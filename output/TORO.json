Risk Factors\nSome of the following risks relate principally to the industry in which we operate. Other risks relate principally to the ownership of our common shares. The occurrence of any of\nthe events described in this section could significantly and negatively affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash available for dividends, as and if declared, or the\ntrading price of our common shares or any other securities of ours.\nSummary of Risk Factors\n• Charter rates for our vessels are volatile and cyclical in nature. A decrease in charter rates may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\n• An oversupply of tanker vessel and LPG carrier capacity may prolong or further depress charter rates when they occur, which may limit our ability to operate our vessels\nprofitably.\n• Future growth in the demand for our services will depend among others on changes in supply and demand, economic growth in the world economy and demand for LPG\nand LPG transportation relative to changes in worldwide fleet capacity.\n• Global economic and financial conditions may negatively impact the sectors of the shipping industry in which we operate, including the extension of credit.\n• Risks involved in operating ocean-going vessels could affect our business and reputation.\n• The operation of tankers has unique operational risks associated with the transportation of oil.\n• The age of our tanker vessel may impact our ability to obtain financing and a decline in the market values of our vessels could limit the amount of funds that we can borrow,\ncause us to breach certain financial covenants in our future credit facilities and/or result in impairment charges or losses on sale.\n• Geopolitical conditions, such as political instability or conflict, terrorist attacks and international hostilities, can affect the seaborne transportation industry, which could\nadversely affect our business.\n• Compliance with rules and other vessel requirements imposed by classification societies may be costly and could reduce our net cash flows and negatively impact our\nresults of operations.\n• We are subject to international laws and regulations and standards (including, but not limited to, environmental standards such as IMO 2020 for the low sulfur fuels and the\nInternational Ballast Water Convention for discharging of ballast water), as well as to regional requirements, such as European Union and U.S. laws and regulations for the\nprevention of water pollution, each of which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In particular, new short-, medium- and long-\nterm measures developed by the IMO, the European Union and other entities to promote decarbonization and the reduction of greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions may\nadversely impact our operations and markets.\n• Increased inspection procedures and tighter import and export controls could increase costs and disrupt our business.\n• We may not be able to execute our strategy and we may not realize the benefits we expect from acquisitions or other strategic transactions.\n• We operate secondhand vessels, some of which have an age above the industry average, which may lead to increased technical problems for our vessels and/or higher\noperating expenses or affect our ability to profitably charter our vessels and to comply with environmental standards and future maritime regulations and result in a more\nrapid depreciation in our vessels’ market and book values.\n• We are dependent upon Castor Ships, a related party, and other third-party sub-managers for the management of our fleet and business, and failure of such counterparties\nto meet their obligations could cause us to suffer losses or could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.\n• Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who may be deemed to beneficially own, directly or indirectly, a majority of our outstanding common shares and 100% of our\nSeries B Preferred Shares, has control over us.\n2\nTable of Contents\n• We expect that any new or amended credit facility we enter into will contain restrictive financial covenants that we may not be able to comply with due to economic,\nfinancial or operational reasons and may limit our business and financing activities.\n• We do not have a declared dividend policy and our Board may never declare dividends on our common shares.\n• Our share price may be highly volatile, and as a result, investors in our common shares could incur substantial losses.\n• Future issuances of common shares or other equity securities, including as a result of an optional conversion of Series A Preferred Shares, or the potential for such\nissuances, may impact the price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise capital through equity offerings. Shareholders may experience significant\ndilution as a result of any such issuances.\n• We are incorporated in the Marshall Islands, which does not have a well-developed body of corporate and case law.\n• We have limited the fields in which we focus our operations and this may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Relating to Our Industry\nCharter rates for our vessels are volatile and cyclical in nature. A decrease in charter rates may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe tanker and LPG carrier industries are both cyclical and volatile in terms of charter rates, profitability and vessel values. Fluctuations in charter rates result from changes in\nthe supply and demand for vessel capacity and changes in the supply and demand for the products transported by tankers and LPG carriers. Further, because many factors influencing\nthe supply of, and demand for, vessel capacity (including the supply and demand for the products transported by tankers and LPG carriers) are unpredictable, the timing, direction and\ndegree of changes in these markets are also unpredictable. Deterioration of charter rates resulting from various factors relating to the cyclicality and volatility of our business may\nadversely affect our ability to profitably charter or re-charter our vessels or to sell our vessels on a profitable basis. This could negatively impact our operating results, liquidity and\nfinancial condition.\nFor a discussion of factors impacting charter rates in the tanker and LPG carrier industries, refer to “—Charter rates for tanker vessels are volatile and cyclical in nature. A\ndecrease in tanker charter rates may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results” and “—Charter rates for LPG carriers are volatile and cyclical in\nnature. A decrease in LPG carrier charter rates may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results”, respectively.\nWe are exposed to fluctuating demand, supply and prices for crude oil, refined petroleum and/or LPG products, and may be affected by a decrease in the demand for such products\nand the volatility in their prices due to their effects on supply and demand of maritime transportation services.\nOur growth significantly depends on continued growth in worldwide and regional demand for the products we transport and their carriage by sea, which could be negatively\naffected by several factors, including declines in prices for such products or general political, regulatory and economic conditions.\nIn past years, China and India have had two of the world’s fastest growing economies in terms of gross domestic product and have been the main driving forces behind\nincreases in shipping trade and the demand for marine transportation. While China in particular has enjoyed rates of economic growth significantly above the world average, slowing\neconomic growth rates may reduce the country’s contribution to world trade growth. If economic growth continues to slow down in China, India and other countries in the Asia Pacific\nregion, particularly in sectors of the economy related to the products we transport, we may face decreases in shipping trade and demand. The level of imports to and exports from China\nmay also be adversely affected by changes in political, economic and social conditions (including a slowing of economic growth) or other relevant policies of the Chinese government,\nsuch as changes in laws, regulations or export and import restrictions, internal political instability, changes in currency policies, changes in trade policies and territorial or trade disputes.\nFurthermore, a slowdown in the economies of the United States or the European Union, or certain other Asian countries may also have adverse impacts on economic growth in the Asia\nPacific region. Therefore, a negative change in the economic conditions of any of these countries or elsewhere may reduce demand for tanker vessels and LPG carriers and their\nassociated charter rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results, as well as our prospects.\n3\nTable of Contents\nSupply and demand for the products our vessels transport are sensitive to the price of oil, which was volatile during 2023. The price of Very Low Sulphur Fuel Oil (“VLSFO”) in\nSingapore ranged from a low of $554 per metric ton in June 2023 to a peak of around $705 per metric ton in November 2023. As of February 29, 2024, the price of VLSFO in Singapore is\n$639 per metric ton. While the supply of oil products periodically tightened in 2023 as a result of the imposition of sanctions against Russia and Belarus in connection with its invasion\nof Ukraine, global supply has rebounded due to record production by the United States and other Atlantic basin countries. For further details on these Russian sanctions, see “—Our\ncharterers calling on ports located in countries or territories that are the subject of sanctions or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government (including OFAC) or other authorities or\nfailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) or similar laws could lead to monetary fines or penalties and adversely affect our reputation. Such\nfailures and other events could adversely affect the market for our common shares.” However, growth in the supply of oil products, including crude oil, refined petroleum products and\nLPG, may outpace demand for such products in 2024, as there is growing evidence of softening global demand due to, among other factors, persistent inflationary pressures, the impact\nof higher interest rates and deteriorating macroeconomic outlooks in certain of the regions we operate in, such as Europe, which has experienced a decline in manufacturing and\nindustrial activity. In light of these economic pressures, the price of oil is generally expected to decline and may remain volatile as the market continues to adjust in changing patterns in\nsupply and demand.\nCertain additional factors may influence the price of oil and therefore supply and demand for the products we transport. For example, sustained periods of low oil prices\ntypically result in reduced exploration and extraction because oil companies’ capital expenditure budgets are subject to cash flow from such activities and are therefore sensitive to\nchanges in energy prices, a fact which could limit oil supply and lead to increases in crude oil and refined petroleum product prices. Consumer demand for crude oil and refined\npetroleum products, and as a result crude oil and refined petroleum product prices, could also be affected by a shift towards other (renewable) energy resources such as wind energy,\nsolar energy, nuclear energy, electricity or water energy. Changes in oil supply balance and oil prices, or the supply balance and prices of products derived from oil, can have a material\neffect on demand for crude oil, refined petroleum product and LPG shipping services. In particular, changes to the trade patterns or trade routes of the products we transport may have a\nsignificant negative or positive impact on the ton mile, and therefore the demand for our tankers and LPG carriers. As of February 29, 2024, trade routes for tankers and LPG carriers have\nbeen disrupted by escalating attacks on vessels in and around the Red Sea. For further details, see “—Geopolitical conditions, such as political instability or conflict, terrorist attacks\nand international hostilities, can affect the seaborne transportation industry, which could adversely affect our business.” Periods of low demand can cause excess vessel supply and\nintensify the competition in the industry, which often results in vessels being idle for long periods of time, which could reduce our revenues and materially harm the profitability of our\nbusiness and/or segments, operating results and/or available cash. As noted above, the global economy and demand for crude oil, refined petroleum products and LPG continues to\nadapt to disruptions in oil supply due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and related sanctions and the market may enter a period of oversupply of oil products as demand shows signs of\nweakening, which may have a material effect on demand for tanker and LPG carriers shipping services, and, consequently, on our business, financial condition, cash flows and operating\nresults. See also “—Geopolitical conditions, such as political instability or conflict, terrorist attacks and international hostilities, can affect the seaborne transportation industry,\nwhich could adversely affect our business.”\nWorldwide inflationary pressures could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nOver the course of 2023, inflationary pressures across many sectors globally continued to weigh on economic activity, though to a lesser extent than in 2022. While the U.S.\nconsumer price index, an inflation gauge that measures costs across dozens of items fell to 3.1% before seasonal adjustment in December 2023, down from 6.5% in December 2022,\ninflation has proven stickier in Europe, where inflation rates have generally been slower to fall and remained relatively high throughout 2023. The ongoing effects of inflation on the\nsupply and demand of the products we transport could alter demand for our services and reduced economic activity due to governmental responses to persistent inflation in any of the\nregions in which we operate could cause a reduction in trade by altering consumer purchasing habits and reducing demand for the crude oil and/or refined petroleum products we carry.\nAs a result, the volumes of goods we deliver and/or charter rates for our vessels may be affected. Alternatively, if inflation fails to abate in 2024, we could experience persistently high\noperating, voyage and administrative costs. Any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and operating results. For additional\ninformation, see “—We are exposed to fluctuating demand, supply and prices for crude oil, refined petroleum and/or LPG products, and may be affected by a decrease in the demand\nfor such products and the volatility in their prices due to their effects on supply and demand of maritime transportation services.”\nGlobal economic and financial conditions may negatively impact the sectors of the shipping industry in which we operate, including the extension of credit.\nAs the shipping industry is highly dependent on economic growth and the availability of credit to finance and expand operations, it may be negatively affected by a decline in\neconomic activity or a deterioration of economic growth and financial conditions. Various factors may impact economic growth and the availability of credit, including those discussed in\n“—We are exposed to fluctuating demand, supply and prices for crude oil, refined petroleum and/or LPG products, and may be affected by a decrease in the demand for such products\nand the volatility in their prices due to their effects on supply and demand of maritime transportation services” and “—Worldwide inflationary pressures could negatively impact our\nresults of operations and cash flows.”\n4\nTable of Contents\nA decline in economic activity or a deterioration of economic growth and financial conditions may have a number of adverse consequences for the sectors of the shipping\nindustry in which we operate, including, among other things:\n• low charter rates, particularly for vessels employed on short-term time charters and in the spot voyage market or pools;\n• decreases in the market value of vessels and the limited second-hand market for the sale of vessels;\n• limited financing for vessels;\n• widespread loan covenant defaults; and\n• declaration of bankruptcy by certain vessel operators, vessel managers, vessel owners, shipyards and charterers.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, compliance with debt covenants, financial condition and\noperating results.\nIncreases in bunker prices could affect our operating results and cash flows.\nFuel is a significant, if not the largest, expense in our shipping operations when vessels are under voyage charters and is an important factor in negotiating charter rates. Bunker\nprices have increased significantly since 2021, starting at $415 per metric ton in January 2021 and reaching a high of $1,100 per metric ton in July 2022, before declining to a still elevated\nprice of $617 per metric ton by the end of December 2022. This volatility was in part attributable to the eruption of armed conflict in Ukraine. In 2023, bunker rates demonstrated\ndecreasing volatility as the market adapted to the conflict in Ukraine, with the price for VLSFO in Singapore reaching a high of $705 per metric ton in November 2023 which decreased to\naround $617 per metric ton by the end of December 2023. As of February 29, 2024, the price of VLSFO in Singapore was approximately $639 per metric ton but uncertainty regarding its\nfuture direction remains. In addition, the conflict in the Middle East, including recent maritime incidents in and around the Red Sea, could cause disruptions to the production and supply\nof oil, and therefore fuel, with adverse impacts on the price of VLSFO in 2024. As a result, our bunker costs for our vessels when off-hire, idling, or operating in the spot voyage charter\nmarket have increased substantially in recent years and may continue to increase, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results and cash flows.\nGeopolitical conditions, such as political instability or conflict, terrorist attacks and international hostilities, can affect the seaborne transportation industry, which could\nadversely affect our business.\nWe conduct most of our operations outside of the United States and our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and ability to pay dividends, if any, in\nthe future may be adversely affected by changing economic, political and government conditions in the countries and regions where our vessels are employed or registered. Moreover,\nwe operate in a sector of the economy that has been and is likely to continue to be adversely impacted by the effects of geopolitical developments, including political instability or\nconflict, terrorist attacks or international hostilities.\nCurrently, the world economy faces a number of challenges, including tensions between the United States and China, new and continuing turmoil and hostilities in Russia,\nUkraine, the Middle East (such as recent maritime incidents in and around the Red Sea) and other geographic areas and countries, continuing economic weakness in the European Union\nand slowing growth in China and the continuing threat of terrorist attacks around the world.\nIn particular, the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine and a severe worsening of Russia’s relations with Western economies has disrupted global markets, contributing to\nshifts in trading patterns and trade routes for products, including crude oil, refined petroleum products and LPG, that may continue into the future. These changes are due in part to the\nimposition of sanctions against Russia and Belarus by various governments, which have contributed to increased volatility in the price of crude oil and refined petroleum products. See\n“—Our charterers calling on ports located in countries or territories that are the subject of sanctions or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government (including OFAC) or other\nauthorities or failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) or similar laws could lead to monetary fines or penalties and adversely affect our\nreputation. Such failures and other events could adversely affect the market for our common shares”, “—Worldwide inflationary pressures could negatively impact our results of\noperations and cash flows” and “—The Company is exposed to fluctuating demand and supply for maritime transportation services, as well as fluctuating prices of crude oil, refined\npetroleum and/or LPG products and may be affected by a decrease in the demand for such products and the volatility in their prices.”\n5\nTable of Contents\nGeopolitical conflicts have also resulted in attacks on vessels, mining of waterways and other efforts to disrupt international shipping. An attack on one of our vessels or\nmerely the perception that our vessels are a potential piracy or terrorist target could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Notably,\nsince November 2023, vessels in and around the Red Sea have faced an increasing number of attempted hijackings and attacks by drones and projectiles launched from Yemen, which\narmed Houthi groups have claimed responsibility for. These groups have stated that these attacks are a response to the Israel-Hamas conflict. While initially Israeli and US-linked\nvessels were thought to be the primary targets of these attacks, vessels from a variety of countries have been the subject of these incidents, including vessels flying the Marshall\nIslands flag. As a result of these attacks, certain vessels have sunk, been set alight and suffered other physical damage and crew injuries and fatalities have occurred, leading to\nheightened concerns for crew safety and security, as well as trade disruption. An increasing number of companies have rerouted their vessels to avoid passage through affected areas\nand are now completing their trades via alternative routes, such as through the Cape of Good Hope, incurring greater shipping costs and delays, as well as the costs of security\nmeasures. Though governments including the United States and United Kingdom have responded with air strikes against the hostile groups believed to be responsible for these attacks,\nthe continuation or escalation of the conflict may drive the foregoing costs and risks higher. Any physical damage to our vessels or injury or loss of life of any of the individuals\nonboard our vessels could result in significant reputational damage or operational disruption, the exact magnitude of which cannot be estimated with certainty at this time. There can be\nno assurance regarding the precise nature, expected duration or likely severity of these maritime incidents. Future hostilities or other political instability in regions where our vessels\ntrade could also negatively affect the shipping industry by resulting rising costs and changing patterns of supply and demand, as well as our trade patterns, trade routes, operations and\nperformance.\nFurther, if attacks on vessels occur in regions that insurers characterize as “war risk” zones or by the Joint War Committee as “war and strikes” listed areas, premiums payable\nfor such coverage could increase significantly and such insurance coverage may be more difficult to obtain, if available at all. As of February 29, 2024, such listed areas included parts of\nthe Southern Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and Black Sea, as well as the coastal waters of Yemen, Israel and Iran, among others. Insurance costs for vessels with links to the United States,\nUnited Kingdom or Israel have already increased as a result of attacks in and around the Red Sea, with such vessels reportedly seeing increases of 25% to 50% in their war risk premium\nrelative to other vessels transiting through the Red Sea, and should these attacks continue or become indiscriminate, we could similarly experience a significant increase in our insurance\ncosts and/or we may not be adequately insured to cover losses from these incidents. See also “—Our business has inherent operational risks, which may not be adequately covered by\ninsurance.” Crew costs, including costs that may be incurred to the extent we employ onboard security guards, could also increase due to acts of piracy or other maritime incidents,\nincluding attacks on vessels. Our customers could also suffer significant losses, impairing their ability to make payments to us under our charters. Any of the foregoing factors could\nhave an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe threat of future terrorist attacks around the world also continues to cause uncertainty in the world’s financial markets and international commerce and may affect our\nbusiness, operating results and financial condition. Continuing conflicts and recent developments in the Middle East, including continuing unrest in Syria and Iran and relating to the\nIsrael-Hamas conflict and recent attacks on vessels in and around the Red Sea which armed Houthi groups have claimed responsibility for, as well as the overthrow of Afghanistan’s\ndemocratic government by the Taliban, may lead to additional acts of terrorism and armed conflict around the world. This may contribute to further economic instability in the global\nfinancial markets and international commerce. Additionally, any escalations between Western Nations, Israel and/or Iran could result in retaliation that could potentially affect the\nshipping industry. For example, there have been an increased number of attacks on or seizures of vessels in the Strait of Hormuz (which already experienced an increased number of\nattacks on and seizures of vessels in recent years, including the seizure of two Greek-flagged vessels in 2022 and one Marshall Islands-flagged vessel in 2023), and ship owners have\nreported a heightened level of harassment when transiting through the region. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse impact on our operating results, revenues and\ncosts. See also “—Acts of piracy or other attacks on ocean-going vessels, including due to geopolitical conflicts, could adversely affect our business.”\nSeparately, protectionism is on the rise globally. For example, in Europe, large sovereign debts and fiscal deficits, low growth prospects and high unemployment rates in a\nnumber of countries have contributed to the rise of various Eurosceptic parties, which advocate for their countries to leave the European Union and/or adopt protectionist policies.\nThese parties are increasingly popular in various European countries, including major European economic powers such as Germany and France. The withdrawal of the United Kingdom\nfrom the European Union has increased the risk of additional trade protectionism and has created supply chain disruptions. The United States, which has emerged as a key market for\nLPG and major producer of crude oil, has similarly seen a rise in protectionist policies. For example, in 2018, China and the United States each began implementing increasingly protective\ntrade measures, including significant tariff increases, in a trade war between these countries. Although there have been signs of thawing China-United states relations, many of these\nprotectionist measures remain in place a deterioration in relations may occur. U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump has also threatened to impose tariffs exceeding 60% on Chinese\ngoods if elected president, which could reignite the China-United States trade war.\n6\nTable of Contents\nTrade barriers to protect domestic industries against foreign imports depress shipping demand. Protectionist developments, such as the imposition of trade tariffs or the\nperception they may occur, may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions, and may significantly reduce global trade. Moreover, increasing trade protectionism may\ncause an increase in (a) the cost of goods exported from regions globally, (b) the length of time required to transport goods and (c) the risks associated with exporting goods. Such\nincreases may significantly affect the quantity of goods to be shipped, shipping time schedules, voyage costs and other associated costs, which could have an adverse impact on our\ncharterers’ business, operating results and financial condition and could thereby affect their ability to make timely charter hire payments to us and to renew and increase the number of\ntheir time charters with us. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Further, protectionist policies in any country could\nimpact global markets, including foreign exchange and securities markets. Any resulting changes in currency exchange rates, tariffs, treaties and other regulatory matters could in turn\nadversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are new entrants to the competitive tanker and LPG shipping sectors and may face difficulties in establishing our business.\nOur tanker-owning subsidiaries entered into the tanker shipping business in 2021 and our LPG carrier-owning subsidiaries entered into the LPG shipping business in 2023. As\nnew entrants to the tanker and LPG shipping businesses, we may struggle to establish market share and broaden our customer base for our operations in these highly competitive\nmarkets due to our lesser-known reputation, while incurring operating costs associated with the operation and upkeep of our tankers and LPG carriers. In addition, we compete with\nvarious companies that operate larger fleets and may be able to offer more competitive prices and greater availability and diversity of vessels, all while achieving economies of scale in\ntheir fleet operating costs. Due in part to the fragmented tanker and LPG carrier markets, existing or additional competitors with greater resources may enter or grow their positions in the\ntanker and LPG carrier sectors through consolidations or acquisitions and could operate more competitive fleets, causing us to lose or be unable to gain market share. Any of these\ncompetitors may be able to devote greater financial and other resources to their activities than we can, resulting in a significant competitive threat to us.\nFurther, we likely possess less operational expertise relative to more experienced competitors and, in general, are more heavily reliant on the knowledge and services of third-\nparty managers for our commercial success. As of the date of this Annual Report, our manager, Castor Ships, has subcontracted, with our consent, the technical management for all of\nour vessels to a third-party ship-management company, except one tanker vessel for which Castor Ships has provided technical management since June 7, 2023. Any failure by us or\nCastor Ships to partner with third-party providers with the appropriate expertise to effectively deliver our services could tarnish our reputation as a vessel operator and impact the\ngrowth of our business, our financial condition and operating profits.\nRisks involved in operating ocean-going vessels could affect our business and reputation.\nThe operation of an ocean-going vessel carries inherent risks. These risks include the possibility of:\n• a marine disaster;\n• war and terrorism;\n• piracy;\n• environmental and other accidents;\n• cargo and property losses and damage;\n• business interruptions caused by mechanical failure, human error, armed conflict, terrorism, piracy, political action in various countries, labor strikes or adverse weather\nconditions; and\n• work stoppages or other labor problems with crew members serving on our vessels, some of whom are unionized and covered by collective bargaining agreements.\nEnvironmental laws often impose strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil, oil products and hazardous substances, which could subject us to liability without\nregard to whether we were negligent or at fault. A spill, such as of bunker oil on our vessels or oil products cargo carried by our tankers, or an accidental release of other hazardous\nsubstances from our vessels, could result in significant liability, including fines, penalties and criminal liability and remediation costs for natural resource damages, as well as third-party\ndamages.\n7\nTable of Contents\nAny of these circumstances or events could increase our costs or lower our revenues. The involvement of our vessels in an oil spill or other environmental incident may harm\nour reputation as a safe and reliable operator, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition to the foregoing risks, the operation of tankers and transportation of oil presents unique operational risks. See “—The operation of tankers has unique operational\nrisks associated with the transportation of oil.”\nActs of piracy or other attacks on ocean-going vessels, including due to geopolitical conflicts, could adversely affect our business.\nActs of piracy have historically affected ocean-going vessels trading in regions of the world such as the South China Sea, the Indian Ocean and, in particular, the Gulf of Aden\noff the coast of Somalia and the Gulf of Guinea region off Nigeria, which experienced increased incidents of piracy in recent years. Pirate activity is also intermittent off the coast of\nEastern Malaysia and a number of oil cargo seizures have occurred there. Sea piracy incidents continue to occur with tanker and LPG carrier vessels particularly vulnerable to such\nattacks. Acts of piracy may result in death or injury to persons or damage to property. In addition, crew costs, including costs of employing on-board security guards, could increase in\nsuch circumstances. We may not be adequately insured to cover losses from these incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows\nand results of operations. See also “—Geopolitical conditions, such as political instability or conflict, terrorist attacks and international hostilities, can affect the seaborne\ntransportation industry, which could adversely affect our business” and “—Our business has inherent operational risks, which may not be adequately covered by insurance.”\nOur charterers calling on ports located in countries or territories that are the subject of sanctions or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government (including OFAC) or other\nauthorities or failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) or similar laws could lead to monetary fines or penalties and adversely affect our\nreputation. Such failures and other events could adversely affect the market for our common shares.\nCertain countries (including certain regions of Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Syria), entities and persons are targeted by economic sanctions and\nembargoes imposed by the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions, and a number of those countries have been identified as state sponsors of terrorism by the U.S.\nDepartment of State. In particular, sanctions imposed in relation to the Russian invasion of Ukraine have created significant disruptions in the global economy and in the shipping\nindustry. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, economic sanctions have been imposed by the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and a number of other\ncountries on Russian financial institutions, businesses and individuals, as well as certain regions within the Donbas region of Ukraine. Certain of these sanctions have targeted the\nRussian oil and petroleum industry and, in particular, the transport of Russian crude oil and refined petroleum products by maritime vessels. Several jurisdictions, including the United\nStates, the United Kingdom, European Union and Canada, have adopted import bans of Russian energy products, such as crude oil and refined petroleum products. The United\nKingdom and European Union have also introduced export restrictions, which capture the provision of maritime vessels and supplies to or for use in Russia. They have also imposed\nadditional restrictions on providing financing, financial assistance, technical assistance and brokering or other services that would further the provision of vessels to or for use in\nRussia. For example, the United Kingdom has barred the provision of ships or services, including shipping services, facilitating the maritime transport of Russian crude oil, with effect\nfrom December 5, 2022, and refined oil products, with effect from February 5, 2023. The Group of Seven nations and the European Union have also imposed a price cap of $60 per barrel\non Russian crude oil with effect from December 5, 2022 and introduced a separate price cap on refined petroleum products with effect from February 5, 2023. In October 2023, the United\nStates also introduced sanctions against 50 tanker vessels with ties to the Russian oil trade, significantly impeding such vessels’ abilities to load cargoes, and has imposed sanctions\nagainst at least two companies and their tankers for breaching the $60 per barrel price cap on Russian crude oil. Recent sanctions efforts by the European Union and United Kingdom\nhave focused on preventing the circumvention of sanctions against Russia and the European Union has adopted sanctions against a number of foreign companies accused of assisting\nRussia in circumventing sanctions. These restrictions may affect our current or future charters.\nIn addition, certain jurisdictions, such as Greece and the United States, have temporarily detained vessels suspected of violating sanctions. Countries, such as Canada, the\nUnited Kingdom and the EU, have also broadly prohibited Russian-affiliated vessels from entering their waters and/or ports. Furthermore, certain of the oil majors, such as ExxonMobil\nand BP, have divested from Russia or announced their intention to exit the region.\n8\nTable of Contents\nAs a result of these bans and related trade sanctions, many consumers of crude oil and refined petroleum products have sought out alternative sources of these products and\ntrade patterns and trade routes for crude oil and refined petroleum products have changed. For example, the United States has emerged as a major producer of crude oil, refined\npetroleum products and natural gas liquids, producing record amounts of oil in 2023 that have helped to offset supply constraints due to Russia’s exclusion from the market and strong\ndemand for exported crude oil. The prices of crude oil, refined petroleum and LPG-related products have increased and remained elevated as a result of these bans and related trade\nsanctions, though record production by the United States has exerted downward price pressure. Increases in the price of oil, refined petroleum and LPG products have and are likely to\naffect adversely global oil demand and reduce worldwide oil transport should they continue. While global shipping rates of oil have generally increased since the commencement of\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine, especially because of increased ton mile demand due to changing trading patterns and the banning of Russian oil tankers by several countries, it is\nuncertain what the ultimate result will be on the Company’s business and financial position. However, due to their effect on the global market for crude oil and petroleum products,\ncurrent or additional sanctions could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, cash flows, financial condition and operating results.\nEconomic sanctions and embargo laws and regulations vary in their application with regard to countries, entities or persons and the scope of activities they subject to\nsanctions. These sanctions and embargo laws and regulations may be strengthened, relaxed or otherwise modified over time. Any violation of sanctions or embargoes could result in the\nCompany incurring monetary fines, penalties or other sanctions. In addition, certain institutional investors may have investment policies or restrictions that prevent them from holding\nsecurities of companies that have contacts with countries or entities or persons within these countries that are identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. We are\nrequired to comply with such policies in order to maintain access to charterers and capital.\nCurrent or future counterparties of ours may be affiliated with persons or entities that are or may be in the future the subject of sanctions imposed by the governments of the\nUnited States, the European Union, and/or other international bodies. Further, it is possible that, in the future, our vessels may call on ports located in sanctioned jurisdictions on\ncharterers’ instructions, without our consent and in violation of their charter party. Moreover, our charterers may violate applicable sanctions and embargo laws and regulations as a\nresult of actions that do not involve us or our vessels. As a result, we may be required to terminate existing or future contracts to which we, or our subsidiaries, are party.\nWe operate in a number of countries throughout the world, including countries known to have a reputation for corruption. We are committed to doing business in accordance\nwith applicable anti-corruption laws, and have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics. However, we are subject to the risk that we, or our affiliated entities, or our or our affiliated\nentities’ respective officers, directors, employees or agents’ actions may be deemed to be in violation of such anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA. Any such violation could result\nin substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions.\nIf the Company, our affiliated entities, or our or their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, or any of our charterers are deemed to have violated economic\nsanctions and embargo laws, or any applicable anti-corruption laws, our results of operations may be adversely affected due to the resultant monetary fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nIn addition, we may suffer reputational harm as a result of any actual or alleged violations. This may affect our ability to access U.S. capital markets and conduct our business, and could\nresult in some investors deciding, or being required, to divest their interest, or not to invest, in us. The determination by these investors not to invest in, or to divest from, our common\nshares may adversely affect the price at which our common shares trade. Investor perception of the value of our common shares may also be adversely affected by the consequences of\nwar, the effects of terrorism, civil unrest and governmental actions in the countries or territories in which we operate. Any of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and operating results.\nFurthermore, detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior management and\nadversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition as a result.\nGlobal public health threats can affect the seaborne transportation industry, which could adversely affect our business.\nPublic health threats or widespread health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, influenza and other highly communicable diseases or viruses (or concerns over the\npossibility of such threats or emergencies) could lead to a significant decrease in demand for the transportation of the products carried by our vessels. In recent years, our business and\nthe tanker and LPG carrier sectors have from time to time been impacted by various public health emergencies in various parts of the world in which we operate, most notably the COVID-\n19 pandemic. While most countries around the world have removed restrictions implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the emergence of new public health threats or\nwidespread health emergencies, whether globally or in the regions in which we operate, may result in new restrictions, lead to further economic uncertainty and heighten certain of the\nother risks described in this Annual Report. In particular, such events have and may also in the future adversely impact our operations, including timely rotation of our crews, the timing\nof completion of any outstanding or future newbuilding projects or repair works in dry-dock as well as the operations of our customers. Delayed rotation of crew may adversely affect\nthe mental and physical health of our crew and the safe operation of our vessels as a consequence. Any public health threat or widespread health emergency, whether widespread or\nlocalized, could create significant disruptions in our business and adversely impact our business, financial condition, cash flows and operating results.\n9\nTable of Contents\nA cyber-attack could materially disrupt our business and may result in a significant financial cost to us.\nWe rely on information technology systems and networks in our operations, our vessels and administration of our business. Information systems are vulnerable to security\nbreaches by computer hackers and cyber terrorists. We rely on industry-accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain confidential and proprietary information\nmaintained on our information systems. However, these measures and technology may not adequately prevent security breaches. Our business operations could be targeted by\nindividuals or groups seeking to sabotage or disrupt our information technology systems and networks, to steal data, or to ask for ransom. A successful cyber-attack could materially\ndisrupt our operations, including the safety of our operations, or lead to unauthorized release, alteration or unavailability of information in our systems. Any such attack or other breach\nof our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. In addition, the unavailability of our information systems or the failure\nof these systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt our business and could result in decreased performance and increased operating costs, causing our business\nand operating results to suffer.\nIn 2017, the IMO adopted Resolution MSC.428(98) on Maritime Cyber Risk Management, which encourages administrations to ensure that cyber risks are appropriately\naddressed in SMS no later than the first annual verification of the Company’s Document of Compliance (DOC) after January 1, 2021, and the U.S. Coast Guard published non-binding\nguidance in February 2021 on addressing cyber risks in a vessel’s safety management system. While we are currently in compliance with the requirements of Resolution MSC.428(98), the\ncybersecurity measures we maintain may not be sufficient to prevent the occurrence of a cybersecurity attack and/or incident. Any inability to prevent security breaches (including the\ninability of our third-party vendors, suppliers or counterparties to prevent security breaches) or any failure to adopt or maintain appropriate cybersecurity risk management and\ngovernance procedures could cause existing or prospective clients to lose confidence in our IT systems and could adversely affect our reputation, cause losses to us or our customers\nand/or damage our brand. This might require us to create additional procedures for managing the risk of cybersecurity, which could require additional expenses and/or capital\nexpenditures. The impact of such regulations is difficult to predict at this time.\nThe risks associated with informational and operational technology incidents have increased in recent years given the increased prevalence of remote work arrangements, and\nmay be further heightened by geopolitical tensions and conflicts, such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. State-sponsored Russian actors have taken and may\ncontinue to take retaliatory actions and enact countermeasures against countries and companies that have divested from or curtailed business with Russia as a result of Russia’s\ninvasion of Ukraine and related sanctions imposed on Russia. See “—Our charterers calling on ports located in countries or territories that are the subject of sanctions or embargoes\nimposed by the U.S. government (including OFAC) or other authorities or failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) or similar laws could lead to\nmonetary fines or penalties and adversely affect our reputation. Such failures and other events could adversely affect the market for our common shares” for further information on\nthese sanctions. This includes cyber-attacks and espionage against other countries and companies in the world, which may negatively impact such countries in which we operate and/or\ncompanies to whom we provide services or receive services from. Any such attacks, whether widespread or targeted, could create significant disruptions in our business and adversely\nimpact our financial condition, cash flows and operating results.\nCompliance with rules and other vessel requirements imposed by classification societies may be costly and could reduce our net cash flows and negatively impact our results of\noperations.\nThe hull and machinery of every commercial vessel must be certified as being “in class” by a classification society recognized by the flag administration in the jurisdiction in\nwhich the vessel is registered (or “flagged”). The classification society certifies that a vessel is safe and seaworthy in accordance with the applicable rules of the class and the\nregulations of the country of registry of the vessel and the Safety of Life at Sea Convention.\nA vessel must undergo annual surveys, intermediate surveys and special surveys. A vessel’s machinery may be placed on a continuous survey cycle, under which the\nmachinery would be surveyed periodically over a five-year period. We expect our vessels to be on special survey cycles for hull inspection and continuous survey cycles for machinery\ninspection. Vessels are also required to be dry-docked, or inspected by divers, every two to three years for inspection of underwater parts.\nWhile the Company believes that it has adequately budgeted for compliance with all currently applicable safety and other vessel operating requirements, newly enacted\nregulations applicable to the Company and its vessels may result in significant and unanticipated future expense. If any vessel does not maintain its class or fails any annual,\nintermediate or special survey, the vessel will be unable to trade between ports and will be unemployable, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows,\nfinancial condition and operating results.\n10\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to international laws and regulations and standards (including, but not limited to, environmental standards such as IMO 2020 for the low sulfur fuels and the\nInternational Ballast Water Convention for discharging of ballast water), as well as to regional requirements, such as European Union and U.S. laws and regulations for the\nprevention of water pollution, each of which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In particular, new short-, medium- and long-term\nmeasures developed by the IMO, the European Union and other entities to promote decarbonization and the reduction of GHG emissions may adversely impact our operations and\nmarkets.\nOur operations are subject to numerous international, regional, national, state and local laws, regulations, treaties and conventions in force in international waters and the\njurisdictions in which our vessels operate or are registered, which can significantly affect the ownership and operation of our vessels. See “Item 4. Information on the Company—B.\nBusiness Overview—Environmental and Other Regulations in the Shipping Industry” for a discussion of certain of these laws, regulations and standards. Compliance with such laws,\nregulations and standards, where applicable, may require installation of costly equipment or implementation of operational changes and may affect the profitability, resale value and\nuseful lives of our vessels. These costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition, and operating results. A failure to comply with applicable\nlaws and regulations may result in administrative and civil penalties, criminal sanctions or the suspension or termination of our operations.\nEnvironmental laws often impose strict liability for emergency response and remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances, which could subject us to\nliability without regard to whether we are negligent or at fault. See “—Risks involved in operating ocean-going vessels could affect our business and reputation” and “—The operation\nof tankers has unique operational risks associated with the transportation of oil.”\nIn connection with IMO 2020 regulations and requirements relating to fuel sulfur levels, as of the date of this Annual Report, we have transitioned to burning IMO compliant\nfuels as none of our vessels is equipped with scrubbers (also known as Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems). As a result, these vessels currently utilize VLSFO containing up to 0.5% sulfur\ncontent. Notably, low sulfur fuel is more expensive than standard high fuel oil and may become more expensive. The price of VLSFO in Singapore ranged from a low of $554 per metric ton\nin June 2023 to a peak of around $705 per metric ton in November 2023. As of February 29, 2024, the price of VLSFO in Singapore was around $639 per metric ton, but uncertainty\nregarding its future direction and the availability of VLSFO remains. For further information, see “—Increases in bunker prices could affect our operating results and cash flows.”\nThe IMO has also imposed updated guidelines for ballast water management systems specifying the maximum amount of viable organisms allowed to be discharged from a\nvessel’s ballast water. Depending on the date of the International Oil Pollution Prevention (IOPP) renewal survey, existing vessels constructed before September 8, 2017 must comply\nwith the updated D-2 standard on or after September 8, 2019. For most vessels, compliance with the D-2 standard involves installing onboard systems to treat ballast water and eliminate\nunwanted organisms. All of our vessels are equipped with a ballast water treatment system and therefore are currently in compliance with this regulation.\nDue to concern over climate change, a number of countries, the European Union and the IMO have adopted regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These\nregulatory measures may include, among others, adoption of cap-and-trade regimes, carbon taxes, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy.\nFurther, although the emissions of GHG from international shipping currently are not subject to the Paris Agreement or the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention\non Climate Change, which required adopting countries to implement national programs to reduce emissions of certain gases. In addition, the International Convention for the Prevention\nof Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) Annex VI has been adopted that restricts air emissions from vessels.\nIn June 2021, IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (“MEPC”) adopted amendments to the MARPOL Annex VI that will require ships to reduce their carbon dioxide\nand GHG emissions. These new requirements combine technical and operational approaches to improve the energy efficiency of ships for future GHG reduction measures. Beginning\nJanuary 1, 2023, each vessel is required to comply with the new Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (“EEXI”). Furthermore, from 2023 to 2026, each vessel must initiate the collection of\ndata for the reporting of its annual operational Carbon Intensity Indicator (“CII”) and CII rating. The IMO is required to review the effectiveness of the implementation of the CII and\nEEXI requirements by January 1, 2026 at the latest. Prior to the implementation of the new regulations under revised Annex VI of MARPOL, official calculations and estimations\nsuggested that merchant vessels built before 2013, including some of our older vessels, may not fully comply with the EEXI requirements. Therefore, to ensure compliance with EEXI\nrequirements many owners/operators may choose to limit engine power rather than apply energy-saving devices and/or effect certain alterations on existing propeller designs, as the\nreduction of engine power is a less costly solution than these measures. As of the date of this Annual Report, official calculations had determined that one tanker vessel and three of the\nfour LPG carrier vessels were in compliance with the EEXI requirements as of January 1, 2023. Our remaining one LPG carrier vessel is expected to be in compliance with the EEXI\nrequirements by obtaining until April 2024 its first annual International Air Pollution Prevention (“IAPP”) certificate, effective from January 1, 2023.\n11\nTable of Contents\nThe engine power limitation is predicted to lead to reduced ballast and laden speeds (at scantling draft) in the non-compliant vessels, which will affect non-compliant vessels’\ncommercial utilization and also decrease the global availability of vessel capacity. Furthermore, required software and hardware alterations as well as documentation and recordkeeping\nrequirements will increase a vessel’s capital and operating expenditures.\nFurther, on January 27, 2021 the Biden administration issued an executive order temporarily blocking new leases for oil and gas drilling in U.S. federal waters. While leasing has\nsince resumed, a record low of just three offshore lease sales over the next five years were unveiled in September 2023. However, leasing for oil and gas drilling in federal waters remains a\ncontentious political issue, with certain states and Republicans in U.S. Congress pushing for increased leasing.\nOn November 13, 2021, the Glasgow Climate Pact was announced following discussions at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (“COP26”). The Glasgow\nClimate Pact calls for signatory states to voluntarily phase out fossil fuels subsidies. A shift away from these products could potentially affect the demand for our vessels and negatively\nimpact our future business, operating results, cash flows and financial position. COP26 also produced the Clydebank Declaration, in which 22 signatory states (including the United\nStates and United Kingdom) announced their intention to voluntarily support the establishment of zero-emission shipping routes. Governmental and investor pressure to voluntarily\nparticipate in these green shipping routes could cause us to incur significant additional expenses to “green” our vessels. The 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference\n(“COP28”) in Dubai called for, among other measures, a swift transition from fossil fuels and deep GHG emission cuts.\nThe foregoing regulations represent a growing trend towards “green” or sustainable sources of energy and increasing intervention by certain governments to impose more\nstringent emissions regimes. These regulations have and may continue to impact demand for crude oil, refined petroleum products and LPG, as well as increase our costs of operation,\nany of which could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nDevelopments in safety and environmental requirements relating to the recycling and demolition of vessels may result in escalated and unexpected costs.\nThe 2009 Hong Kong International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships, or the Hong Kong Convention, aims to ensure ships being recycled\nonce they reach the end of their operational lives do not pose any unnecessary risks to the environment, human health and safety. On November 28, 2019, the Hong Kong Convention\nwas ratified by the required number of countries and it will be in force on June 26, 2025, as the ratifying states represent 40% of world merchant shipping by gross tonnage after the\nratification by Bangladesh and Liberia in June 2023. The Republic of the Marshall Islands recently ratified this Hong Kong Convention in January 2024. Upon the Hong Kong\nConvention’s entry into force, each ship sent for recycling will have to carry an inventory of its hazardous materials. The hazardous materials, the use or installation of which are\nprohibited in certain circumstances, are listed in an appendix to the Hong Kong Convention. Ships will be required to have surveys to verify their inventory of hazardous materials\ninitially, throughout their lives and prior to the ship being recycled. When implemented, the foregoing requirement may lead to cost escalation by shipyards, repair yards and recycling\nyards. This may then result in a decrease in the residual scrap value of a vessel, and a vessel could potentially not cover the cost to comply with the latest requirements, which may have\nan adverse effect on our future performance, cash flows, financial position and operating results.\nFurther, on November 20, 2013, the European Parliament and the Council of the EU adopted the Ship Recycling Regulation, which, among other things, requires any non-EU\nflagged vessels calling at a port or anchorage of an EU member state, including ours, to set up and maintain an Inventory of Hazardous Materials from December 31, 2020. Such a system\nincludes information on the hazardous materials with a quantity above the threshold values specified in relevant EU Resolution that are identified in the ship’s structure and equipment.\nThis inventory must be properly maintained and updated, especially after repairs, conversions or unscheduled maintenance on board the ship.\nThe smuggling of drugs or other contraband onto our vessels may lead to governmental claims against us.\nWe expect that our vessels will call in ports in areas where smugglers attempt to hide drugs and other contraband on vessels, with or without the knowledge of crew members.\nTo the extent our vessels are found with contraband, whether inside or attached to the hull of our vessel, with or without the knowledge of any of our crew, we may face governmental or\nother regulatory claims which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe are subject to international safety standards and the failure to comply with these regulations may subject us to increased liability, may adversely affect our insurance coverage\nand may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports.\nThe operation of our vessels is affected by the requirements set forth in the International Safety Management Code, or the ISM Code, promulgated by the IMO under the\nSOLAS Convention (each as defined in “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Environmental and Other Regulations in the Shipping Industry—International\nMaritime Organization”). The ISM Code requires ship owners, ship managers and bareboat charterers to develop and maintain an extensive “Safety Management System” that includes\nthe adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy setting forth instructions and procedures for the safe operation of vessels and describing procedures for dealing with\nemergencies. In addition, vessel classification societies impose significant safety and other requirements on our vessels. Failure to comply with these regulations may subject us to\nincreased liability, may adversely affect our insurance coverage and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports, and have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and operating results.\n12\nTable of Contents\nMaritime claimants could arrest our vessels, which could interrupt our cash flow and business.\nCrew members, suppliers of goods and services to a vessel, shippers and receivers of cargo and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against a vessel for unsatisfied\ndebts, claims or damages. In many jurisdictions, a maritime lien holder may enforce its lien by “arresting” or “attaching” a vessel through judicial proceedings. The arrest or attachment\nof our vessels, if not timely discharged, could have significant ramifications for the Company, including off-hire periods and/or potential cancellations of charters, high costs incurred in\ndischarging the maritime lien, other expenses to the extent such arrest or attachment is not covered under our insurance coverage, breach the covenants in our future credit facilities and\nreputational damage. This in turn could negatively affect the market for our shares and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to\nservice or refinance our debt. In addition, in jurisdictions where the “sister ship” theory of liability applies, such as South Africa, a claimant may arrest the vessel that is subject to the\nclaimant’s maritime lien and any “associated” vessel, which is any vessel owned or controlled by the same owner. In countries with “sister ship” liability laws, claims might be asserted\nagainst us or any of our vessels for liabilities of other vessels that we then own, compounding the negative effects of an arrest or attachment on the Company. Any of those occurrences\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nGovernments could requisition our vessels during a period of war or emergency resulting in a loss of earnings.\nThe government of a vessel’s registry could requisition for title or seize a vessel. Requisition for title occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and becomes the\nowner. A government could also requisition a vessel for hire. Requisition for hire occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and effectively becomes the charterer at dictated\ncharter rates. Generally, requisitions occur during a period of war or emergency although governments may elect to requisition vessels in other circumstances. Although we would\nexpect to be entitled to compensation in the event of a requisition of one or more of our vessels, the amount and timing of payment, if any, would be uncertain. Government requisition of\none or more of our vessels could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and operating results.\nIncreased inspection procedures and tighter import and export controls could increase costs and disrupt our business.\nInternational shipping is subject to various security and customs inspection and related procedures in countries of origin and destination and trans-shipment points. Inspection\nprocedures may result in the seizure of the contents of our vessels, delays in the loading, offloading, trans-shipment or delivery and the levying of customs duties, fines or other\npenalties against us.\nIt is possible that changes to inspection procedures could impose additional financial and legal obligations on us. Changes to inspection procedures could also impose\nadditional costs and obligations on our customers and may, in certain cases, render the shipment of certain types of cargo uneconomical or impractical. Any such changes or\ndevelopments may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur business has inherent operational risks, which may not be adequately covered by insurance.\nOur vessels and their cargoes are at risk of being damaged or lost because of events such as marine disasters, adverse weather conditions, mechanical failures, human error,\nenvironmental accidents, war, terrorism, piracy and other circumstances or events. In addition, transporting cargoes across a wide variety of international jurisdictions creates a risk of\nbusiness interruptions due to political circumstances in foreign countries, hostilities, labor strikes and boycotts, the potential changes in tax rates or policies, and the potential for\ngovernment expropriation of our vessels. See “—Geopolitical conditions, such as political instability or conflict, terrorist attacks and international hostilities, can affect the\nseaborne transportation industry, which could adversely affect our business” for further information regarding geopolitical circumstances which have or may impact insurance. Any of\nthese events may result in loss of revenues, increased costs and decreased cash flows to our customers, which could impair their ability to make payments to us under our charters.\nWe procure insurance for our vessels against those risks that we believe the shipping industry commonly insures against. This insurance includes marine hull and machinery\ninsurance, protection and indemnity insurance, which include environmental damage, pollution insurance coverage, crew insurance, and, in certain circumstances, war risk insurance.\nCurrently, the amount of coverage for liability for pollution, spillage and leakage available to us on commercially reasonable terms through protection and indemnity associations and\nproviders of excess coverage is $1 billion per occurrence. In certain instances, we may be required by our pooling agreements to arrange for additional loss of hire cover.\nWe do not carry loss of hire insurance. Loss of hire insurance covers the loss of revenue during extended vessel off-hire periods, such as those that occur during an\nunscheduled dry-docking due to damage to the vessel from accidents. Accordingly, any loss of a vessel or any extended period of vessel off-hire, due to an accident or otherwise, could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n13\nTable of Contents\nDespite the above policies, we may not be insured in amounts sufficient to address all risks and we or our pool managers may not be able to obtain adequate insurance\ncoverage for our vessels in the future or may not be able to obtain certain coverage at reasonable rates. For example, in the past more stringent environmental regulations have led to\nincreased costs for, and in the future may result in the lack of availability of, insurance against risks of environmental damage or pollution. We may enter into credit facilities that impose\nrestrictions on the use of any proceeds we may receive from claims under our insurance policies.\nFurther, insurers may not pay particular claims. Our insurance policies contain deductibles for which we will be responsible and limitations and exclusions which may increase\nour costs or lower our revenues. Moreover, insurers may default on claims they are required to pay. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nRisks Relating to the Tanker Industry\nCharter rates for tanker vessels are volatile and cyclical in nature. A decrease in tanker charter rates may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe tanker industry is both cyclical and volatile in terms of charter rates and profitability. Fluctuations in charter rates result from changes in the supply and demand for tanker\ncapacity and changes in the supply and demand for vessel capacity and changes in the supply and demand for the crude oil and refined petroleum products transported by our tanker\nvessels. Further, because many factors (including the supply and demand for the products transported by tankers) influencing the supply of, and demand for, vessel capacity are\nunpredictable, the timing, direction and degree of changes in the tanker market are also unpredictable. Deterioration of charter rates resulting from various factors relating to the\ncyclicality and volatility of our business may adversely affect our ability to profitably charter or re-charter our vessels or to sell our vessels on a profitable basis. This could negatively\nimpact our operating results, liquidity and financial condition.\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine has disrupted energy production, trade patterns and trade routes, including shipping in the Black Sea and elsewhere, and has impacted energy\nprices and tanker rates. For further details, see “—The Company is exposed to fluctuating demand and supply for maritime transportation services, as well as fluctuating prices of\ncrude oil and refined petroleum products, and may be affected by a decrease in the demand for such products and the volatility in their prices.” and “—Our charterers calling on\nports located in countries or territories that are the subject of sanctions or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government (including OFAC) or other authorities or failure to comply\nwith the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) or similar laws could lead to monetary fines or penalties and adversely affect our reputation. Such failures and other\nevents could adversely affect the market for our common shares.”\nDemand for tanker capacity is affected by the supply of and demand for oil products transported by such vessels, including refined petroleum products, which are transported\nby the vessels attributable to our Handysize tanker segment. A variety of factors may impact the supply of and demand for crude oil and/or refined petroleum products, including\nregional availability of refining capacity and inventories and competition from alternative sources of energy. Factors that influence demand for tanker vessel capacity include, but are not\nlimited to:\n• global and regional economic and political conditions and developments, including economic growth in global and local economies and the timeframe over which such\ngrowth occurs, demand for tanker transport that exceeds capacity for such fleets worldwide, armed conflicts (such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine or the armed conflict(s)\nin the Middle East, including maritime incidents in and around the Red Sea, and the spread or worsening of any such conflicts) and terrorist activities, international trade\nsanctions, embargoes and strikes, particularly those that impact the regions or trade routes traveled by our vessels, the regions where the cargoes we carry are produced or\nconsumed, or any similar events which would interrupt the production or consumption of liquefied gases and associated products;\n• regional availability of refining capacity and inventories compared to geographies of oil production regions;\n• developments in international trade, including national policies regarding strategic oil inventories (including the reduction or replenishment of strategic reserves and if\nstrategic reserves are set at a lower level in the future as oil decreases in the energy mix), actions taken by OPEC and major oil producers and refiners and fluctuations in the\nprofit margins of crude oil and refined petroleum products;\n• the distance over which crude oil and/or refined petroleum products are to be moved by sea;\n14\nTable of Contents\n• changes in seaborne and other transportation and distribution patterns, typically influenced by the relative advantage of the various sources of production, locations of\nconsumption, pricing differentials and seasonality;\n• alternative sources of energy, such as natural gas, coal, hydroelectric power and other alternative sources of energy;\n• environmental and other regulatory developments;\n• epidemics and pandemics;\n• natural catastrophes;\n• currency exchange and interest rates; and\n• the weather.\nFor a discussion of factors affecting the supply of tanker vessel capacity, see “—An oversupply of tanker vessel capacity may prolong or further depress low charter rates\nwhen they occur, which may limit our ability to operate our vessels profitably.” These factors are outside of our control and are unpredictable, and accordingly we may not be able to\ncorrectly assess the nature, timing and degree of changes in charter rates. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating\nresults. In particular, a significant decrease in charter rates would cause asset values to decline. See “—The age of our tanker vessel may impact our ability to obtain financing and a\ndecline in the market values of our vessels could limit the amount of funds that we can borrow, cause us to breach certain financial covenants in our future credit facilities and/or\nresult in impairment charges or losses on sale.”\nAn oversupply of tanker vessel capacity may prolong or further depress charter rates when they occur, which may limit our ability to operate our vessels profitably.\nFactors that influence the supply of tanker vessel capacity include:\n• supply and demand for energy resources and crude oil and/or refined petroleum products\n• the number of newbuilding orders and deliveries;\n• the number of shipyards and ability of shipyards to deliver vessels;\n• port and canal congestion;\n• the number of conversions of tankers to other uses or conversions of other vessels to tankers;\n• scrapping of older vessels;\n• vessel freight rates, which are affected by factors that may affect the rate of newbuilding, scrapping and laying-up vessels (as set out below);\n• the availability of modern tanker capacity;\n• the speed of vessels being operated;\n• vessel casualties; and\n• the number of vessels that are out of service or laid up.\nIn addition to the prevailing and anticipated charter rates, factors that affect the rate of newbuilding, scrapping and laying-up include newbuilding prices, secondhand vessel\nvalues in relation to scrap prices, the availability of financing for new vessels and shipping activity, dry-dock and special survey expenditures, costs of bunkers and other operating\ncosts, costs associated with classification society surveys, normal maintenance costs, insurance coverage costs, the efficiency and age profile of the existing fleet in the market, and\ngovernment and industry regulations of maritime transportation practices, in particular environmental protection laws and regulations and laws and regulations regarding safety which\nimpact our industry.\n15\nTable of Contents\nThe limited activity in the tanker newbuilding market during 2022 has continued during 2023, and, as result, the new contracting to active fleet ratio continues to remain at\nrelatively low levels. The worldwide tanker fleet grew by 3.5% during 2022 and by 1.9% during 2023. The total orderbook of tanker vessels at the end of 2023 stood at 4.45% of the\ncurrent fleet, with deliveries expected mainly during the next two to three years.\nTanker vessel supply will continue to be affected by the delivery of new vessels and potential orders of more vessels than vessels removed from the global fleet, either through\nscrapping or accidental losses. An oversupply of tanker vessel capacity could contribute to or exacerbate decreases in charter rates or prolong the period during which low charter rates\nprevail which may have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our business and/or segments, cash flows, financial condition and operating results.\nThe operation of tankers has unique operational risks associated with the transportation of oil.\nThe operation of tankers transporting crude oil and/or refined petroleum products is inherently risky and presents unique operational risks. For example, an oil spill may cause\nsignificant environmental damage. Additionally, compared to other types of vessels, tankers are exposed to a higher risk of damage and loss by fire, whether ignited by a terrorist attack,\ncollision, or other cause, due to the high flammability and hazardous characteristics of the crude oil and refined petroleum products transported in tankers. Our crews could also be\ninadvertently exposed to the crude oil and refined petroleum products that we transport or their byproducts, such as escaped gases, which may pose a risk to their health and safety. As\na result, the unique operational risks associated with the transportation of oil could result in significantly more expensive insurance coverage and the associated costs of an oil spill or\nother health and safety incidents could exceed the insurance coverage available to us. Any of the foregoing factors may adversely affect our tanker segments, our cash flows and\nsegment and overall operating results.\nThe operation of tankers is subject to strict regulations and vetting requirements, that our manager and sub-managers need to comply with. Should either we or our manager and\nthird-party sub-managers not continue to successfully clear the oil majors’ risk assessment processes, our tanker vessels’ employment, as well as our relationship with charterers,\ncould be adversely affected.\nShipping, and especially crude oil, refined petroleum products and chemical tankers have been, and will remain, heavily regulated. For an overview of government regulations\nthat may impact our tanker operations, see “Item 4.B. Business Overview—Environmental and Other Regulations in the Shipping Industry.” The so called “oil major” companies,\ntogether with a number of commodities traders, represent a significant percentage of the production, trading and shipping logistics (i.e., terminals) of crude oil and refined petroleum\nproducts worldwide. Concerns for the environment have led the oil majors to develop and implement a strict ongoing due diligence process when selecting their commercial partners.\nThis vetting process has evolved into a sophisticated and comprehensive risk assessment of both the vessel operator and the vessel, including physical ship inspections, completion of\nvessel inspection questionnaires performed by accredited inspectors and the production of comprehensive risk assessment reports. In the case of term charter relationships, additional\nfactors are considered when awarding such contracts, including:\n• office assessments and audits of the vessel operator;\n• the operator’s environmental, health and safety record;\n• compliance with the standards of the International Maritime Organization (the “IMO”), a United Nations agency that issues international trade standards for shipping;\n• compliance with heightened industry standards that have been set by several oil companies;\n• shipping industry relationships, reputation for customer service, technical and operating expertise;\n• compliance with oil majors’ codes of conduct, policies and guidelines, including transparency, anti-bribery and ethical conduct requirements and relationships with third\nparties;\n• shipping experience and quality of ship operations, including cost-effectiveness;\n• quality, experience and technical capability of crews;\n• the ability to finance vessels at competitive rates and overall financial stability;\n• relationships with shipyards and the ability to obtain suitable berths;\n16\nTable of Contents\n• construction management experience, including the ability to procure on-time delivery of new vessels according to customer specifications;\n• willingness to accept operational risks pursuant to the charter, such as allowing termination of the charter for force majeure events; and\n• competitiveness of the bid in terms of overall price.\nShould either we or our manager and sub-managers not continue to successfully clear the oil majors’ risk assessment processes on an ongoing basis, our tanker vessels’\npresent and future employment, as well as our relationship with our existing charterers and our ability to obtain new charterers, whether medium- or long-term, could be adversely\naffected. Such a situation may lead to the oil majors’ terminating existing charters and refusing to use our tanker vessels which would adversely affect the growth of our business, cash\nflows and operating results.\nThe age of our tanker vessel may impact our ability to obtain financing and a decline in the market values of our vessels could limit the amount of funds that we can borrow, cause\nus to breach certain financial covenants in our future credit facilities and/or result in impairment charges or losses on sale.\nThe fair market values of tanker vessels have generally experienced high volatility. The fair market values of our vessels depend on a number of factors, including:\n• prevailing level of charter rates;\n• general economic and market conditions affecting the shipping industry;\n• the types, sizes and ages of the vessels, including as compared to other vessels in the market;\n• supply of and demand for vessels;\n• the availability and cost of other modes of transportation;\n• distressed asset sales, including newbuilding contract sales below acquisition costs due to lack of financing;\n• cost of newbuildings;\n• governmental or other regulations, including those that may limit the useful life of vessels; and\n• the need to upgrade vessels as a result of environmental, safety, regulatory or charterer requirements, technological advances in vessel design or equipment or otherwise.\nThe average age of our tanker fleet, which comprised one vessel with an age of 18.0 years as of February 29, 2024, was older than the industry average of 12.9 years as of the\nsame date. Our tanker vessel may therefore be viewed as providing insufficient or only short-term collateral. This could restrict our access to or terms of any financing against this tanker\nvessel. If the fair market value of our tanker vessel declines, we may also need to record an impairment charge in our financial statements or incur a loss on the sale of this tanker vessel,\nwhich could adversely affect our financial results. In addition, a decline in the fair market value of our tanker vessel could cause us not to be in compliance with covenants contained in\nany future facilities secured against such vessel that require the maintenance of a certain percentage of the fair market values of the tanker vessel securing any future facility to the\nprincipal outstanding amount of the respective facility. We have entered into facilities on these terms in the past.\nFurther, if vessel values are elevated at a time when we wish to acquire additional vessels, the cost of such acquisitions may increase and this could adversely affect our\nbusiness, cash flows, financial condition and operating results. We may also incur losses and be unable to recoup part of our investment in our tanker vessels if we sell any tanker vessel\nat less than its book value due to unfavorable market or operating conditions.\n17\nTable of Contents\nRisks Relating to the LPG Carrier Industry\nCharter rates for LPG carriers are volatile and cyclical in nature. A decrease in LPG carrier charter rates may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating\nresults.\nThe LPG carrier industry is both cyclical and volatile in terms of charter rates, profitability and vessel values. Fluctuations in charter rates result from changes in the supply and\ndemand for vessel capacity and changes in the supply and demand for the products transported by LPG carriers. The degree of charter rate volatility among different types of LPG\ncarriers has also varied widely. Further, because many factors (including the supply and demand for the products transported by LPG carriers) influencing the supply of, and demand for,\nvessel capacity are unpredictable, the timing, direction and degree of changes in the LPG carrier market are also unpredictable.\nThe global economy and the LPG carrier industry have experienced significant disruptions as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and sanctions imposed in relation to such\nconflict. LPG carrier rates have been impacted by changing energy prices as a result of disruptions to energy production, trade patterns and trade routes, including shipping in the Black\nSea and elsewhere. The continuation or further extension of economic sanctions, boycotts or otherwise may eventually result in a reduction in the supply of LPG available for\ntransportation and could negatively impact charter rates over the longer term. For further details regarding Russian sanctions, see “—Our charterers calling on ports located in\ncountries or territories that are the subject of sanctions or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government (including OFAC) or other authorities or failure to comply with the U.S.\nForeign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) or similar laws could lead to monetary fines or penalties and adversely affect our reputation. Such failures and other events could\nadversely affect the market for our common shares.”\nAny deterioration of charter rates resulting from various factors relating to the cyclicality and volatility of our business, including those above, may adversely affect our ability\nto profitably charter or re-charter our LPG carriers or to sell our vessels LPG carriers on a profitable basis. In particular, a significant decrease in charter rates would cause asset values\nto decline. Any of the foregoing factors could negatively impact our operating results, liquidity and/or financial condition.\nFuture growth in the demand for our services will depend among others on changes in supply and demand, economic growth in the world economy and demand for LPG and LPG\ntransportation relative to changes in worldwide fleet capacity.\nThe capacity of the world LPG carrier fleet appears likely to increase in the near term. However, future growth in the demand for LPG carriers, as well as the charter rates for such\nLPG carriers, depends on a variety of factors that may impact the supply of and demand for the products we transport. Factors that influence demand for LPG carrier capacity include,\nbut are not limited to:\n• changes in the supply of vessel capacity for the seaborne transportation of LPG products, which is influenced by the following factors:\n• the available supply of LPG products;\n• changes in the supply of vessel capacity for the seaborne transportation of LPG products, which is influenced by the following factors:\n• the availability of financing for new and secondhand LPG carriers and shipping activity;\n• the number of newbuilding deliveries and the ability of shipyards to deliver newbuildings by contracted delivery dates and capacity levels of shipyards;\n• the scrapping rate of older vessels and secondhand LPG carrier values in relation to scrap prices;\n• the number of vessels that are out of service, as a result of vessel casualties, repairs and dry-dockings;\n• the number of conversions LPG carriers to other uses or conversions of other vessels to LPG carriers, as applicable;\n• port and canal congestion;\n• the speed of LPG carriers being operated;\n18\nTable of Contents\n• changes in environmental and other regulations that may limit the useful lives of vessels;\n• changes in LPG carrier prices; and\n• any factors that affect the foregoing;\n• changes in the level of demand for seaborne transportation of LPG products, which is influenced by the following factors:\n• the level of production of LPG products in net export regions;\n• the level of demand for LPG products globally, and in particular, in net import regions such as Asia, Europe, Latin America and India;\n• regional availability of refining, liquefaction and deliquefaction capacity and inventories compared to geographies of oil and natural gas production and liquefaction\nand deliquefaction regions;\n• a reduction in global or general industrial activity specifically in the plastics and chemical industry;\n• changes in the cost of petroleum and natural gas from which liquefied gases are derived; and\n• prevailing global and regional economic conditions;\n• global and regional economic and political conditions and developments, including economic growth in global and local economies and the timeframe over which such\ngrowth occurs, demand for LPG carrier transport that exceeds capacity for such fleets worldwide, armed conflicts (such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine or the armed\nconflict(s) in the Middle East, including maritime incidents in and around the Red Sea, and the spread or worsening of any such conflicts) and terrorist activities,\ninternational trade sanctions, embargoes and strikes, particularly those that impact the regions or trade routes traveled by our vessels, the regions where the cargoes we\ncarry are produced or consumed, or any similar events which would interrupt the production or consumption of liquefied gases and associated products;\n• developments in international trade, including national policies regarding strategic oil inventories (including the reduction or replenishment of strategic reserves and if\nstrategic reserves are set at a lower level in the future as oil decreases in the energy mix), actions taken by OPEC and major oil and gas producers and refiners, as well a\nmajor LPG companies, and fluctuations in the profit margins of crude oil, refined petroleum products and/or LPG;\n• the distances between exporting and importing regions over which LPG products are to be transported by sea;\n• infrastructure to support seaborne LPG products trade, including pipelines, railways and terminals;\n• changes in seaborne and other transportation and distribution patterns, typically influenced by the relative advantage of the various sources of production, locations of\nconsumption, opportunities for arbitrage, pricing differentials and seasonality;\n• changes to the arbitrage of certain LPG products in different countries, regions or continents;\n• currency exchange and interest rates;\n• changes in environmental and other regulations that may limit the production or consumption of LPG products;\n• competition from alternative sources of energy alternative sources of energy, such as natural gas, coal, hydroelectric power and other alternative sources of energy, and\nconsumer demand for “green” or sustainable products;\n• inclement weather and/or natural catastrophes; and\n• epidemics and pandemics.\n19\nTable of Contents\nThese factors are outside of our control and are unpredictable, and accordingly we may not be able to correctly assess the nature, timing and degree of changes or their precise\nimpact on our business. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe active fleet on the small LPG carrier vessels, which have similar characteristics to the ones we own, has remained largely stable with a slight 1% decrease between 2022 and\n2023 (from 600 to 596 vessels, respectively). Moreover, the orderbook of small LPG carrier vessels has remained at low levels and has slightly decreased in 2023, from 14 vessels in 2022\nto 8 vessels in 2023.\nA decline in the market values of our LPG carriers could limit the amount of funds that we can borrow, cause us to breach certain financial covenants in our future credit facilities\nand/or result in impairment charges or losses on sale.\nThe fair market values of LPG carriers have generally experienced high volatility based on a variety of factors. Factors which may affect the fair market values of our LPG\ncarriers include, without limitation:\n• prevailing level of charter rates;\n• general economic and market conditions affecting the shipping industry;\n• the types, sizes and ages of the LPG carriers, including as compared to other LPG carriers in the market and as relates to environmental and energy efficiency;\n• supply of and demand for LPG carriers, including as a result of the competitive environment we operate in;\n• the availability and cost of other modes of transportation;\n• distressed asset sales, including newbuilding contract sales below acquisition costs due to lack of financing;\n• cost of newbuildings;\n• speculative LPG carrier orders from peers during periods of low LPG carrier prices, thereby increasing the supply of LPG carrier capacity, satisfying demand sooner and\npotentially suppressing charter rates;\n• shipyard capacity;\n• governmental or other regulations, including those that may limit the useful life of LPG carriers;\n• the need to upgrade LPG carriers as a result of environmental, safety, regulatory or charterer requirements, technological advances in LPG carrier design or equipment or\notherwise; and\n• The size of the LPG carrier market is small and illiquid resulting to only a limited number of vessel sales taking place on an annual basis.\nIn addition, when vessel prices are considered to be low, companies not usually involved in shipping may make speculative vessel orders, thereby increasing the supply of\nvessel capacity, satisfying demand sooner and potentially suppressing charter rates. To the extent we enter into any future facilities that require the maintenance of a certain\npercentage of the fair market values of the LPG carriers securing any future facility to the principal outstanding amount of the respective facility, a decline in the fair value of our LPG\ncarriers could cause us not to be in compliance with such covenants. We have entered into facilities on these terms in the past.\nFurther, if vessel values are elevated at a time when we wish to acquire additional vessels, the cost of such acquisitions may increase and this could adversely affect our\nbusiness, cash flows, financial condition and operating results. We may also incur losses and be unable to recoup part of our investment in our LPG carriers if we sell any LPG carrier at\nless than its book value due to unfavorable market or operating conditions.\n20\nTable of Contents\nRisks Relating to Our Company\nWe may be dependent on a small number of charterers for the majority of our business.\nA small number of charterers have accounted for a significant part of our revenues and we expect this trend to continue in our operations. Indicatively, for the period ended\nDecember 31, 2022, we derived 42% of our operating revenues from three pool managers and in the year ended December 31, 2023, we derived 92% of our operating revenues from two\npool managers and one charterer. While the majority of our vessels no longer participate in pools, including the V8 Plus Pool (the “V8 Plus Pool”) in which all of our Aframax/LR2 vessels\nformerly participated prior to their sale by us to third-parties, we expect our credit concentration to remain significant because our LPG carrier vessels are chartered by a small number of\ncharterers. For further information regarding the V8 Plus Pool, see “Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—B. Related Party Transactions—The V8 Plus Pool.”\nAll the charters for our fleet have fixed terms, but may be terminated earlier due to certain events, such as a charterers’ failure to make payments to us because of financial inability,\ndisagreements with us or otherwise. The ability of each of our counterparties to perform their obligations under a charter with us depends on a number of factors that are beyond our\ncontrol and may include, among other things, general economic conditions, the condition of the shipping industry, prevailing prices for crude oil, refined petroleum and LPG-related\nproducts and the overall financial condition of the counterparty. Should a counterparty fail to honor its obligations under an agreement with us, we may be unable to realize revenue\nunder that charter arrangement and could sustain losses. In addition, if we lose an existing charterer, it may be difficult for us to promptly replace the revenue we derived from that\ncounterparty. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and operating results. For further information, see Note 1 to our\nconsolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for an overview of our charterer concentration.\nWe may not be able to execute our business strategy and we may not realize the benefits we expect from acquisitions or other strategic transactions.\nAs our business grows, we intend to acquire additional tanker and/or LPG carrier vessels, including to replace existing vessels, diversify our fleet and expand our activities,\nsubject to the conditions set out in the Toro Spin-Off Resolutions. See“—We have limited the fields in which we focus our operations and this may have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results.” These objectives have implications for various operating costs, the perceived desirability of our vessels to charterers and the\nability to attract financing for our business on favorable terms or at all. Our future growth will primarily depend upon a number of factors, some of which may not be within our control.\nThese factors include our ability to:\n• identify suitable vessels, including newbuilding slots at reputable shipyards and/or shipping companies for acquisitions at attractive prices;\n• realize anticipated benefits, such as new customer relationships, cost savings or cash flow enhancements from acquisitions;\n• obtain required financing for our existing and new operations;\n• integrate any acquired vessels, assets or businesses successfully with our existing operations, including obtaining any approvals and qualifications necessary to operate\nvessels that we acquire;\n• enlarge our customer base and continue to meet technical and safety performance standards;\n• ensure, either directly or through our manager and sub-managers, that an adequate supply of qualified personnel and crew are available to manage and operate our growing\nbusiness and fleet;\n• improve our operating, financial and accounting systems and controls; and\n• cope with competition from other companies, many of which have significantly greater financial resources than we do, and may reduce our acquisition opportunities or\ncause us to pay higher prices.\nOur failure to effectively identify, acquire, develop and integrate any vessels could adversely affect our business, financial condition, investor sentiment and operating results.\nFinally, acquisitions may require additional equity issuances, which may dilute our common shareholders if issued at lower prices than the price they acquired their shares, or debt\nissuances (with amortization payments), both of which could lower our available cash. See “—Future issuances of common shares or other equity securities, including as a result of an\noptional conversion of Series A Preferred Shares, or the potential for such issuances, may impact the price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise capital through\nequity offerings. Shareholders may experience significant dilution as a result of any such issuances.” If any such events occur, our financial condition may be adversely affected.\n21\nTable of Contents\nWe operate secondhand vessels, some of which have an age above the industry average, which may lead to increased technical problems for our vessels and/or higher operating\nexpenses or affect our ability to profitably charter our vessels, to comply with environmental standards and future maritime regulations and to obtain financing on favorable terms\nor at all and result in a more rapid deterioration in our vessels’ market and book values.\nOur current fleet consists only of secondhand vessels. While we have inspected our vessels and we intend to inspect any potential future vessel acquisition, this does not\nprovide us with the same knowledge about its condition that we would have had if the vessel had been built for and operated exclusively by us. Generally, purchasers of secondhand\nvessels do not receive the benefit of warranties that purchasers of newbuild vessels receive from the builders and the makers of the vessels that they acquire.\nThe cost of maintaining a vessel in good operating condition and operating it generally increases with the age of a vessel because, amongst other things:\n• as our vessels age, typically, they become less fuel-efficient and more costly to maintain than more recently constructed vessels due to improvements in design,\nengineering and technology and due to increased maintenance requirements;\n• cargo insurance rates increase with the age of a vessel, making our vessels more expensive to operate; and\n• governmental regulations, environmental and safety or other equipment standards related to the age of vessels may also require expenditures for alterations or the addition\nof new equipment to our vessels and may restrict the type of activities in which our vessels may engage.\nThe average age of our LPG carrier fleet was 7.5 years as of February 29, 2024, compared to the industry average of the world fleet of small LPGs up to 5,000 cbm, which was 22.0\nyears as of the same date. Further, the average age of our tanker fleet, which comprised one vessel as of such date, was 18.0 years of February 29, 2024, compared to a tanker shipping\nindustry average of 12.9 years. We therefore face increased costs due to the age of our tanker vessel relative to many of our peers.\nCharterers also have age restrictions on the vessels they charter and in the past have actively discriminated against chartering older vessels, which may result in lower\nutilization of our vessels and, in turn, in lower revenues. Our charterers have a high and increasing focus on quality and compliance standards with their suppliers across the entire\nsupply chain, including the shipping and transportation segment. Our continued compliance with these standards and quality requirements is vital for our operations. The charter hire\nrates and the value and operational life of a vessel are determined by a number of factors, including the vessel’s efficiency, operational flexibility and physical life. Efficiency includes\nspeed, fuel economy and the ability to load and discharge cargo quickly. Flexibility includes the ability to enter harbors, operate in extreme climates, utilize related docking facilities and\npass-through canals and straits. The length of a vessel’s physical life is related to its original design and construction, its maintenance and the impact of the stress of operations.\nThe age of our tanker vessel may impede our ability to obtain external financing against that vessel at all or at reasonable terms as our tanker vessel may be seen as less\nvaluable collateral. For further information on the factors which could affect our ability to obtain financing, including the age of our fleet, see “—The age of our tanker vessel may impact\nour ability to obtain financing and a decline in the market values of our vessels could limit the amount of funds that we can borrow, cause us to breach certain financial covenants in\nour future credit facilities and/or result in impairment charges or losses on sale.”\nWe face competition from companies with more modern vessels with more fuel-efficient designs than our vessels (“eco–vessels”). If new tankers are built that are more efficient\nor more flexible or have longer physical lives than even the current eco-vessels, competition from the current eco-vessels and any more technologically advanced vessels could\nadversely affect the amount of charter hire payments we receive for our vessels once their charters expire and the resale value of our vessels could significantly decrease.\nWe cannot assure you that, as our vessels age, market conditions will justify expenditures to maintain or update our vessels or enable us to operate our vessels profitably\nduring the remainder of their useful lives or that we will be able to finance the acquisition of new vessels at the time that we retire or sell our aging vessels. This could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\n22\nTable of Contents\nWe are reliant on the spot market for a portion of our revenue, thereby exposing us to risk of losses based on short-term volatility in shipping rates.\nWe may opportunistically employ some or all of our vessels in the spot market, either in the voyage charter market or in spot-market oriented pools, if spot market conditions are\nfavorable. The spot charter market is highly competitive and freight rates in this market have been volatile, fluctuating significantly based upon supply of and demand for vessels and\ncrude oil, refined petroleum and/or LPG products. Conversely, longer-term charter contracts have pre-determined rates over more extended periods of time, providing a fixed source of\nrevenue to us. The successful operation of our vessels in the competitive spot charter market depends upon, among other things, our commercial manager and/or our pool operators\nobtaining profitable spot charters and minimizing, to the extent possible, time spent waiting for charters and time spent traveling unladen to pick up cargo. We cannot assure you that we\nwill be successful in keeping our vessels fully employed in these short-term markets, or that future spot revenues will be sufficient to enable such vessels to operate profitably.\nIn the past, there have been periods when revenues derived in the spot market have declined below the operating cost of vessels. If spot charter rates decline, then we may be\nunable to operate our vessels trading in the spot market profitably and/or meet our obligations, including payments on indebtedness. Furthermore, as charter rates for spot charters are\nfixed for a single voyage which may last up to several weeks, during periods in which spot charter rates are rising, we will generally experience delays in realizing the benefits from such\nincreases. A significant decrease in spot revenues or our inability to fully employ our vessels by taking advantage of the spot market would therefore adversely affect operating results,\nincluding our profitability and cash flows, with the result that our ability to serve our working capital and debt service needs could be impaired.\nWe are subject to certain risks with respect to our counterparties on contracts, and failure of such counterparties to meet their obligations could cause us to suffer losses or\nnegatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have entered into, and may enter into in the future, various contracts, including charter agreements, pool agreements, management agreements, shipbuilding contracts and\ncredit facilities. Such agreements subject us to counterparty risks. The ability of each of our counterparties to perform its obligations under a contract with us will depend on a number of\nfactors that are beyond our control and may include, among other things, general economic conditions, the condition of the maritime and offshore industries, the overall financial\ncondition of the counterparty, charter rates received for specific types of vessels, and various expenses. For example, the combination of a reduction of cash flow resulting from a decline\nin world trade and the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction in the ability of our charterers and/or pool operators to make payments to us. In\naddition, in depressed market conditions, our charterers and customers may no longer need a vessel that is then under charter or contract or may be able to obtain a comparable vessel at\nlower rates and pool operators may not be able to profitably employ our participating vessels, if any. As a result, charterers and customers may seek to renegotiate the terms of their\nexisting charter agreements or avoid their obligations under those contracts and pool operators may terminate the pool agreements or admit inability to comply with their obligations\nunder those agreements. This may have a significant impact on our revenues due to our concentrated customer base. For further details, see “—We may be dependent on a small number\nof charterers for the majority of our business.” We may also face these counterparty risks due to assignments. Should a counterparty fail to honor its obligations under agreements with\nus, we could sustain significant losses which could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe are dependent upon Castor Ships, a related party, and other third-party sub-managers for the management of our fleet and business and failure of such counterparties to meet\ntheir obligations could cause us to suffer losses or could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nThe management of our business, including, but not limited to, the commercial and technical management of our fleet as well as administrative, financial and other business\nfunctions, is carried out by Castor Ships, which is a company controlled by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Petros Panagiotidis. We are reliant on Castor Ships’ continued and\nsatisfactory provision of its services.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, Castor Ships has subcontracted, with our consent, the technical management for all our vessels to a third-party ship-management\ncompany at its own expense, except for the M/T Wonder Mimosa, which Castor Ships has provided the technical management since June 7, 2023. Our subcontracting arrangements with\nthird-parties may expose us to risks such as low customer satisfaction with the service provided by these subcontractors, increased operating costs compared to those we would\nachieve for our vessels, and an inability to maintain our vessels according to our standards or our current or potential customers’ standards.\n23\nTable of Contents\nOur ability to enter into new charters and expand our customer relationships depends largely on our ability to leverage our relationship with our manager and its subcontractors\nand their reputations and relationships in the shipping industry. If any of these counterparties suffer material damage to their reputations or relationships, it may also harm our ability to\nrenew existing charters upon their expiration, obtain new charters or maintain satisfactory relationships with suppliers and other third parties. In addition, the inability of our manager to\nfix our vessels at competitive charter rates either due to prevailing market conditions at the time or due to its inability to provide the requisite quality of service, could adversely affect\nour revenues and profitability and we may have difficulty meeting our working capital and debt obligations.\nOur operational success and ability to execute our business strategy will depend significantly upon the satisfactory and continued performance of these services by our\nmanager and/or sub-managers, as well as their reputations. Any of the foregoing factors could have an adverse effect on our and their reputations and on our business, financial\ncondition and operating results. Although we may have rights against our manager and/or sub-managers if they default on their obligations to us, our shareholders will share that\nrecourse only indirectly to the extent that we recover funds.\nWe have limited the fields in which we focus our operations and this may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur Chairman and Chief Executive Officer also serves as Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of our former parent company, Castor. Therefore, in\nconnection with the Spin-Off, we resolved to limit the fields in which we focus our operations. We currently focus our efforts on tanker and LPG carrier shipping services, and we have\nno interest or expectancy to participate or pursue any opportunity in areas of business outside of these shipping businesses nor that Petros Panagiotidis, our director, Chairman, Chief\nExecutive Officer and controlling shareholder and his affiliates, such as Castor Ships, offer or inform us of any such opportunity. This does not, however, preclude us from pursuing\nopportunities outside of these shipping business if in the future our Board determines to do so. For example, since completion of the Spin-Off, we have expanded into the LPG carrier\nmarket. Focusing our operations on the tanker and LPG carrier shipping business may reduce the scope of opportunities we may exploit and have an adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and operating results.\nSimilarly, in connection with the Spin-Off, Castor’s board resolved to, among other things, limit the fields in which it focuses its operations, and that Castor has no interest or\nexpectancy to participate or pursue any opportunity in areas of business outside of the dry bulk shipping business nor that Petros Panagiotidis, its director, Chairman, Chief Executive\nOfficer, Chief Financial Officer and controlling shareholder and his affiliates will offer or inform it of any such opportunity. This does not preclude Castor, however, from pursuing\nopportunities outside of the dry bulk shipping business if in the future Castor’s board determines to do so, including in the shipping sectors we operate in.\nOur failure to obtain an opportunity that our Board deems in the interest of our shareholders may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating\nresults. See also “Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—B. Related Party Transactions—The Spin-Off Resolutions.”\nWe expect that any new or amended credit facility we enter into will contain restrictive covenants that we may not be able to comply with due to economic, financial or operational\nreasons and may limit our business and financing activities.\nIn the past, we have entered into facilities that have imposed operating and financial restrictions and covenants on us and we expect that any new or amended facilities that we\nenter into in the future may require us to abide by similar terms. In particular, under the terms of any new or amended facilities, we may be required to obtain the consent of our lenders to\nundertake various actions, such as:\n• incurring or guaranteeing additional indebtedness outside of our ordinary course of business;\n• charging, pledging or encumbering our vessels;\n• changing the flag, class, management or ownership of our vessels;\n• changing the commercial and technical management of our vessels;\n• declaring or paying any dividends or other distributions at a time when the Company has an event of default or the payment of such distribution would cause an event of\ndefault;\n• forming or acquiring any subsidiaries;\n24\nTable of Contents\n• making any investments in any person, asset, firm, corporation, joint venture or other entity;\n• merging or consolidating with any other person;\n• changing the ownership, beneficial ownership, control or management of the Company entities party to the facility, or of any of secured vessels, if the effect of such\nchange would be to materially change the ultimate legal and beneficial ownership in effect at the time the facility was executed; and\n• entering into any demise charter contract or let our vessels under any pooling agreement whereby all of the vessel’s earnings are pooled or shared with any other person.\nWe may also be subject to various financial covenants under any new or amended facilities, including those that require us to maintain a (i) certain minimum level of cash and\ncash equivalents, (ii) specified leverage ratio and/or (iii) minimum net worth amount.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our future credit facilities may be affected by events beyond our control and which could impair our\nability to comply with the terms of such facilities, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions, interest rate developments, changes in the funding costs of our banks\nand changes in vessel earnings and asset valuations. In particular, inflationary pressures have and may continue to impact interest rates, including SOFR, as discussed in “—Worldwide\ninflationary pressures could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.” In the event of non-compliance, we may be required to make prepayments or trigger cross-\ndefault provisions that we may not have sufficient funds to satisfy. Any such payments may impede our business strategy due to the diversion of funds away from our core operating\nactivities. To the extent facilities are secured by our vessels, lenders could also seek to foreclose on those assets. Financial and operating covenants in our facilities could also constrain\nour ability to acquire vessels, as we would have to make contemplated expenditures for vessel acquisitions at levels which do not breach any applicable covenants in our future credit\nfacilities. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on acceptable terms, which may negatively impact our planned growth.\nAs a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets generally and the solvency of counterparties, among other factors, the ability to obtain money from the credit\nmarkets has become more difficult as many lenders have increased interest rates, enacted tighter lending standards, refused to refinance existing debt at all or on terms similar to current\ndebt and reduced, and, in some cases, ceased to provide funding to borrowers. Due to these factors, we cannot be certain that financing or refinancing will be available if needed and, to\nthe extent required, on acceptable terms. The age of our tanker vessel may also impact our ability to obtain new financing against such on favorable terms or at all and may hinder our\nplans to reduce the average age of our fleet through vessel acquisitions and/or replacements. See “—The age of our tanker vessel may impact our ability to obtain financing and a\ndecline in the market values of our vessels could limit the amount of funds that we can borrow, cause us to breach certain financial covenants in our future credit facilities and/or\nresult in impairment charges or losses on sale.” If financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to enhance our existing business,\ncomplete additional vessel acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities as they arise.\nWe are a holding company, and we depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute funds to us to satisfy our financial and other obligations.\nWe are a holding company and have no significant assets other than the equity interests in our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries own all of our existing vessels, and subsidiaries\nwe form or acquire will own any other vessels we may acquire in the future. All payments under our charters and/or pool arrangements are made to our subsidiaries. As a result, our\nability to meet our financial and other obligations, and to pay dividends in the future, as and if declared, will depend on the performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to distribute\nfunds to us. The ability of a subsidiary to make these distributions could be affected by a claim or other action by a third party, including a creditor, by the terms of our financing\narrangements, or by the applicable law regulating the payment of dividends in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries are organized. If we are unable to obtain funds from our\nsubsidiaries, we will not be able to meet our liquidity needs unless we obtain funds from other sources, which we may not be able to do.\n25\nTable of Contents\nWe do not have a declared dividend policy and our Board may never declare dividends on our common shares.\nThe declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will always be subject to the discretion of our Board, restrictions contained in our current or future agreements and the\nrequirements of Marshall Islands law. We do not have a declared dividend policy and if the Board determines to declare dividends, the timing and amount of any dividends declared will\ndepend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition and cash requirements and availability, our ability to obtain debt and equity financing on acceptable terms as\ncontemplated by our business strategy, our compliance with the terms of our outstanding indebtedness and the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute funds to us. The tanker and LPG\nshipping industry is highly volatile, and we cannot predict with certainty the amount of cash, if any, that will be available for distribution as dividends in any period. Also, there may be a\nhigh degree of variability from period to period in the amount of cash that is available for the payment of dividends.\nIn addition, we pay dividends on our Series A Preferred Shares. The dividend rate for the Series A Preferred Shares is 1.00% per annum of the stated amount of $1,000 per share;\nfor each quarterly dividend period commencing on or after the seventh anniversary of the issue date (the “reset date”), the dividend rate will be the dividend rate in effect for the prior\nquarterly dividend period multiplied by a factor of 1.3; provided, however, that the dividend rate will not exceed 20% per annum in respect of any quarterly dividend period. Further, in the\nevent that we declare a dividend of the stock of a subsidiary which we control, the holder(s) of the Series B Preferred Shares are entitled to receive preferred shares of such subsidiary.\nThe rights of the holders of our Series A Preferred Shares rank senior to the obligations to holders of our common shares. This means that, unless accumulated dividends have been paid\nor set aside for payment on all of our outstanding Series A Preferred Shares for all past completed dividend periods, no distributions may be declared or paid on our common shares\nsubject to limited exceptions. See “Item 8. Financial Information—A. Consolidated Statements and other Financial Information—Dividend Policy.”\nWe may incur expenses or liabilities or be subject to other circumstances in the future that reduce or eliminate the amount of cash that we have available for distribution as\ndividends, including as a result of the risks described herein. Our business strategy contemplates that we will finance our acquisitions of additional vessels using cash from operations,\nthrough debt financings and/or from the net proceeds of future equity issuances on terms acceptable to us. If financing is not available to us on acceptable terms or at all, our Board may\ndetermine to finance or refinance acquisitions with cash from operations, which would reduce the amount of any cash available for the payment of dividends, if any.\nThe Republic of Marshall Islands laws generally prohibit the payment of dividends other than from surplus (retained earnings and the excess of consideration received for the\nsale of shares above the par value of the shares) or while a company is insolvent or would be rendered insolvent by the payment of such a dividend. We may not have sufficient surplus\nin the future to pay dividends and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient funds or surplus to make distributions to us. We currently pay no cash dividends and we may never pay\ndividends.\nIncreasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, lenders and other market participants with respect to our Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) policies\nmay impose additional costs on us or expose us to additional risks.\nCompanies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny relating to their ESG practices and policies. Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment\nfunds, lenders and other market participants are increasingly focused on ESG practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the implications and social cost of their\ninvestments. The increased focus and activism related to ESG and similar matters may hinder access to capital, as investors and lenders may decide to reallocate capital or to not commit\ncapital as a result of their assessment of a company’s ESG practices. Companies which do not adapt to or comply with investor, lender or other industry shareholder expectations and\nstandards, which are evolving, or which are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to\ndo so, may suffer from reputational damage and the business, financial condition, and/or stock price of such a company could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may face increasing pressures from investors, lenders and other market participants, who are increasingly focused on climate change, to prioritize sustainable energy\npractices, reduce our carbon footprint and promote sustainability. As a result, we may be required to implement more stringent ESG procedures or standards so that our existing and\nfuture investors and lenders remain invested in us and make further investments in us, especially given the highly focused and specific trade and transport of crude oil and refined\npetroleum products in which we are engaged. If we do not meet these standards, our business and/or our ability to access capital could be harmed.\n26\nTable of Contents\nThese limitations in both the debt and equity capital markets may affect our ability to grow as our plans for growth may include accessing the equity and debt capital markets. If\nthose markets are unavailable, or if we are unable to access alternative means of financing on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be unable to implement our business strategy, which\ncould impair our ability to service our indebtedness. Further, it is likely that we will incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, comply with and implement\nwide-ranging ESG requirements. Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are a new company, and our anti-fraud and corporate governance procedures might not be as advanced as those implemented by our listed peer competitors having a longer\npresence in the shipping industry.\nAs a publicly traded company, the SEC, Nasdaq Capital Market, and other regulatory bodies subject us to increased scrutiny on the way we manage and operate our business\nby urging us or mandating us to take a series of actions that have nowadays become an area of focus among policymakers and investors. Listed companies are occasionally encouraged\nto follow best practices and often must comply with these rules and/or practices addressing a variety of corporate governance and anti-fraud matters, such as director independence,\nboard committees, corporate transparency, ethical behavior, sustainability and prevention of and controls relating to corruption and fraud. While we believe we follow all requirements\nthat regulatory bodies may from time to time impose on us, our internal processes and procedures might not be as advanced or mature as those implemented by other listed shipping\ncompanies with a longer experience and presence in the U.S. capital markets, which could be an area of concern to our investors and expose us to greater operational risks.\nWe may be subject to litigation that, if not resolved in our favor and not sufficiently insured against, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe may, from time to time, be involved in various litigation or arbitration matters. These matters may include, among other things, contract disputes, personal injury claims,\nenvironmental claims or proceedings, asbestos and other toxic tort claims, employment matters, governmental claims for taxes or duties, and other litigation or arbitration that arises in\nthe ordinary course of our business. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any claim or other litigation matter, and the ultimate outcome of any litigation or\narbitration, or the potential costs to resolve it, may have a material adverse effect on our business. Insurance may not be applicable or sufficient in all cases and/or insurers may not\nremain solvent, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe may have to pay tax on United States source income, which would reduce our earnings, cash from operations and cash available for distribution to our shareholders.\nUnder the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”), 50% of the gross shipping income of a vessel owning or chartering corporation, such as ourselves and\nour subsidiaries, that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends, but that does not both begin and end, in the United States may be subject to a 4% U.S. federal income tax\nwithout allowance for deduction, unless that corporation qualifies for exemption from tax under Section 883 of the Code and the applicable Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.\nWe intend to take the position that we and each of our subsidiaries qualify for this statutory tax exemption for our 2021 and future taxable years. However, as discussed below\nunder “Taxation—U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations—U.S. Federal Income Taxation of Our Company”, whether we qualify for this exemption in view of our share structure is\nunclear and there can be no assurance that the exemption from tax under Section 883 of the Code will be available to us. If we or our subsidiaries are not entitled to this exemption, we\nwould be subject to an effective 2% U.S. federal income tax on the gross shipping income we derive during the year that is attributable to the transport of cargoes to or from the United\nStates. If this tax had been imposed for our 2021, 2022 and 2023 taxable year, we anticipate that U.S source income taxes of approximately $206,174, $960,181 and $350,667 would be\ncharged for these periods, respectively, and we have included a provision for these amounts in our Consolidated Financial Statements. However, there can be no assurance that such\ntaxes will not be materially higher or lower in future taxable years.\n27\nTable of Contents\nA change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation, of any country in which we operate could result in a higher tax rate on our worldwide earnings, which could\nresult in a significant negative impact on our earnings and cash flows from operations.\nWe conduct our operations through subsidiaries which can trade worldwide. Tax laws and regulations are highly complex and subject to interpretation. Consequently, we are\nsubject to changing tax laws, treaties and regulations in and between countries in which we operate. Our income tax expense, if any, is based upon our interpretation of tax laws in effect\nin various countries at the time that the expense was incurred. A change in these tax laws, treaties or regulations, or in the interpretation thereof, could result in a materially higher tax\nexpense or a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings, and such change could be significant to our financial results. If any tax authority successfully challenges our\noperational structure, or the taxable presence of our operating subsidiaries in certain countries, or if the terms of certain income tax treaties are interpreted in a manner that is adverse to\nour structure, or if we lose a material tax dispute in any country, our effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings could increase substantially. An increase in our taxes could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows from these operations. Moreover, in February 2023, the Marshall Islands was added to a list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for\ntax purposes, commonly referred to as the “EU blacklist.” Although the Marshall Islands was removed from the EU Blacklist in October 2023, the effect of these developments, including\nwhether the European Union will again add the Marshall Islands to the EU blacklist, any legislation that the Marshall Islands may enact with a view toward not again being added to (or\nbeing removed from) the EU blacklist, how the European Union may react to such legislation, and how counterparties will react to these developments, is unclear and could potentially\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur subsidiaries may be subject to taxation in the jurisdictions in which its activities are conducted. The amount of any such taxation may be material and would reduce the\namounts available for distribution to us.\nOur historical financial results may not be representative of our results as a separate, standalone company.\nSome of the historical financial information we have included in this Annual Report has been derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of\nCastor and does not necessarily reflect what our financial position, results of operations or cash flows would have been had we been a separate, standalone company during the periods\npresented. Although Castor did account for our business as two separate business segments, we were not operated as a separate, standalone company for the historical periods\npresented. The historical information included for the period prior to March 7, 2023 does not necessarily indicate what our results of operations, financial position, cash flows or costs\nand expenses will be in the future.\nWe are dependent on our management and their ability to hire and retain key personnel and their ability to devote sufficient time and attention to their respective roles. In\nparticular, we are dependent on the retention and performance of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Petros Panagiotidis.\nOur success depends upon our and our management’s ability to hire and retain key members of our management team and the ability of our management team to devote\nsufficient time and attention to their respective roles in light of outside business interests. In particular, we are dependent upon the performance of our Chairman and Chief Executive\nOfficer, Petros Panagiotidis, who has outside business interests in Castor, Castor Ships and other ventures. Mr. Panagiotidis will continue to devote such portion of his business time\nand attention to our business as is appropriate and will also continue to devote substantial time to Castor’s business and other business and/or investment activities that Mr.\nPanagiotidis maintains now or in the future. Mr. Panagiotidis’ intention to provide adequate time and attention to other ventures will preclude him from devoting substantially all his time\nto our business. Further, the loss of Mr. Panagiotidis, either to outside business interests or for unrelated reasons, or resignation of Mr. Panagiotidis from any of his current managerial\nroles could adversely affect our business prospects and financial condition. Any difficulty in hiring and retaining key personnel generally could also adversely affect our results of\noperations. We do not maintain “key man” life insurance on any of our officers.\nRisks Relating to Our Preferred Shares\nOur Series A Preferred Shares rank senior to our common shares with respect to dividends, distributions and payments upon liquidation and are convertible into our common\nshares, which could have an adverse effect on the value of our common shares.\nDividends on the Series A Preferred Shares accrue and are cumulative from their issue date and are payable quarterly on each distribution payment date declared by the Board,\nout of funds legally available for such purpose. The dividend rate for the period from, and including, the issue date to, but excluding, the reset date will be 1.00% per annum of the stated\namount of $1,000 per share; however, for each quarterly dividend period commencing on or after the reset date, the dividend rate will be the dividend rate in effect for the prior quarterly\ndividend period multiplied by a factor of 1.3, provided that the dividend rate will not exceed 20% per annum in respect of any quarterly dividend period.\n28\nTable of Contents\nThe rights of the holders of our Series A Preferred Shares rank senior to the obligations to holders of our common shares. This means that, unless accumulated dividends have\nbeen paid or set aside for payment on all of our outstanding Series A Preferred Shares for all past completed dividend periods, no distributions may be declared or paid on our common\nshares subject to limited exceptions. Likewise, in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, no distribution of our assets may be made to holders of\nour common shares until we have paid to holders of our Series A Preferred Shares a liquidation preference equal to $1,000 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.\nIn addition, our Series A Preferred Shares are convertible, in whole or in part, at their holder’s option, to common shares at any time and from time to time from and after the third\nanniversary of their issue date and prior to the seventh anniversary of such date. The conversion of our Series A Preferred Shares could result in significant dilution to our shareholders\nat the time of conversion. See also “—Risks Relating to our Common Shares—Future issuances of common shares or other equity securities, including as a result of an conversion of\nSeries A Preferred Shares, or the potential for such issuances, may impact the price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise capital through equity offerings.\nShareholders may experience significant dilution as a result of any such issuances.”\nAccordingly, the existence of the Series A Preferred Shares and the ability of a holder to convert the Series A Preferred Shares into common shares on or after the third and prior\nto the seventh anniversary of their issue date could have a material adverse effect on the value of our common shares. See “Item 10. Additional Information—B. Memorandum and\nArticles of Incorporation—Description of the Series A Preferred Shares” for a more detailed description of the Series A Preferred Shares.\nRisks Relating to our Common Shares\nOur share price may be highly volatile and, as a result, investors in our common shares could incur substantial losses.\nThe stock market in general, and the market for shipping companies in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated or disproportionate to the\noperating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may experience rapid and substantial losses on their investment in our common shares that are\nunrelated to our operating performance. Our stock price has been volatile and may continue to be volatile, which may cause our common shares to trade above or below what we believe\nto be their fundamental value. Furthermore, significant historical fluctuations in the market price of our former parent company’s common shares have been accompanied by reports of\nstrong and atypical retail investor interest, including on social media and online forums, and, as our common shares were distributed to our former parent company’s common\nshareholders in connection with the Spin-Off, we may have a similar shareholder base and experience similar patterns of investment. Since completion of the Spin-Off, the price of our\ncommon shares has been volatile, ranging from a low of $1.42 per share on March 24, 2023 to a high of $6.50 per share on August 14, 2023. As of February 29, 2024, the closing bid price\nof our common shares was $6.15 per common share. Our shares may continue to experience volatility as the market evaluates our prospects as an independent publicly traded company.\nMarket volatility and trading patterns may create several risks for investors, including but not limited to the following:\n• the market price of our common shares may experience rapid and substantial increases or decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects, or macro or\nindustry fundamentals;\n• to the extent volatility in our common shares is caused by a “short squeeze” in which coordinated trading activity causes a spike in the market price of our common shares\nas traders with a short position make market purchases to avoid or to mitigate potential losses, investors may purchase common shares at inflated prices unrelated to our\nfinancial performance or prospects, and may thereafter suffer substantial losses as prices decline once the level of short-covering purchases has abated; and\n• if the market price of our common shares declines, you may be unable to resell your shares at or above the price at which you acquired them. We cannot assure you that the\nequity issuance of our common shares will not fluctuate, increase or decline significantly in the future, in which case you could incur substantial losses.\nWe may incur rapid and substantial increases or decreases in our stock price in the foreseeable future that may not coincide in timing with the disclosure of news or\ndevelopments by or affecting us. Accordingly, the market price of our common shares may decline or fluctuate rapidly, regardless of any developments in our business.\nOverall, there are various factors, many of which are beyond our control, that could negatively affect the market price of our common shares or result in fluctuations in the\nprice or trading volume of our common shares, which include but are not limited to:\n• investor reaction to our business strategy;\n29\nTable of Contents\n• the sentiment of the significant number of retail investors whom we believe hold our common shares, in part due to direct access by retail investors to broadly available\ntrading platforms, and whose investment thesis may be influenced by views expressed on financial trading and other social media sites and online forums;\n• the amount and status of short interest in our common shares, access to margin debt, trading in options and other derivatives on our common shares and any related\nhedging and other trading factors;\n• our continued compliance with the listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market and any action we may take to maintain such compliance, such as a reverse stock split;\n• regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries, especially changes in laws or regulations applicable to our industry;\n• variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n• our ability or inability to raise additional capital and the terms on which we raise it;\n• our dividend strategy;\n• our continued compliance with our debt covenants;\n• variations in the value of our fleet;\n• declines in the market prices of stocks generally;\n• trading volume of our common shares;\n• sales of our common shares by us or our shareholders;\n• speculation in the press or investment community about our Company, our industry or our securities;\n• general economic, industry and market conditions; and\n• other events or factors, including those resulting from such events, or the prospect of such events, including war, terrorism and other international conflicts, public health\nissues including health epidemics or pandemics, and natural disasters such as fire, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornados or other adverse weather and climate conditions,\nwhether occurring in the United States or elsewhere, could disrupt our operations or result in political or economic instability.\nThe sale of significant volumes of our common shares, or the perception in the market that this will occur, may decrease their market price and have an adverse impact on our\nbusiness, including due to Nasdaq minimum bid price requirements.\nSome companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their common shares have been subject to securities class-action litigation. If instituted against us, such\nlitigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition,\noperating results and growth prospects. There can be no guarantee that the price of our common shares will remain at or rise above its current level or that future sales of our common\nshares will not be at prices lower than those initially distributed or sold to investors.\nFuture issuances of common shares or other equity securities, including as a result of an optional conversion of Series A Preferred Shares, or the potential for such issuances, may\nimpact the price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise capital through equity offerings. Shareholders may experience significant dilution as a result of any\nsuch issuances.\nToro has an authorized share capital of 3,900,000,000 common shares that it may issue without further shareholder approval. Our business strategy may require the issuance of a\nsubstantial amount of additional shares and in the year ended December 31, 2023, we issued 8,500,000 common shares to Pani Corp. (“Pani”), a company controlled by Toro’s Chairman\nand Chief Executive Officer, for gross proceeds of $19,465,0​ 00, less issuance costs of $817,764. Based on market conditions, we may also opportunistically seek to issue equity securities,\nincluding additional common shares. We cannot assure you at what price the offering of our shares in the future, if any, will be made but they may be offered and sold at a price\nsignificantly below the current trading price of our common shares or the acquisition price of common shares by shareholders and may be at a discount to the trading price of our\ncommon shares at the time of such sale. Purchasers of the common shares we sell, as well as our existing shareholders, will experience significant dilution if we sell shares at prices\nsignificantly below the price at which they invested.\n30\nTable of Contents\nFurther, our Series A Preferred Shares are convertible, in whole or in part, at their holder’s option, to common shares at any time and from time to time from and after the third\nanniversary of their issue date and prior to the seventh anniversary of such date. All 140,000 Series A Preferred Shares outstanding as of the date of this Annual Report are beneficially\nowned by Castor. Subject to certain adjustments, the “Conversion Price” for any conversion of the Series A Preferred Shares shall be the lower of (i) 150% of the volume weighted\naverage price (“VWAP”) of our common shares over the five consecutive trading day period commencing on and including the Distribution Date, and (ii) the VWAP of our common\nshares over the 10 consecutive trading day period expiring on the trading day immediately prior to the date of delivery of written notice of the conversion; provided, that, in no event\nshall the Conversion Price be less than $2.50. The number of common shares to be issued to a converting holder shall be equal to the quotient of (i) the aggregate stated amount of the\nSeries A Preferred Shares converted plus Accrued Dividends (but excluding any dividends declared but not yet paid) thereon on the date on which the conversion notice is delivered\ndivided by (ii) the Conversion Price. If converted by Castor, Castor will have registration rights in relation to the common shares issued upon conversion. See “Item 7. Major\nShareholders and Related Party Transactions—B. Related Party Transactions—Contribution and Spin-Off Distribution Agreement.” The issuance of additional common shares upon\nconversion of the Series A Preferred Shares could result in significant dilution to our shareholders at the time of conversion.\nIn addition, we may issue additional common shares or other equity securities of equal or senior rank in the future in connection with, among other things, our Equity Incentive\nPlan (under which a total of 1,240,000 restricted common have already been granted subject but remain unvested as of February 29, 2024), debt prepayments or future vessel acquisitions,\nwithout shareholder approval, in a number of circumstances. To the extent that we issue restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, options or warrants to purchase our common\nshares in the future and those stock appreciation rights, options or warrants are exercised or as the restricted stock units vest, our shareholders may experience further dilution. Holders\nof shares of our common shares have no preemptive rights that entitle such holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, such\nsales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our shareholders.\nOur issuance of additional common shares or other equity securities of equal or senior rank, or the perception that such issuances may occur, could have the following effects:\n• our existing shareholders’ proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease;\n• the earnings per share and the per share amount of cash available for dividends on our common shares (as and if declared) could decrease;\n• the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding common share could be diminished;\n• the market price of our common shares could decline; and\n• our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional securities at a time and price that we deem appropriate could be impaired.\nThe market price of our common shares could also decline due to sales, or the announcements of proposed sales, of a large number of common shares by our large shareholders\n(including sales of common shares issued upon conversion, if any, of the Series A Preferred Shares), or the perception that these sales could occur.\nWe are incorporated in the Marshall Islands, which does not have a well-developed body of corporate and case law.\nWe are organized in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which does not have a well-developed body of corporate or case law, and as a result, shareholders may have fewer\nrights and protections under Marshall Islands law than under a typical jurisdiction in the United States. Our corporate affairs are governed by our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws\nand by the Marshall Islands Business Corporations Act (the “BCA”). The provisions of the BCA resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the United States.\nHowever, there have been few judicial cases in the Marshall Islands interpreting the BCA. The rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under the laws of the Marshall Islands are\nnot as clearly established as the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in the United States. The rights of shareholders of\ncompanies incorporated in the Marshall Islands may differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in the United States. While the BCA provides that its provisions\nshall be applied and construed in a manner to make them uniform with the laws of the State of Delaware and other states with substantially similar legislative provisions, there have been\nfew, if any, court cases interpreting the BCA in the Marshall Islands and we cannot predict whether Marshall Islands courts would reach the same conclusions as U.S. courts. Thus, you\nmay have more difficulty in protecting your interests in the face of actions by our management, directors or controlling shareholders than shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a\nUnited States jurisdiction which has developed a relatively more substantial body of case law would.\n31\nTable of Contents\nThe Marshall Islands has no established bankruptcy act, and as a result, any bankruptcy action involving us would have to be initiated outside the Marshall Islands, and our\nshareholders may find it difficult or impossible to pursue their claims in such other jurisdictions.\nWe are incorporated in the Marshall Islands, and the majority of our officers and directors are non-U.S. residents. It may be difficult to serve legal process or enforce judgments\nagainst us, our directors or our management.\nWe are incorporated under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and substantially all of our assets are located outside of the United States. Our principal executive\noffice is located in Cyprus. In addition, the majority of our directors and officers are non-residents of the United States, and substantially all of their assets are located outside the United\nStates. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for you to bring an action against us or against these individuals in the United States if you believe that your rights have been\ninfringed under securities laws or otherwise. Even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind, the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands and of other jurisdictions may\nprevent or restrict you from enforcing a judgment against our assets or our directors and officers. Although you may bring an original action against us or our affiliates in the courts of\nthe Marshall Islands, and the courts of the Marshall Islands may impose civil liability, including monetary damages, against us or our affiliates for a cause of action arising under\nMarshall Islands law, it may be impracticable for you to do so.\nOur Bylaws contain exclusive forum provisions that may limit a shareholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable.\nOur Bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the High Court of the Republic of the Marshall Islands shall be the sole and\nexclusive forum for asserting any internal corporate claim, intra-corporate claim or claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine and that the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any action asserting a claim arising under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. If the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of New York does not have jurisdiction over the claims assigned to it by our exclusive forum provisions, any other federal district court of the United\nStates may hear such claims.\nWhile the validity of exclusive forum provisions has been upheld under the law of certain jurisdictions, uncertainty remains as to whether our exclusive forum provisions will be\nfully or partially recognized by all jurisdictions. If a court were to find either exclusive forum provision contained in our articles of association to be inapplicable or unenforceable (in\nwhole or in part) in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial\ncondition.\nThe exclusive forum provision in our Bylaws will not relieve us of our duties to comply with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and our\nshareholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations. In particular, Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction\nover all claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder, and Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent\njurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder.\nOur exclusive forum provision may limit a shareholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors or other employees or\nincrease the costs associated with bringing litigation against us or our directors, employees or officers, which may discourage lawsuits against such parties.\nWe are subject to certain anti-takeover provisions that could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition, or could make it difficult for our\nshareholders to replace or remove our current Board, and could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.\nSeveral provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws could make it difficult for our shareholders to change the composition of our Board in any one year, preventing\nthem from changing the composition of management. In addition, the same provisions may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that shareholders may consider\nfavorable. These provisions include:\n• authorizing our Board to issue “blank check” preferred shares without shareholder approval;\n• providing for a classified Board with staggered, three-year terms;\n• establishing certain advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board or for proposing matters that can be acted on by shareholders at shareholder\nmeetings;\n32\nTable of Contents\n• prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n• prohibiting any owner of 15% or more of our voting stock from engaging in a business combination with us within three years after the owner acquired such ownership,\nexcept under certain conditions;\n• limiting the persons who may call special meetings of shareholders; and\n• establishing supermajority voting provisions with respect to amendments to certain provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws.\nOn the Distribution Date, our Board declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a “Right”), for each outstanding common share and adopt a shareholder rights\nplan, as set forth in the Shareholder Protection Rights Agreement (the “Rights Agreement”) entered into between Toro and Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, Inc., as rights agent,\non such same date. Each Right allows its holder to purchase from Toro one common share (or one one-thousandth of a share of Series C Participating Preferred Shares), for the Exercise\nPrice of $22 once the Rights become exercisable. This portion of a Series C Participating Preferred Share will give the shareholder approximately the same dividend, voting and liquidation\nrights as would one common share. The Rights Agreement is intended to protect shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics. In general terms, it imposes a\nsignificant penalty upon any person or group that acquires 15% or more of our outstanding common shares without the approval of our Board. If a shareholder’s beneficial ownership of\nour common shares as of the time of the public announcement of the rights plan and associated dividend declaration is at or above the applicable threshold, that shareholder’s then-\nexisting ownership percentage would be grandfathered, but the rights would become exercisable if at any time after such announcement, the shareholder increases its ownership\npercentage by 1% or more. Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Petros Panagiotidis, and Mr. Panagiotidis’ controlled affiliates are exempt from these provisions. For a full\ndescription of the rights plan, see “Item 10. Additional Information—B. Shareholder Protection Rights Agreement.”\nThe Rights may have anti-takeover effects. The Rights will cause substantial dilution to any person or group that attempts to acquire us without the approval of our Board. As\na result, the overall effect of the Rights may be to render more difficult or discourage any attempt to acquire us. Because our Board can approve a redemption of the Rights for a\npermitted offer, the Rights should not interfere with a merger or other business combination approved by our Board.\nIn addition to the Rights above, we have issued 40,000 Series B Preferred Shares, representing 99.5% of the aggregate voting power of our total issued and outstanding share\ncapital, net of treasury shares, as of February 29, 2024 to an entity controlled by Mr. Panagiotidis. See “—Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who may be deemed to beneficially\nown, directly or indirectly, a majority of our outstanding common shares and 100% of our Series B Preferred Shares, has control over us” and “Item 10. Additional Information—B.\nMemorandum and Articles of Association.”\nIn addition, our future credit facilities may contain covenants prohibiting or limiting a change of control. See “—We expect that any new or amended credit facility we enter into\nwill contain restrictive covenants that we may not be able to comply with due to economic, financial or operational reasons and may limit our business and financing activities” for\nassociated risks.\nThe foregoing anti-takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public shareholders to benefit from a change in control and, as a result, may adversely affect\nthe market price of our common shares and your ability to realize any potential change of control premium.\nOur Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who may be deemed to beneficially own, directly or indirectly, a majority of our outstanding common shares and 100% of our Series B\nPreferred Shares, has control over us.\nOur Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Petros Panagiotidis, may be deemed to be the ultimate beneficial owner of 9,611,240 common shares representing 51.9% of the\n18,501,439 common shares outstanding, net of 476,970 treasury shares, as of February 29, 2024 and 40,000 shares of our Series B Preferred Shares outstanding as of the same date. The\nshares of Series B Preferred Shares each carry 100,000 votes. Together, such shares represent 51.7% of our total outstanding share capital, net of treasury shares and 99.8% of the\naggregate voting power of our total outstanding share capital, net of treasury shares, as of February 29, 2024 and Mr. Panagiotidis therefore has control over our actions.

Further, we are an “emerging growth company”, and we cannot be\ncertain if the reduced requirements applicable to emerging growth companies make our securities less attractive to investors\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the other rules and regulations of the SEC which create additional costs for us and will require the time\nand attention of management, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”). Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires any company subject\nto the reporting requirements of the U.S. securities laws to do a comprehensive evaluation of its and its consolidated subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting. To comply\nwith this statute, we are required to document and test our internal control procedures and our management is required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control over\nfinancial reporting. Such evaluations, as well as any proposed remedial measures, require time and resources. We may not be able to predict or estimate the amount of the additional\ncosts we may incur, the timing of such costs or the degree of impact that our management’s attention to these matters will have on our business. If our management cannot favorably\nassess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investor confidence in our financial results may weaken, and our stock price may suffer. Further, controls\npreviously evaluated as effective may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of\nits inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may also not prevent or detect misstatements.\nAs of February 29, 2024, we are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As an emerging growth\ncompany, we are not required to comply with, among other things, the auditor attestation requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Investors may find our securities less attractive\nbecause we rely on this provision. If investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and prices of such securities may\nbe more volatile.\nWe are a foreign private issuer and, as a result, are not subject to U.S. proxy rules and will be subject to Exchange Act reporting obligations that, to some extent, are more lenient\nand less frequent than those of a U.S. domestic public company.\nWe report under the Exchange Act as a non-U.S. company with foreign private issuer status. Because we qualify as a foreign private issuer under the Exchange Act, we are\nexempt from certain provisions of the Exchange Act that are applicable to U.S. domestic public companies, including (i) the sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of\nproxies, consents or authorizations in respect of a security registered under the Exchange Act, (ii) the sections of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their stock\nownership and trading activities and liability for insiders who profit from trades made in a short period of time, and (iii) the rules under the Exchange Act requiring the filing with the SEC\nof quarterly reports on Form 10-Q containing unaudited financial and other specified information, or current reports on Form 8-K, upon the occurrence of specified significant events. In\naddition, foreign private issuers are not required to file their annual report on Form 20-F until four months after the end of each financial year, while U.S. domestic issuers that are large\naccelerated filers are required to file their annual report on Form 10-K within 60 days after the end of each fiscal year. Foreign private issuers are also exempt from Regulation FD, aimed at\npreventing issuers from making selective disclosures of material information. As a result of the above, you may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies\nthat are not foreign private issuers or controlled companies.\nIn addition, as a foreign private issuer, we are also entitled to and do rely on exceptions from certain corporate governance requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nAs a result, you may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are not foreign private issuers.\nU.S. tax authorities could treat us as a “passive foreign investment company”, which could have adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. shareholders, particularly if\nwe continue to hold significant cash relative to the operating assets we own.\nA foreign corporation will be treated as a “passive foreign investment company” (a “PFIC”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes if either (1) at least 75% of its gross income for\nany taxable year consists of certain types of “passive income” or (2) at least 50% of the average value of the corporation’s assets produce or are held for the production of those types\nof “passive income.” For purposes of these tests, “passive income” includes dividends, interest, and gains from the sale or exchange of investment property and rents and royalties\nother than rents and royalties which are received from unrelated parties in connection with the active conduct of a trade or business. For purposes of these tests, income derived from\nthe performance of services does not constitute “passive income,” whereas rental income would generally constitute “passive income” to the extent not attributable to the active\nconduct of a trade or business. U.S. shareholders of a PFIC are subject to a disadvantageous U.S. federal income tax regime with respect to the income derived by the PFIC, the\ndistributions they receive from the PFIC and the gain, if any, they derive from the sale or other disposition of their shares in the PFIC.\n34\nTable of Contents\nWe do not believe that we will be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year. However, our status as a PFIC is determined on an annual basis and will depend upon the operations of\nour vessels and our other activities during each taxable year. In this regard, we intend to treat the gross income we derive or are deemed to derive from our time chartering, pool\narrangements and/or voyage chartering activities as services income, rather than rental income. Accordingly, we believe that our income from our chartering and/or pool activities does\nnot constitute “passive income,” and the assets that we own and operate in connection with the production of that income do not constitute passive assets.\nThere is, however, no direct legal authority under the PFIC rules addressing our method of operation, in particular, in the event that all our vessels are employed in pools.\nAccordingly, no assurance can be given that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), or a court of law will accept our position, and there is a risk that the IRS or a court of law\ncould determine that we are a PFIC. Moreover, no assurance can be given that we would not constitute a PFIC for any taxable year in which if we become unable to acquire vessels in a\ntimely fashion or if there were to be changes in the nature and extent of our operations.\nIn addition, for purposes of the PFIC “asset” test described above, cash and other current assets readily convertible into cash (“Cash Assets”) are considered to be assets that\nproduce passive income. As indicated in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, we hold significant Cash Assets relative to the operating\nassets we hold. Although we do not expect to be treated as a PFIC for our 2023 taxable year, we cannot predict whether our position in cash and other “passive” assets will cause us to\nbe treated as a PFIC in a future taxable year.\nIf the IRS were to find that we are or have been a PFIC for any taxable year, our U.S. shareholders would face adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences and information\nreporting obligations. Under the PFIC rules, unless those shareholders made an election available under the Internal Revenue Code (which election could itself have adverse\nconsequences for such shareholders, as discussed below under “Item 10. Additional Information—E. Taxation—U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations—Passive Foreign\nInvestment Company Status and Significant Tax Consequences”), such shareholders would be liable to pay U.S. federal income tax upon excess distributions and upon any gain from\nthe disposition of our common shares at the then prevailing income tax rates applicable to ordinary income plus interest as if the excess distribution or gain had been recognized ratably\nover the shareholder’s holding period of our common shares. Please see the section of this Annual Report entitled “Item 10. Additional Information—E. Taxation—U.S. Federal Income\nTax Considerations—Passive Foreign Investment Company Status and Significant Tax Consequences” for a more comprehensive discussion of the U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences to U.S. shareholders if we are treated as a PFIC.\nITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY\nA. History and Development of the Company\nSpin-Off from Castor\nToro was incorporated by Castor under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands on July 29, 2022 as Tankco Shipping Inc., to serve as the holding company of the Toro\nSubsidiaries in connection with the Spin-Off. On September 29, 2022, we were renamed Toro Corp. On November 15, 2022 and December 30, 2022, based on the recommendation of a\nspecial committee of independent disinterested directors of Castor (the “Special Committee”), the independent disinterested members of the board of directors of Castor approved the\nSpin-Off in the Castor Spin-Off Resolutions (as defined in “Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—B. Related Party Transactions”) in order for each of Toro,\nholding Castor’s tanker segments, and Castor, holding its dry bulk segment, to operate and pursue opportunities as a separate “pure play” company in the relevant shipping sector, to\nbe evaluated as such by the market and to enhance our and Castor’s financing and growth opportunities. The terms of the Spin-Off were negotiated and approved by the Special\nCommittee.\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, on March 7, 2023, Castor contributed to us the Toro Subsidiaries, in exchange for (i) all of our 9,461,009 common shares at the time, (ii) the issue\nof 140,000 Series A Preferred Shares to Castor, with a cumulative preferred distribution accruing initially at a rate of 1.00% per annum on the stated amount of $1,000 per share and a par\nvalue of $0.001 per share, all of which were retained by Castor after the Spin-Off, and (iii) the issue of 40,000 Series B Preferred Shares, each carrying 100,000 votes on all matters on\nwhich our shareholders are entitled to vote but no economic rights, to Pelagos, a company controlled by our and Castor’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, against payment of their\nnominal value of $0.001 per Series B Preferred Share. On March 7, 2023, Castor distributed all of our 9,461,009 common shares at the time on a pro rata basis to its holders of common\nstock. Our common shares commenced trading on March 7, 2023 on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “TORO”.\n35\nTable of Contents\nSubscription Agreement with Pani\nOn April 17, 2023, Toro entered into a subscription agreement with Pani, a company controlled by Toro’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. For a description of this and\nother recent equity transactions, please see “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—B. Liquidity and Capital Resources—Equity Transactions.”\nPurchase of Series D Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Shares of Castor\nOn August 7, 2023, we agreed to purchase 50,000 Castor Series D Preferred Shares for aggregate cash consideration of $50.0 million. For a description of this transaction, please\nsee “Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—B. Related Party Transactions— Purchase by the Company of 5.00% Series D Cumulative Perpetual Convertible\nPreferred Shares of Castor.”\nBusiness\nWe are an independent, growth-oriented shipping company that acquires, owns, charters and operates oceangoing tanker and LPG carrier vessels and provides worldwide\nenergy seaborne transportation services for crude oil, refined petroleum products and LPG. As of the date of this Annual Report, we primarily operate in the LPG sector and maintain a\nfleet of one Handysize tanker vessel and four LPG carrier vessels with an aggregate cargo carrying capacity of 0.1 million dwt and an average fleet age of 9.6 years. As of December 31,\n2023, our fleet comprised six vessels, made up of one Handysize tanker vessel, one Aframax/LR2 vessel and four LPG carrier vessels.\nOur commercial strategy primarily focuses on deploying our fleet under a mix of pools, voyage charters and time charters according to our assessment of market conditions. We\nadjust the mix of these charters to take advantage of the relatively stable cash flows and high utilization rates for our vessels associated with period time charters, to profit from attractive\ntrip charter rates during periods of strong charter market conditions associated with voyage charters or to take advantage of high utilization rates for our vessels along with exposure to\nattractive charter rates during periods of strong charter market conditions when employing our vessels in pools. As of the date of this Annual Report, the tanker vessel in our fleet was\nemployed in a pool and our four LPG carrier vessels were employed in period time charters. Such arrangements will be reevaluated by management on a periodic basis.\nWe intend to expand our fleet in the future and may acquire additional tankers and/or LPG carriers, including to replace existing vessels or vessels we have disposed of,\ndiversify our fleet, expand our activities and reduce the average age of our fleet, and potentially, if our Board so determines, acquire vessels in other sectors, based on, in each case, our\nassessment of market conditions and subject to the conditions set out in the Toro Spin-Off Resolutions. We intend to acquire additional vessels principally in the secondhand market,\nincluding acquisitions from third-parties, and we may also acquire additional vessels from related parties, provided that such related party acquisitions are negotiated and conducted on\nan arms-length basis. We may also enter into newbuilding contracts to the extent that we believe they present attractive opportunities. For an overview of our fleet, please see “—B.\nBusiness Overview—Our fleet.”\nOur principal executive office is at 223 Christodoulou Chatzipavlou Street, Hawaii Royal Gardens, 3036 Limassol, Cyprus. Our telephone number at that address is +357 25 357\n768. Our website is www.torocorp.com. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file\nelectronically with the SEC. The address of the SEC’s Internet site is www.sec.gov. None of the information contained on, or that can be accessed through, these websites is\nincorporated into or forms a part of this Annual Report.\nFleet Development and Vessel Capital Expenditures\nIn 2021, our fleet grew from zero vessels to nine vessels through the acquisition by Castor of nine tanker vessels, one of which was sold to a third-party on May 9, 2022 and\ndelivered to that party on July 15, 2022 prior to completion of the Spin-Off. In the second and third quarters of 2023, we acquired four LPG carriers comprising our newly established LPG\ncarrier segment. Between the second and fourth quarters of 2023, we completed the sales of six of our tanker vessels to third-parties due to attractive purchase terms offered by these\nbuyers. This included one of the two Handysize vessels then comprising our Handysize segment and all six of the seven Aframax/LR2 vessels then comprising our Aframax/LR2\nsegment. On January 24, 2024, we have completed the sale of the M/T Wonder Sirius, the sole remaining Aframax/LR2 tanker comprising our Aframax/LR2 segment. For further\ninformation on these vessel acquisitions and the financing transaction associated with certain of these vessel acquisitions, see “—B. Business Overview—Our fleet” and Notes 5, 6 and\n18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, all of our vessels are equipped with a ballast water treatment system (“BWTS”). During the period ended December 31, 2021 and the years\nended December 31, 2022 and 2023, we made capital expenditures of $1.2 million, $0.3 million and $0.8 million, respectively, for the installation of BWTS on our vessels.\n36\nTable of Contents\nB. Business Overview\nDuring the period ended December 31, 2021 and the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, we operated tanker vessels that engaged in the worldwide transportation of crude\noil and refined petroleum products using our Aframax/LR2 tankers, which transport crude oil, and Handysize tankers, which transport refined petroleum products and, from their first\nacquisition in the second quarter of 2023, we operated 5,000 cbm LPG carriers, which transport liquefied petroleum gas. As a result of the different characteristics of such LPG carriers in\nrelation to our other two operating segments, we determined that, with effect from the second quarter of 2023, we operated in three reportable segments: (i) Aframax/LR2 tanker segment,\n(ii) Handysize tanker segment and (iii) LPG carrier segment. The reportable segments reflect our internal organization and the way our chief operating decision maker reviews the\noperating results and allocates capital within the Company. Further, the transport of crude oil (carried by Aframax/LR2 tankers), refined petroleum products (carried by Handysize tanker\nvessels) and LPG (carried by LPG carriers) has different characteristics. In addition, the nature of trade, trading routes, charterers and cargo handling of LPG, refined petroleum products\nand crude oil differs.\nWe do not disclose geographic information relating to our segments. When we charter a vessel to a charterer, the charterer is free, subject to certain exemptions, to trade the\nvessel worldwide and, as a result, the disclosure of geographic information is impracticable. For further information, see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included\nelsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOur Fleet\nThe following table summarizes key information about our fleet as of February 29, 2024:\nEstimated Estimated\nVessel Capacity Year Country of Type of Gross Charter Earliest Charter Latest Charter\nName (dwt) Built Construction Charter Rate ($/day) Expiration Expiration\nHandysize Segment\nM/T Wonder\nMimosa 36,718 2006 S.

With regard to our LPG carrier fleet, which comprised four vessels as of\nFebruary 29, 2024, we intend mainly to employ our LPG carrier vessels in period time charter contracts, while evaluating the conditions and taking advantage of some spot voyages upon\nredelivery from period time charters if spot market conditions are favorable.\n37\nTable of Contents\nCharter rates in the spot market are volatile and sometimes fluctuate on a seasonal and year-to-year basis. Fluctuations derive from imbalances in the availability of cargoes for\nshipment and the number of vessels available at any given time to transport these cargoes, as well as supply and demand for crude oil and oil products carried by ocean-going vessels\ninternationally. Vessels operating in the spot market generate revenue that is less predictable than those under period time charters but may enable us to capture increased profit margins\nduring periods of improvements in the tanker shipping market. Industry downturns relating to the products that our vessels transport could result in a reduction in profit margins and\nlead to losses. Based on market conditions, we may opportunistically look to employ more of our vessels in the spot market under time charter trip contracts, voyage charter contracts\nand/or pooling arrangements.\nVoyage charters involve a charterer engaging a vessel for a particular journey. A voyage contract is made for the use of a vessel, for which we are paid freight (a fixed amount\nper ton of cargo carried or a lump sum amount) on the basis of transporting cargo from a loading port to a discharge port. Depending on charterparty terms, freight can be fully prepaid,\nor be paid upon reaching the discharging destination upon delivery of the cargo, at the discharging destination but before discharging, or during a ship’s voyage. Revenues from\nvoyage charters are typically tied to prevailing market rates and may therefore be more volatile than rates from other charters, such as time charters.\nTime charters involve a charterer engaging a vessel for a set period of time. Time charter agreements may have extension options ranging from months to, sometimes, years and\nare therefore viewed as providing more predictable cash flows over the period of the engagement than may otherwise be attainable from other charter arrangements. The time charter\nparty generally provides, among others, typical warranties regarding the speed and the performance of the vessel as well as owner protective restrictions such that the vessel is sent\nonly to safe ports by the charterer, subject always to compliance with applicable sanction laws and war risks, and carry only lawful and non-hazardous cargo. We typically enter into time\ncharters ranging from one month to 12 months and, in isolated cases, on longer terms depending on market conditions. Time charter agreements may have extension options that range\nover certain time periods, which are usually periods of months. The charterer has the full discretion over the ports visited, shipping routes and vessel speed, subject to the owner’s\nprotective restrictions set forth in the agreed charterparty’s terms. Under our time charter agreements, whereby our vessels are utilized by a charterer for a set duration of time, the\ncharterer pays a fixed or floating daily hire rate and other compensation costs related to the contracts.\nA pool consists of a group of vessels of similar types and sizes provided by various owners for the purpose of enabling a centralized pool operator to engage those vessels\ncommercially. Pools employ experienced commercial charterers and operators who have close working relationships with customers and brokers, while technical management is separate\nfrom pool operations. Their main objective is to enter into arrangements for the employment and operation of the pool vessels, so as to secure for the pool participants the highest\ncommercially available earnings per vessel on the basis of pooling the net revenues of the pool vessels and dividing it between the pool participants based on the terms of the pool\nagreement. Pool vessels are marketed as a single group of vessels, primarily in the spot market but also from time to time for time charters, and all revenues earned from the operation of\nthe pool vessels are aggregated together and, after deduction of all costs involved in the operation of the pool, shared between the pool participants based on an agreed key. The size\nand scope of pools enable them to achieve larger economies of scale and to have better negotiating power with all procurement vendors (e.g., bunker suppliers, port agents, towing\ncompanies, etc.) and as a result they are able to reduce their costs for such items. They also achieve geographic diversification by deploying their pool vessels in both Atlantic and\nPacific markets while arbitraging from spread opportunities. The diversification in revenue streams due to typically broader shipping capabilities of pool fleet vessels and/or more\naccessible customer base, alongside payments to pool participants on a set schedule, can stabilize revenues for pool participants, though this may be offset by volatility in spot rates.\nFurthermore, due to their large fleets, pools can make vessels available for prompt cargoes (which are usually priced at higher than market rates) on short notice and thus they are able to\ncapture the premium of such prompt cargoes. Pools also have higher market visibility, which provides them with opportunities not available to smaller tanker market participants. By\nbeing able to reduce costs and optimize revenues, pools aim to outperform the industry benchmark indices by utilizing their size and sophistication and improving utilization rates for\nparticipating vessels through various methods, including securing backhaul voyages and contracts of affreightment.\nFor further information on our charters and charter terms, please refer to “Item 5. Operation and Financial Results Review—A. Operating Results—Hire Rates and the Cyclical\nNature of the Industry.”\n38\nTable of Contents\nManagement of our Business\nOur vessels are commercially and technically managed by Castor Ships, a company controlled by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Petros Panagiotidis. Castor Ships\nmanages our business overall and provides us with crew management, technical management, operational employment management, insurance management, provisioning, bunkering,\ncommercial, chartering and administrative services, including, but not limited to, securing employment for our fleet, arranging and supervising the vessels’ commercial operations,\nhandling all of the Company’s vessel sale and purchase transactions, undertaking related shipping projects, management advisory and support services, accounting and audit support\nservices, as well as other associated services requested from time to time by us and our ship-owning subsidiaries. Castor Ships may choose to subcontract these services to other\nparties at its discretion. As of the date of this Annual Report, Castor Ships has subcontracted the technical management of all of our vessels to a third-party ship-management company,\nexcept for the M/T Wonder Mimosa, which Castor Ships has directly provided technical management services to since June 7, 2023. Castor Ships pays, at its own expense, these\ntechnical management companies a fee for the services it has subcontracted to them, without burdening the Company with any additional cost.\nIn exchange for the above management services, we and our subsidiaries pay Castor Ships (i) following an inflation-based adjustment effective July 1, 2023, a (A) flat quarterly\nmanagement fee in the amount of $0.8 million for the management and administration of our business and (B) daily fee of $1,039 per vessel for the provision of ship management services\nunder separate ship management agreements entered into by our shipowning subsidiaries, (ii) a commission of 1.25% on all gross income received from the operation of our vessels and\n(iii) a commission of 1% on each consummated sale and purchase transaction.\nFor further information, see “Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—B. Related Party Transactions.”\nEnvironmental and Other Regulations in the Shipping Industry\nGovernment regulations and laws significantly affect the ownership and operation of our fleet. We are subject to international conventions and treaties, regional, national, state\nand local laws and regulations in force in the countries in which our vessels may operate or are registered relating to safety, health and environmental protection including the storage,\nhandling, emission, transportation and discharge of hazardous and non-hazardous materials, and the remediation of contamination and liability for damage to natural resources.\nCompliance with such international conventions, laws, regulations, insurance and other requirements entails significant expense, including for vessel modifications and the\nimplementation of certain operating procedures.\nA variety of government and private entities subject our vessels to both scheduled and unscheduled inspections. These entities include the local port authorities (applicable\nnational authorities such as the United States Coast Guard (“USCG”), harbor master or equivalent), classification societies, flag state administrations (countries of registry) and\ncharterers, particularly terminal operators. Certain of these entities require us to obtain permits, licenses, certificates and other authorizations for the operation of our vessels. Failure to\nmaintain necessary permits, certificates and approvals could require us to incur substantial costs or result in the temporary suspension of the operation of our vessels.\nIncreasing environmental concerns have created a demand for vessels that conform to stricter environmental standards. We are required to maintain operating standards for our\nvessels that emphasize operational safety, quality maintenance, continuous training of our officers and crews and compliance with United States, European Union and international\nregulations. We believe that the operation of our vessels is in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that our vessels have all material permits,\nlicenses, certificates or other authorizations necessary for the conduct of our operations. However, because such laws and regulations frequently change and may impose increasingly\nstricter requirements, we cannot predict the ultimate cost of complying with these requirements, or the impact of these requirements on the resale value or useful lives of our vessels. In\naddition, a serious marine incident that causes significant adverse environmental impact could result in additional legislation or regulation that could have a material adverse effect on\nour business, financial condition and operating results.\nInternational Maritime Organization\nThe International Maritime Organization, the United Nations agency for maritime safety and the prevention of pollution by vessels (the “IMO”), has adopted the International\nConvention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto, collectively referred to as MARPOL 73/78 and herein as “MARPOL”,\nthe International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea of 1974 (“SOLAS Convention”), and the International Convention on Load Lines of 1966. MARPOL establishes environmental\nstandards relating to oil leakage or spilling, garbage management, sewage, air emissions, handling and disposal of noxious liquids and handling of harmful substances in packaged forms.\nMARPOL is applicable to dry bulk, tanker, containers, LPG and LNG carriers, among other vessels, and includes six Annexes, each of which regulates a different source of pollution.\nAnnex I relates to operational or accidental oil leakage or spilling; Annexes II and III relate to harmful substances carried in bulk in liquid or in packaged form, respectively; Annexes IV\nand V relate to sewage and garbage management, respectively. Annex VI, which relates to air emissions, was separately adopted by the IMO in September of 1997. New emissions\nstandards, titled IMO-2020, took effect on January 1, 2020.\n39\nTable of Contents\nAir Emissions\nIn September 1997, the IMO adopted Annex VI to MARPOL to address air emissions from vessels. Effective May 2005, Annex VI sets limits on sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and\nother emissions from all commercial vessel exhausts and prohibits “deliberate emissions” of ozone-depleting substances (such as halons and chlorofluorocarbons), emissions of volatile\ncompounds from cargo tanks, and the shipboard incineration of specific substances. Annex VI also includes a global cap on the sulfur content of fuel oil and allows for special emission\ncontrol areas to be established with more stringent limits on sulfur emissions, as explained below. Emissions of “volatile organic compounds” from certain tankers and shipboard\nincineration (from incinerators installed after January 1, 2000) of certain substances (such as polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs) are also prohibited. We believe that our vessels are\ncurrently compliant in all material respects with these requirements.\nThe Marine Environment Protection Committee, or “MEPC,” adopted amendments to Annex VI regarding emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, particulate matter and\nozone depleting substances, which entered into force on July 1, 2010. The amended Annex VI seeks to further reduce air pollution by, among other things, implementing a progressive\nreduction of the amount of sulfur contained in any fuel oil used on board ships. On October 27, 2016, at its seventieth session, the MEPC agreed to implement a global 0.5% m/m sulfur\noxide emissions limit (reduced from 3.50%) starting from January 1, 2020. This limitation can be met by using low-sulfur compliant fuel oil, alternative fuels, or certain exhaust gas cleaning\nsystems. Ships are now required to obtain bunker delivery notes and International Air Pollution Prevention Certificates from their flag states that specify sulfur content. Additionally, at\nMEPC 73, amendments to Annex VI to prohibit the carriage of bunkers above 0.5% sulfur on ships not equipped with exhaust gas cleaning systems were adopted and took effect on\nMarch 1, 2020. These regulations subject ocean-going vessels to stringent emissions controls and may cause us to incur substantial costs. As of the date of this Annual Report, our\nvessels are not equipped with scrubbers and we have transitioned to burning IMO compliant fuels.\nSulfur content standards are even stricter within certain “Emission Control Areas”, or (“ECAs”). As of January 1, 2015, ships operating within an ECA were not permitted to use\nfuel with sulfur content in excess of 0.1% m/m. Amended Annex VI establishes procedures for designating new ECAs. Currently, the IMO has designated four ECAs, including specified\nportions of the Baltic Sea area, North Sea area, North American area and United States Caribbean area. Ocean-going vessels in these areas are subject to more stringent emission\ncontrols and may cause us to incur additional costs. Other areas in China are subject to local regulations that impose stricter emission controls. If other ECAs are approved by the IMO,\nor other new or more stringent requirements relating to emissions from marine diesel engines or port operations by vessels are adopted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\n(“EPA”) or the other jurisdictions where we operate, compliance with these regulations could entail significant capital expenditures or otherwise increase the costs of our operations.\nAmended Annex VI also establishes new tiers of stringent nitrogen oxide emissions standards for marine diesel engines, depending on their date of installation. At the MEPC\nmeeting held from March to April 2014, amendments to Annex VI were adopted which address the date on which Tier III Nitrogen Oxide (“NOx”) standards in ECAs will go into effect.\nUnder the amendments, Tier III NOx standards apply to ships that operate in the North American and U.S. Caribbean Sea ECAs designed for the control of NOx produced by vessels\nwith a marine diesel engine installed and constructed on or after January 1, 2016. Tier III requirements could apply to areas that will be designated for Tier III NOx in the future. Currently,\nas four of the five vessels in our current fleet were built prior to 2016, they are not affected by Tier III requirements from an operational perspective. The LPG Dream Terrax was built after\nJanuary 1, 2016 but has not complied with Tier III requirements since the date of its construction and therefore is not trading and cannot be trading in USA. Our LPG carrier vessels are\nalso subject to and currently in compliance with Tier II NOx, which regulates nitrogen dioxide emissions from vessels built on or after January 1, 2011, while our Handysize vessel is\nsubject to and currently in compliance with Tier I NOx requirements. However, we may acquire additional vessels that are subject to Tier II or Tier III NOx in the future and/or additional\ntrading restrictions could be imposed upon vessels that are currently in compliance with Tier I or II NOx standards, each of which may cause us to incur additional capital expenses\nand/or other compliance costs.\nAt MEPC 70 and MEPC 71, the MEPC approved the North Sea and Baltic Sea as ECAs for nitrogen oxide for ships built on or after January 1, 2021. The EPA promulgated\nequivalent (and in some respects stricter) emissions standards in 2010. As determined at the MEPC 70, the new Regulation 22A of MARPOL Annex VI became effective as of March 1,\n2018, and requires ships above 5,000 gross tonnage to collect and report annual data on fuel oil consumption to an IMO database, with the first year of data collection having\ncommenced on January 1, 2019. The IMO intends to use such data as the first step in its roadmap for developing its strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships, as\ndiscussed further below. The 2023 IMO GHG Strategy seeks a reduction in carbon intensity of international shipping as an average across international shipping, by at least 40% by\n2030. Related measures are discussed further below.\n40\nTable of Contents\nAs of January 1, 2013, MARPOL made mandatory certain measures relating to energy efficiency for ships. All ships are now required to develop and implement Ship Energy\nEfficiency Management Plans (“SEEMPS”), and new ships must be designed in compliance with minimum energy efficiency levels per capacity mile as defined by the Energy Efficiency\nDesign Index (“EEDI”). Under these measures, by 2025, all new ships built will be 30% more energy efficient than those built in 2014. Additionally, MEPC 75 adopted amendments to\nMARPOL Annex VI which brings forward the effective date of the EEDI’s “phase 3” requirements from January 1, 2025 to April 1, 2022 for several ship types, including gas carriers,\ngeneral cargo ships, and LNG carriers. This may require us to incur additional operating or other costs for those vessels built after January 1, 2013. Further, MEPC 75 approved draft\namendments requiring that, on or before January 1, 2023, all ships above 400 gross tonnage must have an approved SEEMP on board. For ships above 5,000 gross tonnage, the SEEMP\nneeds to include certain mandatory content.\nIn addition to the recently implemented emission control regulations, the IMO has been devising strategies to reduce greenhouse gases and carbon emissions from ships.\nAccording to its latest announcement, IMO plans to initiate measures to reduce carbon intensity by at least 40% by 2030 and 70% by 2050 from the levels in 2008. It also plans to\nintroduce measures to reduce GHG emissions by 50% by 2050 from the 2008 levels. These are likely to be achieved by setting energy efficiency requirements and encouraging ship\nowners to use alternative fuels such as biofuels, methanol, LNG, LPG and electro-/synthetic fuels such as hydrogen or ammonia and may also include limiting the speed of the ships.\nHowever, there is still uncertainty regarding the exact measures that the IMO will undertake to achieve these targets. IMO-related uncertainty is also a factor discouraging ship owners\nfrom ordering newbuild vessels, as these vessels may have high future environmental compliance costs with untested technology.\nIn June 2021, IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (“MEPC”) adopted amendments to MARPOL Annex VI that will require ships to reduce their greenhouse gas\nemissions. These amendments combine technical and operational approaches to improve the energy efficiency of ships, also providing important building blocks for future GHG\nreduction measures. The new measures require the IMO to review the effectiveness of the implementation of the Carbon Intensity Indicator (“CII”) and Energy Efficiency Existing Ship\nIndex (“EEXI”) requirements, by January 1, 2026 at the latest. EEXI is a technical measure and will apply to ships above 400 GT. It indicates the energy efficiency of the ship compared to\na baseline and is based on a required reduction factor (expressed as a percentage relative to the EEDI baseline). On the other hand, CII is an operational measure which specifies carbon\nintensity reduction requirements for vessels with 5,000 GT and above. The CII determines the annual reduction factor needed to ensure continuous improvement of the ship’s\noperational carbon intensity within a specific rating level. The operational carbon intensity rating would be given on a scale of A, B, C, D or E indicating a major superior, minor superior,\nmoderate, minor inferior, or inferior performance level, respectively. The performance level would be recorded in the ship’s SEEMP. A ship rated E for three consecutive years would have\nto submit a corrective action plan to show how the required index (D or above) would be achieved. Further, the European Union has endorsed a binding target of at least 55% domestic\nreduction in economy wide GHG reduction by 2030 compared to 1990. The amendments to MARPOL Annex VI (adopted in a consolidated revised Annex VI) entered into force on\nNovember 1, 2022, with the requirements for EEXI and CII certification coming into effect from January 1, 2023. This means that the first annual reporting on carbon intensity will be\ncompleted for 2023, with the first rating given in 2024. We are also required to comply with requirements relating to new European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (“EU ETS”)\nregulations for carbon emissions for voyages of vessels above 5000 GT departing from or arriving to ports in the European Union phased in from the beginning of 2024, with an\nimplementation scheme of 40% of emissions, followed by 70% of emissions in 2025 and ending in 2026 with 100% of the emissions produced by these voyages.\nWe may incur costs to comply with these revised standards including the introduction of new emissions software platform applications which will enable continuous\nmonitoring of CIIs as well as automatic generation of CII reports, amendment of SEEMP part II plans and adoption and implementation of ISO 500001 procedures. Additional or new\nconventions, laws and regulations may be adopted that could require the installation of expensive emission control systems and could adversely affect our business, cash flows,\nfinancial condition and operating results.\nSafety Management System Requirements\nThe SOLAS Convention was amended to address the safe manning of vessels and emergency training drills. The Convention of Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims (the\n“LLMC”) sets limitations of liability for a loss of life or personal injury claim, or a property claim against ship owners. We believe that our vessels are in substantial compliance with\nSOLAS and LLMC standards.\nUnder Chapter IX of the SOLAS Convention, or the International Safety Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (the “ISM Code”), our\noperations are also subject to environmental standards and requirements. The ISM Code requires the party with operational control of a vessel to develop an extensive safety\nmanagement system that includes, among other things, the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy, as well as a cybersecurity risk policy, setting forth instructions and\nprocedures for operating its vessels safely and describing procedures for responding to emergencies. We rely upon the safety management system that we and our technical\nmanagement team have developed for compliance with the ISM Code. The failure of a vessel owner or bareboat charterer to comply with the ISM Code may subject such party to\nincreased liability, decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports.\n41\nTable of Contents\nThe ISM Code requires that vessel operators obtain a safety management certificate for each vessel they operate. This certificate evidences compliance by a vessel’s\nmanagement with the ISM Code requirements for a safety management system. No vessel can obtain a safety management certificate unless its manager has been awarded a document of\ncompliance, issued by each flag state, under the ISM Code. We have obtained applicable documents of compliance for our offices and safety management certificates for our vessels for\nwhich the certificates are required by the IMO. The document of compliance and safety management certificate are renewed as required.\nRegulation II-1/3-10 of the SOLAS Convention on goal-based ship construction standards for oil tankers stipulates that ships over 150 meters in length must have adequate\nstrength, integrity and stability to minimize risk of loss or pollution.\nThe IMO has also adopted the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (“STCW”). As of February 2017, all seafarers\nare required to meet the STCW standards and be in possession of a valid STCW certificate. Flag states that have ratified SOLAS and STCW generally authorize the classification\nsocieties to undertake surveys to confirm compliance on their behalf.\nThe IMO’s Maritime Safety Committee and MEPC, respectively, each adopted relevant parts of the International Code for Ships Operating in Polar Water (the “Polar Code”).\nThe Polar Code, which entered into force on January 1, 2017, covers design, construction, equipment, operational, training, search and rescue as well as environmental protection matters\nrelevant to ships operating in the waters surrounding the two poles. It also includes mandatory measures regarding safety and pollution prevention as well as recommended provisions.\nThe Polar Code applies to new ships constructed after January 1, 2017, and from January 1, 2018, ships constructed before January 1, 2017 are required to meet the relevant requirements\nby the earlier of their first intermediate or renewal survey.\nFurthermore, recent action by the IMO’s Maritime Safety Committee and United States agencies indicates that cybersecurity regulations for the maritime industry are likely to be\nfurther developed in the near future in an attempt to combat cybersecurity threats. Companies are required from January 2021 to develop additional procedures for monitoring\ncybersecurity in addition to those required by the IMO, which could require additional expenses and/or capital expenditures.\nFuel Regulations in Arctic Waters\nMEPC 76 adopted amendments to MARPOL Annex I (addition of a new regulation 43A) to introduce a prohibition on the use and carriage for use as fuel of heavy fuel oil (HFO)\nby ships in Arctic waters on and after July 1, 2024. The prohibition will cover the use and carriage for use as fuel of oils having a density at 15°C higher than 900 kg/m3 or a kinematic\nviscosity at 50°C higher than 180 mm2/s. Ships engaged in securing the safety of ships, or in search and rescue operations, and ships dedicated to oil spill preparedness and response\nare exempt. Ships which meet certain construction standards with regard to oil fuel tank protection would need to comply on and after July 1, 2029.\nPollution Control and Liability Requirements\nThe IMO has negotiated international conventions that impose liability for pollution in international waters and the territorial waters of the signatories to such conventions. For\nexample, the IMO adopted an International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments (the “BWM Convention”) in 2004. The BWM\nConvention entered into force on September 8, 2017. The BWM Convention requires ships to manage their ballast water to remove, render harmless, or avoid the uptake or discharge of\nnew or invasive aquatic organisms and pathogens within ballast water and sediments. The BWM Convention’s implementing regulations call for a phased introduction of mandatory\nballast water exchange requirements, to be replaced in time with mandatory concentration limits, and require all ships to carry a ballast water record book and an international ballast\nwater management certificate.\nOn December 4, 2013, the IMO Assembly passed a resolution revising the application dates of the BWM Convention so that the dates are triggered by the entry into force date\nand not the dates originally in the BWM Convention. This, in effect, makes all vessels delivered before the entry into force date “existing vessels” and allows for the installation of\nballast water management systems on such vessels at the first International Oil Pollution Prevention (“IOPP”) renewal survey following entry into force of the convention. The MEPC\nadopted updated guidelines for approval of ballast water management systems (G8) at MEPC 70. At MEPC 71, amendments were introduced to extend the date existing vessels are\nsubject to certain ballast water standards. Those changes were adopted at MEPC 72. Ships over 400 gross tons generally must comply with a “D-1 standard,” requiring the exchange of\nballast water only in open seas and away from coastal waters. The “D-2 standard” specifies the maximum amount of viable organisms allowed to be discharged, and compliance dates\nvary depending on the IOPP renewal dates. Depending on the date of the IOPP renewal survey, existing vessels must comply with the D-2 standard on or after September 8, 2019. For\nmost ships, compliance with the D-2 standard will involve installing onboard systems to treat ballast water and eliminate unwanted organisms. Ballast water management systems, which\ninclude systems that make use of chemical, biocides, organisms or biological mechanisms, or which alter the chemical or physical characteristics of the ballast water, must be approved in\naccordance with IMO Guidelines (Regulation D-3). As of October 13, 2019, MEPC 72’s amendments to the BWM Convention took effect, making the Code for Approval of Ballast Water\nManagement Systems, which governs assessment of ballast water management systems, mandatory rather than permissive, and formalized an implementation schedule for the D-2\nstandard. Under these amendments, all ships must meet the D-2 standard by September 8, 2024. Significant costs may be incurred to comply with these regulations. Additionally, in\nNovember 2020, MEPC 75 adopted amendments to the BWM Convention which would require a commissioning test of the ballast water management system for the initial survey or\nwhen performing an additional survey for retrofits. This analysis will not apply to ships that already have an installed BWM system certified under the BWM Convention. These\namendments entered into force on June 1, 2022. To date we have made $2.3 million in capital expenditures relating to the installation of BWTS on our vessels. For further information on\nthese installations, see “—A. History and Development of the Company—Fleet Development and Vessel Capital Expenditures.”\n42\nTable of Contents\nMany countries already regulate the discharge of ballast water carried by vessels from country to country to prevent the introduction of invasive and harmful species via such\ndischarges. The U.S., for example, requires vessels entering its waters from another country to conduct mid-ocean ballast exchange, or undertake some alternate measure, and to comply\nwith certain reporting requirements. Ballast water compliance requirements could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe IMO also adopted the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage (the “Bunker Convention”) to impose strict liability on ship owners\n(including the registered owner, bareboat charterer, manager or operator) for pollution damage in jurisdictional waters of ratifying states caused by discharges of bunker fuel. The Bunker\nConvention requires registered owners of ships over 1,000 gross tons to maintain insurance for pollution damage in an amount equal to the limits of liability under the applicable national\nor international limitation regime (but not exceeding the amount calculated in accordance with the LLMC). With respect to non-ratifying states, liability for spills or releases of oil carried\nas fuel in ships’ bunkers typically is determined by the national or other domestic laws in the jurisdiction where the events or damages occur.\nShips are required to maintain a certificate attesting that they maintain adequate insurance to cover an incident. In jurisdictions such as the United States where the Bunker\nConvention has not been adopted, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, along with various legislative schemes and common law standards of conduct govern, and liability is imposed either on\nthe basis of fault or on a strict-liability basis.\nAnti-Fouling Requirements\nIn 2001, the IMO adopted the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-fouling Systems on Ships (the “Anti-fouling Convention”). The Anti-fouling\nConvention, which entered into force on September 17, 2008, prohibits the use of organotin compound coatings to prevent the attachment of mollusks and other sea life to the hulls of\nvessels. Vessels of over 400 gross tons engaged in international voyages are also required to undergo an initial survey before the vessel is put into service or before an International\nAnti-fouling System Certificate is issued for the first time; and subsequent surveys when the anti-fouling systems are altered or replaced.\nIn June 2021, MEPC 76 adopted amendments to the Anti-fouling Convention to prohibit the use of biocide cybutryne contained in anti-fouling systems, which would apply to\nships from January 1, 2023, or, for ships already bearing such an anti-fouling system, at the next scheduled renewal of the system after that date, but no later than 60 months following\nthe last application to the ship of such a system, as studies have proven that the substance is harmful to a variety of marine organisms.\nWe have obtained Anti-fouling System Certificates for all of our vessels that are subject to the Anti-fouling Convention.\nCompliance Enforcement\nNoncompliance with the ISM Code or other IMO regulations may subject the ship owner or bareboat charterer to increased liability, may lead to decreases in available insurance\ncoverage for affected vessels and may result in the denial of access to, or detention in, some ports. The USCG and European Union authorities have indicated that vessels not in\ncompliance with the ISM Code by applicable deadlines will be prohibited from trading in U.S. and European Union ports, respectively. As of the date of this Annual Report, our vessels\nare ISM Code certified through their respective third-party managers. Castor Ships has obtained the interim documents of compliance in order to operate the vessels in accordance with\nthe ISM Code and all other international and regional requirements that are applicable to our vessels. However, there can be no assurance that such certificates will be maintained in the\nfuture. The IMO continues to review and introduce new regulations. It is impossible to predict what additional regulations, if any, may be passed by the IMO and what effect, if any,\nsuch regulations might have on our operations.\nUnited States Regulations\nThe U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act\nThe U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) established an extensive regulatory and liability regime for the protection and cleanup of the environment from oil spills. OPA affects\nall “owners and operators” whose vessels trade or operate within the U.S., its territories and possessions or whose vessels operate in U.S. waters, which includes the U.S.’s territorial sea\nand its 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone around the U.S. The U.S. has also enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”),\nwhich applies to the discharge of hazardous substances other than oil, except in limited circumstances, whether on land or at sea. OPA and CERCLA both define “owner and operator” in\nthe case of a vessel as any person owning, operating or chartering by demise, the vessel. Both OPA and CERCLA impact our operations.\n43\nTable of Contents\nUnder OPA, vessel owners and operators are “responsible parties” and are jointly, severally and strictly liable (unless the spill results solely from the act or omission of a third\nparty, an act of God or an act of war) for all containment and clean-up costs and other damages arising from discharges or threatened discharges of oil from their vessels, including\nbunkers (fuel). OPA defines these other damages broadly to include:\n(i) injury to, destruction or loss of, or loss of use of, natural resources and related assessment costs;\n(ii) injury to, or economic losses resulting from, the destruction of real and personal property;\n(iii) loss of subsistence use of natural resources that are injured, destroyed or lost;\n(iv) net loss of taxes, royalties, rents, fees or net profit revenues resulting from injury, destruction or loss of real or personal property, or natural resources;\n(v) lost profits or impairment of earning capacity due to injury, destruction or loss of real or personal property or natural resources; and\n(vi) net cost of increased or additional public services necessitated by removal activities following a discharge of oil, such as protection from fire, safety or health hazards, and\nloss of subsistence use of natural resources.\nOPA contains statutory caps on liability and damages but such caps do not apply to direct clean-up costs. Effective December 12, 2019, the USCG adjusted the limits of OPA\nliability for non-tank vessels, edible oil tank vessels, and any oil spill response vessels, to the greater of $1,200 per gross ton or $997,100 (subject to periodic adjustment for inflation).\nHowever, these limits of liability do not apply if an incident was proximately caused by the violation of an applicable U.S. federal safety, construction or operating regulation by a\nresponsible party (or its agent, employee or a person acting pursuant to a contractual relationship), or a responsible party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. The limitation on\nliability similarly does not apply if the responsible party fails or refuses to (i) report the incident as required by law where the responsible party knows or has reason to know of the\nincident; (ii) reasonably cooperate and assist as requested in connection with oil removal activities; or (iii) without sufficient cause, comply with an order issued under the Federal Water\nPollution Act (Section 311 (c), (e)) or the Intervention on the High Seas Act.\nCERCLA contains a similar liability regime whereby owners and operators of vessels are liable for cleanup, removal and remedial costs, as well as damages for injury to, or\ndestruction or loss of, natural resources, including the reasonable costs associated with assessing the same, and health assessments or health effects studies. There is no liability if the\ndischarge of a hazardous substance results solely from the act or omission of a third party, an act of God or an act of war. Liability under CERCLA is limited to the greater of $300 per\ngross ton or $5.0 million for vessels carrying a hazardous substance as cargo and the greater of $300 per gross ton or $500,000 for any other vessel. However, these limits do not apply\n(rendering the responsible person liable for the total cost of response and damages) if the release or threat of release of a hazardous substance resulted from willful misconduct or\nnegligence, or the primary cause of the release was a violation of applicable safety, construction or operating standards or regulations. The limitation on liability also does not apply if\nthe responsible person fails or refused to provide all reasonable cooperation and assistance as requested in connection with response activities where the vessel is subject to OPA.\nOPA and CERCLA each preserve the right to recover damages under existing law, including maritime tort law. OPA and CERCLA both require owners and operators of vessels to\nestablish and maintain with the USCG evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to meet the maximum amount of liability to which the particular responsible person may be subject.\nVessel owners and operators may satisfy their financial responsibility obligations by providing a proof of insurance, a surety bond, qualification as a self-insurer or a guarantee. We\ncomply and plan to be in compliance going forward with the USCG’s financial responsibility regulations by providing applicable certificates of financial responsibility.\nThe 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico resulted in additional regulatory initiatives or statutes, including higher liability caps under OPA, new regulations\nregarding offshore oil and gas drilling, and a pilot inspection program for offshore facilities. Several of these initiatives and regulations have been or may be revised. For example, the\nU.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement’s (“BSEE”) revised Production Safety Systems Rule (“PSSR”), effective December 27, 2018, modified and relaxed certain\nenvironmental and safety protections under the 2016 PSSR. Additionally, the BSEE amended the Well Control Rule, effective July 15, 2019, which rolled back certain reforms regarding the\nsafety of drilling operations. In 2023, the BSSE issued a final Well Control Rule which revises or rescinds certain modifications that were made in the 2019 rule. The effects of these\nproposals and changes are currently unknown. On January 27, 2021 the Biden administration issued an executive order temporarily blocking new leases for oil and gas drilling in federal\nwaters. On April 18, 2022 the Bureau of Land Management resumed oil and gas leasing on a much reduced basis and, in September 2023, a record low of just three offshore lease sales\nover the next five years were unveiled. However, leasing for oil and gas drilling in federal waters remains a contentious political issue, with certain states and Republicans in U.S.\nCongress pushing for increased leasing. Compliance with any new requirements of OPA and future legislation or regulations applicable to the operation of our vessels could impact the\ncost of our operations or demand for our vessels and adversely affect our business.\n44\nTable of Contents\nOPA specifically permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries, provided they accept, at a\nminimum, the levels of liability established under OPA and some states have enacted legislation providing for unlimited liability for oil spills, including bunker fuel spills. Many U.S.\nstates that border a navigable waterway have enacted environmental pollution laws that impose strict liability on a person for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of\noil or a release of a hazardous substance. Some of these laws are more stringent than U.S. federal law in some respects. Moreover, some states have enacted legislation providing for\nunlimited liability for discharge of pollutants within their waters, although in some cases, states which have enacted this type of legislation have not yet issued implementing regulations\ndefining shipowners’ responsibilities under these laws. The Company intends to be in compliance with all applicable state regulations in the relevant ports where the Company’s vessels\ncall.\nWe currently maintain pollution liability coverage insurance in the amount of $1.0 billion per incident for our vessels. If the damages from a catastrophic spill were to exceed our\ninsurance coverage, it could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nOther United States Environmental Initiatives\nThe U.S. Clean Air Act of 1970 (including its amendments of 1977 and 1990) (“CAA”) requires the EPA to promulgate standards applicable to emissions of greenhouse gasses,\nvolatile organic compounds and other air contaminants. The CAA requires states to adopt State Implementation Plans, some of which regulate emissions resulting from vessel loading\nand unloading operations which may affect our vessels.\nThe U.S. Clean Water Act (“CWA”) prohibits the discharge of oil, hazardous substances and ballast water in U.S. navigable waters unless authorized by a duly issued permit or\nexemption and imposes strict liability in the form of penalties for any unauthorized discharges. The CWA also imposes substantial liability for the costs of removal, remediation and\ndamages and complements the remedies available under OPA and CERCLA.\nThe EPA and the USCG have also enacted rules relating to ballast water discharge, compliance with which requires the installation of equipment on our vessels to treat ballast\nwater before it is discharged or the implementation of other port facility disposal arrangements or procedures at potentially substantial costs and/or otherwise restrict our vessels from\nentering U.S. waters. The EPA will regulate these ballast water discharges and other discharges incidental to the normal operation of certain vessels within United States waters pursuant\nto the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act (“VIDA”), which was signed into law on December 4, 2018 and replaces the 2013 Vessel General Permit (“VGP”) program (which authorizes\ndischarges incidental to operations of commercial vessels and contains numeric ballast water discharge limits for most vessels to reduce the risk of invasive species in U.S. waters,\nstringent requirements for exhaust gas scrubbers, and requirements for the use of environmentally acceptable lubricants) and current Coast Guard ballast water management regulations\nadopted under the U.S. National Invasive Species Act, such as mid-ocean ballast exchange programs and installation of approved USCG technology for all vessels equipped with ballast\nwater tanks bound for U.S. ports or entering U.S. waters. VIDA establishes a new framework for the regulation of vessel incidental discharges under the CWA, requires the EPA to\ndevelop performance standards for those discharges within two years of enactment, and requires the U.S. Coast Guard to develop implementation, compliance and enforcement\nregulations within two years of the EPA’s promulgation of standards. Though the EPA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking in October 2020 and a supplemental notice of proposed\nrulemaking in October 2023 (whose comment period closed on December 18, 2023), as of December 31, 2023, the EPA has not promulgated a final rule on new discharge standards and the\nUSCG has not developed implementation, compliance and enforcement regulations. Under VIDA, all provisions of the 2013 VGP and USCG regulations regarding ballast water treatment\nremain in force and effect until the EPA and U.S. Coast Guard regulations are finalized. Non-military, non-recreational vessels greater than 79 feet in length must continue to comply with\nthe requirements of the VGP, including submission of a Notice of Intent (“NOI”) or retention of a Permit Authorization and Record of Inspection (PARI) form and submission of annual\nreports. We have submitted NOIs for our vessels where required. Compliance with the EPA, U.S. Coast Guard and state regulations could require the installation of additional ballast\nwater treatment equipment on our vessels which have not already installed this equipment or the implementation of other port facility disposal procedures as a result of which we may\nincur additional capital expenditures or may otherwise have to restrict certain of our vessels from entering U.S. waters.\nThe California Air Resources Board regulation for reducing emissions from diesel auxiliary engines on ships while at-berth is applicable for container vessels from January 1,\n2023. Effective January 1, 2025, every dry bulk carrier and oil tanker vessel approaching California ports must be also equipped with shore power supply.\n45\nTable of Contents\nEuropean Union Regulations\nIn October 2009, the European Union amended a directive to impose criminal sanctions for illicit ship-source discharges of polluting substances, including minor discharges, if\ncommitted with intent, recklessly or with serious negligence and the discharges individually or in the aggregate result in deterioration of the quality of water. Aiding and abetting the\ndischarge of a polluting substance may also lead to criminal penalties. The directive applies to all types of vessels, irrespective of their flag, with certain exceptions for warships or where\nhuman safety or that of the ship is in danger. Criminal liability for pollution may result in substantial penalties or fines and increased civil liability claims. Regulation (EU) 2015/757 of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2015 (amending EU Directive 2009/16/EC) governs the monitoring, reporting and verification of carbon dioxide emissions from\nmaritime transport, and, subject to some exclusions, requires companies with ships over 5,000 gross tonnage to monitor and report carbon dioxide emissions annually, which may cause\nus to incur additional expenses.\nThe European Union has adopted several regulations and directives requiring, among other things, more frequent inspections of high-risk ships, as determined by type, age and\nflag as well as the number of times the ship has been detained. The European Union also adopted and extended a ban on substandard ships and enacted a minimum ban period and a\ndefinitive ban for repeated offenses. The regulation also provided the European Union with greater authority and control over classification societies, by imposing more requirements on\nclassification societies and providing for fines or penalty payments for organizations that failed to comply. Furthermore, the EU has implemented regulations requiring vessels to use\nreduced sulfur content fuel for their main and auxiliary engines. The EU Directive 2005/33/EC (amending Directive 1999/32/EC) introduced requirements parallel to those in MARPOL\nAnnex VI relating to the sulfur content of marine fuels. In addition, the EU imposed a 0.1% maximum sulfur requirement for fuel used by ships at berth in the Baltic, the North Sea and the\nEnglish Channel (the so called “SOx-Emission Control Area”). As of January 2020, EU member states must also ensure that ships in all EU waters, except in the SOx-Emission Control\nArea, use fuels with a 0.5% maximum sulfur content.\nOn September 15, 2020, the European Parliament voted to include greenhouse gas emissions from the maritime sector in the European Union’s carbon market. This will require\nshipowners to buy permits to cover these emissions. On July 14, 2021, the EU Commission proposed legislation to amend the EU ETS to include shipping emissions which was phased in\nbeginning in 2023. In January 2024, EU ETS was extended to cover carbon dioxide emissions from all large ships (of 5,000 gross tonnage and above) entering EU ports, regardless of the\nflag they fly.\nGreenhouse Gas Regulation\nCurrently, the emissions of greenhouse gases from international shipping are not subject to the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange, which entered into force in 2005 and pursuant to which adopting countries have been required to implement national programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with targets\nextended through 2020. International negotiations are continuing with respect to greenhouse gas emissions and restrictions on shipping emissions may be included in any new treaty. In\nDecember 2009, more than 27 nations, including the U.S. and China, signed the Copenhagen Accord, which includes a non-binding commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris resulted in the Paris Agreement, which entered into force on November 4, 2016 and does not directly limit greenhouse gas\nemissions from ships. The U.S. initially entered into the agreement, but the Trump administration withdrew from the Paris Agreement effective November 4, 2020. On January 20, 2021,\nU.S. President Biden signed an executive order to rejoin the Paris Agreement, which took effect on February 19, 2021.\nAt MEPC 70 and MEPC 71, a draft outline of the structure of the initial strategy for developing a comprehensive IMO strategy on reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from\nships was approved. In accordance with this roadmap, in April 2018, nations at the MEPC 72 adopted an initial strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships. The initial\nstrategy identifies “levels of ambition” to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including (1) decreasing the carbon intensity from ships through implementation of further phases of the\nEEDI for new ships; (2) reducing carbon dioxide emissions per transport work, as an average across international shipping, by at least 40% by 2030, pursuing efforts towards 70% by\n2050, compared to 2008 emission levels; and (3) reducing the total annual greenhouse emissions by at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008 while pursuing efforts towards phasing them\nout entirely. The initial strategy notes that technological innovation, alternative fuels and/or energy sources for international shipping will be integral to achieve the overall ambition. The\nMEPC 76 adopted amendments to MARPOL Annex VI that will require ships to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. These amendments combine technical and operational\napproaches to improve the energy efficiency of ships, in line with the targets established in the 2018 Initial IMO Strategy for Reducing GHG Emissions from Ships and provide important\nbuilding blocks for future GHG reduction measures. The new measures will require all ships to calculate their EEXI following technical means to improve their energy efficiency and to\nestablish their annual operational carbon intensity indicator (CII) and CII rating. Carbon intensity links the GHG emissions to the transport work of ships. These regulations could cause\nus to incur additional substantial expenses.\n46\nTable of Contents\nThe EU made a unilateral commitment to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions from its member states by 20% of 1990 levels by 2020. The EU also committed to reduce its\nemissions by 20% under the Kyoto Protocol’s second period from 2013 to 2020. Starting in January 2018, large ships over 5,000 gross tonnage calling at EU ports are required to collect\nand publish data on carbon dioxide emissions and other information. As previously discussed, implementation of regulations relating to the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions from\nthe maritime sector in the European Union’s carbon market is also forthcoming.\nIn the United States, the EPA issued a finding that greenhouse gases endanger the public health and safety, adopted regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions from certain\nmobile sources, and proposed regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions from large stationary sources. However, in March 2017, U.S. President Trump sought to eliminate elements\nof the EPA’s plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions and rolled back standards to control methane and volatile organic compound emissions from new oil and gas facilities. However, the\nBiden administration directed the EPA to publish rules suspending, revising or rescinding certain of these regulations. The EPA and/or individual U.S. states could enact additional\nenvironmental regulations that would affect our operations.\nAny passage of climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by the IMO, the EU, the U.S. or other countries where we operate, or any treaty adopted at the\ninternational level to succeed or further implement the Kyoto Protocol or Paris Agreement which further restricts emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to make significant\nfinancial expenditures which we cannot predict with certainty at this time. Even in the absence of climate control legislation, our business may be indirectly affected to the extent that\nclimate change results in sea level changes or increases in extreme weather events.\nInternational Labor Organization\nThe International Labor Organization is a specialized agency of the UN that has adopted the Maritime Labor Convention 2006 (“MLC 2006”). A Maritime Labor Certificate and a\nDeclaration of Maritime Labor Compliance is required to ensure compliance with the MLC 2006 for all ships that are 500 gross tonnage or over and are either engaged in international\nvoyages or flying the flag of a Member and operating from a port, or between ports, in another country. Our vessels are certified as per MLC 2006 and, we believe, in substantial\ncompliance with the MLC 2006.\nVessel Security Regulations\nSince the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 in the United States, there have been a variety of initiatives intended to enhance vessel security such as the U.S. Maritime\nTransportation Security Act of 2002 (“MTSA”). To implement certain portions of the MTSA, the USCG issued regulations requiring the implementation of certain security requirements\naboard vessels operating in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and at certain ports and facilities, some of which are regulated by the EPA.\nSimilarly, Chapter XI-2 of the SOLAS Convention imposes detailed security obligations on vessels and port authorities and mandates compliance with the International Ship\nand Port Facility Security Code (“the ISPS Code”). The ISPS Code is designed to enhance the security of ports and ships against terrorism. To trade internationally, a vessel must attain\nan International Ship Security Certificate (“ISSC”) from a recognized security organization approved by the vessel’s flag state. Ships operating without a valid certificate may be\ndetained, expelled from, or refused entry at port until they obtain an ISSC. The various requirements, some of which are found in the SOLAS Convention, include, for example, onboard\ninstallation of automatic identification systems to provide a means for the automatic transmission of safety-related information from among similarly equipped ships and shore stations,\nincluding information on a ship’s identity, position, course, speed and navigational status; onboard installation of ship security alert systems, which do not sound on the vessel but only\nalert the authorities on shore; the development of vessel security plans; ship identification number to be permanently marked on a vessel’s hull; a continuous synopsis record kept\nonboard showing a vessel’s history including the name of the ship, the state whose flag the ship is entitled to fly, the date on which the ship was registered with that state, the ship’s\nidentification number, the port at which the ship is registered and the name of the registered owner(s) and their registered address; and compliance with flag state security certification\nrequirements.\nThe USCG regulations, intended to align with international maritime security standards, exempt non-U.S. vessels from MTSA vessel security measures, provided such vessels\nhave on board a valid ISSC that attests to the vessel’s compliance with the SOLAS Convention security requirements and the ISPS Code. Future security measures could have a\nsignificant financial impact on us. We intend to comply with the various security measures addressed by MTSA, the SOLAS Convention and the ISPS Code.\nThe cost of vessel security measures has also been affected by the escalation in the frequency of acts of piracy against ships, notably off the coast of Somalia in the Gulf of\nAden and off the coast of Nigeria in the Gulf of Guinea. Furthermore, costs of vessel security measures have been affected by the geopolitical conflicts in the Middle East and maritime\nincidents in and around the Red Sea, including off the coast of Yemen in the Gulf of Aden where vessels have faced an increased number of armed attacks targeting Israeli and US-linked\nships, as well as Marshall Islands’ flagged vessels. Substantial loss of revenue and other costs may be incurred as a result of detention of a vessel or additional security measures, and\nthe risk of uninsured losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity and operating results. Costs are incurred in taking additional security measures in accordance\nwith Best Management Practices to Deter Piracy, notably those contained in the BMP5 industry standard.\n47\nTable of Contents\nInspection by Classification Societies\nThe hull and machinery of every commercial vessel must be classed by a classification society authorized by its country of registry. The classification society certifies that a\nvessel is safe and seaworthy in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the country of registry of the vessel and SOLAS. Most insurance underwriters make it a\ncondition for insurance coverage and lending that a vessel be certified “in class” by a classification society which is a member of the International Association of Classification\nSocieties, the IACS. The IACS has adopted harmonized Common Structural Rules, or the Rules, which apply to oil tankers contracted for construction on or after July 1, 2015. The Rules\nattempt to create a level of consistency between IACS Societies. Our vessels are certified as being “in class” by the applicable IACS Classification Societies (e.g., American Bureau of\nShipping, Lloyd’s Register of Shipping, Det Norske Veritas, Nippon Kaiji Kyokai, etc.).\nA vessel must undergo annual surveys, intermediate surveys, dry-dockings and special surveys. A vessel’s machinery may be on a continuous survey cycle, under which the\nmachinery would be surveyed periodically over a five-year period. Every vessel is also required to be dry-docked every 30 to 36 months for inspection of the underwater parts of the\nvessel. If any vessel does not maintain its class and/or fails any annual survey, intermediate survey, dry-docking or special survey, the vessel will be unable to carry cargo between ports\nand will be unemployable and uninsurable which could cause us to be in violation of certain covenants in our loan agreements. Any such inability to carry cargo or to be employed, or\nany such violation of covenants, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nRisk of Loss and Liability Insurance\nGeneral\nThe operation of any cargo vessel includes risks such as mechanical failure, physical damage, collision, property loss, cargo loss or damage and business interruption due to\npolitical circumstances in foreign countries, piracy incidents, hostilities and labor strikes. In addition, there is always an inherent possibility of marine disaster, including oil spills and\nother environmental events, and the liabilities arising from owning and operating vessels in international trade. We and our pool operators carry insurance coverage as customary in the\nshipping industry. However, not all risks can be insured, specific claims may be rejected, and we might not be always able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates.\nAny of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nHull and Machinery Insurance\nWe procure hull and machinery insurance, protection and indemnity insurance, which includes environmental damage and pollution insurance, war risk insurance, freight and\ndemurrage and defense insurance for all vessels in our fleet. Each of our vessels is insured up to what we believe to be at least its fair market value, after meeting certain deductibles. We\ndo not have and do not expect to obtain loss of hire insurance (or any other kind of business interruption insurance) covering the loss of revenue during off-hire periods, other than due\nto war risks, for any of our vessels. In certain instances where our vessels are participating in a pool transit through high-risk areas, the pool operator arranges for kidnap and ransom\nloss of hire insurance for a specified duration on our behalf.\nProtection and Indemnity Insurance\nProtection and indemnity insurance is provided by mutual protection and indemnity associations, or “P&I Associations” or clubs, and covers our third-party liabilities in\nconnection with our shipping activities. This includes third-party liability and other related expenses of injury or death of crew, passengers and other third parties, loss or damage to\ncargo, claims arising from collisions with other vessels, damage to other third-party property, pollution arising from oil or other substances, and salvage, towing and other related costs,\nincluding wreck removal.\nOur current protection and indemnity insurance coverage for pollution is $1 billion per vessel per incident. There are 13 P&I Associations that comprise the “International\nGroup”, a group of P&I Associations that insure approximately 90% of the world’s commercial tonnage and have entered into a pooling agreement to reinsure each association’s\nliabilities. The International Group’s website states that the pool provides a mechanism for sharing all claims in excess of $10 million up to, currently, approximately $3.1 billion. As a\nmember of a P&I Association, which is a member of the International Group, we are subject to calls payable to the associations based on our claim records as well as the claim records of\nall other members of the individual associations and members of the shipping pool of P&I Associations comprising the International Group.\n48\nTable of Contents\nCompetition\nWe operate in markets that are highly competitive, particularly in the tanker industry where ownership of tanker vessels is highly fragmented. The LPG carrier market is also\nmoderately fragmented in terms of ownership. Although we believe that at the present time no single company has a dominant position in the markets in which we operate, that could\nchange and we may face substantial competition for charters from a number of established companies who may have greater resources or experience.\nThe process of obtaining new employment for our fleet generally involves intensive screening, and competitive bidding, and often extends for several months. We compete for\ncharters on the basis of price, vessel location, size, age and condition of the vessel, as well as based on customer relationships and our reputation as an owner and operator. In the LPG\ncarrier sector, we may compete with LPG distributors and traders who use their fleets not only to transport their own LPG, but also to transport LPG for third-party charterers in direct\ncompetition with independent owners and operators. Demand for tanker and LPG carrier vessels fluctuates in line with the main patterns of trade for the cargoes transported by our\nvessels and varies according to supply and demand for such products.\nPermits and Authorizations\nWe are required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain certain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to our vessels. The kinds of permits,\nlicenses and certificates required depend upon several factors, including the commodity transported, the waters in which the vessel operates, the nationality of the vessel’s crew and the\nage of a vessel. We have been able to obtain all permits, licenses and certificates currently required to permit our vessels to operate. Additional laws and regulations, environmental or\notherwise, may be adopted which could limit our ability to do business or increase our cost of doing business.\nSeasonality\nBased on the Company’s historical data and industry trends, we expect demand for our tanker and LPG carrier vessels to exhibit seasonal variations and, as a result, charter and\nfreight rates to fluctuate. In particular, the LPG carrier market is typically stronger in the fall and winter months in anticipation of increased consumption of propane and butane for\nheating during the winter months. In addition, unpredictable weather patterns in these months tend to disrupt vessel scheduling and supplies of certain commodities. Similarly, tanker\nfreight rates tend to perform stronger in the first and fourth quarters of the year, driven by higher demand for oil products in the winter months in the Northern hemisphere, though this\nseasonal pattern has somewhat weakened in recent years due to an increasing proportion of oil product demand originating from Asia, which is less affected by seasonal consumption\npatterns. These variations may result in quarter-to-quarter volatility in our operating results for our vessels when trading in the spot trip or voyage charter market or if on period time\ncharter when a new time charter is being entered into. Seasonality in the tanker and LPG shipping sector in which we operate could materially affect our operating results and cash flows.\nC. Organizational Structure\nWe were incorporated by Castor in the Republic of the Marshall Islands on July 29, 2022, with our principal executive offices located at 223 Christodoulou Chatzipavlou Street,\nHawaii Royal Gardens, 3036 Limassol, Cyprus.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS\nThe following is a discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2023. You should\nread the following discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes to those statements included in “Item 18. Financial Statements.”\nAmounts relating to percentage variations in period-on-period comparisons shown in this section are derived from those consolidated financial statements. The following discussion\ncontains forward-looking statements that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. These forward-looking statements are dependent upon events, risks and\nuncertainties that may be outside our control which could cause actual results, cash flows, financial positions, events or conditions to differ materially from those currently anticipated\nand expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth in “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors.” Refer to the section\ncaptioned “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for further discussion of such events, risks and uncertainties. All dollar amounts referred to in this\ndiscussion and analysis are expressed in U.S. dollars except where indicated otherwise.\nFor a discussion of our results for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the period ended December 31, 2021, please see “—Item 5. Operating and Financial Review\nand Prospects—A. Operating Results—Year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to period ended December 31, 2021” contained in our annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on March 8, 2023.\nA. Operating Results\nIn the second quarter of 2023, we established our LPG carrier operations through the acquisition of two LPG carrier vessels. As a result, as of December 31, 2023, we operated in\nthree reportable segments: (i) the Aframax/LR2 tanker segment, (ii) the Handysize tanker segment and (iii) the LPG carrier segment. The reportable segments reflect the internal\norganization of the Company and the way the chief operating decision maker reviews the operating results and allocates capital within the Company. Further, the transport of crude oil\n(carried by Aframax/LR2 tankers), refined petroleum products (carried by Handysize tanker vessels) and liquefied petroleum gas (carried by LPG carriers) has different characteristics. In\naddition, the nature of trade, trading routes, charterers and cargo handling of liquefied petroleum gas, refined petroleum products and crude oil differs.\nFollowing completion of the sale of the M/T Wonder Sirius in January 2024, the Company no longer has any Aframax/LR2 vessels and management has determined that, with\neffect from the second quarter of 2024, the Company operates in two reportable segments: (i) the Handysize tanker segment and (ii) the LPG carrier segment.\nPrincipal factors impacting our business, results of operations and financial condition\nOur results of operations are affected by numerous factors. The principal factors that have impacted the business during the fiscal periods presented in the following\ndiscussion and analysis and that are likely to continue to impact our business are the following:\n• The levels of demand and supply of seaborne cargoes and vessel tonnage in the shipping industries in which we operate;\n• The cyclical nature of the shipping industry in general and its impact on charter and freight rates and vessel values;\n• The successful implementation of our business strategy, including the ability to obtain equity and debt financing at acceptable and attractive terms to fund future capital\nexpenditures and/or to implement this business strategy;\n• The global economic growth outlook and trends;\n• Economic, regulatory, political and governmental conditions that affect shipping and the tanker shipping industry, including international conflict or war (or threatened\nwar), such as between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East, and acts of piracy or maritime aggression, such as recent maritime incidents involving vessels in and\naround the Red Sea;\n• The employment and operation of our fleet including the utilization rates of our vessels;\n• The ability to successfully employ our vessels at economically attractive rates and the strategic decisions regarding the employment mix of our fleet in the voyage, time\ncharter and pool markets, as our charters expire or are otherwise terminated;\n50\nTable of Contents\n• Management of the operational, financial, general and administrative elements involved in the conduct of our business and ownership of our fleet, including the effective\nand efficient management of our fleet by our manager and its sub-managers, and each of their suppliers;\n• The number of charterers and pool operators who use our services and the performance of their obligations under their agreements, including their ability to make timely\npayments to us;\n• The ability to maintain solid working relationships with our existing charterers and pool operators and our ability to increase the number of our charterers through the\ndevelopment of new working relationships;\n• The vetting approvals requested by oil majors and the Chemical Distribution Institute (CDI) for the vessels managed by our manager and/or sub-managers;\n• Dry-docking and special survey costs and duration, both expected and unexpected;\n• Our borrowing levels and the finance costs related to our outstanding debt as well as our compliance with our debt covenants;\n• Management of our financial resources, including banking relationships and of the relationships with our various stakeholders;\n• Major outbreaks of diseases and governmental responses thereto; and\n• The level of any distribution on all classes of our shares.\nThese factors are volatile and in certain cases may not be within our control. Accordingly, past performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance, and it is difficult\nto predict future performance with any degree of certainty. See also “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors” in this Annual Report and “Risk Factors” herein.\nHire Rates and the Cyclical Nature of the Industry\nOne of the factors that impacts our profitability is the hire and freight rates at which we are able to fix our vessels and the pool rates we earn from the pool arrangements. The\nshipping industry is cyclical with attendant volatility in rates and, as a result, profitability. The tanker shipping sector has been characterized by long and short periods of imbalances\nbetween supply and demand, causing charter rates to be volatile.\nThe degree of charter rate volatility among different types of tanker and LPG carrier vessels has varied widely, and charter rates for these vessels have also varied significantly\nin recent years. Fluctuations in charter rates result from changes in the supply and demand for vessel capacity and changes in the supply and demand for the crude oil, refined petroleum\nproducts and liquefied petroleum gas carried by oceangoing vessels internationally. The factors and the nature, timing, direction and degree of changes in industry conditions affecting\nthe supply and demand for vessels are unpredictable to a great extent and outside our control.\nOur vessel deployment strategy seeks to maximize revenues throughout industry cycles while maintaining cash flow stability and foreseeability. Our gross revenues on a\nstandalone basis for the year ended December 31, 2023 consisted predominantly of hire earned by our vessels participating in pools, as well as revenue earned under time charter\ncontracts and voyage charter contracts. For a description of these chartering arrangements, refer to “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Chartering of Our\nFleet.”\nThe year ended December 31, 2023 was one of the best years for spot crude tanker trades since 2000. Deadweight carrying capacity of the tanker fleet increased by\napproximately 1.9% in 2023, as compared to 4.1% in 2022, while demand in terms of tonne miles for crude oil and oil products in 2023 is estimated to have grown by 6.8% and 10.3%,\nrespectively, and is expected to continue growing at a robust pace in 2024. The tanker spot charter market has seen significant volatility throughout 2023, with rates rising from $47,913\nper day in January 2023 to $68,437 per day in March 2023 before declining to a low of $23,606 per day in September 2023 and ending the year at $43,637 per day in December 2023.\nVolatility in charter rates in the tanker market may affect the value of tanker vessels, which occasionally follow the trends of tanker charter rates, and similarly affects our earnings, cash\nflows and liquidity.\nIn comparison to the spot market average, LPG 5,000 cbm rates have shown little volatility in 2023, as charter rates ranged from a low of $10,028 per day in January 2023 to a high\nof $10,356 per day in June 2023, after which rates remained roughly the same until year end. There has been a slight increase in time charter rates of around 1.7% in 2023 in the regions\nfrom the Red Sea to the Indian, North and South Pacific Oceans and 6.3% in 2023 in the regions from the Mediterranean and Adriatic Seas to the Baltic Sea, North and South Atlantic\nOceans compared to last year. In 2022 and 2023, the deadweight carrying capacity of the small LPG carrier vessels is estimated to have increased by 4% annually in each of the two\nperiods.\n51\nTable of Contents\nOur future gross revenues may be affected by our commercial strategy, including decisions regarding the employment mix of our fleet among time and voyage charters and pool\narrangements. See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a breakdown of revenues per category.\nEmployment and operation of our fleet\nAnother factor that impacts our profitability is the employment and operation of our fleet. The profitable employment of our fleet is highly dependent on the levels of demand\nand supply in the shipping segments in which we operate, our commercial strategy including the decisions regarding the employment mix of our fleet among time and voyage charters\nand pool arrangements, as well as our manager’s and sub-managers’ ability to leverage our relationships with existing or potential customers. As a new entrant to the tankers and LPG\ncarriers’ business, our customer base is currently concentrated to a small number of charterers and pool managers. The breadth of our customer base has historically had an impact on\nthe profitability of our business and in the year ended December 31, 2023, 81% of our revenues were earned on pool arrangements entered into with two pool managers. Further, the\neffective operation of our fleet mainly requires regular maintenance and repair, effective crew selection and training, ongoing supply of our fleet with the spares and the stores that it\nrequires, contingency response planning, auditing of our vessels’ onboard safety procedures, arrangements for our vessels’ insurance, chartering of the vessels, training of onboard and\non shore personnel with respect to the vessels’ security and security response plans (ISPS), obtaining of ISM certifications, compliance with environmental regulations and standards\nand performing the necessary audit for the vessels within the year of taking over a vessel and the ongoing performance monitoring of the vessels.\nFinancial, general and administrative management\nThe management of financial, general and administrative elements involved in the conduct of our business and ownership of our vessels requires us to manage our financial\nresources, which includes managing banking relationships, administrating our bank accounts, managing our accounting system, records and financial reporting, monitoring and ensuring\ncompliance with the legal and regulatory requirements affecting our business and assets and managing our relationships with our service providers and customers.\nImportant Measures and Definitions for Analyzing Results of Operations\nOur management uses the following metrics to evaluate our operating results, including our operating results at the segment level, and to allocate capital accordingly:\nTotal vessel revenues. Total vessel revenues are generated from voyage charters, time charters and pool arrangements. Total vessel revenues are affected by the number of\nvessels in our fleet, hire and freight rates and the number of days a vessel operates which, in turn, are affected by several factors, including the amount of time that we spend positioning\nour vessels, the amount of time that our vessels spend in dry-dock undergoing repairs, maintenance and upgrade work, the age, condition and specifications of our vessels, and levels\nof supply and demand in the seaborne transportation market. Total vessel revenues are also affected by our commercial strategy related to the employment mix of our fleet between\nvessels on time charters, vessels operating on voyage charters and vessels in pools.\nWe measure revenues in each segment for three separate activities: (i) time charter revenues, (ii) voyage charter revenues, and (iii) pool revenues. For a description of these\ntypes of chartering arrangements, refer to “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Chartering of Our Fleet.”\nVoyage expenses. Our voyage expenses primarily consist of bunker expenses, port and canal expenses and brokerage commissions paid in connection with the chartering of our\nvessels. Voyage expenses are incurred primarily during voyage charters or when the vessel is repositioning or unemployed. Bunker expenses, port and canal dues increase in periods\nduring which vessels are employed on voyage charters because these expenses are in this case borne by us. Under a time charter, the charterer pays substantially all the vessel voyage\nrelated expenses. Under pooling arrangements, voyage expenses are borne by the pool operator. Gain/loss on bunkers may also arise where the cost of the bunker fuel sold to the new\ncharterer is greater or less than the cost of the bunker fuel acquired.\nOperating expenses. We are responsible for vessel operating costs, which include crewing, expenses for repairs and maintenance, the cost of insurance, tonnage taxes, the cost\nof spares and consumable stores, lubricating oils costs, communication expenses and other expenses. Expenses for repairs and maintenance tend to fluctuate from period to period\nbecause most repairs and maintenance typically occur during periodic dry-docking. Our ability to control our vessels’ operating expenses also affects our financial results. Daily vessel\noperating expenses are calculated by dividing fleet operating expenses by the Ownership Days for the relevant period.\nManagement fees. Management fees include fees paid to related parties providing certain ship management services to our fleet pursuant to the Ship Management\nAgreements.\n52\nTable of Contents\nOff-hire. Off-hire is the period our fleet is unable to perform the services for which it is required under a charter for reasons such as scheduled repairs, vessel upgrades, dry-\ndockings or special or intermediate surveys or other unforeseen events.\nDry-docking/Special Surveys. We periodically dry-dock and/or perform special surveys on our fleet for inspection, repairs and maintenance and any modifications to comply\nwith industry certification or governmental requirements. Our ability to control our dry-docking and special survey expenses and our ability to complete our scheduled dry-dockings\nand/or special surveys on time also affects our financial results. Dry-docking and special survey costs are accounted for under the deferral method whereby the actual costs incurred are\ndeferred and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the period through the date the next survey is scheduled to become due.\nOwnership Days. Ownership Days are the total number of calendar days in a period during which we owned a vessel. Ownership Days are an indicator of the size of our fleet\nover a period and determine both the level of revenues and expenses recorded during that specific period.\nAvailable Days. Available Days are the Ownership Days in a period less the aggregate number of days our vessels are off-hire due to scheduled repairs, dry-dockings or special\nor intermediate surveys. The shipping industry uses Available Days to measure the aggregate number of days in a period during which vessels are available to generate revenues. Our\ncalculation of Available Days may not be comparable to that reported by other companies.\nOperating Days. Operating Days are the Available Days in a period after subtracting unscheduled off-hire and idle days.\nFleet Utilization. Fleet Utilization is calculated by dividing the Operating Days during a period by the number of Available Days during that period. Fleet Utilization is used to\nmeasure a company’s ability to efficiently find suitable employment for its vessels and minimize the number of days that its vessels are off-hire for reasons such as major repairs, vessel\nupgrades, dry-dockings or special or intermediate surveys and other unforeseen events.\nDaily Time Charter Equivalent (“TCE”) Rate. The Daily Time Charter Equivalent Rate (“Daily TCE Rate”), is a measure of the average daily revenue performance of a vessel.\nThe Daily TCE Rate is not a measure of financial performance under U.S. GAAP (i.e., it is a non-GAAP measure) and should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of\nfinancial performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We calculate Daily TCE Rate by dividing total revenues (time charter and/or voyage charter revenues, and/or pool\nrevenues, net of charterers’ commissions), less voyage expenses, by the number of Available Days during that period. Under a time charter, the charterer pays substantially all the vessel\nvoyage related expenses. However, we may incur voyage related expenses when positioning or repositioning vessels before or after the period of a time or other charter, during periods\nof commercial waiting time or while off-hire during dry-docking or due to other unforeseen circumstances. Under voyage charters, the majority of voyage expenses are generally borne\nby us whereas for vessels in a pool, such expenses are borne by the pool operator. The Daily TCE Rate is a standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare\nperiod-to-period changes in a company’s performance and, management believes that the Daily TCE Rate provides meaningful information to our investors because it compares daily net\nearnings generated by our vessels irrespective of the mix of charter types (e.g., time charter, voyage charter, pools) under which our vessels are employed between the periods while it\nfurther assists our management in making decisions regarding the deployment and use of our vessels and in evaluating our financial performance. Our calculation of the Daily TCE Rates\nmay be different from and may not be comparable to that reported by other companies.\nEBITDA. EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, does not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating\nincome, cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We define EBITDA as earnings before interest and\nfinance costs (if any), net of interest income, taxes (when incurred), depreciation and amortization of deferred dry-docking costs. EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by\nmanagement and external users of financial statements to assess our operating performance. We believe that EBITDA assists our management by providing useful information that\nincreases the comparability of our operating performance from period to period and against the operating performance of other companies in our industry that provide EBITDA\ninformation. This increased comparability is achieved by excluding the potentially disparate effects between periods or companies of interest, other financial items, depreciation and\namortization and taxes, which items are affected by various and possibly changing financing methods, capital structure and historical cost basis and which items may significantly affect\nnet income between periods.

This\ndecrease of $33.4 million was largely driven by the decrease in the Available Days of our fleet to 2,734 days in the year ended December 31, 2023, from 3,037 days in the corresponding\nperiod in 2022, as the result of the sale of the (i) M/T Wonder Arcturus on July 15, 2022, (ii) M/T Wonder Bellatrix on June 22, 2023, (iii) M/T Wonder Polaris on June 26, 2023, (iv) M/T\nWonder Musica on July 6, 2023, (v) M/T Wonder Avior on July 17, 2023, (vi) M/T Wonder Formosa on November 16, 2023 and (vii) M/T Wonder Vega on December 21, 2023, partly offset\nby the acquisition of (i) LPG Dream Terrax on May 26, 2023, (ii) LPG Dream Arrax on June 14, 2023, (iii) LPG Dream Syrax on July 18, 2023 and (iv) LPG Dream Vermax on August 4,\n2023. During the year ended December 31, 2023, our fleet earned on average a Daily TCE Rate of $27,075, compared to an average Daily TCE Rate of $27,187 earned during the same\nperiod in 2022. Daily TCE Rate is not a recognized measure under U.S. GAAP. Please refer to “—Daily TCE Rate” and “—Reconciliation of Daily TCE Rate to Total vessel revenues —\nConsolidated” above for the definition and reconciliation of this measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n56\nTable of Contents\nVoyage expenses\nVoyage expenses for our fleet decreased by $24.9 million, to $4.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, from $29.3 million in the same period of 2022. This decrease in\nvoyage expenses is mainly associated with the decrease in expenses associated with our vessels’ commercial employment arrangements, as during the year ended December 31, 2023,\nseven of our eight tanker vessels operated under pool agreements pursuant to which our pool operators bear bunker consumption costs and port expenses, resulting in a substantial\ndecrease in such expenses as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, during which our Aframax/LR2 tanker segment operated predominantly under voyage charters under which\nwe bore bunker consumption costs and port expenses. It was also due to the reduction of Ownership Days of our fleet, to 2,876 days in the year ended December 31, 2023 from 3,115\ndays in the same period in 2022 due to the decrease of the average number of operating vessels to 7.9 vessels in the year ended December 31, 2023 from 8.5 vessels in the same period of\n2022.\nVessel Operating Expenses\nThe decrease in vessel operating expenses by $0.6 million, to $21.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, from $21.7 million in the same period of 2022, mainly reflects the\ndecrease in the Ownership Days of our fleet, partly offset by the increase in the daily vessel operating expenses to $7,331 in the year ended December 31, 2023, from $6,969 in the same\nperiod in 2022, due to additional expenses related to the engagement of new third party manager subcontracted to technically manage a number of our vessels.\nManagement Fees\nThe increase in management fees by $0.3 million, to $3.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, from $2.8 million in the same period of 2022, mainly reflects the (i) increase\nin management fees from $850 per vessel per day to $975 per vessel per day following entry by the Toro Subsidiaries into the Amended and Restated Master Management Agreement\nwith effect from July 1, 2022, (ii) increased management fees with effect from July 1, 2023, from $975 per vessel per day to $1,039 per vessel per day which were adjusted for inflation in\naccordance with the terms of the Master Management Agreement and (iii) entry into new management agreements on April 26, 2023 with Castor Ships S.A. for our four LPG carriers,\nwhich are effective from the date of the purchase agreements, partially offset by the decrease in the Ownership Days of our fleet.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation expenses for our fleet decreased to $5.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, from $6.6 million in the same period in 2022 as a result of the decrease in the\nOwnership Days of our fleet. Dry-dock and special survey amortization charges amounted to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to a charge of $0.7 million in the\nyear ended December 31, 2022. This increase in dry-dock amortization charges primarily resulted from the increase in dry-dock amortization days from 563 days in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, to 870 dry-dock amortization days in the year ended December 31, 2023.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses in the year ended December 31, 2023, amounted to $5.4 million, whereas, in the same period in 2022, general and administrative expenses\ntotaled $2.1 million. This increase of $3.3 million is mainly associated with (i) the stock based compensation cost for non-vested shares granted under our Equity Incentive Plan\namounting to $1.2 million and (ii) a $2.6 million flat vessel management fee for the period from March 7, 2023 through December 31, 2023. The flat vessel management fee was increased\nfrom $0.75 million to $0.8 million, in accordance with the terms of Master Management Agreement with effect from July 1, 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2022, and for the period\nfrom January 1, 2023 through March 7, 2023 (completion of Spin-Off), General and administrative expenses reflect the expense allocations made to the Company by Castor based on the\nproportion of the number of Ownership Days of our fleet vessels to the total Ownership Days of Castor’s full fleet.\nGain on sale of vessels\nOn June 22, 2023, we concluded the sale of the M/T Wonder Bellatrix which we sold, pursuant to an agreement dated May 12, 2023, for cash consideration of $37.0 million.

These provisions include:\n• an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement of management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the emerging growth company’s internal controls over financial\nreporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley; and\n• an exemption from compliance with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, requiring mandatory audit firm\nrotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and financial statements.\nWe may choose to take advantage of some or all of these reduced reporting requirements. We may take advantage of these provisions until the last day of the fiscal year\nfollowing the fifth anniversary of the date we first sell our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or such earlier time that we\nare no longer an emerging growth company. We will cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $1.235 billion in “total annual gross revenues” during our most\nrecently completed fiscal year, if we become a “large accelerated filer” with a public float of more than $700 million, as of the last business day of our most recently completed second\nfiscal quarter or as of any date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt over the three-year period prior to such date. For as long as we take advantage of\nthe reduced reporting obligations, the information that we provide shareholders may be different from information provided by other public companies.\nB. Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe operate in a capital-intensive industry, and we expect to finance the purchase of additional vessels and other capital expenditures through a combination of cash from\noperations, proceeds from equity offerings, and borrowings from debt transactions. Our liquidity requirements relate to servicing the principal and interest on our debt, funding capital\nexpenditures and working capital (which includes maintaining the quality of our vessels and complying with international shipping standards and environmental laws and regulations)\nand maintaining cash reserves for the purpose of satisfying certain minimum liquidity restrictions contained in our credit facility. In accordance with our business strategy, other liquidity\nneeds may relate to funding potential investments in new vessels and maintaining cash reserves against fluctuations in operating cash flows. Our funding and treasury activities are\nintended to maximize investment returns while maintaining appropriate liquidity.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, our principal sources of funds were cash from operations and the net proceeds from (i) the sale of six vessels of our fleet and (ii) the\nissuance of common shares pursuant to the subscription agreement with Pani, as discussed below under “—Equity Transactions.”\nAs of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $155.2 million and $41.8 million, respectively, which excludes $0.4 million and $0.7 million\nof restricted cash in each period under our debt agreements, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents are primarily held in U.S. dollars.\nTwo of our subsidiaries, Rocket Shipping Co. and Gamora Shipping Co., entered into an $18.0 million term loan facility on April 27, 2021. In connection with the Spin-Off, we\namended this facility and Toro replaced Castor as guarantor for it. See “Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—B. Related Party Transactions—Contribution and\nSpin-Off Distribution Agreement” below. As of December 31, 2023, we had $5.3 million of gross indebtedness outstanding under this facility, of which $1.3 million was due to mature in\nthe year ending December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, we were also in compliance with all the financial and liquidity covenants contained in our debt agreement. The outstanding\nprincipal balance of $5.3 million on this facility was prepaid on January 25, 2024 following the completion of the sale of M/T Wonder Sirius and we no longer have any outstanding\nindebtedness under any facility as of the date of this Annual Report.\nWorking capital is equal to current assets minus current liabilities. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had a working capital surplus of $157.3 million and $48.2\nmillion, respectively.\nWe believe that our current sources of funds and those that we anticipate to internally generate for a period of at least the next twelve months from December 31, 2023, will be\nsufficient to fund the operations of our fleet and meet our normal working capital requirements for that period and for the foreseeable future.\n61\nTable of Contents\nOur medium- and long-term liquidity requirements relate to the funding of cash dividends on our Series A Preferred Shares, when declared, and expenditures relating to the\noperation and maintenance of our vessels. Sources of funding for our medium- and long-term liquidity requirements include cash flows from operations or new debt financing, if required.\nAs noted above, routine or strategic acquisitions may require the incurrence of additional indebtedness, including debt issuances, and/or additional equity issuances, which\nmay dilute our common shareholders if issued at lower prices than the price they acquired their shares, both of which could lower our available cash. See “Item 3. Key Information—D.\nRisk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Company—We may not be able to execute our growth strategy and we may not realize the benefits we expect from acquisitions or other strategic\ntransactions.”\nFor a discussion of our management agreements with our related-party manager and relevant fees charged, see “Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—\nB. Related Party Transactions.”\nCapital Expenditures\nFrom time to time, we make capital expenditures in connection with vessel acquisitions and vessels upgrades and improvements (either for the purpose of meeting regulatory or\nlegal requirements or for the purpose of complying with requirements imposed by classification societies). We currently finance our capital expenditures using cash from operations and\ndebt financing and expect to continue to do so in the future, though in the future, we may also utilize, subject to market conditions, further debt financing and equity issuances as a\nsource of funding. As of December 31, 2023 and as of the date of this Annual Report, we did not have any commitments for capital expenditures related to vessel acquisitions.\nA failure to fulfill our capital expenditure commitments generally results in a forfeiture of advances paid with respect to the contracted acquisitions and a write-off of capitalized\nexpenses. In addition, we may also be liable for other damages for breach of contract. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and\noperating results.\nEquity Transactions\nUnder Toro’s initial Articles of Incorporation dated July 29, 2022, Toro’s authorized capital stock consisted of 1,000 shares par value $0.001 per share. On March 2, 2023, the\nCompany’s articles of incorporation were amended and restated and Toro’s authorized capital stock was increased to 3,900,000,000 common shares, par value $0.001 per share and\n100,000,000 preferred shares, par value $0.001 per share. In connection with the Spin-Off, on March 7, 2023 Toro issued to Castor (i) 9,461,009 common shares with one vote per share,\nand (ii) 140,000 Series A Preferred Shares, with a stated value of $1,000 and par value of $0.001 per share, and no voting power, and issued to Pelagos, a company controlled by Toro’s\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, 40,000 Series B Preferred Shares. Such common shares were distributed on March 7, 2023 pro rata to the shareholders of record of Castor as of\nFebruary 22, 2023 at a ratio of one Toro common share for every ten Castor common shares.\nOn April 17, 2023, Toro entered into a subscription agreement with Pani, a company controlled by Toro’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, pursuant to which Toro issued\nand sold, and Pani purchased, 8,500,000 common shares, par value $0.001 per share, at a purchase price of $2.29 per share, for gross proceeds of $19,465,000, less issuance costs of\n$817,764 and was approved by a special committee of our disinterested and independent directors. The 8,500,000 common shares were issued on April 19, 2023 in a private placement\npursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D promulgated thereunder. The terms of the subscription agreement were negotiated and approved by a special\ncommittee of our disinterested and independent directors. See also “Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—B. Related Party Transactions.”\nOn September 6, 2023, our Board adopted an Equity Incentive Plan (the “Equity Incentive Plan”) under which directors, officers and employees (including any prospective\ndirector, officer or employee) of the Company and/or its subsidiaries and affiliates and consultants and service providers to (including persons who are employed by or provide services\nto any entity that is itself a consultant or service provider to) the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates, are eligible to receive awards including (a) non-qualified stock options, (b)\nstock appreciation rights, (c) restricted stock, (d) restricted stock unit, (e) dividend equivalents, (f) cash awards, (g) unrestricted stock and (h) other equity-based or equity-related\nAwards. The Equity Incentive Plan is administered by the Company’s board of directors and the aggregate number of common shares that may be issued with respect to awards granted\nunder the Equity Incentive Plan cannot exceed the 2,000,000 common shares. The Company’s board of directors may terminate the Equity Incentive Plan at any time. On September 28,\n2023, a total of 1,240,000 restricted common shares had been granted under the Equity Incentive Plan to directors, officers and non-employees. The fair value of each restricted share was\n$5.83, based on the latest closing price of our common shares on the grant date. Non-vested restricted common shares granted under the Equity Incentive Plan are entitled to receive\ndividends, which are not refundable even if such shares are forfeited. See also “Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees—B. Compensation.”\n62\nTable of Contents\nOn November 6, 2023, our Board approved a share repurchase program (the “Repurchase Program”), authorizing the repurchase of up to $5.0 million of the Company’s common\nshares commencing November 10, 2023, through to March 31, 2024. Shares may be repurchased pursuant to the Repurchase Program in open market and/or privately negotiated\ntransactions. The timing, manner and total amount of any share repurchases is determined by management at its discretion and depends upon business, economic and market\nconditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, prevailing share prices, and other considerations. The authorization does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of\ncommon shares. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company repurchased under the Repurchase Program 222,600 common shares in open market transactions for aggregate\nconsideration of approximately $1.0 million. On December 27, 2023, 179,251 repurchased common shares were cancelled and were removed from the Company’s share capital. The\nremaining 43,349 repurchased common shares have been classified as treasury shares as they were not cancelled as of December 31, 2023. See also “Item 16E. Purchases of Equity\nSecurities by the Issuer and Affiliated Persons” for further information regarding the number of common shares repurchased under the Repurchase Program in the year ended December\n31, 2023.\nOur Borrowing Activities\nAs of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, $5.3 million and $13.3 million, respectively, of gross indebtedness was outstanding under our $18.0 million term loan facility\nattributable to our Aframax/LR2 segment. On January 25, 2024, the outstanding principal amount of $5.3 million under this facility was prepaid using part of the proceeds of the sale of\nthe M/T Wonder Sirius, which served as security under the facility.\nAs of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all the financial and liquidity covenants contained in this debt agreement.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our net cash flows provided by/(used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022:\nFor the year For the year\nended ended\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2022 2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities 41,538,177 56,126,319\nNet cash provided by investing activities 11,788,681 50,706,251\nNet cash (used in)/ provided by financing activities (16,510,675) 6,273,237\nOperating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $56.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, consisting of net income of $140.6 million, with\nnon-cash adjustment for the aggregate gain on sale of the M/T Wonder Bellatrix, M/T Wonder Polaris, M/T Wonder Musica, M/T Wonder Avior, M/T Wonder Formosa and M/T Wonder\nVega of $99.0 million, non-cash adjustments related to depreciation and amortization of $6.9 million, amortization of deferred finance charges of $0.1 million, a payment of dry-dock costs\nof $3.5 million, stock compensation cost of $1.3 million and a net decrease of $9.7 million in working capital which mainly derived from a decrease in accounts receivable by $6.5 million,\nan increase in ‘Due from/to related parties’ by $3.8 million and a decrease in prepaid expenses by $4.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash provided by operating\nactivities amounted to $41.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, consisting of net income of $49.9 million, non-cash adjustments related to depreciation and amortization of $7.3\nmillion, amortization of deferred finance charges of $0.1 million, gain on sale of the M/T Wonder Arcturus of $3.2 million, provision for doubtful accounts of $0.3 million, payment of dry-\ndock costs of $1.9 million, partly offset by a net increase of $11.0 million in working capital, which mainly derived from an increase in prepaid expenses by $4.8 million and an increase in\naccounts receivable trade by $6.8 million. The $14.6 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared with the same period\nof 2022, reflects mainly the increase in net income which was largely driven by the gain on sale of the aforementioned vessels.\nInvesting Activities: Net cash provided by investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2023 amounted to $50.7 million and mainly reflects the (i) net proceeds from the\nsale of the M/T Wonder Bellatrix, M/T Wonder Polaris, M/T Wonder Musica, M/T Wonder Avior, M/T Wonder Formosa and M/T Wonder Vega amounting to $172.9 million, partly offset\nby (A) vessel acquisitions of the LPG Dream Terrax, LPG Dream Arrax, LPG Dream Syrax and LPG Dream Vermax amounting to $70.7 million and (B) payments of initial vessel and\nBWTS installation expenses amounting to $1.5 million and (ii) purchase of 50,000 5.00% Series D Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Shares of Castor with a stated amount of\n$1,000 each for the purchase price of $50.0 million. Net cash provided by investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2022 amounting to $11.8 million mainly reflect the net\nproceeds from the sale of the M/T Wonder Arcturus amounting to $12.6 million, partly offset by the payments in the current period of prior year initial vessel and BWTS installation\nexpenses amounting to $0.8 million.\n63\nTable of Contents\nFinancing Activities: Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2023 amounted to $6.3 million and relates to (i) Spin-Off expenses\namounting to $2.7 million incurred by Castor on our behalf, which were reimbursed by us pursuant to the Contribution and Spin-Off Distribution Agreement entered into between us and\nCastor on February 24, 2023, (ii) $2.0 million of period scheduled principal repayments in connection with our $18.0 million term loan facility and $6.0 million for the early repayment of the\noutstanding portion of that loan secured by M/T Wonder Polaris, (iii) payment for repurchase of common shares under the Company’s share repurchase program amounting to $1.0\nmillion and (iv) payment to Castor of a dividend on the Series A Preferred Shares for the period from March 7, 2023 to October 14, 2023 amounting to $0.9 million, as more than offset by\nnet proceeds from the issuance of 8,500,000 common shares pursuant to a subscription agreement with Pani, a company controlled by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,\namounting to $18.7 million and a net increase in former parent company investment amounting to $0.2 million. Net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31,\n2022 amounting to $16.5 million, relates to: (i) a net decrease in former parent company investment amounting to $13.4 million, and (ii) $3.1 million of period scheduled principal\nrepayments in connection with our $18.0 million term loan facility.\nC. Research and Development, Patents and Licenses, Etc.\nNot applicable.\nD. Trend Information\nOur results of operations depend primarily on the charter rates that we are able to realize. Charter hire rates paid for tanker vessels and LPG carriers are primarily a function of the\nunderlying balance between vessel supply and demand. For a discussion regarding the market performance, please see “—A. Operating Results—Hire Rates and Cyclical Nature of the\nIndustry.” There can be no assurance as to how long charter rates will remain at their current levels or whether they will improve or deteriorate and, if so, when and to what degree. That\nmay have a material adverse effect on our future growth potential and our profitability.\nDue to the sale of M/T Wonder Sirius on January 24, 2024, the Company no longer has any Aframax/LR2 vessels. Consequently, management has decided that, starting from the\nsecond quarter of 2024, the Company operates in two reportable segments: (i) the Handysize tanker segment, comprising one vessel, and (ii) the LPG carrier segment, comprising four\nvessels. This change may adversely impact our future growth potential and profitability, given that, as of February 29, 2024, a number of our LPG carriers were fixed for a minimum period\nof 12 months at gross charter rates materially lower than the rates observed for our Aframax/LR2 and Handysize tanker vessels in the year ended December 31, 2023. See “Item 4.\nInformation on the Company—B. Business Overview—Our Fleet” for further information regarding the terms of such charters and charter rates.\nFurthermore, the Company’s business could be adversely affected by the risks related to the conflict in Ukraine and the severe worsening of Russia’s relations with Western\neconomies that has created significant uncertainty in global markets, including increased volatility in the prices of certain of products which our vessels transport and shifts in the\ntrading patterns for such products which may continue into the future. In addition, since November 2023, vessels in and around the Red Sea have faced an increasing number of\nattempted hijackings and attacks by drones and projectiles launched from Yemen which armed Houthi groups have claimed responsibility for and which have resulted in casualties and\nsunken or damaged vessels. Refer to “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Geopolitical conditions, such as political instability or conflict, terrorist attacks and international\nhostilities can affect the seaborne transportation industry, which could adversely affect our business” for further details.\nWe are currently unable to predict with reasonable certainty the potential effects of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine or the Middle East, including due to the attacks on vessels\ndescribed above, on our future business, financial condition, cash flows or operating results and these events could have a material adverse effect on any of the foregoing.\nFurthermore, during 2023 many economies worldwide experienced inflationary pressures. For further information, see “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—The\nCompany is exposed to fluctuating demand and supply for maritime transportation services, as well as fluctuating prices of oil and refined petroleum products, and may be affected by\na decrease in the demand for such products and the volatility in their prices.” Such inflationary pressures and disruptions could adversely impact our operating costs and demand and\nsupply for products we transport. It remains to be seen whether inflationary pressures will continue, and to what degree. Interventions in the economy by central banks in response to\ninflationary pressures may slow down economic activity, reducing demand for products we carry, and cause a reduction in trade. As a result, the volumes of products we deliver and/or\ncharter rates for our vessels may be affected. These factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and operating results.\n64\nTable of Contents\nE. Critical Accounting Estimates\nCritical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and\nhave had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. On a\nregular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with\nU.S. GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences\ncould be material. For a description of our significant accounting policies, please read Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and “Item 18.\nFinancial Statements” in this Annual Report.\nMezzanine equity\nAs discussed in Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, the Company has issued as part of the Spin-Off to Castor 140,000\nSeries A Preferred Shares.\nThe Series A Preferred Shares are convertible, in whole or in part, at their holder’s option, to common shares at any time and from time to time from and after the third\nanniversary of their issue date and prior to the seventh anniversary of the issue date of March 7, 2023. For each quarterly dividend period commencing on or after the seventh\nanniversary of the issue date, the dividend rate on the Series A Preferred Shares will be the dividend rate in effect for the prior quarterly dividend period multiplied by a factor of 1.3;\nprovided, however, that the dividend rate will not exceed 20% per annum in respect of any quarterly dividend period. Dividends are subject to declaration by the Board or any authorized\ncommittee thereof and may be paid only out of legally available funds for such purpose.\nCastor, a related party, is the holder of all of our issued and outstanding Series A Preferred Shares. The Series A Preferred Shares have been classified in Mezzanine equity as\nper ASC 480-10-S99 “Distinguishing liabilities from Equity – SEC Materials” as they are in essence redeemable at the option of the holder as Mr. Panagiotidis, the Chairman, Chief\nExecutive Officer and controlling shareholder of us and Castor, who can effectively determine the timing of the redemption of the Series A Preferred Shares.\nThe fair value of Series A Preferred Shares on initial recognition was determined through Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as defined in FASB guidance for Fair Value\nMeasurements (ASC 820). Determining the fair value of the mezzanine equity requires management to make judgments about the valuation methodologies, including the unobservable\ninputs and other assumptions and estimates, which are significant in the fair value measurement of mezzanine equity. For the estimation of the fair value of the mezzanine equity, we used\nthe Black & Scholes and the discounted cash flow model and we also used significant unobservable inputs which are sensitive in nature and subject to uncertainty, such as expected\nvolatility.\nVessel Impairment\nThe Company reviews for impairment on its vessels held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances (such as market conditions, obsolescence or damage to the\nasset, potential sales and other business plans) may result in the fair value of a vessel being less than its carrying amount indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be\nrecoverable. When the estimate of undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to be generated by the use of the asset is less than its carrying amount, including the\nvalue of unamortized dry-docking costs, we are required to evaluate the asset for an impairment loss. Measurement of the impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset.\nThe carrying values of our vessels may not represent their fair market value at any point in time since the market prices of second-hand vessels tend to fluctuate with changes\nin charter rates and the cost of newbuilds. Historically, both charter rates and vessel values tend to be cyclical, including for the reasons discussed under the headings “—Charter rates\nfor our vessels are volatile and cyclical in nature. A decrease in charter rates may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results”, “—Charter rates for\ntanker vessels are volatile and cyclical in nature. A decrease in tanker charter rates may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results” and “—Charter\nrates for LPG carriers are volatile and cyclical in nature. A decrease in LPG carrier charter rates may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results” in\n“Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors”.\nOur estimates of basic market value assume that the vessels are all in good and seaworthy condition without need for repair and, if inspected, would be certified in class without\nnotations of any kind. Our estimates are based on the estimated market values for the vessels received from a third-party independent shipbroker approved by our financing providers.\nVessel values are highly volatile. Accordingly, our estimates may not be indicative of the current or future basic market value of the vessels or prices that could be achieved if the vessels\nwere to be sold.\n65\nTable of Contents\nWe perform undiscounted cash flow tests when necessary, as an impairment analysis, in which we made estimates and assumptions relating to determining the projected\nundiscounted net operating cash flows by considering the following:\n• the charter revenues from existing time charters for the fixed fleet days;\n• the estimated vessel operating expenses and voyage expenses;\n• the estimated dry-docking expenditures;\n• an estimated gross daily charter rate for the unfixed days (based on the ten-year average of the historical one-year time charter rates available for each type of vessel) over\nthe remaining economic life of each vessel, excluding estimated days of scheduled off-hires and net of estimated commissions;\n• the residual value of vessels;\n• commercial and technical management fees;\n• an estimated utilization rate; and\n• the remaining estimated lives of our vessels, consistent with those used in our depreciation calculations.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023, the charter-free market value of all our vessels exceeded their carrying value. Thus, no undiscounted cash flow tests were\ndeemed necessary to be performed for any of our vessels. Therefore, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, this is not considered a critical accounting estimate.\nITEM 6. DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES\nA. Directors and Senior Management\nSet forth below are the names, ages and positions of our directors and executive officer. Our Board currently consists of three directors. Our Board is divided into three classes\nof directors (Class A, Class B and Class C).

Major Shareholders\nCertain information regarding beneficial ownership of 5% or more of our common shares and equity ownership by our directors and officers is reported below. Information\nregarding beneficial ownership of our common shares is based on information available to us, including information contained in public filings.\n68\nTable of Contents\nThe percentage of beneficial ownership and the following discussion is based on 18,501,439 common shares outstanding, net of 476,970 treasury shares, as of February 29,\n2024.\nName of Beneficial Owner No. of Common Shares Percentage\nPani Corp. (1) 9,611,240 51.9%\nAll executive officers and directors (other than Petros Panagiotidis) as a group(2) — —%\n(1) Pani Corp. is a corporation organized under the laws of the Republic of Liberia. Pani is controlled by the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Petros Panagiotidis. As of\nFebruary 29, 2024, Mr. Panagiotidis beneficially owns 9,611,240 common shares, which includes 11,240 common shares acquired by Pani from Thalassa Investment Co. S.A., an entity\ncontrolled by Mr. Panagiotidis, on April 25, 2023. The 9,611,240 common shares represent 51.9% of common shares outstanding, net of treasury shares, as of February 29, 2024. Mr.\nPanagiotidis also beneficially owns through Pelagos 40,000 of the Company’s Series B Preferred Shares, representing all such Series B Preferred Shares outstanding, each Series B\nPreferred Share having the voting power of 100,000 common shares. For further information regarding the Series B Preferred Shares, refer to “Item 10. Additional Information—B.\nMemorandum and Articles of Association.” Mr. Panagiotidis therefore beneficially owns 51.7% of the Company’s total outstanding share capital, net of treasury shares and controls\n99.8% of the aggregate voting power of the Company’s total issued and outstanding share capital, net of treasury shares.\n(2) Excluding Petros Panagiotidis, none of the directors and executive officers individually, nor taken as a group, hold more than 1% of the outstanding common shares.\nAll of our common shareholders are entitled to one vote for each common share held. As of February 29, 2024 there were 11 holders of record of Toro’s common shares, seven of\nwhich have a U.S. mailing address. One of these holders is Cede & Co., a nominee company for The Depository Trust Company, which held approximately 47.3% of Toro’s outstanding\ncommon shares, net of treasury shares, as of the same date. The beneficial owners of the common shares held by Cede & Co. may include persons who reside outside the United States.\nB. Related Party Transactions\nFrom time to time, we have entered into agreements and have consummated transactions with certain related parties. We may enter into related party transactions from time to\ntime in the future. Related party transactions are subject to review and approval of a special committee composed solely of independent members of our Board.\nManagement, Commercial and Administrative Services\nOur vessels are commercially and technically managed by Castor Ships, a company controlled by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer under the Master Management\nAgreement entered into between Toro, Toro’s shipowning subsidiaries and Castor Ships with effect as of the date of the Distribution. Prior to our separation from Castor, the vessels\nowned by the Toro Subsidiaries were commercially and technically managed by Castor Ships pursuant to the Amended and Restated Master Management Agreement between Castor\nand Castor Ships, effective July 1, 2022, which is in substantially the same form as the Master Management Agreement described herein. The following is a summary of the Master\nManagement Agreement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the relevant agreement, which is attached as an exhibit hereto and incorporated by reference into\nthis Annual Report. Refer to Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further information.\nCastor Ships manages our business overall and provides us with a wide range of shipping services such as crew management, technical management, operational employment\nmanagement, insurance management, provisioning, bunkering, accounting and audit support services, commercial, chartering and administrative services, including, but not limited to,\nsecuring employment for our fleet, arranging and supervising the vessels’ commercial operations, providing technical assistance where requested in connection with the sale of a vessel,\nnegotiating loan and credit terms for new financing upon request and providing cybersecurity and general corporate and administrative services, among other matters. Castor Ships is\ngenerally not liable to us for any loss, damage, delay or expense incurred during the provision of the foregoing services, except insofar as such events arise from Castor Ships or its\nemployees’ fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct (for which our recovery will be limited to two times the Flat Management Fee, as defined below). Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, Castor Ships is in no circumstances responsible for the actions of the crews of our vessels. We have also agreed to indemnify Castor Ships in certain circumstances. Under\nthe terms of the Master Management Agreement, our shipowning subsidiaries have also entered into separate management agreements appointing Castor Ships as commercial and\ntechnical manager of their vessels (collectively, the “Ship Management Agreements”).\n69\nTable of Contents\nCastor Ships may choose to subcontract some of these services to other parties at its discretion. As of the date of this Annual Report, Castor Ships has subcontracted the\ntechnical management of all of our vessels to a third-party ship-management company, except for the M/T Wonder Mimosa, which Castor Ships has directly provided technical\nmanagement services to since June 7, 2023. Castor Ships pays, at its own expense, these third-party management companies a fee for the services it has subcontracted to them, without\nburdening the Company with any additional cost.\nIn exchange for these services, we pay Castor Ships (i) a flat quarterly management fee in the amount of $0.8 million for the management and administration of our business (the\n“Flat Management Fee”) , (ii) a commission of 1.25% on all gross income received from the operation of our vessels, and (iii) a commission of 1% on each consummated sale and\npurchase transaction. In addition, each of our vessel-owning subsidiaries pays Castor Ships a daily fee of $1,039 per vessel for the provision of commercial and technical ship\nmanagement services provided under the Ship Management Agreements (the “Ship Management Fee”). The Ship Management Fee and Flat Management Fee are adjusted annually for\ninflation on each anniversary of the Master Management Agreement’s effective date and, in accordance with the terms of the Master Management Agreement, the Ship Management\nFee increased from $975 per vessel per day to $1,039 per vessel per day and the Flat Management Fee increased from $0.75 million to $0.8 million effective July 1, 2023. We may also\nreimburse Castor Ships for extraordinary fees and costs, such as the costs of repairs, maintenance or structural changes to our vessels.\nThe Master Management Agreement has a term of eight years from its effective date and this term automatically renews for a successive eight-year term on each anniversary of\nthe effective date, starting from the first anniversary of the effective date, unless the agreements are terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions contained therein. In the event\nthat the Master Management Agreement is terminated by the Company or is terminated by Castor Ships due to a material breach of the Master Management Agreement by the Company\nor a change of control in the Company (including certain business combinations, such as a merger or the disposal of all or substantially all of our assets or changes in key personnel\nsuch as our current directors or Chief Executive Officer), Castor Ships is entitled to a termination fee equal to seven times the total amount of the Flat Management Fee calculated on an\nannual basis. This termination fee is in addition to any termination fees provided for under each Ship Management Agreement.\nThe V8 Plus Pool\nIn the period between September 30, 2022, and December 12, 2022, the M/T Wonder Polaris, M/T Wonder Sirius, M/T Wonder Bellatrix, M/T Wonder Musica, M/T Wonder Avior\nand M/T Wonder Vega, entered into a series of separate agreements with V8 Pool Inc. (“V8”), a member of the Navig8 Group of companies, for the participation of the vessels in the V8\nPlus Pool. Under the terms of the respective agreements, the vessels participated in the V8 Plus Pool for a minimum period of six months. During the period of the vessels’ participation,\neach was provided with certain commercial management services and entered into charters by the pool manager. In return for such services, the pool manager was entitled to a $250 daily\nfee and customary 2% commission on all income received under charters and contracts of affreightment. The relevant Toro Subsidiary received its proportional share of pool revenues,\nsubject to adjustments for expenses, among other factors. Each Toro Subsidiary was entitled to elect one voting representative to the pool’s committee, which approved (i) the basis for\ncalculating pool costs and (ii) requirements under which pool participants could have been required to make additional contributions to the pool’s working capital. Certain of the\nagreements contained trading restrictions for vessels not yet fully equipped with BWTS. The agreement was negotiated and approved by a special committee of independent\ndisinterested directors.\nIn February 2023, the agreement relating to the M/T Wonder Sirius’s participation in the V8 Plus Pool was terminated and the vessel commenced a period time charter. In\nDecember 2023, after the termination of the period time charter, the M/T Wonder Sirius was entered back into V8 Plus Pool. The V8 Plus Pool is managed by V8 Plus Management Pte Ltd.,\na company in which Petros Panagiotidis has a minority equity interest. Following the sales of the M/T Wonder Bellatrix and M/T Wonder Polaris in the second quarter of 2023, the M/T\nWonder Avior and M/T Wonder Musica in the third quarter of 2023, the M/T Wonder Vega in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the M/T Wonder Sirius in January 2024, the foregoing vessels’\nrespective pool agreements with the V8 Plus Pool were terminated.\nThe Spin-Off Resolutions\nOn November 15, 2022 and December 30, 2022, our Board resolved among other things, (i) to focus our efforts on our current business of tanker shipping services, (ii) that we\nhave no interest or expectancy to participate or pursue any opportunity in areas of business outside of the tanker shipping business and (iii) that Petros Panagiotidis, our director,\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer and controlling shareholder and his affiliates, such as Castor Ships, are not required to offer or inform us of any such opportunity. The foregoing Toro\nSpin-Off Resolutions do not preclude us, however, from pursuing opportunities outside of the tanker shipping business if in the future our Board determines to do so. Nevertheless,\nfocusing our operations on tanker and LPG carrier shipping may reduce the scope of opportunities we may exploit.\n70\nTable of Contents\nSimilarly on November 15, 2022 and December 30, 2022, Castor’s board resolved, among other things, (i) to focus its efforts on its current business of dry bulk shipping\nservices, (ii) that Castor has no interest or expectancy to participate or pursue any opportunity in areas of business outside of the dry bulk shipping business and (iii) that Petros\nPanagiotidis, its director, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and controlling shareholder and his affiliates are not required to offer or inform it of any such\nopportunity (such resolutions, the “Castor Spin-Off Resolutions”). This does not preclude Castor from pursuing opportunities outside of its declared business focus area, including in\nthe tanker shipping business, if in the future Castor’s board determines to do so and it has since entered into the container shipping sector.\nMr. Panagiotidis will continue to devote such portion of his business time and attention to our business as is appropriate and will also continue to devote substantial time to\nCastor’s business and other business and/or investment activities that Mr. Panagiotidis maintains now or in the future. Mr. Panagiotidis’ intention to provide adequate time and attention\nto other ventures will preclude him from devoting substantially all his time to our business. Our Board and Castor’s board have each resolved to accept this arrangement.\nContribution and Spin-Off Distribution Agreement\nThe following description of the Contribution and Spin-Off Distribution Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference\nto, the Contribution and Spin-Off Distribution Agreement, which is included as an exhibit to this Annual Report and incorporated by reference herein. The terms of the transactions\nwhich are the subject of the Contribution and Spin-Off Distribution Agreement were negotiated and approved by the Special Committee.\nWe entered into the Contribution and Spin-Off Distribution Agreement with Castor, pursuant to which (i) Castor contributed the Toro Subsidiaries to us in exchange for all our\n9,461,009 common shares at the time and 140,000 Series A Preferred Shares and the issue of 40,000 Series B Preferred Shares to Pelagos against payment of their nominal value, (ii) Castor\nagreed to indemnify us and our vessel-owning subsidiaries for any and all obligations and other liabilities arising from or relating to the operation, management or employment of vessels\nor subsidiaries it retains after to the Distribution Date and we agreed to indemnify Castor for any and all obligations and other liabilities arising from or relating to the operation,\nmanagement or employment of the vessels contributed to us or our vessel-owning subsidiaries, and (iii) we agreed to replace and replaced Castor as guarantor under the $18.0 million\nterm loan facility. The Contribution and Spin-Off Distribution Agreement also provided for the settlement or extinguishment of certain liabilities and other obligations between us and\nCastor.\nUnder the Contribution and Spin-Off Distribution Agreement, Castor distributed all of our 9,461,009 common shares at the time to holders of its common shares, with one of our\ncommon shares being distributed for every ten shares of Castor’s common shares held by Castor stockholders as of the close of business on February 22, 2023 (the “Record Date”).\nFurther, the Contribution and Spin-Off Distribution Agreement provides for certain registration rights to Castor relating to the common shares, if any, issued upon conversion of\nthe Series A Preferred Shares (the “Registerable Securities”). Such securities will cease to be registerable by us upon the earliest of (i) their sale pursuant to an effective registration\nstatement, (ii) their eligibility for sale or sale pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act, and (iii) the time at which they cease to be outstanding. Subject to Castor timely providing us with\nall information and documents reasonably requested by us in connection with such filings and to certain blackout periods, we have agreed to file, as promptly as practicable and in any\nevent no later than 30 calendar days after a request by Castor, one or more registration statements to register Registrable Securities then held by Castor and to use our reasonable best\nefforts to have each such registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable after such filing and keep such registration statement continuously effective until such\nregistration rights terminate. All fees and expenses incident to our performance of our obligations in connection with such registration rights shall be borne solely by us and Castor shall\npay any transfer taxes and fees and expenses of its counsel relating to a sale of Registrable Securities. These registration rights shall terminate on (i) the date occurring after the seventh\nanniversary of the original issue date of the Series A Preferred Shares on which Castor owns no Registrable Securities or (ii) if earlier, the date on which Castor owns no Series A\nPreferred Shares and no Registerable Securities.\nAny and all agreements and commitments, currently existing between us and our subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Castor and its subsidiaries, on the other hand, terminated as\nof March 7, 2023. None of these arrangements and commitments is deemed material to the Company. In particular, our vessel-owning subsidiaries ceased to be parties to the Amended\nand Restated Master Management Agreement and entered into the Master Management Agreement with Toro and Castor Ships described above. Our vessel-owning subsidiaries\nceased to be party to certain custodial and Cash Pooling Deeds entered into individually by each of such subsidiaries and Castor Maritime SCR Corp. and entered into substantively\nsimilar cash management and custodial arrangements with our wholly owned treasury subsidiary, Toro RBX Corp. Under the Contribution and Spin-Off Distribution Agreement, we also\nagreed to reimburse Castor for transaction expenses incurred in connection with our separation from Castor, such as adviser and filing fees. Following the Spin-Off, the Company\nreimbursed Castor $2,694,646 for expenses related to the Spin-Off that were incurred by Castor. As of December 31, 2023, there were no outstanding expenses to be reimbursed by the\nCompany under the Contribution and Spin-Off Distribution Agreement.\n71\nTable of Contents\nPurchase of Common Shares by Pani\nThe following description of the Subscription Agreement (as defined herein) does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to the\nSubscription Agreement, which is included as an exhibit to this Annual Report and incorporated by reference herein.\nOn April 17, 2023, Toro entered into a subscription agreement (the “Subscription Agreement”) with Pani, a company controlled by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,\npursuant to which Toro issued and sold, and Pani purchased, 8,500,000 common shares at a purchase price of $2.29 per share for gross proceeds of $19,465,000, less issuance costs of\n$817,764. The 8,500,000 common shares were issued on April 19, 2023 in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D promulgated thereunder.\nAs of February 29, 2024, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer beneficially owns through Pani 51.9% of our outstanding common shares, net of treasury shares, and controls 99.8%\nof the aggregate voting power of the Company’s total issued and outstanding share capital, net of treasury shares. See “Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—\nA. Major Shareholders” for further details.\nThe Subscription Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and covenants of each party. We granted Pani certain customary registration rights with respect\nto the common shares purchased thereunder and, following the exercise of such rights by Pani, we filed on November 13, 2023 a registration statement on Form F-3 relating to the\npossible offer and sale from time to time of up to 8,500,000 common shares by Pani.\nDividends to Castor on the Series A Preferred Shares\nAs discussed under “Item 4. Information on the Company—A. History and Development of the Company—Spin-Off from Castor”, which discussion is incorporated by\nreference herein, in connection with the Spin-Off Toro issued 140,000 Series A Preferred Shares to Castor on March 7, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, we had paid to Castor a dividend\namounting to $851,667 on the Series A Preferred Shares for the period from March 7, 2023 to October 14, 2023 and the accrued amount for the period from October 15, 2023 to December\n31, 2023 (included in the dividend period ended January 14, 2024) amounted to $315,000. Refer to “Item 10. Additional Information—B. Memorandum and Articles of Incorporation—\nDescription of the Series A Preferred Shares” for further information regarding the terms of the Series A Preferred Shares.\nPurchase by the Company of 5.00% Series D Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Shares of Castor\nOn August 7, 2023, we agreed to purchase 50,000 Castor Series D Preferred Shares for aggregate cash consideration of $50.0 million. The distribution rate on the Castor Series D\nPreferred Shares is 5.00% per annum, which rate will be multiplied by a factor of 1.3 on the seventh anniversary of the issue date of the Series D Preferred Shares and annually thereafter,\nsubject to a maximum distribution rate of 20% per annum in respect of any quarterly dividend period. Dividends on the Castor Series D Preferred Shares are payable quarterly in arrears\non the 15th day of January, April, July and October in each year, subject to approval by the board of directors of Castor. The first payment date occurred on October 16, 2023 and we\nreceived a dividend on the Castor Series D Preferred Shares amounting to $0.5 million.\nThe Castor Series D Preferred Shares are convertible, in whole or in part, at our option into common shares of Castor from the first anniversary of the issue date of the Castor\nSeries D Preferred Shares at the lower of (i) $0.70 per common shares and (ii) the 5 day value weighted average price immediately preceding the conversion. The conversion price of the\nCastor Series D Preferred Shares is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, including the occurrence of splits and combinations (including a reverse stock split) of\nthe common shares. The minimum conversion price is $0.30 per common share of Castor.\nThis transaction and its terms were approved by the independent members of the board of directors of each of Castor and Toro at the recommendation of their respective\nspecial committees composed of independent and disinterested directors, which negotiated the transaction and its terms.\nGrant of Restricted Common Shares to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nOn September 6, 2023, our Board adopted the Equity Incentive Plan, permitting the grant of up to 2,000,000 common shares to eligible participants. See “Item 5. Operating and\nFinancial Review and Prospects—B. Liquidity and Capital Resources—Equity Transactions” and “Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees—B. Compensation” for a\ndescription of the Equity Incentive Plan. See also Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further information.\nC. Interests of Experts and Counsel\nNot applicable.\n72\nTable of Contents\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nA. Consolidated Statements and other Financial Information\nPlease see “Item 18. Financial Statements.”\nLegal Proceedings\nTo our knowledge, we are not currently a party to any legal proceedings that, if adversely determined, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of\noperations or liquidity. As such, we do not believe that pending legal proceedings, taken as a whole, should have any significant impact on our financial statements. We are, and from\ntime to time in the future may be, subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, principally personal injury and property casualty claims. While we expect\nthat these claims would be covered by our existing insurance policies, those claims, even if lacking merit, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.\nDividend Policy\nWe are a recently formed company and have a limited performance record and operating history. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to pay dividends on our\ncommon shares at all, and our ability to pay dividends will be subject to the limitations set forth below and under “Item 3. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Common Shares—We do\nnot have a declared dividend policy and our Board may never declare dividends on our common shares.”\nWe do not have a declared dividend policy. Under our Bylaws, our Board may declare and pay dividends in cash, stock or other property of the Company. Any dividends\ndeclared will be in the sole discretion of the Board and will depend upon factors such as earnings, increased cash needs and expenses, restrictions in any of our agreements (including\nour current and future credit facilities), overall market conditions, current capital expenditure programs and investment opportunities, and the provisions of Marshall Islands law affecting\nthe payment of distributions to shareholders (as described below), and will be subject to the priority of our Series A Preferred Shares. The foregoing is not an exhaustive list of factors\nwhich may impact the payment of dividends.\nDividends on our Series A Preferred Shares accrue and are cumulative from their issue date and are payable quarterly, assuming dividends have been declared by our Board or\nany authorized committee thereof out of legally available funds for such purpose. From, and including, their issue date to, but excluding, the seventh anniversary of the issue date (the\n“reset date”), the dividend rate for the Series A Preferred Shares is 1.00% per annum of the stated amount of $1,000 per share; for each quarterly dividend period commencing on or after\nthe reset date, the dividend rate will be the dividend rate in effect for the prior quarterly dividend period multiplied by a factor of 1.3; provided, however, that the dividend rate will not\nexceed 20% per annum in respect of any quarterly dividend period. We may redeem the Series A Preferred Shares at any time on or after the reset date, in whole or in part, at a redemption\nprice of $1,000 per share plus an amount equal to all accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon to the date of redemption, whether or not declared. The rights of the holders of our Series\nA Preferred Shares rank senior to the obligations to holders of our common shares. This means that, unless accumulated dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on all of our\noutstanding Series A Preferred Shares for all past completed dividend periods, no distributions may be declared or paid on our common shares subject to limited exceptions.\nThe Series A Preferred Shares are convertible, in whole or in part, at their holder’s option, to common shares at any time and from time to time from and after the third\nanniversary of their issue date and prior to the reset date. Subject to certain adjustments, the “Conversion Price” for any conversion of the Series A Preferred Shares shall be the lower of\n(i) 150% of the VWAP of our common shares over the five consecutive trading day period commencing on and including March 7, 2023, and (ii) the VWAP of our Common Shares over\nthe 10 consecutive trading day period expiring on the trading day immediately prior to the date of delivery of written notice of the conversion; provided, that, in no event shall the\nConversion Price be less than $2.50. The number of Common Shares to be issued to a converting holder shall be equal to the quotient of (i) the aggregate stated amount of the Series A\nPreferred Shares converted plus Accrued Dividends (but excluding any dividends declared but not yet paid) thereon on the date on which the conversion notice is delivered divided by\n(ii) the Conversion Price.\nIn the event that we declare a dividend of the stock of a subsidiary which we control, the holder(s) of the Series B Preferred Shares are entitled to receive preferred shares of\nsuch subsidiary. Such preferred shares will have at least substantially identical rights and preferences to our Series B Preferred Shares and will be issued pro rata to holder(s) of the\nSeries B Preferred Shares. The Series B Preferred Shares have no other dividend or distribution rights.\nSee “Item 10. Additional Information—B.

In addition, under Marshall Islands law, we may not pay dividends on or redeem any shares of capital stock if we are insolvent or would be rendered\ninsolvent by the payment of such a dividend or the making of such redemption.\nAny dividends paid by us may be treated as ordinary income to a U.S. shareholder. Please see the section entitled “Item 10. Additional Information—E. Taxation—U.S.\nFederal Income Tax Considerations—U.S. Federal Income Taxation of U.S. Holders—Distributions” for additional information relating to the U.S. federal income tax treatment of our\ndividend payments, if any are declared in the future.\nWe have not paid any dividends to our shareholders as of the date of this Annual Report.\nB. Significant Changes\nIn January 2024, we used part of the proceeds of the sale of the M/T Wonder Sirius to fully prepay the remaining outstanding balance of $5.3 million under the $18.0 million term\nloan facility, our only outstanding loan facility under which the M/T Wonder Sirius served as security. As a result, we have no outstanding indebtedness under any facility as of the date\nof this Annual Report. Further, as a result of the sale, we no longer have any Aframax/LR2 vessels and management has determined that, with effect from the second quarter of 2024, we\noperate in two reportable segments: (i) the Handysize tanker segment and (ii) the LPG carrier segment.\nFrom January 1, 2024 and as of February 29, 2024, the Company repurchased 476,970 shares of common stock for aggregate consideration of $2.8 million under its share\nrepurchase program.\nThere have been no significant changes since the date of our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, other than those described above and in Note\n18 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nITEM 9.

Memorandum and Articles of Association\nArticles of Association and Bylaws\nThe following is a description of material terms of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. Because this description is a summary, it does not contain all information that you\nmay find useful. For more complete information, you should read our Articles of Incorporation and our Bylaws, as amended, copies of which are filed as exhibits to this Annual Report\nand are incorporated herein by reference.\nAny amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to alter our capital structure requires approval by an affirmative majority of the voting power of the total number of shares\nissued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereon. Shareholders of any series or class of shares are entitled to vote upon any proposed amendment, whether or not entitled to vote\nthereon by the Articles of Incorporation, if such amendment would (i) increase or decrease the par value of the shares of such series or class, or (ii) alter or change the powers,\npreferences or special rights of the shares of such series or class so as to adversely affect them. Such class vote would be conducted in addition to the vote of all shares entitled to vote\nupon the amendment and requires approval by an affirmative majority of the voting power of the affected series or class.\nPurpose\nOur purpose is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may now or hereafter be organized under the BCA. However, in connection with the Spin-Off, our\nBoard has resolved to focus our efforts on our then-current business of tanker shipping services, though we have since expanded into LPG carrier services in accordance with such\nresolutions. See “Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—B. Related Party Transactions—The Spin-Off Resolutions” for further details. Our Articles of\nIncorporation and Bylaws, as amended, do not impose any limitations on the ownership rights of our shareholders.\nShareholders’ Meetings\nThe time and place of our annual meeting of shareholders is determined by our Board. Our first annual meeting of shareholders was held on November 15, 2022. Special\nmeetings of the shareholders, unless otherwise prescribed by law, may be called for any purpose or purposes permitted under applicable law (i) at any time by the Chairman, Chief\nExecutive Officer or President of the Company or a majority of the Board and (ii) by shareholders holding more than 50% of the voting rights in the Company. No other person or persons\nare permitted to call a special meeting, unless otherwise prescribed by law. The Board may fix a record date of not more than sixty (60) nor less than fifteen (15) days prior to the date of\nany meeting of shareholders.\nAuthorized Capitalization\nUnder our Articles of Incorporation, our authorized capital stock consists of 3,900,000,000 common shares, par value $0.001 per share and 100,000,000 preferred shares, par value\n$0.001 per share. As of December 31, 2023 and as of February 29, 2024, 19,021,758 and 18,978,409 common shares were issued and 18,978,409 and 18,501,439 common shares were\noutstanding, net of 43,349 and 476,970 common shares repurchased under the Repurchase Program and held by us as treasury shares and inclusive of 1,240,000 restricted common\nshares issued pursuant to Equity Incentive Plan, 140,000 Series A Preferred Shares were issued and outstanding, 40,000 Series B Preferred Shares were issued and outstanding and no\nSeries C Participating Preferred Shares were authorized, respectively. Authorization for the issuance of Series C Participating Preferred Shares in connection with our Rights Agreement is\nvalid until the expiry of such agreement. See “Item 10. Additional Information—B. Memorandum and Articles of Association—Shareholder Protection Rights Agreement” for\nadditional details.\nOn November 14, 2022, Castor, in its capacity as our sole shareholder, authorized our Board to effect one or more reverse stock splits of our common shares issued and\noutstanding at the time of the reverse stock split at a cumulative exchange ratio of between one-for-two and one-for-five hundred shares. Our Board may determine, in its sole discretion,\nwhether to implement any reverse stock split by filing an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation, as well as the specific timing and ratio, within such approved range of ratios;\nprovided that any such reverse stock split or splits are implemented prior to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders in 2026. This authorization was intended to provide us the\nmeans to maintain compliance with the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, and in particular the minimum bid price requirement, if required, as well as to realize\ncertain beneficial effects of a higher trading price for our common shares, including the ability to appeal to certain investors and potentially increased trading liquidity under appropriate\ncircumstances.\n75\nTable of Contents\nDescription of the Common Shares\nFor a description of our common shares, see “Description of Common Shares” in Exhibit 2.2 (Description of Securities), which description is incorporated by reference herein. As of\nFebruary 29, 2024, Pani, a corporation controlled by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, owned 51.9% of our outstanding common shares, net of treasury shares, which makes it\nmore difficult to effect a change of control of us.\nPreferred Shares\nOur Articles of Incorporation authorize our Board to establish one or more series of preferred shares and to determine, with respect to any series of preferred shares, the terms\nand rights of that series, including:\n• the designation of the series;\n• the number of shares of the series;\n• the preferences and relative, participating, option or other special rights, if any, and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such series; and\n• the voting rights, if any, of the holders of the series.\nDescription of the Series A Preferred Shares\nThe number of designated Series A Preferred Shares initially is 140,000 and the “stated amount” per Series A Preferred Share is $1,000. We have issued all Series A Preferred\nShares to Castor. The Series A Preferred Shares have the following characteristics:\n• Ranking. With respect to the payment of dividends and distributions of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the Series A Preferred shares rank (i) senior\nto our common shares, the Series B Preferred Shares and any class or series of our stock that ranks junior to the Series A Preferred Shares in the payment of dividends or in\nthe distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up (together with our common stock, “Junior Stock”); (ii) senior to or on a parity with the Series C\nPreferred Shares and each other series of our preferred shares we may issue with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions of assets upon any liquidation,\ndissolution or winding up of the Company; and (iii) junior to all existing and future indebtedness and other non-equity claims on us.\n• Dividends. Holders of Series A Preferred Shares shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by our Board, but only out of funds legally available therefor,\ncumulative cash dividends at the Annual Rate and no more, payable quarterly in arrears on the 15th day of each January, April, July and October, respectively, in each year,\nbeginning on April 15, 2023 (each, a “Dividend Payment Date”), with respect to the Dividend Period ending on the day preceding such respective Dividend Payment Date,\nto holders of record on the 15th calendar day before such Dividend Payment Date or such other record date not more than 30 days preceding such Dividend Payment Date\nfixed for that purpose by our Board (or a duly authorized committee of the Board) in advance of payment of each particular dividend. The amount of the dividend per Series\nA Preferred Share for each Dividend Period will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.\n“Annual Rate” means from, and including, the Issue Date to, but excluding, the seventh anniversary of the Issue Date (the “Reset Date”), 1.00% per annum of the stated\namount. For each Dividend Period commencing on or after the Reset Date, the Annual Rate shall be the Annual Rate in effect for the prior Dividend Period multiplied by a\nfactor of 1.3; provided, however, that in no event will the Annual Rate on the Series A Preferred Shares exceed 20% per annum in respect of any Dividend Period.\n“Dividend Period” means each period commencing on (and including) a Dividend Payment Date and continuing to (but not including) the next succeeding Dividend\nPayment Date, except that the first Dividend Period for the initial issuance of the Series A Preferred Shares shall commence on (and include) the Issue Date.\n“Issue Date” means the Distribution Date.\n76\nTable of Contents\n• Restrictions on Dividends, Redemption and Repurchases. So long as any Series A Preferred Share remains outstanding, unless full Accrued Dividends on all outstanding\nSeries A Preferred Shares through and including the most recently completed Dividend Period have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has\nbeen set aside for payment, no dividend may be declared or paid or set aside for payment, and no distribution may be made, on any Junior Stock, other than a dividend\npayable solely in stock that ranks junior to the Series A Preferred Shares in the payment of dividends and in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or\nwinding up of the Company. “Accrued Dividends” means, with respect to Series A Preferred Shares, an amount computed at the Annual Rate from, as to each share, the\ndate of issuance of such share to and including the date to which such dividends are to be accrued (whether or not such dividends have been declared), less the aggregate\namount of all dividends previously paid on such share.\nSo long as any Series A Preferred Share remains outstanding, unless full Accrued Dividends on all outstanding Series A Preferred Shares through and including the most\nrecently completed Dividend Period have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside for payment, no monies may be paid or\nmade available for a sinking fund for the redemption or retirement of Junior Stock, nor shall any shares of Junior Stock be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for\nconsideration by us, directly or indirectly, other than (i) as a result of (x) a reclassification of Junior Stock, or (y) the exchange or conversion of one share of Junior Stock for\nor into another share of stock that ranks junior to the Series A Preferred Shares in the payment of dividends and in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution\nor winding up of the Company; or (ii) through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of stock that rank junior to the Series A\nPreferred Shares in the payment of dividends and in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company.\n• Redemption. The Series A Preferred Shares are perpetual and have no maturity date. We may, at our option, redeem the Series A Preferred Shares in whole or in part, at any\ntime and from time to time after the Reset Date, at a cash redemption price equal to the stated amount, together with an amount equal to all Accrued Dividends to, but\nexcluding, the redemption date.\n• Conversion Rights. The Series A Preferred Shares are convertible, at their holder’s option, to common shares, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time from and\nafter the third anniversary of the Issue Date until but excluding the Reset Date. Subject to certain adjustments, the “Conversion Price” for any conversion of the Series A\nPreferred Shares shall be the lower of (i) 150% of the VWAP of our common shares over the five consecutive trading day period commencing on and including the\nDistribution Date, and (ii) the VWAP of our common shares over the 10 consecutive trading day period expiring on the trading day immediately prior to the date of delivery\nof written notice of the conversion; provided, that, in no event shall the Conversion Price be less than $2.50. The number of common shares to be issued to a converting\nholder shall be equal to the quotient of (i) the aggregate stated amount of the Series A Preferred Shares converted plus Accrued Dividends (but excluding any dividends\ndeclared but not yet paid) thereon on the date on which the conversion notice is delivered divided by (ii) the Conversion Price. Castor will have registration rights in\nrelation to the common shares issued upon conversion. See “Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—B. Related Party Transactions—Contribution\nand Spin-Off Distribution Agreement.” The Series A Preferred Shares otherwise are not convertible into or exchangeable for property or shares of any other series or class\nof our capital stock.\n• Liquidation Rights. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, before any distribution or\npayment out of our assets may be made to or set aside for the holders of any Junior Stock, holders of Series A Preferred Shares will be entitled to receive out of our assets\nlegally available for distribution to our shareholders an amount equal to the stated amount per share ($1,000), together with an amount equal to all Accrued Dividends to\nthe date of payment whether or not earned or declared (the “Liquidation Preference”). If the Liquidation Preference has been paid in full to all holders of Series A Preferred\nShares and all holders of any class or series of our stock that ranks on a parity with Series A Preferred Shares in the distribution of assets on liquidation, dissolution or\nwinding up of the Company, the holders of Junior Stock will be entitled to receive all of our remaining assets according to their respective rights and preferences.\n77\nTable of Contents\n• Voting Rights. Except as indicated below or otherwise required by law, the holders of the Series A Preferred Shares do not have any voting rights.\n○ Right to Elect Directors on Nonpayment of Dividends. If and whenever dividends payable on Series A Preferred Shares or any class or series of our stock that ranks\non a parity with the Series A Preferred Shares in the payment of dividends (“Dividend Parity Stock”) having voting rights equivalent to those described in this\nparagraph (“Voting Parity Stock”) have not been declared and paid (or, in the case of Series A Preferred Shares and Voting Parity Stock bearing dividends on a\ncumulative basis, shall be in arrears) in an aggregate amount equal to full dividends for at least six quarterly Dividend Periods or their equivalent (whether or not\nconsecutive) (a “Nonpayment Event”), the number of directors then constituting our Board shall be automatically increased by (i) one, if at such time the Board\nconsists of eight or fewer directors or (ii) two, if at such time the Board consists of nine or more directors, and the holders of Series A Preferred Shares, together with\nthe holders of any outstanding Voting Parity Stock then entitled to vote for additional directors, voting together as a single class in proportion to their respective\nstated amounts, shall be entitled to elect the additional director or two directors, as the case may be (the “Preferred Share Directors”); provided that our Board shall at\nno time include more than two Preferred Share Directors (including, for purposes of this limitation, all directors that the holders of any series of voting preferred shares\nare entitled to elect pursuant to like voting rights). When (i) Accrued Dividends have been paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for payment thereof set aside) in full\non the Series A Preferred Shares after a Nonpayment Event, and (ii) the rights of holders of any Voting Parity Stock to participate in electing the Preferred Share\nDirectors shall have ceased, the right of holders of the Series A Preferred Shares to participate in the election of Preferred Share Directors shall cease (but subject\nalways to the revesting of such voting rights in the case of any future Nonpayment Event), the terms of office of all the Preferred Share Directors shall forthwith\nterminate, and the number of directors constituting our Board shall automatically be reduced accordingly. Any Preferred Share Director may be removed at any time\nwithout cause by the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding Series A Preferred Shares and Voting Parity Stock, when they have the voting rights described\nabove (voting together as a single class in proportion to their respective stated amounts). The Preferred Share Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director\non any matter that shall come before our Board for a vote.\n○ Other Voting Rights. So long as any Series A Preferred Shares are outstanding, in addition to any other vote or consent of shareholders required by law or by our\nArticles of Incorporation, the vote or consent of the holders of at least two thirds of the Series A Preferred Shares at the time outstanding, voting together with any\nother series of preferred shares that would be adversely affected in substantially the same manner and entitled to vote as a single class in proportion to their respective\nstated amounts (to the exclusion of all other series of preferred shares), given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at any meeting called\nfor the purpose, will be necessary for effecting or validating: (i) any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of our Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws that\nwould alter or change the voting powers, preferences or special rights of the Series A Preferred Shares so as to affect them adversely; (ii) the issuance of Dividend\nParity Stock if the Accrued Dividends on all outstanding Series A Preferred Shares through and including the most recently completed Dividend Period have not been\npaid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside for payment; (iii) any amendment or alteration of the Articles of Incorporation to\nauthorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any shares of any class or series or any securities convertible into shares of any class or series of our capital\nstock ranking prior to Series A in the payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company; or (iv) any\nconsummation of (x) a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series A Preferred Shares, (y) a merger or consolidation of the Company with another\nentity (whether or not a corporation), or (z) a conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance of the Company into another entity or an entity organized under the\nlaws of another jurisdiction, unless in each case (A) the Series A Preferred Shares remain outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect\nto which we are not the surviving or resulting entity, or any such conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance, the Series A Preferred Shares are converted into\nor exchanged for preference securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, and (B) such shares remaining outstanding or such preference\nsecurities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions, and limitations and restrictions thereof,\ntaken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and restrictions and limitations\nthereof, of the Series A Preferred Shares immediately prior to such consummation, taken as a whole. The foregoing voting rights do not apply in connection with the\ncreation or issuance of Series C Participating Preferred Shares of the Company substantially in the form approved by the Board in connection with the Shareholder\nProtection Rights Agreement.\n• No Preemptive Rights; No Sinking Fund. Holders of the Series A Preferred Shares do not have any preemptive rights. The Series A Preferred Shares will not be subject to\nany sinking fund or any other obligation of us for their repurchase or retirement.\nThe Series A Preferred Shares have been classified in Mezzanine equity as per ASC 480-10-S99 “Distinguishing liabilities from Equity – SEC Materials” as they are in essence\nredeemable at the option of the holder as our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and controlling shareholder, Mr. Panagiotidis, can effectively determine the timing of the redemption of\nthe Series A Preferred Shares. For further information, see Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n78\nTable of Contents\nDescription of the Series B Preferred Shares\nOn March 7, 2023, we issued all of our 40,000 authorized Series B Preferred Shares to Pelagos. Pelagos is a company controlled by Petros Panagiotidis, our Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer and Castor’s Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. As a result, we are controlled by Mr. Panagiotidis, making it more difficult to effect a change\nof control of us.\nThe Series B Preferred Shares have the following characteristics:\n• Conversion. The Series B Preferred Shares are not convertible into common shares.\n• Distributions. In the event that we declare a dividend of the stock of a subsidiary which we control, the holder(s) of the Series B Preferred Shares are entitled to receive\npreferred shares of such subsidiary. Such preferred shares will have at least substantially identical rights and preferences to our Series B Preferred Shares and be issued in\nan equivalent number to our Series B Preferred Shares. The Series B Preferred Shares have no other dividend or distribution rights.\n• Voting. Each Series B Preferred Share has the voting power of 100,000 common shares and counts for 100,000 votes for purposes of determining quorum at a meeting of\nshareholders, subject to adjustment to maintain a substantially identical voting interest in Toro following the (i) creation or issuance of a new series of shares of the\nCompany carrying more than one vote per share to be issued to any person other than holders of the Series B Preferred Shares, except for the creation (but not the\nissuance) of Series C Participating Preferred Shares substantially in the form approved by the Board and included as an exhibit to this Annual Report, without the prior\naffirmative vote of a majority of votes cast by the holders of the Series B Preferred Shares or (ii) issuance or approval of common shares pursuant to and in accordance with\nthe Shareholder Protection Rights Agreement. The Series B Preferred Shares vote together with the common shares as a single class, except that the Series B Preferred\nShares vote separately as a class on amendments to the Articles of Incorporation that would materially alter or change the powers, preference or special rights of the Series\nB Preferred Shares.\n• Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up. Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the Series B Preferred Shares shall have the same liquidation\nrights as and pari passu with the common shares up to their par value of $0.001 per share and, thereafter, the Series B Preferred Shares have no right to participate further in\nthe liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company.\nDescription of the Series C Participating Preferred Shares\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, no Series C Participating Preferred Shares were authorized in connection with our Rights Agreement (as defined below). See “Item 10.\nAdditional Information—B. Memorandum and Articles—Shareholder Protection Rights Agreement.” If issued, the Series C Participating Preferred Shares will, among other things:\n• not be redeemable;\n• entitle holders to dividend payments in an amount per share equal to the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and the aggregate per share amount (payable in\nkind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions other than a dividend payable in our common shares or a subdivision of our outstanding common shares (by\nreclassification or otherwise) declared on our common shares; and\n• entitle holders to 1,000 votes per Series C Participating Preferred Share on all matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the Company.\nEach one one-thousandth of a Series C Participating Preferred Share issued in connection with the Rights Agreement should approximate the value of one common share.\nShareholder Protection Rights Agreement\nOn the Distribution Date, our Board declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a “Right” or the “Rights”) for each outstanding common share and adopted a\nshareholder rights plan, as set forth in the Shareholder Protection Rights Agreement (the “Rights Agreement”) entered into between the Company and Broadridge Corporate Issuer\nSolutions, Inc., as rights agent (the “Rights Agent”) on the same date. Each Right trades with, and are inseparable from, our common shares, entitles the holder to purchase from the\nCompany, for $22, one common share (or one one-thousandth of a share of Series C Participating Preferred Shares) and will become exercisable following the earlier of (i) the tenth\nbusiness day (or other date designated by resolution of the Board) after any person other than our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Petros Panagiotidis, or Mr. Panagiotidis’\ncontrolled affiliates commences a tender offer that would result in such person becoming the beneficial owner of a total of 15% or more of the common shares or (ii) the date of the “Flip-\nin” Trigger, as defined below. For additional details, see the Rights Agreement included as an exhibit to this Annual Report.\n79\nTable of Contents\nThe rights plan adopted under the Rights Agreement and the Rights have the following characteristics:\n• Distribution and Transfer of the Rights. Our Board will declare a dividend of one Right for each share of our common shares outstanding. Prior to the Separation Time\nreferred to below, the Rights would be evidenced by and trade with our common shares and would not be exercisable. After the Separation Time, we would cause the Rights\nAgent to mail Rights certificates to shareholders and the Rights would trade independent of the common shares. New Rights will accompany any new common shares of\nthe Company issued after the Distribution until the Separation Time.\n• Separation Time. Rights would separate from our common shares and become exercisable following the earlier of (i) the tenth (10) business day (or other date designated\nby resolution of the Board) after any person (other than Mr. Panagiotidis or his controlled affiliates) commences a tender offer that would result in such person becoming\nthe beneficial owner of a total of 15% or more of the common shares or (ii) the date of the “Flip-in” Trigger.\n• Exercise of the Rights. On or after the Separation Time, each Right would initially entitle the holder to purchase, for $22 (the “Exercise Price”), one common share (or one\none-thousandth of a share of Series C Participating Preferred Shares, such portion of a Series C Participating Preferred Share being designed to give the shareholder\napproximately the same dividend, voting and liquidation rights as would one common share). Prior to exercise, the Right does not give its holder any dividend, voting, or\nliquidation rights.\n• “Flip-in” Trigger. Upon public announcement by the Company that any person other than Mr. Panagiotidis or his controlled affiliates (an “Acquiring Person”) has\nacquired 15% or more of our outstanding common shares:\n(i) Rights owned by the Acquiring Person or transferees thereof would automatically be void; and\n(ii) each other Right will automatically become a right to buy, for the Exercise Price, that number of common shares of the Company (or equivalent fractional shares of\nSeries C Participating Preferred Shares) having a market value of twice the Exercise Price.\n• “Flip-over” Trigger. After an Acquiring Person has become such, (i) the Company may not consolidate or merge with any person, if the Company’s Board is controlled by\nthe Acquiring Person or the Acquiring Person is the beneficial owner of 50% or more of the outstanding shares of our common shares, and the transaction is with the\nAcquiring Person or its affiliate or associate or the shares owned by the Acquiring Person are treated differently from those of other shareholders, and (ii) the Company\nmay not sell 50% or more of its assets if the Company’s Board is controlled by the Acquiring Person unless in either case proper provision is made so that each Right\nwould thereafter become a right to buy, for the Exercise Price, that number of common shares of such other person having a market value of twice the Exercise Price.\n• Redemption. The Rights may be redeemed by the Board, at any time until a “Flip-in” Trigger has occurred, at a redemption price of $0.001 per Right.\n• Power to Amend. Our Board may amend the Rights Agreement in any respect until a “Flip-in” Trigger has occurred. Thereafter, our Board may amend the Rights\nAgreement in any respect not materially adverse to Rights holders generally.\n• Expiration. The Rights will expire on the tenth anniversary of the Distribution Date.\nFurthermore, if any person (other than Mr. Panagiotidis or his controlled affiliates) acquires between 15% and 50% of our outstanding common shares, the Board may, in lieu of\nallowing Rights to be exercised, require each outstanding Right to be exchanged for one common share of the Company (or one one-thousandth of a share of Series C Participating\nPreferred Shares). The Board may enter into a trust agreement pursuant to which the Company would deposit into a trust its common shares that would be distributable to shareholders\n(excluding the Acquiring Person) in the event this exchange option is implemented.\nCertain synthetic interests in securities created by derivative positions, whether or not such interests are considered to be ownership of the underlying common shares or are\nreportable for purposes of Regulation 13D of the Exchange Act, as amended, are treated as beneficial ownership of the number of our common shares equivalent to the economic\nexposure created by the derivative position, to the extent our actual common shares are directly or indirectly held by counterparties to the derivatives contracts. Swaps dealers\nunassociated with any control intent or intent to evade the purposes of the Rights Agreement are excepted from such imputed beneficial ownership.\nThe Rights Agreement “grandfathers” the current level of ownership of persons who, prior to the date of the Rights Agreement, beneficially owned 15% or more of our\noutstanding common shares, so long as they do not purchase additional shares in excess of certain limitations. Such provisions also “grandfather” our Chairman and Chief Executive\nOfficer, Petros Panagiotidis, and Mr. Panagiotidis’ controlled affiliates.\n80\nTable of Contents\nThe Rights may have anti-takeover effects. The Rights will cause substantial dilution to any person or group that attempts to acquire us without the approval of our Board. As\na result, the overall effect of the Rights may be to render more difficult or discourage any attempt to acquire us. Because our Board can approve a redemption of the Rights for a\npermitted offer, the Rights should not interfere with a merger or other business combination approved by our Board.\nThe foregoing description of the Rights Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to the Rights Agreement, which\nis included as an exhibit to this Annual Report.\nTransfer Agent\nThe registrar and transfer agent for our common shares is Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, Inc.\nExclusive Forum\nOur Bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the High Court of the Republic of Marshall Islands shall be the sole and exclusive\nforum for any internal corporate claim, intra-corporate claim, or claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine and that the United States District Court for the Southern District of New\nYork shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any claim arising under the Securities Act or Exchange Act. If the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York does\nnot have jurisdiction over the claims assigned to it by our exclusive forum provisions, any other federal district court of the United States may hear such claims. Any person or entity\npurchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of capital stock of the Company shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to this exclusive forum provision.\nThe exclusive forum provision in our Bylaws will not relieve us of our duties to comply with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and our\nshareholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations. In particular, Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction\nover all claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder, and Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent\njurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder.\nMarshall Islands Company Law Considerations\nFor a description of significant differences between the statutory provisions of the BCA and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware relating to shareholders’\nrights, refer to Exhibit 2.2 (Description of Securities).\nC. Material Contracts\nWe refer you to “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—B. Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party\nTransactions—B. Related Party Transactions” for a discussion of certain material contracts to which we are a party.\nD. Exchange Controls\nThe Marshall Islands impose no exchange controls on non-resident corporations.\nE. Taxation\nThe following is a discussion of the material Marshall Islands and U.S. federal income tax considerations relevant to a U.S. Holder and a Non-U.S. Holder, each as defined below,\nwith respect to the common shares. This discussion does not purport to deal with the tax consequences of owning common shares to all categories of investors, such as dealers in\nsecurities or commodities, traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for securities holdings, financial institutions, insurance companies, tax-exempt\norganizations, U.S. expatriates, persons liable for the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income, persons liable for the alternative minimum tax, persons who hold common\nshares as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion transaction or integrated investment, persons that purchase or sell common shares as part of a wash sale for tax purposes, U.S. Holders\nwhose functional currency is not the United States dollar, and investors that own, actually or under applicable constructive ownership rules, 10% or more of our common shares. This\ndiscussion deals only with holders who hold our common shares as a capital asset. You are encouraged to consult your own tax advisers concerning the overall tax consequences\narising in your own particular situation under U.S. federal, state, local or foreign law of the ownership of common shares. The discussion below is based, in part, on the description of our\nbusiness in this Annual Report above and assumes that we conduct our business as described in that section. Except as otherwise noted, this discussion is based on the assumption\nthat we will not maintain an office or other fixed place of business within the United States.\n81\nTable of Contents\nMarshall Islands Tax Consequences\nWe are incorporated in the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Under current Marshall Islands law, we are not subject to tax on income or capital gains, and no Marshall Islands\nwithholding tax will be imposed upon payments of dividends by us to our shareholders, and holders of our common shares that are not residents of or domiciled or carrying on any\ncommercial activity in the Republic of the Marshall Islands will not be subject to Marshall Islands tax on the sale or other disposition of our common shares.\nU.S. Federal Income Taxation of Our Company\nTaxation of Operating Income: In General\nUnless exempt from U.S. federal income taxation under the rules discussed below, a foreign corporation is subject to U.S. federal income taxation in respect of any income that is\nderived from the use of vessels, from the hiring or leasing of vessels for use on a time, voyage or bareboat charter basis, from the participation in a pool, partnership, strategic alliance,\njoint operating agreement, cost sharing arrangements or other joint venture it directly or indirectly owns or participates in that generates such income, or from the performance of\nservices directly related to those uses, which we refer to collectively as “shipping income,” to the extent that the shipping income is derived from sources within the United States. For\nthese purposes, 50% of shipping income that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends, but that does not begin and end, in the United States constitutes income from sources\nwithin the United States, which we refer to as “U.S. source gross shipping income” or USSGTI.\nShipping income attributable to transportation that begins and ends in the United States is U.S. source income. We are not permitted by law to engage in such transportation\nand thus will not earn income that is considered to be 100% derived from sources within the United States.\nShipping income attributable to transportation between non-U.S. ports is considered to be derived from sources outside the United States. Such income is not subject to U.S.\ntax.\nIf not exempt from tax under Section 883 of the Code, our USSGTI would be subject to a tax of 4% without allowance for any deductions (“the 4% tax”) as described below.\nExemption of Operating Income from U.S. Federal Income Taxation\nUnder Section 883 of the Code and the regulations thereunder, we will be exempt from the 4% tax on our USSGTI if:\n(1) we are organized in a foreign country that grants an “equivalent exemption” to corporations organized in the United States; and\n(2) either\n(a) more than 50% of the value of our stock is owned, directly or indirectly, by individuals who are “residents” of a foreign country that grants an “equivalent exemption”\nto corporations organized in the United States (each such individual is a “qualified shareholder” and collectively, “qualified shareholders”), which we refer to as the\n“50% Ownership Test,” or\n(b) our stock is “primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market” in our country of organization, in another country that grants an “equivalent\nexemption” to U.S. corporations, or in the United States, which we refer to as the “Publicly-Traded Test.”\nThe Marshall Islands, the jurisdiction in which we and our ship-owning subsidiaries are incorporated, grants an “equivalent exemption” to U.S. corporations. Therefore, we will\nbe exempt from the 4% on our USSGTI if we meet either the 50% Ownership Test or the Publicly Traded Test.\nDue to the widely dispersed nature of the ownership of our common shares, it is highly unlikely that we will satisfy the requirements of the 50% Ownership Test. Therefore, we\nexpect to be exempt from the 4% tax on our USSGTI only if we can satisfy the Publicly-Traded Test.\nTreasury Regulations provide, in pertinent part, that stock of a foreign corporation must be “primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in the U.S. or in a\nqualified foreign country.” To be “primarily traded” on an established securities market, the number of shares of each class of our stock that are traded during any taxable year on all\nestablished securities markets in the country where they are listed must exceed the number of shares in each such class that are traded during that year on established securities markets\nin any other country. Our common shares, which are traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market, meet the test of being “primarily traded.”\n82\nTable of Contents\nTo be “regularly traded” one or more classes of our stock representing more than 50% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and of the total\nvalue of the stock that is listed must be listed on an established securities market (“the vote and value” test) and meet certain other requirements. Our common shares are listed on the\nNasdaq Capital Market but do not represent more than 50% of the voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote. Our Series B Preferred Shares, which have super voting rights and\nhave voting control but are not entitled to dividends, are not listed. Thus, based on a strict reading of the vote and value test described above, our stock is not “regularly traded.”\nTreasury Regulations provide, in pertinent part, that a class of stock will not be considered to be “regularly traded” on an established securities market for any taxable year in\nwhich 50% or more of such class of the outstanding shares of the stock is owned, actually or constructively under specified stock attribution rules, on more than half the days during the\ntaxable year by persons who each own 5% or more of the value of such class of the outstanding stock, which we refer to as the “5% Override Rule.” When more than 50% of the shares\nare owned by 5% shareholders, then we will be subject to the 5% Override Rule unless we can establish that among the shares included in the closely-held block of stock are a sufficient\nnumber of shares in that block to “prevent nonqualified shareholders in the closely held block from owning 50 percent or more of the stock.”\nWe believe our ownership structure meets the intent and purpose of the Publicly Traded Test and the tax policy behind it even if it does not literally meet the vote and value\nrequirements. In our case, there is no closely held block because less than 5% shareholders in aggregate own more than 50% of the value of our stock. However, we expect that we would\nhave satisfied the Publicly Traded Test if, instead of our current share structure, our common shares represented more than 50% of the voting power of our stock. In addition, we can\nestablish that nonqualified shareholders cannot exercise voting control over the corporation because a qualified shareholder controls the non-traded voting stock. Moreover, we believe\nthat the 5% Override Rule suggests that the Publicly Traded Test should be interpreted by reference to its overall purpose, which we consider to be that Section 883 should generally be\navailable to a publicly traded company unless it is more than 50% owned, by vote or value, by nonqualified 5% shareholders. We therefore believe our stock structure, when considered\nby the U.S. Treasury in light of the Publicly Traded Test enunciated in the regulations, should be accepted as satisfying the exemption. Accordingly, we intend to take the position that\nwe qualify for the benefits of Section 883. However, there can be no assurance that our particular stock structure will be treated as satisfying the Publicly Traded Test. Accordingly, there\ncan be no assurance that we or our subsidiaries will qualify for the benefits of Section 883 for any taxable year.\nTaxation in the Absence of Exemption under Section 883 of the Code\nIf contrary to our position described above the IRS determines that we do not qualify for the benefits of Section 883 of the Code, USSGTI, to the extent not considered to be\n“effectively connected” with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business, as described below, would be subject to a 4% tax imposed by Section 887 of the Code on a gross basis, without the\nbenefit of deductions, which we refer to as the “4% gross basis tax regime.”\nTo the extent the benefits of the exemption under Section 883 of the Code are unavailable and USSGTI is considered to be “effectively connected” with the conduct of a U.S.\ntrade or business, as described below, any such “effectively connected” U.S.-source shipping income, net of applicable deductions, would be subject to the U.S. federal corporate\nincome tax imposed at a rate of 21%. In addition, we may be subject to the 30% “branch profits” tax on earnings effectively connected with the conduct of such U.S. trade or business, as\ndetermined after allowance for certain adjustments, and on certain interest paid or deemed paid attributable to the conduct of such U.S. trade or business.\nUSSGTI would be considered “effectively connected” with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business only if:\n• We have, or are considered to have, a fixed place of business in the United States involved in the earning of shipping income; and\n• substantially all our USSGTI is attributable to regularly scheduled transportation, such as the operation of a vessel that follows a published schedule with repeated sailings\nat regular intervals between the same points for voyages that begin or end in the United States.\nWe do not currently have, nor do we intend to have or permit circumstances that would result in us having, any vessel operating to the United States on a regularly scheduled\nbasis. Based on the foregoing and on the expected mode of our shipping operations and other activities, we believe that none of our USSGTI will be “effectively connected” with the\nconduct of a U.S. trade or business.\nU.S. Taxation of Gain on Sale of Vessels\nRegardless of whether we qualify for exemption under Section 883 of the Code, we do not expect to be subject to U.S. federal income taxation with respect to gain realized on a\nsale of a vessel, provided the sale is considered to occur outside of the United States under U.S. federal income tax principles. In general, a sale of a vessel will be considered to occur\noutside of the United States for this purpose if title to the vessel, and risk of loss with respect to the vessel, pass to the buyer outside of the United States. It is expected that any sale of\na vessel by us will be considered to occur outside of the United States.\n83\nTable of Contents\nU.S. Federal Income Taxation of U.S. Holders\nAs used herein, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of our common shares that is a U.S. citizen or resident, U.S. corporation or other U.S. entity taxable as a\ncorporation, an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source, or a trust if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary\njurisdiction over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) it has in place an election to be\ntreated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nIf a partnership holds our common shares, the tax treatment of a partner of such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and upon the activities of the\npartnership. If you are a partner in a partnership holding our common shares, you are encouraged to consult your tax adviser.\nNo ruling has been or will be requested from the IRS regarding any matter affecting the Company or its shareholders. The statements made here may not be sustained by a court\nif contested by the IRS.\nDistributions\nSubject to the discussion of passive foreign investment companies, or PFIC, below, any distributions made by us with respect to our common shares to a U.S. Holder will\ngenerally constitute dividends to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. Distributions in excess of such\nearnings and profits will be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in his common shares on a dollar-for-dollar basis and thereafter as\ncapital gain. However, we do not expect to calculate earnings and profits in accordance with U.S. federal income tax principles. Accordingly, you should expect to generally treat the\ndistributions we make as dividends. Because we are not a U.S. corporation, U.S. Holders that are corporations will generally not be entitled to claim a dividends-received deduction with\nrespect to any distributions they receive from us. Dividends paid with respect to our common shares will generally be treated as “passive category income” for purposes of computing\nallowable foreign tax credits for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes.\nDividends paid on our common shares to a U.S. Individual Holder will generally be treated as ordinary income. However, if you are a U.S. Individual Holder, dividends that\nconstitute qualified dividend income will be taxable to you at the preferential rates applicable to long-term capital gains provided that you hold the shares for more than 60 days during\nthe 121-day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date and meet other holding period requirements. Dividends paid with respect to the shares generally will be qualified\ndividend income provided that, in the year that you receive the dividend, the shares are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States. Our common shares are\nlisted on the Nasdaq Capital Market, and we therefore expect that dividends will be qualified dividend income.\nSpecial rules may apply to any “extraordinary dividend,” generally, a dividend paid by us in an amount which is equal to or in excess of 10% of a shareholder’s adjusted tax\nbasis (or fair market value in certain circumstances) or dividends received within a one-year period that, in the aggregate, equal or exceed 20% of a shareholder’s adjusted tax basis (or\nfair market value upon the shareholder’s election) in a common share. If we pay an “extraordinary dividend” on our common shares that is treated as “qualified dividend income,” then\nany loss derived by a U.S. Individual Holder from the sale or exchange of such common shares will be treated as long-term capital loss to the extent of such dividend.\nSale, Exchange or other Disposition of Common Shares\nSubject to the discussion of our status as a PFIC below, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize taxable gain or loss upon a sale, exchange or other disposition of our common\nshares in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized by the U.S. Holder from such sale, exchange or other disposition and the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in such stock.\nSuch gain or loss will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period is greater than one year at the time of the sale, exchange or other disposition. Such\ncapital gain or loss will generally be treated as U.S.-source income or loss, as applicable, for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes. A U.S. Holder’s ability to deduct capital losses is subject to\ncertain limitations.\nPassive Foreign Investment Company Status and Significant Tax Consequences\nSpecial U.S. federal income tax rules apply to a U.S. Holder that holds stock in a foreign corporation classified as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, we will\nbe treated as a PFIC with respect to a U.S. Holder if, for any taxable year in which such holder held our common shares, either\n• at least 75% of our gross income for such taxable year consists of passive income (e.g., dividends, interest, capital gains and rents derived other than in the active conduct\nof a rental business); or\n• at least 50% of the average value of the assets held by the corporation during such taxable year produce, or are held for the production of, passive income.\n84\nTable of Contents\nFor purposes of determining whether we are a PFIC, we will be treated as earning and owning our proportionate share of the income and assets, respectively, of any of our\nsubsidiaries’ corporations in which we own at least 25% of the value of the subsidiary’s stock. Income earned, or deemed earned, by us in connection with the performance of services\nwould not constitute “passive income” for these purposes. By contrast, rental income would generally constitute “passive income” unless we were treated under specific rules as\nderiving our rental income in the active conduct of a trade or business.\nIn general, income derived from the bareboat charter of a vessel will be treated as “passive income” for purposes of determining whether we are a PFIC, and such vessel will be\ntreated as an asset which produces or is held to produce “passive income.” On the other hand, income derived from the time charter of a vessel should not be treated as “passive\nincome” for such purpose, but rather should be treated as services income; likewise, a time chartered vessel should generally not be treated as an asset which produces or is held for the\nproduction of “passive income.”\nSubject to the discussion in the follow paragraph, based on our current assets and activities, we do not believe that we will be a PFIC for the current or subsequent taxable\nyears. Although there is no legal authority directly on point, and we are not relying upon an opinion of counsel on this issue, our belief is based principally on the position that, for\npurposes of determining whether we are a passive foreign investment company, the gross income we derive or are deemed to derive from the time and voyage chartering activities and\npool arrangements of our wholly owned subsidiaries should constitute services income, rather than rental income. Correspondingly, such income should not constitute passive income,\nand the assets that we or our wholly-owned subsidiaries own and operate in connection with the production of such income, particularly the vessels, should not constitute passive\nassets for purposes of determining whether we were a passive foreign investment company. We believe there is substantial legal authority supporting our position consisting of case law\nand IRS pronouncements concerning the characterization of income derived from time charters and voyage charters as services income for other tax purposes. However, in the absence\nof any legal authority specifically relating to the statutory provisions governing passive foreign investment companies, the IRS or a court could disagree with our position. In addition,\nalthough we intend to conduct our affairs in a manner to avoid being classified as a passive foreign investment company with respect to any taxable year, we cannot assure you that the\nnature of our operations will not change in the future.\nFor purposes of the PFIC “asset” test described above, Cash Assets are considered to be assets that produce passive income. As indicated in our consolidated financial\nstatements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, we have significant Cash Assets relative to the operating assets we hold. Although we do not expect to be treated as a PFIC for\nour 2023 taxable year, we cannot predict whether our position in cash and other “passive” assets will cause us to be treated as a PFIC in a future taxable year.\nAs discussed more fully below, if we were to be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year, a U.S. Holder would be subject to different U.S. federal income taxation rules depending\non whether the U.S. Holder makes an election to treat us as a “Qualified Electing Fund,” which election is referred to as a “QEF Election.” As discussed below, as an alternative to making\na QEF Election, a U.S. Holder should be able to make a “mark-to-market” election with respect to our common shares, which election is referred to as a “Mark-to-Market Election.” A U.S.\nHolder holding PFIC shares that does not make either a “QEF Election” or “Mark-to-Market Election” will be subject to the Default PFIC Regime, as defined and discussed below in “Item\n10. Additional Information—E. Taxation—U.S. Federal Income Taxation of U.S. Holders—Taxation of U.S. Holders Not Making a Timely QEF or “Mark-to-Market” Election.”\nIf the Company were to be treated as a PFIC, a U.S. Holder would be required to file IRS Form 8621 to report certain information regarding the Company. If you are a U.S. Holder\nwho held our common shares during any period in which we are a PFIC, you are strongly encouraged to consult your tax adviser.\nThe QEF Election\nIf a U.S. Holder makes a timely QEF Election, which U.S. Holder we refer to as an “Electing Holder,” the Electing Holder must report each year for United States federal income\ntax purposes his pro rata share of our ordinary earnings and our net capital gain, if any, for our taxable year that ends with or within the taxable year of the Electing Holder, regardless of\nwhether or not distributions were made by us to the Electing Holder. The Electing Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the common shares will be increased to reflect taxed but undistributed\nearnings and profits. Distributions of earnings and profits that had been previously taxed will result in a corresponding reduction in the adjusted tax basis in the common shares and will\nnot be taxed again once distributed. An Electing Holder would generally recognize capital gain or loss on the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common shares. It should be\nnoted that if any of our subsidiaries is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Holder must make a separate QEF Election with respect to each such\nsubsidiary.\n85\nTable of Contents\nTaxation of U.S. Holders Making a “Mark-to-Market” Election\nIf we are a PFIC in a taxable year and our shares are treated as “marketable stock” in such year, you may make a mark-to-market election with respect to your shares. As long as\nour common shares are traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market, as they currently are and as they may continue to be, our common shares should be considered “marketable stock” for\npurposes of making the Mark-to-Market Election. However, a mark-to-market election generally cannot be made for equity interests in any lower-tier PFICs that we own, unless shares of\nsuch lower-tier PFIC are themselves “marketable.” As a result, even if a U.S. Holder validly makes a mark-to-market election with respect to our common shares, the U.S. Holder may\ncontinue to be subject to the Default PFIC Regime (described below) with respect to the U.S. Holder’s indirect interest in any of our subsidiaries that are treated as an equity interest in a\nPFIC. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisers in this regard.\nTaxation of U.S. Holders Not Making a Timely QEF or “Mark-to-Market” Election\nFinally, a U.S. Holder who does not make either a QEF Election or a Mark-to-Market Election with respect to any taxable year in which we are treated as a PFIC, or a U.S. Holder\nwhose QEF Election is invalidated or terminated (or a “Non-Electing Holder”), would be subject to special rules, or the Default PFIC Regime, with respect to (1) any excess distribution\n(i.e., the portion of any distributions received by the Non-Electing Holder on the common shares in a taxable year (other than the taxable year in which such Non-Electing Holder’s\nholding period in the common shares begins) in excess of 125% of the average annual distributions received by the Non-Electing Holder in the three preceding taxable years, or, if\nshorter, the Non-Electing Holder’s holding period for the common shares), and (2) any gain realized on the sale, exchange, redemption or other disposition of the common shares.\nUnder the Default PFIC Regime:\n• the excess distribution or gain would be allocated ratably over the Non-Electing Holder’s aggregate holding period for the common shares;\n• the amount allocated to the current taxable year and any taxable year before we became a PFIC would be taxed as ordinary income; and\n• the amount allocated to each of the other taxable years would be subject to tax at the highest rate of tax in effect for the applicable class of taxpayer for that year, and an\ninterest charge for the deemed tax deferral benefit would be imposed with respect to the resulting tax attributable to each such other taxable year.\nAny distributions other than “excess distributions” by us to a Non-Electing Holder will be treated as discussed above under “Taxation—U.S. Federal Income Taxation of U.S.\nHolders—Distributions.”\nIf a Non-Electing Holder who is an individual dies while owning the common shares, such Non-Electing Holder’s successor generally would not receive a step-up in tax basis\nwith respect to the common shares.\nShareholder Reporting\nA U.S. Holder that owns “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value in excess of $50,000 (and in some circumstances, a higher threshold) may be required to file\nan information report with respect to such assets with its tax return. “Specified foreign financial assets” may include financial accounts maintained by foreign financial institutions, as\nwell as the following, but only if they are held for investment and not held in accounts maintained by financial institutions: (i) stocks and securities issued by non-United States persons,\n(ii) financial instruments and contracts that have non-United States issuers or counterparties, and (iii) interests in foreign entities. Significant penalties may apply for failing to satisfy\nthis filing requirement. U.S. Holders are urged to contact their tax advisers regarding this filing requirement.\nU.S. Federal Income Taxation of “Non-U.S. Holders”\nA beneficial owner of our common shares (other than a partnership) that is not a U.S. Holder is referred to herein as a “Non-U.S. Holder.”\nDividends on Common Shares\nNon-U.S. Holders generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax or withholding tax on dividends received from us with respect to our common shares, unless that\nincome is effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by the Non-U.S. Holder in the United States. If the Non-U.S. Holder is entitled to the benefits of a U.S. income tax\ntreaty with respect to those dividends, that income is taxable only if it is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder in the United States.\n86\nTable of Contents\nSale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Common Shares\nNon-U.S. Holders generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax or withholding tax on any gain realized upon the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common\nshares, unless:\n• the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by the Non-U.S. Holder in the United States. If the Non-U.S. Holder is entitled to the benefits of a U.S.\nincome tax treaty with respect to that gain, that gain is taxable only if it is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder in the United States;\nor\n• the Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of disposition and other conditions are met.\nIf the Non-U.S. Holder is engaged in a U.S. trade or business for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the income from the common shares, including dividends and the gain from\nthe sale, exchange or other disposition of the stock that is effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax in the same\nmanner as discussed in the previous section relating to the taxation of U.S. Holders. In addition, in the case of a corporate Non-U.S. Holder, the earnings and profits of such Non-U.S.\nHolder that are attributable to effectively connected income, subject to certain adjustments, may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of 30%, or at a lower rate as may\nbe specified by an applicable U.S. income tax treaty.\nBackup Withholding and Information Reporting\nIf you are a U.S. Individual Holder, information reporting requirements on IRS Form 1099 generally will apply to dividend payments or other taxable distributions made to you\nwithin the United States, and the payment of proceeds to you from the sale of common shares effected at a United States office of a broker.\nAdditionally, backup withholding may apply to such payments if you fail to comply with applicable certification requirements or (in the case of dividend payments) are notified\nby the IRS that you have failed to report all interest and dividends required to be shown on your federal income tax returns.\nIf you are a Non-U.S. Holder, you are generally exempt from backup withholding and information reporting requirements with respect to dividend payments made to you outside\nthe United States by us or another non-United States payor. You are also generally exempt from backup withholding and information reporting requirements in respect of dividend\npayments made within the United States and the payment of the proceeds from the sale of common shares effected at a United States office of a broker, as long as either (i) you have\nfurnished a valid IRS Form W-8 or other documentation upon which the payor or broker may rely to treat the payments as made to a non-United States person, or (ii) you otherwise\nestablish an exemption.\nPayment of the proceeds from the sale of common shares effected at a foreign office of a broker generally will not be subject to information reporting or backup withholding.\nHowever, a sale effected at a foreign office of a broker could be subject to information reporting in the same manner as a sale within the United States (and in certain cases may be\nsubject to backup withholding as well) if (i) the broker has certain connections to the United States, (ii) the proceeds or confirmation are sent to the United States or (iii) the sale has\ncertain other specified connections with the United States.\nYou generally may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules that exceed your income tax liability by filing a refund claim with the IRS.\nOther Tax Considerations\nIn addition to the income tax consequences discussed above, the Company may be subject to tax, including tonnage taxes, in one or more other jurisdictions where the\nCompany conducts activities. All our vessel-owning subsidiaries are subject to tonnage taxes. Generally, under a tonnage tax, a company is taxed based on the net tonnage of qualifying\nvessels such company operates, independent of actual earnings. The amount of any tonnage tax imposed upon our operations may be material.\nF. Dividends and Paying Agents\nNot applicable.\nG. Statement by Experts\nNot applicable.\n87\nTable of Contents\nH.

In accordance with these requirements we file reports and other information with the SEC, including\nannual reports on Form 20-F and periodic reports on Form 6-K. The SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports and other information about issuers, like us, that file\nelectronically with the SEC. The address of that website is www.sec.gov.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to various market risks, including foreign currency fluctuations, changes in interest rates and credit risk. Our activities expose us primarily to the financial risks\nof changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as described below.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe international shipping industry is capital intensive, requiring significant amounts of investment provided in the form of long-term debt. As of December 31, 2023 our term\nloan facility had a floating interest rate that fluctuated with changes in the financial markets and in particular changes in SOFR. From and after March 7, 2023, the reference rate for this\nterm loan facility was changed from LIBOR to SOFR. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our net effective exposure to floating interest rate fluctuations on our outstanding\ndebt was $5.3 million and $13.2 million, respectively. Our interest expense has been affected by changes in the general level of interest rates, particularly LIBOR and SOFR. As an\nindication of the extent of our sensitivity to interest rate changes, an increase in LIBOR or SOFR of 1% would have decreased our net income both in the year ended December 31, 2022\nand 2023 by approximately $0.1 million based upon our floating interest-bearing average debt level during these periods. We expect our sensitivity to interest rate changes to increase in\nthe future if we enter into additional debt agreements in connection with future vessel acquisitions and/or the unencumbered part of our existing fleet. We do not consider the risk from\ninterest rate fluctuations to be material for our results of operations as on January 25, 2024, we fully prepaid the outstanding principal amount under our only outstanding loan facility\nusing part of the proceeds of the sale of the M/T Wonder Sirius.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe generate all of our revenues in U.S. dollars. A minority of our vessels’ operating expenses (approximately 1.2% for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 3.0% for the year\nended December 31, 2023) and of our general and administrative expenses (approximately 9.9% for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 8.8% for the year ended December 31, 2023) are\nin currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily Euro. For accounting purposes, expenses incurred in other currencies are converted into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing on\nthe date of each transaction. We do not consider the risk from exchange rate fluctuations to be material for our results of operations because as of December 31, 2022 and as of December\n31, 2023, these non-U.S. dollar expenses represented 0.4% and 1.4% our revenues, respectively. However, the portion of our business conducted in other currencies could increase in the\nfuture, which could increase our exposure to losses arising from exchange rate fluctuations.\nInflation Risk\nInflation has not had a material effect on our expenses in the preceding fiscal year. In the event that significant global inflationary pressures appear, these pressures would\nincrease our operating costs.\nITEM 12.

Additional Information—B. Memorandum and Articles of Association” for a description of the rights of holders of our Series A Preferred Shares and\nSeries B Preferred Shares relative to the rights of holders of our common shares.\nITEM 15. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nA. Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of December 31, 2023, our management conducted an evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, as amended, of the\neffectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.\nThe term disclosure controls and procedures is defined under SEC rules as controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to\nbe disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s\nrules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the\nreports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosure. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error\nand the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving\ntheir control objectives.\nOur management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\nobjectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all\ncontrol issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the partnership have been detected. Further, in the design and evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our management\nnecessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective\ncontrol system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nBased upon that evaluation, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures which include, without limitation, controls and\nprocedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management,\nas appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information that was required to be disclosed by us in\nreports we file or submit under the Exchange Act was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC.\nB. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) promulgated under the\nExchange Act. Our internal controls were designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation and presentation of our financial\nstatements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\n89\nTable of Contents\nOur internal controls over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n• Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;\n• Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and\n• Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the\nfinancial statements.\nOur management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon the 2013 framework in Internal Control – Integrated\nFramework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management believes that our internal control over\nfinancial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nHowever, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate.\nC. Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThis Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s\nreport was not subject to attestation by the Company’s registered public accounting firm, since, as an “emerging growth company”, we are exempt from having our independent auditor\nassess our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nD. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Annual Report that have materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nITEM 16.

CHANGE IN REGISTRANT’S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT\nNot applicable.\nITEM 16G. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nPursuant to an exception under the Nasdaq listing standards available to foreign private issuers, we are not required to comply with all of the corporate governance practices\nfollowed by U.S. companies under the Nasdaq listing standards, which are available at www.nasdaq.com, because in certain cases we follow our home country (Marshall Islands)\npractice. Pursuant to Section 5600 of the Nasdaq Listed Company Manual, we are required to list the significant differences between our corporate governance practices that comply\nwith and follow our home country practices and the Nasdaq standards applicable to listed U.S. companies. Set forth below is a list of those differences:\n• Independence of Directors. The Nasdaq requires that a U.S. listed company maintain a majority of independent directors. Although our Board is currently composed of\nthree directors a majority of whom are independent, we cannot assure you that in the future we will have a majority of independent directors.\n• Executive Sessions. The Nasdaq requires that non-management directors meet regularly in executive sessions without management. The Nasdaq also requires that all\nindependent directors meet in an executive session at least once a year. As permitted under Marshall Islands law and our bylaws, our non-management directors do not\nregularly hold executive sessions without management.\n• Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee. The Nasdaq requires that a listed U.S. company have a nominating/corporate governance committee of independent\ndirectors and a committee charter specifying the purpose, duties and evaluation procedures of the committee. As permitted under Marshall Islands law and our bylaws, we\ndo not currently have a nominating or corporate governance committee, nor do we expect to establish such committees.\n• Compensation Committee. The Nasdaq requires U.S. listed companies to have a compensation committee composed entirely of independent directors and a committee\ncharter addressing the purpose, responsibility, rights and performance evaluation of the committee. As permitted under Marshall Islands law, we do not currently have a\ncompensation committee. To the extent we establish such committee in the future, it may not consist of independent directors, entirely or at all.\n• Audit Committee. The Nasdaq requires, among other things, that a listed U.S. company have an audit committee with a minimum of three members, all of whom are\nindependent. As permitted by Nasdaq Rule 5615(a)(3), we follow home country practice regarding audit committee composition. Therefore, our audit committee is\ncomposed of two independent directors, Mr. Angelos Rounick Platanias and Mr. Petros Zavakopoulos. Although the members of our audit committee are independent, we\nare not required to ensure their independence under Nasdaq Rule 5605(c)(2)(A) subject to compliance with Rules 10A-3(b)(1) and 10A-3(c) under the Securities Exchange\nAct of 1934.\n• Shareholder Approval Requirements. The Nasdaq requires that a listed U.S. company obtain prior shareholder approval for certain issuances of authorized stock or the\napproval of, and material revisions to, equity compensation plans. As permitted under Marshall Islands law and our bylaws, we do not intend seek shareholder approval\nprior to issuances of authorized stock or the approval of and material revisions to equity compensation plans.\n• Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Nasdaq requires U.S. companies to adopt and disclose corporate governance guidelines. The guidelines must address, among\nother things: director qualification standards, director responsibilities, director access to management and independent advisers, director compensation, director orientation\nand continuing education, management succession and an annual performance evaluation of the Board. We are not required to adopt such guidelines under Marshall\nIslands law and we have not and do not intend to adopt such guidelines.\n92\nTable of Contents\nITEM 16H.

CYBERSECURITY\nWe maintain various cybersecurity measures and protocols to safeguard our systems and data and continuously monitor and assess potential threats to pre-emptively address\nany emerging cyber risks. We have implemented various processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats, which are integrated into our\noverall risk management framework. These processes include access controls to organizational systems, data encryption, cybersecurity training and security awareness campaigns\nthrough direct mail, and are designed to systematically evaluate potential vulnerabilities and cybersecurity threats and minimize their potential impact on our organization’s operations,\nassets, and stakeholders. Our cybersecurity risk management processes share common methodologies, reporting channels and governance processes with our broader risk management\nprocesses. By embedding cybersecurity risk management into and aligning it with our broader risk management processes, we aim to ensure a comprehensive and proactive approach to\nsafeguarding our assets and operations.\nWe engage assessors, consultants, auditors, and other third-party specialists to enhance the effectiveness of our cybersecurity processes, augment our internal capabilities,\nvalidate our controls, and stay abreast of evolving cybersecurity risks and best practices.\nIn 2023, we did not detect any cybersecurity incidents that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of\noperations, or financial condition.\nResponsibility for overseeing cybersecurity risks is integrated into the purview of the Information Technology and Cybersecurity Department of Castor Ships (the “ITC\nDepartment”), our commercial and technical co-manager. The ITC Department is responsible for monitoring, detecting and assessing cybersecurity risks and incidents at the parent\ncompany, subsidiary and vessel level. The ITC Department provides these services to us pursuant to the Amended and Restated Master Management.\nWe also utilize third-party service providers for certain IT-related and other services, where appropriate, to assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of our security controls.\nAccordingly, we also implement processes to oversee and identify material cybersecurity risks associated with our utilization of third-party service providers on whom we have a material\ndependency, such as conducting due diligence assessments to evaluate their cybersecurity measures, data protection practices, and compliance with relevant regulatory requirements.\nThe ITC Department currently comprises a senior IT professional with expertise in risk management, cybersecurity, and information technology. This individual has, and any\nfuture members of the ITC Department are expected to have, credentials relevant to their role, which includes prior experience working in similar roles and formal education (e.g., a\nBachelor of Science in information technology fields). The ITC Department is also expected to keep abreast of cybersecurity best practices and procedures. The ITC Department is\nresponsible for assessing, identifying and mitigating material cybersecurity risks, including at a strategic level, monitoring for, defending against and remediating cybersecurity incidents\nand implementing and making improvements to our overall cybersecurity strategy. The ITC Department utilizes key performance indicators and metrics to monitor their performance and\ntrack progress towards goals established by the ITC Department.\nAs we do not have a dedicated board committee solely focused on cybersecurity, our full Board oversees the implementation of our cybersecurity strategy, as well as\ncybersecurity risks, with the aim of protecting our interests and assets. Our cybersecurity strategy was developed by the ITC Department and approved by senior management. The\nBoard receives periodic reports and presentations on cybersecurity risks from the ITC Department, including regarding recent incidents or breaches (if any), vulnerabilities, mitigation\nstrategies and the overall effectiveness of our cybersecurity program. These reports highlight significant or emerging cybersecurity threats, their potential impact on the organization,\nongoing initiatives to mitigate risks and any proposed actions or investments required to enhance our cybersecurity posture.\n93\nTable of Contents\nPART III\nITEM 17.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the\nfinancial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period January 13, 2021 to December 31, 2021 and for each\nof the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits.\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the\nCompany in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the\nfinancial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control\nover financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on\nthe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond\nto those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the\naccounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Deloitte Certified Public Accountants S.A.\nAthens, Greece\nMarch 12, 2024\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since

STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in U.S. Dollars – except for share data unless otherwise stated)\n1. Basis of Presentation and General information:\nToro Corp. (“Toro”) was formed on July 29, 2022 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Castor Maritime Inc. (“Castor”, or the “Former Parent Company”) under the laws of the Republic\nof the Marshall Islands under the name Tankco Shipping Inc. and changed its name to Toro Corp. on September 29, 2022. On March 7, 2023 (the “Distribution Date”), Castor completed\nthe Spin-Off of Toro based on the terms approved by the independent disinterested directors of Castor following the recommendation of its special committee of independent\ndisinterested directors. In the Spin-Off, Castor separated its tanker fleet from its dry bulk and container fleet by, among other actions, contributing to Toro its interest in the subsidiaries\ncomprising its tanker fleet, each owning one tanker vessel and Elektra Shipping Co. (the “Toro Subsidiaries”) in exchange for (i) 9,461,009 common shares of Toro, (ii) the issuance to\nCastor of 140,000 1.00% Series A fixed rate cumulative perpetual convertible preferred shares of Toro (the “Series A Preferred Shares”) having a stated amount of $1,000 per share and a\npar value of $0.001 per share and (iii) the issuance at par to Pelagos Holdings Corp, a company controlled by the Toro’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, of 40,000 Series B preferred\nshares of Toro, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series B Preferred Shares”). Toro’s common shares were distributed on March 7, 2023 pro rata to the shareholders of record of Castor as\nof February 22, 2023 at a ratio of one Toro common share for every ten Castor common shares. The foregoing transactions are referred to collectively herein as the “Spin-Off”. Toro\nbegan trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market (the “Nasdaq”), under the symbol “TORO”.\nIn addition, Toro entered into various agreements effecting the separation of its business from Castor including a Contribution and Spin-Off Distribution Agreement entered into by\nToro and Castor on February 24, 2023 (the “Contribution and Spin-Off Distribution Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, (i) Castor agreed to indemnify Toro and the\nToro Subsidiaries for any and all obligations and other liabilities arising from or relating to the operation, management or employment of vessels or subsidiaries that Castor retained after\nthe Distribution Date and Toro agreed to indemnify Castor for any and all obligations and other liabilities arising from or relating to the operation, management or employment of the\nvessels contributed to it or the Toro Subsidiaries, and (ii) Toro agreed to replace Castor as guarantor under the $18.0 senior secured credit facility with Alpha Bank S.A. (the “$18.0\nMillion Term Loan Facility”) upon completion of the Spin-Off. The Contribution and Spin-Off Distribution Agreement also provided for the settlement or extinguishment of certain\nliabilities and other obligations between Castor and Toro and provides Castor with certain registration rights relating to Toro’s common shares, if any, issued upon conversion of the\nSeries A Preferred Shares issued to Castor in connection with the Spin-Off. Following the successful completion of the Spin Off on March 7, 2023, Toro reimbursed Castor for expenses\nrelated to the Spin-Off that were incurred by Castor, except for any of these expenses that were incurred or paid by any of Toro’s subsidiaries, after March 7, 2023.\nThe Spin-off has been accounted for as a transfer of business among entities under common control. Accordingly, these accompanying consolidated financial statements of the\nCompany have been presented as if the Toro Subsidiaries were consolidated subsidiaries of the Company for all periods presented and using the historical carrying costs of the assets\nand the liabilities of the subsidiaries listed below, from their dates of incorporation. As a result, the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Toro and its\nwholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”).\nThe Company is currently engaged in the worldwide transportation of crude oil, refined petroleum products and liquefied petroleum gas through its vessel-owning subsidiaries.\nCastor Ships S.A., a corporation incorporated under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (“Castor Ships”), a related party controlled by Toro’s Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer, Petros Panagiotidis, provides ship management and chartering services to the vessels owned by the Company’s vessel-owning subsidiaries with effect from July 1,\n2022. Such services are provided through subcontracting agreements with unrelated third-party managers, entered into with the Company’s consent, for all of the Company’s vessels.\nDuring the period ended December 31, 2021 and until June 30, 2022, Castor Ships provided only commercial ship management and chartering services to such subsidiaries. As a part of\nthe Spin-Off, the Company entered into a master management agreement with Castor Ships with respect to its vessels in substantially the same form as Castor’s Master Management\nAgreement previously in place for its vessels. The vessel management agreements with Castor Ships previously entered into for each of the vessels by the applicable vessel-owning\nsubsidiary remain in effect for each such vessel. Upon the acquisition of the LPG carrier vessels (Note 5), the relevant vessel owning subsidiaries entered into management agreements\nwith Castor Ships on substantially the same terms as the existing vessel-owning subsidiaries.\nF-7\nTable of Contents\nTORO CORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in U.S. Dollars – except for share data unless otherwise stated)\n1.

Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements:\nPrinciples of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Toro and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon\nconsolidation. Toro, as the holding company, determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a\nvariable interest entity. Under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) 810 “Consolidation”, a voting interest entity is an entity in\nwhich the total equity investment at risk is deemed sufficient to absorb the expected losses of the entity, the equity holders have all the characteristics of a controlling financial interest\nand the legal entity is structured with substantive voting rights. The holding company consolidates voting interest entities in which it owns all, or at least a majority (generally, greater\nthan 50%) of the voting interest. Variable interest entities (“VIE”) are entities, as defined under ASC 810, that in general either have equity investors with non-substantive voting rights\nor that have equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. The holding company has a controlling financial interest in a VIE\nand is, therefore, the primary beneficiary of a VIE if it has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to\nabsorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. A VIE should have only one primary beneficiary which is required to consolidate the VIE. A\nVIE may not have a primary beneficiary if no party meets the criteria described above. The Company evaluates all arrangements that may include a variable interest in an entity to\ndetermine if it is the primary beneficiary, and would therefore be required to include assets, liabilities, and operations of a VIE in its consolidated financial statements.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses\nduring the reporting period. Significant estimates include vessel valuations, the valuation of amounts due from charterers, residual value and the useful life of the vessels. Actual results\nmay differ from these estimates.\nOther comprehensive (loss)/income\nThe Company follows the accounting guidance relating to comprehensive (loss)/income, which requires separate presentation of certain transactions that are recorded directly as\ncomponents of shareholders’ equity. The Company has no other comprehensive (loss)/income items and, accordingly, comprehensive (loss)/income equals net (loss)/income for the\nperiods presented.\nForeign currency translation\nThe Company’s reporting and functional currency is the U.S. Dollar (“USD”). Transactions incurred in other currencies are translated into USD using the exchange rates in effect at\nthe time of the transactions. At the balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in other currencies are translated into USD to reflect the end-of-period\nexchange rates and any gains or losses are included in the statement of comprehensive loss.\nCash and cash equivalents\nThe Company considers highly liquid investments such as time deposits and certificates of deposit with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nRestricted cash\nRestricted cash may comprise (i) minimum liquidity collateral requirements or minimum required cash deposits that are required to be maintained under the Company’s financing\narrangements, (ii) cash deposits in so-called “retention accounts” which may only be used as per the Company’s borrowing arrangements for the purpose of serving the loan\ninstallments coming due or, (iii) other cash deposits required to be retained until other specified conditions prescribed in the Company’s debt agreements are met. In the event that the\nobligation to maintain such deposits is expected to elapse within the next operating cycle, these deposits are classified as current assets. Otherwise, they are classified as non-current\nassets.\nF-10\nTable of Contents\nTORO CORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in U.S. Dollars – except for share data unless otherwise stated)\n2. Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements: (continued)\nAccounts receivable trade, net\nThe amount shown as trade receivables, net, at the balance sheet date, includes receivables from charterers for hire, freight, pool revenue, and other potential sources of income\n(such as ballast bonus compensation and/or holds cleaning compensation, etc.) under the Company’s charter contracts and/or pool arrangements, net of any provision for doubtful\naccounts. At each balance sheet date, all potentially uncollectible accounts are assessed individually for purposes of determining the appropriate provision for doubtful accounts.\nProvision for doubtful accounts recorded as of December 31, 2022 and 2023 amounted to $266,732, and $0, respectively.\nInventories\nInventories consist of bunkers, lubricants and provisions on board each vessel. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the\nestimated selling price less reasonably predictable costs of disposal and transportation. Cost is determined by the first in, first out method. Inventories consist of bunkers during periods\nwhen vessels are unemployed, undergoing dry-docking or special survey or under voyage charters.\nIntangible assets/liabilities related to time charters acquired\nWhen and where the Company identifies any assets or liabilities associated with the acquisition of a vessel, the Company records such identified assets or liabilities at fair value.\nFair value is determined by reference to market data obtained from independent broker’s valuations. The valuations reflect the fair value of the vessel with and without the attached time\ncharter and the cost of the acquisition is then allocated to the vessel and the intangible asset or liability on the basis of their relative fair values. The intangible asset or liability is\namortized as an adjustment to revenues over the assumed remaining term of the acquired time charter and is classified as a non-current asset or liability, as applicable, in the\naccompanying balance sheet.\nInsurance claims\nThe Company records insurance claim recoveries for insured losses incurred on damage to fixed assets, for insured crew medical expenses and for loss of hire for certain of its\nvessels that maintain such kind of insurance. Insurance claim recoveries are recorded, net of any deductible amounts, at the time when (i) the Company’s vessels suffer insured damages\nor at the time when crew medical expenses are incurred, (ii) recovery is probable under the related insurance policies, (iii) the Company can estimate the amount of such recovery\nfollowing submission of the insurance claim and (iv) provided that the claim is not subject to litigation.\nVessels, net\nVessels, net are stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation. The cost of a vessel consists of the contract price plus any direct expenses incurred upon acquisition, including\nimprovements, delivery expenses and other expenditures to prepare the vessel for its intended use which is to provide worldwide integrated transportation services. Subsequent\nexpenditures for conversions and major improvements are also capitalized when they appreciably extend the life, increase the earning capacity or improve the efficiency or safety of a\nvessel; otherwise these amounts are charged to expense as incurred.\nF-11\nTable of Contents\nTORO CORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in U.S. Dollars – except for share data unless otherwise stated)\n2. Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements: (continued)\nVessels’ depreciation\nDepreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of a vessel, after considering the estimated salvage value. Each vessel’s salvage value is\nequal to the product of its lightweight tonnage and estimated scrap rate. Salvage values are periodically reviewed and revised, if needed, to recognize changes in conditions, new\nregulations or for other reasons. Revisions of salvage value affect the depreciable amount of the vessels and affect depreciation expense in the period of the revision and future periods.\nManagement estimates the useful life of its vessels to be 25 years from the date of initial delivery from the shipyard, whereas, secondhand vessels are depreciated from the date of their\nacquisition through their remaining estimated useful life.\nImpairment of vessels\nThe Company reviews its vessels for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a vessel may not be recoverable. When the\nestimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the use of a vessel is less than its carrying amount, the Company evaluates the vessel for an impairment loss.\nMeasurement of the impairment loss is based on the fair value of the vessel in comparison to its carrying value, including any related intangible assets and liabilities. In this respect,\nmanagement regularly reviews the carrying amount of its vessels in connection with their estimated recoverable amount.\nDry-docking and special survey costs\nDry-docking and special survey costs are accounted for under the deferral method whereby the actual costs incurred are deferred and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the\nperiod through the date the next survey is scheduled to become due. Costs deferred are limited to actual costs incurred at the yard and parts used in the dry-docking or special survey.\nCosts deferred include expenditures incurred relating to shipyard costs, hull preparation and painting, inspection of hull structure and mechanical components, steelworks, machinery\nworks, and electrical works as well as lodging and subsistence of personnel sent to the yard site to supervise. If a dry-dock and/or a special survey is performed prior to its scheduled\ndate, the remaining unamortized balance is immediately expensed. Unamortized balances of vessels that are sold are written-off and included in the calculation of the resulting gain or\nloss in the period of a vessel’s sale. The amortization charge related to dry-docking costs and special survey costs is presented within Depreciation and amortization in the\naccompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss)/income.\nRevenue and expenses recognition\nThe Company currently generates its revenues from time charter contracts, voyage charter contracts and pool arrangements. Under a time charter agreement, a contract is entered\ninto for the use of a vessel for a specific period of time and a specified daily charter hire rate. Under a voyage charter agreement, a contract is made for the use of a vessel for a specific\nvoyage to transport a specified agreed upon cargo at a specified freight rate per ton or occasionally a lump sum amount. A part of the Company’s revenues is also generated from pool\narrangements, determined in accordance with the profit-sharing mechanism specified within each pool agreement. The Company recognizes pool revenue based on quarterly reports from\nthe pools which identifies the number of days the vessel participated in the pool, the total pool points for the period, the total pool revenue for the period, and the calculated share of\npool revenue for the vessel.\nRevenues related to time charter contracts\nThe Company accounts for its time charter contracts as operating leases pursuant to ASC 842 “Leases”. The Company has determined that the non-lease component in its time\ncharter contracts relates to services for the operation of the vessel, which comprise crew, technical and safety services, among others. The Company further elected to adopt the practical\nexpedient that provides it with the discretion to recognize lease revenue as a combined single lease component for all time charter contracts (operating leases) since it determined that the\nrelated lease component and non-lease component have the same timing and pattern of transfer and the predominant component is the lease. The Company qualitatively assessed that\nmore value is ascribed to the use of the asset (i.e., the vessel) rather than to the services provided under the time charter agreements.\nF-12\nTable of Contents\nTORO CORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in U.S. Dollars – except for share data unless otherwise stated)\n2. Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements: (continued)\nLease revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable rental periods of such charter agreements, as rental service is provided, beginning when a vessel is\ndelivered to the charterer until it is redelivered back to the Company, and is recorded as part of vessel revenues in the Company’s statement of comprehensive (loss)/income. Revenues\ngenerated from variable lease payments are recognized in the period when changes in facts and circumstances on which the variable lease payments are based occur. Deferred revenue\nincludes (i) cash received prior to the balance sheet date for which all criteria to recognize as lease revenue have not yet been met as at the balance sheet date and, accordingly, is related\nto revenue earned after such date and (ii) deferred contract revenue such as deferred ballast compensation earned as part of a lease contract. Lease revenue is shown net of commissions\npayable directly to charterers under the relevant time charter agreements. Charterers’ commissions represent discount on services rendered by the Company and no identifiable benefit is\nreceived in exchange for the consideration provided to the charterer. Apart from the agreed hire rate, the owner may be entitled to additional income, such as ballast bonus, which is\nconsidered as reimbursement of owner’s expenses and is recognized together with the lease component over the duration of the charter. The Company made an accounting policy\nelection to recognize the related ballast costs, which mainly consist of bunkers, incurred over the period between the charter party date or the prior redelivery date (whichever is latest)\nand the delivery date to the charterer, as contract fulfillment costs (please also refer to Voyage expenses below).\nRevenues related to voyage charter contracts\nThe Company accounts for its voyage charter contracts following the provisions of ASC 606, Revenue from contracts with customers. The Company has determined that its voyage\ncharter agreements do not contain a lease because the charterer under such contracts does not have the right to control the use of the vessel since the Company retains control over the\noperations of the vessel, the terms of the voyage charter are predetermined, and any change requires the Company’s consent and are therefore considered service contracts.\nThe Company assessed the provisions of ASC 606 and concluded that there is one single performance obligation when accounting for its voyage charters, which is to provide the\ncharterer with an integrated cargo transportation service within a specified period of time. In addition, the Company has concluded that voyage charter contracts meet the criteria to\nrecognize revenue over time as the charterer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the Company’s performance. As a result of the foregoing, voyage revenue derived\nfrom voyage charter contracts is recognized from the time when a vessel arrives at the load port until completion of cargo discharge. Demurrage income, which is considered a form of\nvariable consideration, is included in voyage revenues, and represents payments by the charterer to the vessel owner when loading or discharging time exceeds the stipulated time in the\nvoyage charter agreements. Demurrage income is recognized starting from the point that is determined that the amount can be estimated, and its collection is probable and on a straight-\nline basis until the end of the voyage.\nUnder a voyage charter agreement, the Company incurs and pays for certain voyage expenses, primarily consisting of bunkers consumption, brokerage commissions, port and canal\ncosts.\nRevenues related to pool contracts\nPool revenue for each vessel is determined in accordance with the profit-sharing mechanism specified within each pool agreement. In particular, the Company’s pool managers\naggregated the revenues and expenses of all of the pool participants and distribute the net earnings to participants, as applicable:\n• based on the pool points attributed to each vessel (which are determined by vessel attributes such as cargo carrying capacity, speed, fuel consumption, and construction and\nother characteristics); or\n• by making adjustments to account for the cost of performance, the bunkering fees and the trading capabilities of each vessel and the number of days the vessel participated in\nthe pool in the period (excluding off-hire days).\nF-13\nTable of Contents\nTORO CORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in U.S. Dollars – except for share data unless otherwise stated)\n2. Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements: (continued)\nThe Company records revenue generated from the pools in accordance with ASC 842, Leases, since it assesses that a vessel pool arrangement is a variable time charter with the\nvariable lease payments recorded as income in profit or loss in the period in which the changes in facts and circumstances on which the variable lease payments are based occur.\nVoyage expenses\nVoyage expenses, consist of: (a) port, canal and bunker expenses unique to a particular charter that the Company incurs primarily when its vessels operate under voyage charter\narrangements or during repositioning periods, and (b) brokerage commissions. All voyage expenses are expensed as incurred, except for contract fulfilment costs which are capitalized to\nthe extent the Company, in its reasonable judgement, determines that they (i) are directly related to a contract, (ii) will be recoverable and (iii) enhance the Company’s resources by\nputting the Company’s vessel in a location to satisfy its performance obligation under a contract pursuant to the provisions of ASC 340-40 “Other assets and deferred costs”. These\ncapitalized contract costs are amortized on a straight-line basis as the related performance obligations are satisfied. Costs to fulfill the contract prior to arriving at the load port primarily\nconsist of bunkers which are deferred and amortized during the voyage period. These capitalized contract fulfilment costs are recorded under “Deferred charges, net” in the\naccompanying balance sheet. At the inception of a time charter, the Company records the difference between the cost of bunker fuel delivered by the terminating charterer and the\nbunker fuel sold to the new charterer as a bunker gain or loss within voyage expenses.\nAccounting for financial instruments\nThe principal financial assets of the Company consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, amounts due from related parties and trade receivables, net. The principal\nfinancial liabilities of the Company consist of trade and other payables, accrued liabilities, long-term debt and amounts due to related parties.\nFair value measurements\nThe Company follows the provisions of ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” which defines, and provides guidance as to the measurement of fair value. ASC 820\ncreates a hierarchy of measurement and indicates that, when possible, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority (Level 1) to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority (Level 3) to unobservable data, for\nexample, the reporting entity’s own data. Under the standard, fair value measurements are separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy.\nRepairs and maintenance\nAll repair and maintenance expenses including underwater inspection expenses are expensed in the period incurred. Such costs are included in Vessel operating expenses in the\naccompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss)/income.\nSegment reporting\nThe Company engages in the operation of Aframax/LR2 and Handysize tanker vessels and LPG carrier vessels which have been identified as three reportable segments as a result of\nthe different characteristics of these three asset classes. The reportable segments reflect the internal organization of the Company and the way the chief operating decision maker\nreviews the operating results and allocates capital within the Company. The accounting policies applied to the reportable segments are the same as those used in the preparation of the\nCompany’s financial statements. When the Company charters a vessel to a charterer, the charterer is free to trade the vessel worldwide and, as a result, the disclosure of geographic\ninformation is impracticable.\nF-14\nTable of Contents\nTORO CORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in U.S. Dollars – except for share data unless otherwise stated)\n2. Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements: (continued)\nFinancing costs\nCosts associated with long-term debt, including but not limited to, fees paid to lenders, fees required to be paid to third parties on the lender’s behalf in connection with debt\nfinancing or refinancing, or any unamortized portion thereof, are presented by the Company as a reduction of long-term debt. Such fees are deferred and amortized in interest and finance\ncosts during the life of the related debt instrument using the effective interest method. Any unamortized balance of costs relating to loans repaid or refinanced is expensed in interest and\nfinance costs in the period in which the repayment or refinancing occurs, in accordance with the debt extinguishment guidance. Any unamortized balance of costs relating to refinanced\nlong-term debt is deferred and amortized over the term of the credit facility in the period that such refinancing occurs, subject to the provisions of the accounting guidance prescribed\nunder 470-50, Debt—Modifications and Extinguishments.\nCommitments, contingencies and provisions\nCommitments are recognized when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying\neconomic benefits will be required to settle this obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and\nadjusted to reflect the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation. Contingent liabilities are not recognized in the financial statements but are\ndisclosed unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote. Contingent assets are not recognized in the financial statements but are disclosed\nwhen an inflow of economic benefits is probable.\nAssets held for sale\nThe Company classifies a group of assets as being held for sale when all of the following criteria, enumerated under ASC 360 “Property, Plant, and Equipment”, are met: (i)\nmanagement has committed to a plan to sell the assets; (ii) the assets are available for immediate sale in their present condition; (iii) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions\nrequired to complete the plan to sell the assets have been initiated; (iv) the sale of the assets is probable, and transfer of the assets is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed\nsale within one year; (v) the assets are being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to their current fair value; and (vi) actions required to complete the plan\nindicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. Long-lived assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of\ntheir carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. The resulting difference, if any, is recorded under “Impairment loss” in the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss)/income.\nAn asset ceases being depreciated once it meets the held for sale classification criteria.\n(Loss)/ Earnings per common share\nBasic earnings per common share are computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during\nthe relevant period. Non-vested shares granted under the Company’s incentive plan, are entitled to receive dividends, which are not refundable even if such shares are forfeited, and\ntherefore are considered participating securities for basic earnings per share calculation purposes, using the two-class method. Dividends and deemed dividends on cumulative\nredeemable perpetual preferred shares reduce the income available to common shareholders (whether or not earned). Diluted earnings per common share reflects the potential dilution\nthat could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common shares were exercised or converted at the beginning of the periods presented, or issuance date, if later. Diluted earnings\nattributable to common shareholders per common share is computed by dividing the net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares\noutstanding plus the dilutive effect of convertible securities and shares issued and outstanding under the Company’s equity incentive plan during the applicable periods. The if\nconverted method is used to compute the dilutive effect of shares which could be issued upon conversion of the convertible preferred shares. For purposes of the if converted\ncalculation, the conversion price of convertible preferred shares is based on the fixed conversion price or on the average market price when the number of shares that may be issued is\nvariable. The treasury stock or the two-class method is used to compute the dilutive effect of shares issued under the Company’s equity incentive plan. The two-class method is used for\ndiluted earnings per common share when such is the most dilutive method, considering anti–dilution sequencing as per ASC 260. Potential common shares that have an anti-dilutive\neffect (i.e. those that increase income per share or decrease loss per share) are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share.\nF-15\nTable of Contents\nTORO CORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in U.S. Dollars – except for share data unless otherwise stated)\n2. Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements: (continued)\nInvestment in related party (Financial Instruments, Recognition and Measurement):\nThe Company has elected to measure equity securities without a readily determinable fair value that do not qualify for the practical expedient in ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement to\nestimate fair value using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) at its cost minus impairment, if any. At each reporting period, the Company also evaluates indicators such as the investee’s\nperformance and its ability to continue as going concern and market conditions, to determine whether an investment is impaired, in which case the Company will estimate the fair value of\nthe investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss.\nStock based compensation\nStock based compensation includes vested and non-vested shares that may be granted to directors, officers and employees of the Company and/or its subsidiaries and affiliates\nand consultants and service providers to the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates and is included in ‘General and administrative expenses’ in the accompanying consolidated\nstatements of comprehensive (loss)/income. These shares are measured at their fair value, which is equal to the market value of the Company’s common shares on the grant date. The\nshares that do not contain any future service vesting conditions are considered vested shares and the total fair value of such shares is recognized in full on the grant date. The shares\nthat contain a time-based service vesting condition are considered non-vested shares on the grant date and a total fair value of such shares is recognized using the accelerated\nattribution method, which treats an award with multiple vesting dates as multiple awards and results in a front-loading of the costs of the award. The fair value is recognized (as\ncompensation expense) over the requisite service period for all awards that vest. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur (Note 11).\nShare repurchases\nThe Company records the repurchase of its common shares at cost. The Company retires its repurchased common shares and reduces its common stock accordingly. Any excess of\nthe cost of the shares over their par value is allocated in additional paid-in capital, in accordance with ASC 505-30-30, Treasury Stock. Until their retirement these common shares are\nclassified as treasury stock, which is a reduction to shareholders’ equity. Treasury shares are included in authorized and issued shares but excluded from outstanding shares.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements:\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, which requires the disclosure of significant segment expenses that are part of an entity’s segment measure of profit or loss and\nregularly provided to the chief operating decision maker. In addition, it adds or makes clarifications to other segment-related disclosures, such as clarifying that the disclosure\nrequirements in ASC 280 are required for entities with a single reportable segment and that an entity may disclose multiple measures of segment profit and loss. ASU 2023-07 is effective\nfor fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be adopted\nretrospectively. The Company does not expect that the adoption of ASU 2023-07 would have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nF-16\nTable of Contents\nTORO CORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in U.S. Dollars – except for share data unless otherwise stated)\n3.

In exchange for these services, the relevant Toro Subsidiaries each paid Castor Ships (i) a daily fee of $250 per\nvessel for the provision of the services under the Ship Management Agreements, (ii) a commission of 1.25% on all charter agreements arranged by Castor Ships and (iii) a commission of\n1% on each vessel sale and purchase transaction.\nF-17\nTable of Contents\nTORO CORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in U.S. Dollars – except for share data unless otherwise stated)\n3. Transactions with Related Parties: (continued)\nEffective July 1, 2022, Castor entered into an Amended and Restated Master Management Agreement with Castor Ships. Under such agreement, Castor Ships agreed to provide the\nCompany with a broad range of management services such as crew management, technical management, operational employment management, insurance management, provisioning,\nbunkering, accounting and audit support services, commercial, chartering and administrative services, including, but not limited to, securing employment for the Company’s fleet,\narranging and supervising the vessels’ commercial operations, providing technical assistance where requested in connection with the sale of a vessel, negotiating loan and credit terms\nfor new financing upon request and providing cybersecurity and general corporate and administrative services, among other matters, which it may choose to subcontract to other parties\nat its discretion. Castor Ships generally is not liable to the Company for any loss, damage, delay, or expense incurred during the provision of the foregoing services, except insofar as\nsuch events arise from Castor Ships or its employees’ fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct (for which our recovery will be limited to two times the Flat Management Fee, as\ndefined below).\nUntil March 7, 2023, in exchange for these services, the Company paid Castor Ships (i) a flat quarterly management fee in the amount of $0.75 million for the management and\nadministration of their business (the “Flat Management Fee”), (ii) a commission of 1.25% on all gross income received from the operation of their vessels, and (iii) a commission of 1% on\neach consummated sale and purchase transaction. In addition, each of the Company’s subsidiaries paid Castor Ships a daily fee of $975 per vessel for the provision of commercial and\ntechnical ship management services provided under the ship management agreements (the “Ship Management Fee”). The Ship Management Fee and Flat Management Fee were\nadjusted annually for inflation on each anniversary of the effective date of the Amended and Restated Master Management Agreement. The Company’s subsidiaries will also reimburse\nCastor Ships for extraordinary fees and costs, such as the costs of extraordinary repairs, maintenance, or structural changes to their vessels. On March 7, 2023, Toro entered into a master\nmanagement agreement with Castor Ships with respect to its vessels in substantially the same form as Castor’s Amended and Restated Master Management Agreement (the “Master\nManagement Agreement”). The Ship Management Fee and Flat Management Fee are adjusted annually for inflation on each anniversary of the Master Management Agreement’s\neffective date and, in accordance with the terms of the Master Management Agreement, the Ship Management Fee increased from $975 per vessel per day to $1,039 per vessel per day\nand the Flat Management Fee increased from $0.75 million to $0.8 million effective July 1, 2023.

For each dividend period\ncommencing on or after the seventh anniversary of March 7, 2023, the rate shall be the rate in effect for the prior dividend period multiplied by a factor of 1.3; but the rate cannot exceed\n20% per annum in respect of any dividend period.\nSo long as any Series A Preferred Share remains outstanding, unless full Accrued Dividends on all outstanding Series A Preferred Shares through and including the most recently\ncompleted dividend period have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside for payment, no dividend may be declared or paid or set aside for\npayment, and no distribution may be made, on any junior stock, other than a dividend payable solely in stock that ranks junior to the Series A Preferred Shares in the payment of\ndividends and in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. “Accrued Dividends” means, with respect to Series A Preferred Shares, an\namount computed at the annual rate stated above from, as to each share, the date of issuance of such share to and including the date to which such dividends are to be accrued (whether\nor not such dividends have been declared), less the aggregate amount of all dividends previously paid on such share.\nFurther, so long as any Series A Preferred Share remains outstanding, unless full Accrued Dividends on all outstanding Series A Preferred Shares through and including the most\nrecently completed dividend period have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside for payment, no monies may be paid or made available for\na sinking fund for the redemption or retirement of junior stock, nor shall any shares of junior stock be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by us, directly or\nindirectly, other than (i) as a result of (x) a reclassification of junior stock, or (y) the exchange or conversion of one share of junior stock for or into another share of stock that ranks\njunior to the Series A Preferred Shares in the payment of dividends and in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company; or (ii) through the use\nof the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of stock that rank junior to the Series A Preferred Shares in the payment of dividends and in the distribution of\nassets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company.\nThe Series A Preferred Shares are convertible, at their holder’s option, to common shares after the third anniversary of March 7, 2023, until but excluding the seventh anniversary of\nMarch 7, 2023. The conversion price for any conversion of the Series A Preferred Shares shall be the lower of (i) 150% of the volume-weighted average price (“VWAP”) of our common\nshares over the five consecutive trading day period commencing on and including March 7, 2023, and (ii) the VWAP of our common shares over the 10 consecutive trading day period\nexpiring on the trading day immediately prior to the date of delivery of written notice of the conversion; provided, that, in no event shall the conversion price be less than $2.50.\nThe Company may, at its option, redeem the Series A Preferred Shares in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time after the seventh anniversary of March 7, 2023 (the Series\nA Preferred Shares issue date), at a cash redemption price equal to the stated amount, together with an amount equal to all accrued dividends.\nHolders of the Series A Preferred Shares do not have any voting rights except for a right to elect directors in the event of nonpayment of dividends and a vote or consent of the\nholders of at least two thirds of the Series A Preferred Shares at the time outstanding, voting together with any other series of preferred shares that would be adversely affected in\nsubstantially the same manner and entitled to vote as a single class in proportion to their respective stated amounts, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by\nvote at any meeting called for the purpose, for effecting or validating: (i) any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of our Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws that would alter\nor change the voting powers, preferences or special rights of the Series A Preferred Shares so as to affect them adversely; (ii) the issuance of dividend parity stock if the accrued\ndividends on all outstanding Series A Preferred Shares through and including the most recently completed dividend period have not been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the\npayment thereof has been set aside for payment; (iii) any amendment or alteration of the Articles of Incorporation to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any shares\nof any class or series or any securities convertible into shares of any class or series of our capital stock ranking prior to Series A in the payment of dividends or in the distribution of\nassets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company; or (iv) any consummation of (x) a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series A Preferred\nShares, (y) a merger or consolidation of the Company with another entity (whether or not a corporation), or (z) a conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance of the Company into\nanother entity or an entity organized under the laws of another jurisdiction, unless in each case (A) the Series A Preferred Shares remain outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or\nconsolidation with respect to which we are not the surviving or resulting entity, or any such conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance, the Series A Preferred Shares are\nconverted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, and (B) such shares remaining outstanding or such preference securities,\nas the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions, and limitations and restrictions thereof, taken as a whole, as are not\nmaterially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and restrictions and limitations thereof, of the Series A Preferred Shares\nimmediately prior to such consummation, taken as a whole.\nF-26\nTable of Contents\nTORO CORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in U.S. Dollars – except for share data unless otherwise stated)\n8. Mezzanine equity: (continued)\nIn the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, before any distribution or payment out of the Company’s\nassets may be made to or set aside for the holders of any junior stock, holders of Series A Preferred Shares will be entitled to receive out of our assets legally available for distribution to\nour shareholders an amount equal to the stated amount per share of $1,000, together with an amount equal to all accrued dividends to the date of payment whether or not earned or\ndeclared.\nThe Series A Preferred Shares have been classified in Mezzanine equity as per ASC 480-10-S99 “Distinguishing liabilities from Equity – SEC Materials” as they are in essence\nredeemable at the option of the holder as Mr. Panagiotidis, the Chief Executive Officer and controlling shareholder of Castor and Toro, who can effectively determine the timing of the\nredemption of the Series A Preferred Shares.\nThe Company uses an effective interest rate of 3.71% over the expected life of the preferred stock being nine years which is the expected earliest redemption date. This is consistent\nwith the interest method, taking into account the discount between the issuance price and liquidation preference and the stated dividends, including “step-up” amounts. The amount\naccreted during the period March 7, 2023 through December 31, 2023 was $2,429,275 and is presented as ‘Deemed dividend on Series A Preferred Shares’ in the accompanying\nconsolidated statements of comprehensive (loss)/income.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the net value of Mezzanine Equity amounted to $119,601,410, comprising (i) the fair value measurement of the Series A Preferred Shares on initial\nrecognition based on a third party valuation of $117,222,135, less issuance costs of $50,000 and (ii) $2,429,275 of deemed dividend on the Series A Preferred Shares during the period\nMarch 7, 2023 through December 31, 2023, and is separately presented as ‘Mezzanine Equity’ in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2023, the Company\npaid to Castor a dividend amounting to $851,667 on the Series A Preferred Shares for the period from March 7, 2023 to October 14, 2023 and the accrued amount for the period from\nOctober 15, 2023 to December 31, 2023 (included in the dividend period ended January 14, 2024) amounted to $315,000 (Notes 3(d) and 18(a)).\n9. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Disclosures:\nThe principal financial assets of the Company consist of cash at banks, restricted cash, trade accounts receivable, an investment in a related party, Castor Maritime Inc., and\namounts due from related parties. The principal financial liabilities of the Company consist of trade accounts payable, amounts due to related parties and long-term debt.\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments:\n• Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable trade, net, amounts due from/to related party/(ies) and accounts payable: The carrying values reported in the consolidated\nbalance sheets for those financial instruments are reasonable estimates of their fair values due to their short-term maturity nature. Cash and cash equivalents are considered\nLevel 1 items as they represent liquid assets with short term maturities. The carrying value approximates the fair market value for interest bearing cash classified as restricted\ncash, non-current and is considered Level 1 item of the fair value hierarchy.\nF-27\nTable of Contents\nTORO CORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in U.S. Dollars – except for share data unless otherwise stated)\n9. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Disclosures: (continued)\n• Long-term debt: The secured credit facility discussed in Note 6, has a recorded value which is a reasonable estimate of its fair value due to its variable interest rate and is thus\nconsidered Level 2 item in accordance with the fair value hierarchy as SOFR rates are observable at commonly quoted intervals for the full terms of the loans.\n• Investment in related party: Investment in related party is initially measured at the transaction price and subsequently assessed for the existence of any observable market for\nthe Castor Series D Preferred Shares and any observable price changes for identical or similar investments and the existence of any indications for impairment. As per the\nCompany’s assessment no such case was identified as at December 31, 2023.\nConcentration of credit risk: Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of cash and cash\nequivalents, due from related parties and trade accounts receivable. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents, consisting mostly of deposits, with high credit qualified financial\ninstitutions. The Company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of the financial institutions in which it places its deposits. The Company limits its credit risk with\naccounts receivable by performing ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition.\n10. Commitments and Contingencies:\nVarious claims, lawsuits, and complaints, including those involving government regulations and product liability, arise in the ordinary course of the shipping business. In addition,\nlosses may arise from disputes with charterers, pool operators, agents, insurance and other claims with suppliers relating to the operations of the Company’s vessels. Currently,\nmanagement is not aware of any such claims or contingent liabilities, which should be disclosed, or for which a provision should be established in the accompanying consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nThe Company accrues for the cost of environmental liabilities when management becomes aware that a liability is probable and is able to reasonably estimate the probable exposure.\nAs of the date of these consolidated financial statements, management was not aware of any such claims or contingent liabilities that should be disclosed or for which a provision\nshould be established in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company is covered for liabilities associated with the vessels’ actions to the maximum limits as\nprovided by Protection and Indemnity (P&I) Clubs, members of the International Group of P&I Clubs.\n(a) Commitments under long-term lease contracts\nThe following table sets forth the future minimum contracted lease payments to the Company (gross of charterers’ commissions), based on the Company’s vessels’ commitments to\nnon-cancelable time charter contracts as of December 31, 2023. Non-cancelable time charter contracts include fixed-rate time charters.\nTwelve-month period ending December 31, Amount\n2024 $ 3,708,206\nTotal $ 3,708,206\nF-28\nTable of Contents\nTORO CORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in U.S. Dollars – except for share data unless otherwise stated)\n11. Equity Incentive Plan:\nOn September 6, 2023, the Company’s board of directors adopted an Equity Incentive Plan (the “Equity Incentive Plan”) under which directors, officers and employees (including\nany prospective director, officer or employee) of the Company and/or its subsidiaries and affiliates and consultants and service providers to (including persons who are employed by or\nprovide services to any entity that is itself a consultant or service provider to) the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates, are eligible to receive awards including (a) non-qualified\nstock options, (b) stock appreciation rights, (c) restricted stock, (d) restricted stock unit, (e) dividend equivalents, (f) cash awards, (g) unrestricted stock and (h) other equity-based or\nequity-related Awards. The Equity Incentive Plan is administered by the Company’s board of directors and the aggregate number of common shares that may be issued with respect to\nawards granted under the Equity Incentive Plan cannot exceed the 2,000,000 common shares. The Company’s board of directors may terminate the Equity Incentive Plan at any time. On\nSeptember 28, 2023, a total of 1,240,000 restricted common shares had been granted under the Plan to directors, officers and non-employees. The fair value of each restricted share was\n$5.83, based on the latest closing price of the Company’s common shares on the grant date.\nThe stock based compensation cost for the non-vested shares for the year ended December 31, 2023 amounted to $1,272,698 and is included in ‘General and administrative\nexpenses’ in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss)/income.\nA summary of the status of the Company’s non-vested restricted shares as of December 31, 2023, is presented below:\nWeighted average grant\nNumber of date fair value per\nrestricted shares non-vested share\nNon-vested, September 6, 2023 — —\nGranted 1,240,000 5.83\nNon-vested, December 31, 2023 1,240,000 5.83\nNo shares vested during the period presented. The remaining unrecognized compensation cost relating to the shares granted amounting to $5,956,502 as of December 31, 2023, is\nexpected to be recognized over the remaining period of three years, according to the contractual terms of those non-vested share awards.\n12. (Loss)/Earnings Per Common Share:\nThe computation of (loss)/earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during that period and gives retroactive effect to the shares\nissued in connection with the Spin-Off.\nThe Company calculates (loss)/earnings per common share by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares\noutstanding during the relevant period.\nThe Company calculates basic (loss)/earnings per share in conformity with the two-class method required for companies with participating securities. The calculation of basic\n(loss)/earnings per share does not consider the non-vested shares as outstanding until the time-based vesting restrictions have lapsed.\nF-29\nTable of Contents\nTORO CORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in U.S. Dollars – except for share data unless otherwise stated)\n12. (Loss)/Earnings Per Common Share: (continued)\nDiluted (loss)/earnings per common share, if applicable, reflects the potential dilution that could occur if potentially dilutive instruments were exercised, resulting in the issuance of\nadditional shares that would then share in the Company’s net income. For the purpose of calculating diluted (loss)/earnings per common share, the weighted average number of diluted\nshares outstanding includes (i) the conversion of outstanding Series A Preferred Shares (Note 8) calculated with the “if converted” method by using the average closing market price\nover the reporting period from March 7, 2023 to December 31, 2023 and (ii) the incremental shares assumed to be issued, determined under the two-class method weighted for the periods\nthe non-vested shares were outstanding, since the two-class method was more dilutive than the treasury stock method. The components of the calculation of basic and diluted\n(loss)/earnings per common share in each of the periods comprising the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss)/income are as follows:\nPeriod ended Year ended Year ended\nDecember 31, December 31, December 31,\n2021 2022 2023\nNet (loss)/income and comprehensive (loss)/income $ (1,430,391) $ 49,926,383 $ 140,636,993\nDividend on Series A Preferred Shares — — (1,166,667)\nDeemed dividend on Series A Preferred Shares — — (2,429,275)\nUndistributed earnings to non-vested participating securities — — (2,805,275)\nNet (loss)/income attributable to common Shareholders, basic $ (1,430,391) $ 49,926,383 $ 134,235,776\nUndistributed earnings to non-vested participating securities — — 2,805,275\nUndistributed earnings reallocated to non-vested participating securities — — (926,641)\nDividend on Series A Preferred Shares — — 1,166,667\nDeemed dividend on Series A Preferred Shares — — 2,429,275\nNet (loss)/income attributable to common Shareholders, diluted $ (1,430,391) $ 49,926,383 $ 139,710,352\nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding, basic 9,461,009 9,461,009 15,443,485\nEffect of dilutive shares — 33,216,240 33,216,240\nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding, diluted 9,461,009 42,677,249 48,659,725\n(Loss)/Earnings per common share, basic $ (0.15) $ 5.28 $ 8.69\n(Loss)/Earnings per common share, diluted $ (0.15) $ 1.17 $ 2.87\n13.

Vessel Revenues: (Continued)\nThe Company generates its revenues from time charters, voyage contracts and pool arrangements.\nThe Company typically enters into time charters ranging from one month to twelve months, and, in isolated cases, for longer terms, depending on market conditions. The charterer\nhas the full discretion over the ports visited, shipping routes and vessel speed, subject to the owner’s protective restrictions set forth in the agreed charterparty’s terms. Time charter\nagreements may have extension options that range over certain time periods, which are usually periods of months. The time charter party generally provides, among others, typical\nwarranties regarding the speed and the performance of the vessel as well as owner protective restrictions such that the vessel is sent only to safe ports by the charterer, subject always\nto compliance with applicable sanction laws and war risks, and carry only lawful and non-hazardous cargo.\nVessels are also chartered under voyage charters, where a contract is made for the use of a vessel under which the Company is paid freight on the basis of transporting cargo from a\nloading port to a discharge port. Depending on charterparty terms, freight can be fully prepaid, or be paid upon reaching the discharging destination upon delivery of the cargo, at the\ndischarging destination but before discharging, or during a ship’s voyage.\nThe Company employs certain of its vessels in pools. The main objective of pools is to enter into arrangements for the employment and operation of the pool vessels, so as to\nsecure for the pool participants the highest commercially available earnings per vessel on the basis of pooling the revenue and expenses of the pool vessels and dividing it between the\npool participants based on the terms of the pool agreement. The Company typically enters into pool arrangements for a minimum period of six months, subject to certain rights of\nsuspension and/or early termination.\nAs of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, ‘Trade accounts receivable, net’, related to voyage charters, amounted to $303,577 and $2,462,714, respectively. This decrease by\n$2,159,137 in ‘Trade accounts receivable, net’ was mainly attributable to the timing of collections and the employment in pools of our tanker fleet, except one tanker vessel that operated\nunder period time charter during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, there were no deferred assets and liabilities related to voyage charters.\n14.

Segment Information:\nIn the second quarter of 2023, the Company established its LPG carrier operations through the acquisition of two LPG carrier vessels. With effect from the second quarter of 2023,\nthe Company operated in three reportable segments: (i) the Aframax/LR2 tanker segment, (ii) the Handysize tanker segment and (iii) the LPG carrier segment. The reportable segments\nreflect the internal organization of the Company and the way the chief operating decision maker reviews the operating results and allocates capital within the Company. Further, the\ntransport of crude oil (carried by Aframax/LR2 tankers), refined petroleum products (carried by Handysize tanker vessels) and liquefied petroleum gas (carried by LPG carriers) has\ndifferent characteristics.

Income Taxes:\nToro and its subsidiaries are incorporated under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, but are not subject to income taxes in the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Toro’s\nship-owning subsidiaries are subject to registration and tonnage taxes, which have been included in Vessel operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of\ncomprehensive (loss)/income.\nPursuant to §883 of the Internal Revenue Code of the United States (the “Code”), U.S. source income from the international operation of ships is generally exempt from U.S. Federal\nincome tax on such income if the company meets the following requirements: (a) the company is organized in a foreign country that grants an equivalent exception to corporations\norganized in the U. S. and (b) either (i) more than 50 percent of the value of the company’s stock is owned, directly or indirectly, by individuals who are “residents” of the company’s\ncountry of organization or of another foreign country that grants an “equivalent exemption” to corporations organized in the U.S. (the “50% Ownership Test”) or (ii) the company’s stock\nis “primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market” in its country of organization, in another country that grants an “equivalent exemption” to U.S. corporations, or in\nthe U.S. (the “Publicly Traded Test”). Marshall Islands, the jurisdiction where the Company and its ship-owning subsidiaries are incorporated, grants an equivalent exemption to United\nStates corporations. Therefore, the Company is exempt from United States federal income taxation with respect to U.S.-source shipping income if either the 50% Ownership Test or the\nPublicly Traded Test is met.\nIn the Company’s case, it would have satisfied the Publicly Traded Test if its common shares represented more than 50% of the voting power of its stock, and it can establish that\nnonqualified shareholders cannot exercise voting control over the corporation because a qualified shareholder controls the non-traded voting stock. The Company therefore believes its\nstock structure, when considered by the U.S. Treasury in light of the Publicly Traded Test enunciated in the regulations, satisfies the intent and purpose of the exemption. This position\nis uncertain and was disclosed to the Internal Revenue Service when the Company filed its U.S. tax returns for 2021 and 2022. It will be disclosed again when the Company files its U.S.\ntax returns for 2023.\nBecause the position stated above is uncertain, the Company has recorded provisions of $206,174, $960,181, and $350,667 for U.S. source gross transportation income tax in the\naccompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss)/income for the period ended December 31, 2021 and the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively.\nF-34\nTable of Contents\nTORO CORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in U.S. Dollars – except for share data unless otherwise stated)\n18. Subsequent Events:\n(a) Dividend on Series A Preferred Shares: On January 16, 2024, the Company paid to Castor a dividend on the Series A Preferred Shares, which was declared on December 27,\n2023,amounting to $350,000 for the dividend period from October 15, 2023 to January 14, 2024.\n(b) Sale of the M/T Wonder Sirius and prepayment of the $18.0 Million Term Facility: On January 8, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with an unaffiliated third party for\nthe sale of the M/T Wonder Sirius, at a price of $33.8 million. The vessel was delivered to its new owner on January 24, 2024. The Company expects to record during the first quarter\nof 2024 a net gain on the sale of the M/T Wonder Sirius of approximately $20.9 million, excluding any transaction related costs. The Company used part of the proceeds of the sale of\nM/T Wonder Sirius to fully prepay the remaining outstanding balance of $5.3 million under the $18.0 Million Term Facility (described in Note 6), under which the M/T Wonder Sirius\nserved as security. As a result, we have no outstanding indebtedness under any facility as of February 29, 2024. Further, as a result of the sale, the Company no longer has any\nAframax/LR2 vessels and management has determined that, with effect from the second quarter of 2024, the Company operates in two reportable segments: (i) the Handysize tanker\nsegment and (ii) the LPG carrier segment.\n(c) Share Repurchase Program: Between January 1, 2024 and February 29, 2024, the Company repurchased 476,970 shares of common stock for aggregate consideration of 2.8 million\nunder its share repurchase program.\nF-35\nExhibit 2.2\nDESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT’S SECURITIES REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934\nAs of the date of the annual report to which this exhibit is being filed, Toro Corp. (the “Company”) had two classes of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”):\n(1) Common shares, par value $0.001 per share (the “common shares”); and\n(2) Preferred Share Purchase Rights under the Rights Agreement, as defined below (a “Right” or the “Rights”).\nThe following description sets forth certain material provisions of these securities. The following summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in\nits entirety by reference to, the applicable provisions of (i) the Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the “Articles of Incorporation”), (ii) the Company’s\nAmended and Restated Bylaws (the “Bylaws”), and (iii) the Shareholder Protection Rights Agreement, dated as of March 7, 2023 (the “Rights Agreement”), by and between the\nCompany and Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, LLC, as rights agent (the “Rights Agent”), each of which is an exhibit to the annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 (the “Annual Report”) of which this Exhibit is a part. We encourage you to refer to our Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws and the Rights Agreement for additional\ninformation.\nCapitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings given to them in our Annual Report.\nOUR SHARE CAPITAL\nUnder our Articles of Incorporation our authorized capital stock consists of 4,000,000,000 registered shares, of which 3,900,000,000 are designated as common shares, par value\n$0.001 per share, and 100,000,000 are designated as preferred shares, par value $0.001 per share. As of December 31, 2023, we had 19,021,758 common shares issued and 18,978,409\ncommon shares outstanding (net of 43,349 treasury shares), 140,000 1.00% Series A Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Shares and 40,000 Series B Preferred Shares.\nNo Series C Participating Preferred Shares were authorized as of the same time. Our common shares and associated Rights are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol\n“TORO”.\nAny amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to alter our capital structure requires approval by an affirmative majority of the voting power of the total number of shares\nissued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereon. Shareholders of any series or class of shares are entitled to vote upon any proposed amendment, whether or not entitled to vote\nthereon by the Articles of Incorporation, if such amendment would (i) increase or decrease the par value of the shares of such series or class, or, (ii) alter or change the powers,\npreferences or special rights of the shares of such series or class so as to adversely affect them. Such class vote would be conducted in addition to the vote of all shares entitled to vote\nupon the amendment and requires approval by an affirmative majority of the voting power of the affected series or class.\nDESCRIPTION OF COMMON SHARES\nHolders of common shares do not have conversion, sinking fund, redemption or pre-emptive rights to subscribe to any of our securities. There are no restrictions under\nMarshall Islands law on the transferability of our common shares. The rights, preferences and privileges of holders of our common shares are subject to the rights of the holders of any\npreferred shares, which we have issued in the past or which we may issue in the future.\nVoting Rights\nEach outstanding common share entitles the holder to one (1) vote on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders. Our directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast\nby shareholders entitled to vote and serve for three-year terms. There is no provision for cumulative voting. Our common shares and Series B Preferred Shares vote together as a class\non most matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of the Company, though our Articles of Incorporation provide for a separate vote of the Series B Preferred Shares for certain matters\nadversely impacting such shares rights and preferences. Series B Preferred Shares have one hundred thousand (100,000) votes per share and currently have a controlling vote over the\nmatters put to a vote of the Company’s shareholders over which they are entitled to vote together with the common shares as a single class.\nAll of our 40,000 Series B Preferred Shares were issued to Pelagos Holdings Corp (“Pelagos”). Pelagos is a company controlled by Petros Panagiotidis, our Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer. Further, as of February 29, 2024, Pani, a corporation controlled by Mr. Panagiotidis, owned 51.9% of 18,501,439 outstanding common shares, net of 476,970 treasury\nshares. As a result, we are controlled by Mr. Panagiotidis, which makes it more difficult to effect a change of control of us.\nDividend Rights\nSubject to preferences that may be applicable to any outstanding preferred shares, including the Series A Preferred Shares, holders of common shares are entitled to receive\nratably all dividends, if any, declared by our Board of Directors (the “Board”) out of funds legally available for dividends.\nOur Series A Preferred Shares provide that holders of Series A Preferred Shares are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by our Board, but only out of funds legally\navailable therefor, cumulative cash dividends at the Annual Rate and no more, payable quarterly in arrears on the 15th day of each January, April, July and October, respectively, in each\nyear, beginning on April 15, 2023 (each, a “Dividend Payment Date”), with respect to the Dividend Period ending on the day preceding such respective Dividend Payment Date. So long\nas any Series A Preferred Share remains outstanding, unless full Accrued Dividends on all outstanding Series A Preferred Shares through and including the most recently completed\nDividend Period have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside for payment, no dividend may be declared or paid or set aside for payment,\nand no distribution may be made, on any Junior Stock, other than a dividend payable solely in stock that ranks junior to the Series A Preferred Shares in the payment of dividends and in\nthe distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company.\nFor purposes of the Series A Preferred Shares:\n(i) “Accrued Dividends” means an amount computed at the Annual Rate from, as to each share, the date of issuance of such share to and including the date to which such\ndividends are to be accrued (whether or not such dividends have been declared), less the aggregate amount of all dividends previously paid on such share;\n(ii) “Annual Rate” means (A) from, and including, March 7, 2023 to, but excluding, the seventh anniversary of such date (the “Reset Date”), 1.00% per annum of the stated\namount and (B) for each Dividend Period commencing on or after the Reset Date, the Annual Rate in effect for the prior Dividend Period multiplied by a factor of 1.3; provided, however,\nthat in no event will the Annual Rate on the Series A Preferred Shares exceed 20% per annum in respect of any Dividend Period;\n(iii) “Dividend Period” means each period commencing on (and including) a Dividend Payment Date and continuing to (but not including) the next succeeding Dividend\nPayment Date; and\n(iv) “Junior Stock” means our common shares, the Series B Preferred Shares and any class or series of our stock that ranks junior to the Series A Preferred Shares in the payment\nof dividends or in the distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up.\nSo long as any Series A Preferred Share remains outstanding, unless full Accrued Dividends on all outstanding Series A Preferred Shares through and including the most\nrecently completed Dividend Period have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside for payment, no monies may be paid or made available for\na sinking fund for the redemption or retirement of Junior Stock, nor shall any shares of Junior Stock be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by us, directly or\nindirectly, other than (i) as a result of (x) a reclassification of Junior Stock, or (y) the exchange or conversion of one share of Junior Stock for or into another share of stock that ranks\njunior to the Series A Preferred Shares in the payment of dividends and in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company; or (ii) through the use\nof the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of stock that rank junior to the Series A Preferred Shares in the payment of dividends and in the distribution of\nassets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company.\nLiquidation Rights\nUpon our dissolution or liquidation or winding up of our affairs, whether voluntary or involuntary, after payment in full of all amounts required to be paid to creditors and to the\nholders of preferred shares having liquidation preferences, including the Series A Preferred Shares, the holders of our common shares are entitled to receive pro rata our remaining assets\navailable for distribution.\nOur Series A Preferred Shares provide that in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, before any\ndistribution or payment out of our assets may be made to or set aside for the holders of any Junior Stock, holders of Series A Preferred Shares will be entitled to receive out of our assets\nlegally available for distribution to our shareholders an amount equal to the stated amount per Series A Preferred Share ($1,000), together with an amount equal to all Accrued Dividends\nto the date of payment whether or not earned or declared (the “Liquidation Preference”). If the Liquidation Preference has been paid in full to all holders of Series A Preferred Shares and\nall holders of any class or series of our stock that ranks on a parity with Series A Preferred Shares in the distribution of assets on liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company,\nthe holders of Junior Stock will be entitled to receive all of our remaining assets according to their respective rights and preferences.\nLimitations on Ownership\nUnder Marshall Islands law generally and our Articles of Incorporation, there are no limitations on the right of persons who are not citizens or residents of the Marshall Islands\nto hold or vote our common shares.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RIGHTS UNDER THE STOCKHOLDERS RIGHTS AGREEMENT\nPreferred Shares and the Rights\nOur Articles of Incorporation authorize our Board to establish one or more series of preferred shares and to determine, with respect to any series of preferred shares, the terms\nand rights of that series, including:\n• the designation of the series;\n• the number of shares of the series;\n• the preferences and relative, participating, option or other special rights, if any, and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such series; and\n• the voting rights, if any, of the holders of the series.\nOn March 7, 2023, our Board declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each outstanding common share and adopted a rights plan, as set forth in the Rights\nAgreement. Each Right entitles the holder to purchase from the Company, for $22, one common share (or one one-thousandth of a share of Series C Participating Preferred Shares) and\nwill become exercisable following the earlier of (i) the tenth business day (or other date designated by resolution of the Board) after any person other than our Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer, Petros Panagiotidis, or Mr. Panagiotidis’ controlled affiliates commences a tender offer that would result in such person becoming the beneficial owner of a total of 15%\nor more of the common shares or (ii) the date of the “Flip-in” Trigger, as defined below.\nThe rights plan adopted under the Rights Agreement and the Rights have the following characteristics:\n• Distribution and Transfer of the Rights. Our Board will declare a dividend of one Right for each share of our common shares outstanding. Prior to the Separation Time\nreferred to below, the Rights would be evidenced by and trade with our common shares and would not be exercisable. After the Separation Time, we would cause the\nRights Agent to mail Rights certificates to shareholders and the Rights would trade independent of the common shares. New Rights will accompany any new common\nshares of the Company issued after the Distribution until the Separation Time.\n• Separation Time. Rights would separate from our common shares and become exercisable following the earlier of (i) the tenth (10) business day (or other date designated\nby resolution of the Board) after any person (other than Mr. Panagiotidis or his controlled affiliates) commences a tender offer that would result in such person becoming\nthe beneficial owner of a total of 15% or more of the common shares or (ii) the date of the “Flip-in” Trigger.\n• Exercise of the Rights. On or after the Separation Time, each Right would initially entitle the holder to purchase, for $22 (the “Exercise Price”), one common share (or one\none-thousandth of a share of Series C Participating Preferred Shares, such portion of a Series C Participating Preferred Share being designed to give the shareholder\napproximately the same dividend, voting and liquidation rights as would one common share). Prior to exercise, the Right does not give its holder any dividend, voting, or\nliquidation rights.\n• “Flip-in” Trigger. Upon public announcement by the Company that any person other than Mr. Panagiotidis or his controlled affiliates (an “Acquiring Person”) has\nacquired 15% or more of our outstanding common shares:\n(i) Rights owned by the Acquiring Person or transferees thereof would automatically be void; and\n(ii) each other Right will automatically become a right to buy, for the Exercise Price, that number of common shares of the Company (or equivalent fractional shares of\nSeries C Participating Preferred Shares) having a market value of twice the Exercise Price.\n• “Flip-over” Trigger. After an Acquiring Person has become such, (i) the Company may not consolidate or merge with any person, if the Company’s Board is controlled\nby the Acquiring Person or the Acquiring Person is the beneficial owner of 50% or more of the outstanding shares of our common shares, and the transaction is with the\nAcquiring Person or its affiliate or associate or the shares owned by the Acquiring Person are treated differently from those of other shareholders, and (ii) the Company\nmay not sell 50% or more of its assets if the Company’s Board is controlled by the Acquiring Person unless in either case proper provision is made so that each Right\nwould thereafter become a right to buy, for the Exercise Price, that number of common shares of such other person having a market value of twice the Exercise Price.\n• Redemption. The Rights may be redeemed by the Board, at any time until a “Flip-in” Trigger has occurred, at a redemption price of $0.001 per Right.\n• Power to Amend. Our Board may amend the Rights Agreement in any respect until a “Flip-in” Trigger has occurred. Thereafter, our Board may amend the Rights\nAgreement in any respect not materially adverse to Rights holders generally.\n• Expiration. The Rights will expire on the tenth anniversary of the Distribution Date.\nFurthermore, if any person (other than Mr. Panagiotidis or his controlled affiliates) acquires between 15% and 50% of our outstanding common shares, the Board may, in lieu of\nallowing Rights to be exercised, require each outstanding Right to be exchanged for one common share of the Company (or one one-thousandth of a share of Series C Participating\nPreferred Shares). The Board may enter into a trust agreement pursuant to which the Company would deposit into a trust its common shares that would be distributable to shareholders\n(excluding the Acquiring Person) in the event this exchange option is implemented.\nCertain synthetic interests in securities created by derivative positions, whether or not such interests are considered to be ownership of the underlying common shares or are\nreportable for purposes of Regulation 13D of the Exchange Act, as amended, are treated as beneficial ownership of the number of our common shares equivalent to the economic\nexposure created by the derivative position, to the extent our actual common shares are directly or indirectly held by counterparties to the derivatives contracts. Swaps dealers\nunassociated with any control intent or intent to evade the purposes of the Rights Agreement are excepted from such imputed beneficial ownership.\nThe Rights Agreement “grandfathers” the current level of ownership of persons who, prior to the date of the Rights Agreement, beneficially owned 15% or more of our\noutstanding common shares, so long as they do not purchase additional shares in excess of certain limitations. Such provisions also “grandfather” our Chairman and Chief Executive\nOfficer, Petros Panagiotidis, and Mr. Panagiotidis’ controlled affiliates.\nThe Rights may have anti-takeover effects. The Rights will cause substantial dilution to any person or group that attempts to acquire us without the approval of our Board. As\na result, the overall effect of the Rights may be to render more difficult or discourage any attempt to acquire us. Because our Board can approve a redemption of the Rights for a\npermitted offer, the Rights should not interfere with a merger or other business combination approved by our Board.\nAnti-Takeover Provisions in our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws\nSeveral provisions of the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws could make it difficult for shareholders to change the composition of our Board in any one year, preventing them\nfrom changing the composition of management. In addition, the same provisions may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that shareholders may consider favorable.\nThese provisions are:\n• authorizing our Board to issue “blank check” preferred shares without shareholder approval;\n• providing for a classified Board with staggered, three-year terms for three classes of directors;\n• establishing certain advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board or for proposing matters that can be acted on by shareholders at\nshareholder meetings;\n• prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n• limiting the persons who may call special meetings of shareholders; and\n• establishing supermajority voting provisions with respect to amendments to certain provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws.\nThe Articles of Incorporation also prohibit any Interested Shareholder from engaging in a Business Combination (as defined in the Articles of Incorporation) with us within\nthree years after the owner acquired such ownership, except where:\n• the Board approved either the Business Combination or the transaction which resulted in the shareholder becoming an Interested Shareholder;\n• upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the shareholder becoming an Interested Shareholder, the Interested Shareholder owned at least 85% of the\nvoting stock of the Company outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the number of voting stock outstanding\nthose shares or equity interests owned (i) by persons who are directors and also officers and (ii) employee stock plans in which employee participants do not have\nthe right to determine confidentially whether shares or equity interests held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or\n• at or subsequent to such time, the Business Combination is approved by the Board and authorized at an annual or special meeting of shareholders, and not by\nwritten consent, by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the Interested Shareholder.\nThe foregoing restrictions do not apply if:\n• A shareholder becomes an Interested Shareholder inadvertently and (i) as soon as practicable divests itself of ownership of sufficient shares or equity interests so\nthat the shareholder ceases to be an Interested Shareholder; and (ii) would not, at any time within the three-year period immediately prior to a Business Combination\nbetween the Company and such shareholder, have been an Interested Shareholder but for the inadvertent acquisition of ownership; or\n• The Business Combination is proposed prior to the consummation or abandonment of and subsequent to the earlier of the public announcement or the notice\nrequired hereunder of a proposed transaction which (i) constitutes one of the transactions described in the following sentence; (ii) is with or by a person who either\nwas not an Interested Shareholder during the previous three years or who became an Interested Shareholder with the approval of the Board; and (iii) is approved or\nnot opposed by a majority of the members of the Board then in office (but not less than one) who were directors prior to any person becoming an Interested\nShareholder during the previous three years or were recommended for election or elected to succeed such directors by a majority of such directors. The proposed\ntransactions referred to in the preceding sentence are limited to:\no a merger or consolidation of the Company (except for a merger in respect of which, pursuant to the BCA, no vote of the shareholders of the Company is\nrequired);\no a sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition (in one transaction or a series of transactions), whether as part of a dissolution or\notherwise, of assets of the Company or of any direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiary of the Company (other than to any direct or indirect wholly-owned\nsubsidiary or to the Company) having an aggregate market value equal to 50% or more of either the aggregate market value of all of the assets of the Company\ndetermined on a consolidated basis or the aggregate market value of all the outstanding common shares of the Company; or\no a proposed tender or exchange offer for 50% or more of the outstanding common shares of the Company.\nFor the purposes of the foregoing, “Interested Shareholder” means any person (other than the Company and any direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiary of the Company)\nthat (i) is the owner of 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the Company, or (ii) is an affiliate or associate of the Company and was the owner of fifteen percent (15%) or more\nof the outstanding voting stock of the Company at any time within the three-year period immediately prior to the date on which it is sought to be determined whether such person is an\nInterested Shareholder; and the affiliates and associates of such person; provided, however, that the term “Interested Shareholder” shall not include any person whose ownership of\nshares in excess of the fifteen percent (15%) limitation set forth herein is the result of action taken solely by the Company; provided that such person shall be an Interested Shareholder\nif thereafter such person acquires additional shares of voting stock of the Company, except as a result of further Company action not caused, directly or indirectly, by such person. For\nthe purpose of determining whether a person is an Interested Shareholder, the voting stock of the Company deemed to be outstanding shall include voting stock deemed to be owned by\nthe person, but shall not include any other unissued shares which may be issuable pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding, or upon exercise of conversion rights,\nwarrants or options, or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Petros Panagiotidis, his affiliates and associates shall not be considered an Interested Shareholder.\nMarshall Islands Company Considerations\nOur corporate affairs are governed by our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and by the BCA. The provisions of the BCA resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a\nnumber of states in the United States. While the BCA provides that its provisions shall be applied and construed in a manner to make them uniform with the laws of the State of Delaware\nand other states of the United States of America with substantially similar legislative provisions, there have been few, if any, court cases interpreting the BCA in the Marshall Islands and\nwe cannot predict whether Marshall Islands courts would reach the same conclusions as courts in the United States. As a result, you may have more difficulty protecting your interests\nin the face of actions by our management, directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a U.S. jurisdiction which has developed a\nsubstantial body of case law. The following table outlines significant differences between the statutory provisions of the BCA and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware\nrelating to shareholders’ rights.\nMarshall Islands Delaware\nShareholder Meetings\nMay be held at a time and place as designated in the bylaws.

BACKGROUND\nToro Corp. (the “Company”) has adopted this Policy Regarding the Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation (this “Policy”) to provide for the\nrecovery or “clawback” of excess Incentive-Based Compensation earned by current or former Executive Officers of the Company in the event of a required Restatement (each, as defined\nunder the section entitled “VIII. Definitions” herein).\nThis Policy is intended to comply with the requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) Listing Rule 5608 (the “Listing Standard”). To the extent that any provision in\nthis Policy is ambiguous as to its compliance with the Listing Standard or to the extent any provision in this Policy must be modified to comply with the Listing Standard, such provision\nwill be read, or will be modified, as the case may be, in such a manner so that all applicable provisions under this Policy comply with the Listing Standard.\nII. STATEMENT OF POLICY\nThe Company shall recover reasonably promptly the amount of erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation in the event that the Company is required to prepare an\naccounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting\nrestatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the\nerror were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period (a “Restatement”).\nThe Company shall recover erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation in compliance with this Policy except to the extent provided under the section entitled “V.\nExceptions” herein.\nIII. SCOPE OF POLICY\nA. Persons Covered and Recovery Period. This Policy applies to all Incentive-Based Compensation received by an Executive Officer:\n• after beginning service as an Executive Officer,\n• who served as an Executive Officer at any time during the performance period for that Incentive-Based Compensation,\n• while the Company has a class of securities listed on Nasdaq, and\n• during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date that the Company is required to prepare a Restatement (the “Recovery Period”).\n-1-\nNotwithstanding this look-back requirement, the Company is only required to apply this Policy to Incentive-Based Compensation received on or after October 2, 2023.\nFor purposes of this Policy, Incentive-Based Compensation shall be deemed “received” in the Company’s fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting Measure (as defined herein)\nspecified in the Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of the Incentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of that period.\nB. Transition Period. In addition to the Recovery Period, this Policy applies to any transition period (that results from a change in the Company’s fiscal year) within or\nimmediately following the Recovery Period (a “Transition Period”), provided that a Transition Period between the last day of the Company’s previous fiscal year end and the first day of\nthe Company’s new fiscal year that comprises a period of nine to 12 months will be deemed a completed fiscal year.\nC. Determining Recovery Period. For purposes of determining the relevant Recovery Period, the date that the Company is required to prepare the Restatement is the earlier to\noccur of:\n• the date the board of directors of the Company (the “Board”), a committee of the Board, or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action\nis not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare a Restatement, and\n• the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare a Restatement.\nFor clarity, the Company’s obligation to recover erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation under this Policy is not dependent on if or when a Restatement is filed.\nIV. AMOUNT SUBJECT TO RECOVERY\nA. Recoverable Amount. The amount of Incentive-Based Compensation subject to this Policy is the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation received that exceeds the\namount of Incentive-Based Compensation that otherwise would have been received had it been determined based on the restated amounts, computed without regard to any taxes paid.\nB. Covered Compensation Based on Stock Price or TSR. For Incentive-Based Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return (“TSR”), where the amount of\nerroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in a Restatement, the recoverable amount shall be based\non a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Restatement on the stock price or TSR upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was received. In such event, the Company shall\nmaintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to Nasdaq.\n-2-\nV. EXCEPTIONS\nThe Company shall recover erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation in compliance with this Policy except to the extent that the conditions set out below are met and a\nmajority of the independent directors serving on the Board has made a determination that recovery would be impracticable:\nA. Direct Expense Exceeds Recoverable Amount. The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered;\nprovided, however, that before concluding it would be impracticable to recover any amount of erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation based on expense of enforcement,\nthe Company shall make a reasonable attempt to recover such erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation, document such reasonable attempt(s) to recover, and provide that\ndocumentation to Nasdaq.\nB. Violation of Home Country Law. Recovery would violate Marshall Islands law where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022; provided, however, that before\nconcluding it would be impracticable to recover any amount of erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation based on violation of Marshall Islands law, the Company shall\nobtain an opinion of Marshall Islands counsel, acceptable to Nasdaq, that recovery would result in such a violation, and shall provide such opinion to Nasdaq.\nC. Recovery from Certain Tax-Qualified Retirement Plans. Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available\nto employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder.\nVI. PROHIBITION AGAINST INDEMNIFICATION\nNotwithstanding the terms of any indemnification arrangement or insurance policy with any individual covered by this Policy, the Company shall not indemnify any Executive\nOfficer or former Executive Officer against the loss of erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation, including any payment or reimbursement for the cost of insurance obtained\nby any such covered individual to fund amounts recoverable under this Policy.\nVII. DISCLOSURE\nThe Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy and recoveries under this Policy in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Federal securities laws,\nincluding the disclosure required by the applicable Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings.\nVIII.DEFINITIONS\nUnless the context otherwise requires, the following definitions apply for purposes of this Policy:\n-3-\n“Executive Officer” means the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer (or if there is no such accounting officer, the controller), any\nvice-president of the Company in charge of a principal business unit, division, or function (such as sales, administration, or finance), any other officer who performs a policy-making\nfunction, or any other person who performs similar policymaking functions for the Company. Policy-making function is not intended to include policymaking functions that are not\nsignificant. Identification of an Executive Officer for purposes of this Policy would include at a minimum executive officers identified pursuant to 17 CFR 229.401(b).\n“Financial Reporting Measures” means any of the following: (i) measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the\nCompany’s financial statements, and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures, (ii) stock price and (iii) TSR. A Financial Reporting Measure need not be\npresented within the Company’s financial statements or included in a filing with the SEC.\n“Incentive-Based Compensation” means any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure.\nX. EFFECTIVENESS\nThis Policy shall be effective as of December 1, 2023. This Policy supersedes any previous policy of the Company concerning the recovery of excess Incentive-Based\nCompensation earned by current or former Executive Officers in the event of a required Restatement. Any right of recoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any\nother remedies or rights of recoupment that may be available to the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates under applicable law or pursuant to the terms of any similar policy or\nsimilar provision in any employment agreement, equity award agreement or similar agreement.\n-4-"

On September 29, 2022, we were renamed Toro Corp. On November 15, 2022 and December 30, 2022, the independent disinterested members\nof the board of directors of Castor, based on the recommendation of a special committee of independent disinterested directors (the “Special Committee”), approved the Spin Off in the\n“Castor Spin Off Resolutions” in order for each of us, holding Castor’s tanker segments, and Castor, holding its dry bulk segment, to operate and pursue opportunities as a separate\n“pure play” company in the relevant shipping sector, to be evaluated as such by the market and to enhance our and Castor’s financing and growth opportunities. The terms of the Spin\nOff were negotiated and approved by the Special Committee.\nIn connection with and as part of the Spin Off, on November 15, 2022 and December 30, 2022, the independent disinterested directors of Castor approved, based on the\nrecommendation of the Special Committee, in the Castor Spin Off Resolutions, among other things:\n• the contribution to us of the Toro Subsidiaries, being Castor’s eight tanker-owning subsidiaries (each owning one tanker vessel) and an additional subsidiary formerly owning\nthe M/T Wonder Arcturus (which was sold pursuant to a memorandum of agreement entered into on May 9, 2022 and delivered to its new owner on July 15, 2022);\n• in exchange for:\n○ all of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “common shares”);\n○ 140,000 shares of our 1.00% Series A Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Shares (the “Series A Preferred Shares”), with a cumulative preferred\ndistribution accruing initially at a rate of 1.00% per annum on the stated amount of $1,000 per share, all of which are retained by Castor after the Spin Off; and\n○ the issuance of 40,000 Series B Preferred Shares (the “Series B Preferred Shares”), each carrying 100,000 votes on all matters on which our shareholders are entitled to vote\nbut no economic rights, to Pelagos, a company controlled by our and Castor’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, against payment of their nominal value of $0.001 per\nSeries B Preferred Share.\nThe Series A Preferred Shares retained by Castor have an initial aggregate stated amount of $140,000,000, and, together with the common shares distributed in the Distribution,\nconstitute the consideration issued to Castor for the contribution of the Toro Subsidiaries to Toro. Accordingly, the Series A Preferred Shares are convertible, in whole or in part, at their\nholder’s option, to Common Shares from and after the third anniversary of their issue date (March 7, 2023) and prior to the seventh anniversary of such date at the lower of (i) 150% of\nthe volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) of our common shares over the five consecutive trading day period commencing on and including March 7, 2023 (the “Distribution Date”),\nand (ii) the VWAP of our common shares over the 10 consecutive trading day period expiring on the trading day immediately prior to the date of delivery of written notice of the\nconversion; provided, that, in no event shall the conversion price be less than $2.50. See “Item 10. Additional Information—B. Memorandum and Articles of Association” for additional\ninformation on our common and preferred stock, as well as our Shareholder Protection Rights Agreement.\nIn connection with the contribution of the Toro Subsidiaries to it, Toro replaced Castor as Guarantor under the $18.0 million term loan facility described in “Item 5. Operating and\nFinancial Review and Prospects—B. Liquidity and Capital Resources—Our Borrowing Activities.”\nOn the Distribution Date, Castor distributed all of our common shares outstanding to its holders of common stock of record at the close of business on February 22, 2023 (the\n“Record Date”). Shareholders of Castor received one of our common shares for every ten shares of Castor’s common stock owned at the Record Date.\nAs a part of the Spin Off, we entered into a master management agreement with Castor Ships S.A. (“Castor Ships”) with respect to our vessels in substantially the same form as\nCastor’s master management agreement for its vessels. The vessel management agreements with Castor Ships previously entered into for each of our vessels by the applicable vessel-\nowning Toro Subsidiary remain in effect for each such vessel.\nIn addition, as part of the Spin Off, we entered into various other agreements effecting the separation of our business from Castor. See “Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related\nParty Transactions—B. Related Party Transactions” for additional details.\nSince consummation of the Spin Off and the listing of our common shares on the Nasdaq Capital Market, we and Castor are separate publicly traded companies. We provide tanker\nshipping services and Castor provides dry bulk and containership shipping services. We and Castor have separate boards of directors, except that Castor’s current director, Chairman,\nChief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Petros Panagiotidis, also serves as our director, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\nIn connection with the Spin Off, on November 15, 2022 and December 30, 2022, our board of directors (the “Board”) resolved (in the “Toro Spin Off Resolutions” and, together with\nthe Castor Spin Off Resolutions, the “Spin Off Resolutions”), among other things (i) to focus our efforts on our current business of tanker shipping services, (ii) that we have no interest\nor expectancy to participate or pursue any opportunity in areas of business outside of the tanker shipping business and (iii) that Petros Panagiotidis, our director, Chairman, Chief\nExecutive Officer and controlling shareholder and his affiliates, such as Castor Ships, are not required to offer or inform us of any such opportunity. This does not preclude us, however,\nfrom pursuing opportunities outside of the tanker shipping business if in the future our Board determines to do so. In the Castor Spin Off Resolutions, Castor’s board similarly resolved,\namong other things (i) to focus Castor’s efforts on its current business of dry bulk shipping services, (ii) that Castor has no interest or expectancy to participate or pursue any\nopportunity in areas of business outside of the dry bulk shipping business and (iii) that Petros Panagiotidis, Castor’s director, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer\nand controlling shareholder and his affiliates are not required to offer or inform it of any such opportunity. This does not preclude Castor, however, from pursuing opportunities outside\nof the dry bulk shipping business if in the future Castor’s board determines to do so. See “Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—B. Related Party Transactions\n—The Spin Off Resolutions” for additional details.\nTable of Contents\nPART I\nITEM 1.

Other risks relate principally to the ownership of our common shares. The occurrence of any of the\nevents described in this section could significantly and negatively affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash available for dividends, as and if declared, or the\ntrading price of our common shares.\nSummary of Risk Factors\n• There has not been any public market for our common shares. Accordingly, the market price and trading volume of our common shares may be volatile.\n• Our share price may be highly volatile, and as a result, investors in our common shares could incur substantial losses.\n• Charter hire rates for tanker vessels are volatile. A decrease in charter rates may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\n• An oversupply of tanker vessel capacity may prolong or further depress low charter rates when they occur, which may limit our ability to operate our vessels profitably.\n• Global economic and financial conditions may negatively impact the tanker sector of the shipping industry, including the extension of credit.\n• Risks involved in operating ocean-going vessels could affect our business and reputation.\n1\nTable of Contents\n• The operation of tankers has unique operational risks associated with the transportation of oil.\n• The age of our fleet may impact our ability to obtain financing and a decline in the market values of our vessels could limit the amount of funds that we can borrow, cause us to\nbreach certain financial covenants in our current or future credit facilities and/or result in impairment charges or losses on sale.\n• Political instability, terrorist attacks, international hostilities and global public health threats, including major outbreaks of diseases, could adversely affect our business.\n• Compliance with safety and other vessel requirements imposed by classification societies may be costly and could reduce our net cash flows and negatively impact our results\nof operations.\n• We are subject to laws, regulations and standards (including environmental standards such as IMO 2020, standards regulating ballast water discharge, etc.), which could\nadversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In particular, climate change and greenhouse gas restrictions may adversely impact our\noperations and markets.\n• Increased inspection procedures and tighter import and export controls could increase costs and disrupt our business.\n• We may not be able to execute our growth strategy and we may not realize the benefits we expect from acquisitions or other strategic transactions.\n• We operate secondhand vessels with an age above the industry average which may lead to increased technical problems for our vessels and/or higher operating expenses or\naffect our ability to profitably charter our vessels and to comply with environmental standards and future maritime regulations and result in a more rapid depreciation in our\nvessels’ market and book values.\n• We are dependent upon Castor Ships, a related party, and other third-party sub-managers for the management of our fleet and business, and failure of such counterparties to\nmeet their obligations could cause us to suffer losses or could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.\n• Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who may be deemed to beneficially own, directly or indirectly, 100% of our Series B Preferred Shares, has control over us.\n• Our term loan facility contains, and we expect that any new or amended credit facility we enter into will contain, restrictive financial covenants that we may not be able to comply\nwith due to economic, financial or operational reasons and may limit our business and financing activities.\n• Our Board may never declare dividends.\n• Future issuances of common shares or other equity securities, including as a result of an optional conversion of the Series A Preferred Shares, or the potential of such\nissuances, may impact the price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise capital through equity offerings. Shareholders may experience significant dilution as\na result of any such issuances. Based on market conditions, we may opportunistically seek to issue equity securities shortly\n• We are incorporated in the Marshall Islands, which does not have a well-developed body of corporate and case law.\n• We have limited the fields in which we focus our operations and this may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\n2\nTable of Contents\nRisks Relating to Our Industry\nCharter hire rates for tanker vessels are volatile. A decrease in charter rates may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe tanker industry is both cyclical and volatile in terms of charter rates and profitability. Fluctuations in charter rates result from changes in the supply and demand for tanker\ncapacity and changes in the supply and demand for crude oil and refined petroleum products. Deterioration of charter rates resulting from various factors relating to the cyclicality and\nvolatility of our business may adversely affect our ability to profitably charter or re-charter our vessels or to sell our vessels on a profitable basis. This could negatively impact our\noperating results, liquidity and financial condition.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is likely that our tanker charter rates will continue to be exposed to volatility in the near to medium term. Such exposure could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFurthermore, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is disrupting energy production and trade patterns, including shipping in the Black Sea and elsewhere, and has impacted energy prices\nand tanker rates. Subsequent to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the market developed into two tiers, with operators willing to call on Russian ports receiving a premium in rates.\nHowever, as the number of jurisdictions prohibiting and/or targeting the import of Russian oil grows, tanker rates could begin to weaken. For example, if Russian crude oil is not available\nfor export, due to the extension of economic sanctions, boycotts or otherwise, it could eventually result in a reduction in the supply of crude oil and refined petroleum products cargoes\navailable for transportation and could negatively impact tanker charter rates over the longer term, despite these initial and ongoing increases. For further details, see “—The Company is\nexposed to fluctuating demand and supply for maritime transportation services, as well as fluctuating prices of crude oil and refined petroleum products, and may be affected by a\ndecrease in the demand for such products and the volatility in their prices.” and “—Our charterers calling on ports located in countries or territories that are the subject of sanctions\nor embargoes imposed by the U.S. government (including OFAC) or other authorities or failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) or similar laws\ncould lead to monetary fines or penalties and adversely affect our reputation. Such failures and other events could adversely affect the market for our common shares”.\nDemand for tanker capacity is affected by the supply of and demand for crude oil (for our Aframax/LR2 tanker segment) and supply and demand for refined petroleum products (for\nour Handysize tanker segment). A variety of factors may impact the supply of and demand for crude oil and/or refined petroleum products, including regional availability of refining\ncapacity and inventories and competition from alternative sources of energy. Factors that influence demand for tanker vessel capacity include, but are not limited to:\n• global and regional economic and political conditions and developments, including armed conflicts and terrorist activities, international trade sanctions, embargoes and strikes;\n• regional availability of refining capacity and inventories compared to geographies of oil production regions;\n3\nTable of Contents\n• developments in international trade, including national policies regarding strategic oil inventories (including the reduction or replenishment of strategic reserves and if strategic\nreserves are set at a lower level in the future as oil decreases in the energy mix), actions taken by OPEC and major oil producers and refiners and fluctuations in the profit\nmargins of crude oil and refined petroleum products;\n• the distance over which crude oil and/or refined petroleum products are to be moved by sea;\n• changes in seaborne and other transportation and distribution patterns, typically influenced by the relative advantage of the various sources of production, locations of\nconsumption, pricing differentials and seasonality;\n• epidemics and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\n• environmental and other regulatory developments;\n• alternative sources of energy, such as natural gas, coal, hydroelectric power and other alternative sources of energy;\n• natural catastrophes;\n• currency exchange and interest rates; and\n• the weather.\nFor a discussion of factors affecting the supply of tanker vessel capacity, see “—An oversupply of tanker vessel capacity may prolong or further depress low charter rates when\nthey occur, which may limit our ability to operate our vessels profitably.” These factors are outside of our control and are unpredictable, and accordingly we may not be able to\ncorrectly assess the nature, timing and degree of changes in charter rates. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating\nresults. In particular, a significant decrease in charter rates would cause asset values to decline. See “—The age of our fleet may impact our ability to obtain financing and a decline in\nthe market values of our vessels could limit the amount of funds that we can borrow, cause us to breach certain financial covenants in our current or future credit facilities and/or\nresult in impairment charges or losses on sale.”\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuating demand and supply for maritime transportation services, as well as fluctuating prices of crude oil and/or refined petroleum products and\nmay be affected by a decrease in the demand for such products and the volatility in their prices.\nOur growth significantly depends on continued growth in worldwide and regional demand for crude oil and/or refined petroleum products and the shipping of those cargoes, which\ncould be negatively affected by several factors, including declines in prices for such products or general political, regulatory and economic conditions.\nIn past years, China and India have had two of the world’s fastest growing economies in terms of gross domestic product and have been the main driving forces behind increases in\nshipping trade and the demand for marine transportation. While China in particular has enjoyed rates of economic growth significantly above the world average, slowing economic\ngrowth rates may reduce the country’s contribution to world trade growth. If economic growth declines in China, India and other countries in the Asia Pacific region, we may face\ndecreases in shipping trade and demand. The level of imports to and exports from China may also be adversely affected by changes in political, economic and social conditions\n(including a slowing of economic growth) or other relevant policies of the Chinese government, such as changes in laws, regulations or export and import restrictions, internal political\ninstability, changes in currency policies, changes in trade policies and territorial or trade disputes. Furthermore, a slowdown in the economies of the United States or the European\nUnion, or certain other Asian countries may also have adverse impacts on economic growth in the Asia Pacific region. Therefore, a negative change in the economic conditions\n(including any negative changes resulting from any pandemic) of any of these countries or elsewhere may reduce demand for tanker vessels and their associated charter rates, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results, as well as our prospects.\nThe price of oil was highly volatile during 2022. The price of Very Low Sulphur Fuel Oil (“VLSFO”) started off in Singapore at $675 per metric ton in January 2022 and peaked at\naround $1,100 per metric ton in July 2022. Thereafter, a downward trend prevailed and at the end of December 2022, the price of VLSFO closed at $620 per metric ton. As of February 9,\n2023 the price of VLFSO in Singapore is $656 per metric ton. Supply of oil has periodically tightened due to the imposition of sanctions against Russia, which is estimated to have\naccounted for approximately 9% of seaborne crude oil exports and 11% of refined petroleum exports in 2021. Escalating tensions in the region and fears of potential shortages in the\nsupply of Russian crude oil in light of boycotts and sanctions targeting Russian oil and refined petroleum products imposed by various jurisdictions have caused the price of crude oil\nto recently trade above $100 per barrel. For further details on these sanctions, see “—Our charterers calling on ports located in countries or territories that are the subject of sanctions\nor embargoes imposed by the U.S. government (including OFAC) or other authorities or failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) or similar laws\ncould lead to monetary fines or penalties and adversely affect our reputation. Such failures and other events could adversely affect the market for our common shares”. However,\ndemand for crude oil may be softening due to inflationary pressures and rising interest rates in various economies, as well as due to the lingering impacts of COVID-19 on certain\neconomies, such as China. A cap proposed by the Group of Seven nations and the European Union on the price of Russian oil have further undermined the upward trajectory of the price\nof oil. In light of these mixed economic pressures and growing fears of a global recession, the price of oil is generally expected to remain volatile.\n4\nTable of Contents\nCertain additional factors may influence the price of oil. For example, sustained periods of low oil prices typically result in reduced exploration and extraction because oil companies’\ncapital expenditure budgets are subject to cash flow from such activities and are therefore sensitive to changes in energy prices, a fact which could limit oil supply and lead to increases\nin crude oil and refined petroleum product prices. Consumer demand for crude oil and refined petroleum products, and as a result crude oil and refined petroleum product prices, could\nalso be affected by a shift towards other (renewable) energy resources such as wind energy, solar energy, nuclear energy, electricity or water energy. Changes in oil supply balance and\noil prices can have a material effect on demand for crude oil and refined petroleum product shipping services. In particular, changes to the trade patterns of crude oil and refined\npetroleum products may have a significant negative or positive impact on the ton mile, and therefore the demand for our tankers. Periods of low demand can cause excess vessel supply\nand intensify the competition in the industry, which often results in vessels being idle for long periods of time, which could reduce our revenues and materially harm the profitability of\nour business and/or segments, operating results and/or available cash. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic tempered demand for fuel crude oil and refined petroleum products during the\nfirst half of 2022. The global economy and demand for crude oil and refined petroleum products currently remains and is expected to continue to remain subject to substantial uncertainty\ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic and related containment efforts throughout the world and disruptions in oil supply due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and related sanctions against\nRussia and Belarus, which may have a material effect on demand for tanker shipping services, and, consequently, on our business, financial condition, cash flows and operating results.\nSee also “—Political instability, terrorist attacks, international hostilities and global public health threats can affect the seaborne transportation industry, which could adversely\naffect our business.”\nAn oversupply of tanker vessel capacity may prolong or further depress low charter rates when they occur, which may limit our ability to operate our vessels profitably.\nFactors that influence the supply of tanker vessel capacity include:\n• supply and demand for energy resources and crude oil and/or refined petroleum products\n• the number of newbuilding orders and deliveries;\n• the number of shipyards and ability of shipyards to deliver vessels;\n• port and canal congestion;\n• the number of conversions of tankers to other uses or conversions of other vessels to tankers;\n• scrapping of older vessels;\n• vessel freight rates, which are affected by factors that may affect the rate of newbuilding, scrapping and laying-up vessels (as set out below);\n• the availability of modern tanker capacity;\n• the speed of vessels being operated;\n• vessel casualties; and\n• the number of vessels that are out of service or laid up.\nIn addition to the prevailing and anticipated charter rates, factors that affect the rate of newbuilding, scrapping and laying-up include newbuilding prices, secondhand vessel values\nin relation to scrap prices, the availability of financing for new vessels and shipping activity, drydock and special survey expenditures, costs of bunkers and other operating costs, costs\nassociated with classification society surveys, normal maintenance costs, insurance coverage costs, the efficiency and age profile of the existing fleet in the market, and government and\nindustry regulations of maritime transportation practices, in particular environmental protection laws and regulations and laws and regulations regarding safety which impact our\nindustry.\nThe limited activity in the tanker newbuilding market during 2021 has continued during 2022, and, as result, the new contracting to active fleet ratio continues to remain at relatively\nlow levels. The worldwide tanker fleet grew by 1.7% during 2021 and by 3.4% during 2022. Growth until February 1, 2023 was 0.5%. The total orderbook of tanker vessels as of the same\ndate stood at 3.9% of the current fleet, with deliveries expected mainly during the next two years.\nVessel supply will continue to be affected by the delivery of new vessels and potential orders of more vessels than vessels removed from the global fleet, either through scrapping\nor accidental losses. An oversupply of vessel capacity could exacerbate decreases in charter rates or prolong the period during which low charter rates prevail which may have a material\nadverse effect on the profitability of our business and/or segments, cash flows, financial condition and operating results.\n5\nTable of Contents\nGlobal economic and financial conditions may negatively impact the tanker sector of the shipping industry, including the extension of credit.\nAs the shipping industry is highly dependent on economic growth and the availability of credit to finance and expand operations, it may be negatively affected by a decline in\neconomic activity or a deterioration of economic growth and financial conditions. This may have a number of adverse consequences for the tanker sector of the shipping industry in\nwhich we operate, including, among other things:\n• low charter rates, particularly for vessels employed on short-term time charters and in the spot voyage market or pools;\n• decreases in the market value of vessels and the limited second-hand market for the sale of vessels;\n• limited financing for vessels;\n• widespread loan covenant defaults; and\n• declaration of bankruptcy by certain vessel operators, vessel managers, vessel owners, shipyards and charterers.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, compliance with debt covenants, financial condition and operating\nresults.\nIncreases in bunker prices could affect our operating results and cash flows.\nFuel is a significant, if not the largest, expense in our shipping operations when vessels are under voyage charters and is an important factor in negotiating charter rates. Bunker\nprices have increased significantly during 2021 and have continued rising during 2022. Prices for VLSFO in Singapore started at around $415 per metric ton in January 2021 and reached\n$620 per metric ton by the end of December 2021, an increase of about 50%. During 2022, our bunker costs have further risen as a result of the eruption of the conflict in Ukraine. The\nprice of VLSFO has increased significantly as a result of the conflict in Ukraine and, indicatively, the price for VLSFO in Singapore reached $1,100 per metric ton in July 2022 but has since\ndecreased. As of February 9, 2023, the price of VLSFO in Singapore was approximately $656 per metric ton but uncertainty regarding its future direction remains. As a result, our bunker\ncosts for our vessels when off-hire, idling, or operating in the spot voyage charter market have increased substantially since 2021 and may continue to increase, which could have an\nadverse impact on our operating results and cash flows.\nRisks involved in operating ocean-going vessels could affect our business and reputation.\nThe operation of an ocean-going vessel carries inherent risks. These risks include the possibility of:\n• a marine disaster;\n• terrorism;\n• environmental and other accidents;\n• cargo and property losses and damage; and\n• business interruptions caused by mechanical failure, human error, war, terrorism, piracy, political action in various countries, labor strikes or adverse weather conditions.\n6\nTable of Contents\nEnvironmental laws often impose strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances, which could subject us to liability without regard to whether\nwe were negligent or at fault. A spill, either of bunker oil on our vessels or oil products cargo carried by our tankers, or an accidental release of other hazardous substances from our\nvessels, could result in significant liability, including fines, penalties and criminal liability and remediation costs for natural resource damages, as well as third-party damages.\nAny of these circumstances or events could increase our costs or lower our revenues. The involvement of our vessels in an oil spill or other environmental incident may harm our\nreputation as a safe and reliable operator, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition to the foregoing risks, the operation of tankers and transportation of oil presents unique operational risks. See “—The operation of tankers has unique operational\nrisks associated with the transportation of oil.”\nThe operation of tankers has unique operational risks associated with the transportation of oil.\nThe operation of tankers transporting crude oil and/or refined petroleum products is inherently risky and presents unique operational risks. For example, an oil spill may cause\nsignificant environmental damage. Additionally, compared to other types of vessels, tankers are exposed to a higher risk of damage and loss by fire, whether ignited by a terrorist attack,\ncollision, or other cause, due to the high flammability and hazardous characteristics of the crude oil and refined petroleum products transported in tankers. Our crews could also be\ninadvertently exposed to the crude oil and refined petroleum products that we transport or their byproducts, such as escaped gases, which may pose a risk to their health and safety. As\na result, the unique operational risks associated with the transportation of oil could result in significantly more expensive insurance coverage and the associated costs of an oil spill or\nother health and safety incidents could exceed the insurance coverage available to us. Any of the foregoing factors may adversely affect our tanker segments, our cash flows and\nsegment and overall operating results.\nThe operation of tankers is subject to strict regulations and vetting requirements, that our manager and sub-managers need to comply with. Should either we or our manager and\nthird-party sub-managers not continue to successfully clear the oil majors’ risk assessment processes, our tanker vessels’ employment, as well as our relationship with charterers,\ncould be adversely affected.\nShipping, and especially crude oil, refined product and chemical tankers have been, and will remain, heavily regulated. For an overview of government regulations that may impact\nour tanker operations, see “Item 4.B. Business Overview—Environmental and Other Regulations in the Shipping Industry.” The so called “oil major” companies, together with a\nnumber of commodities traders, represent a significant percentage of the production, trading and shipping logistics (terminals) of crude oil and refined petroleum products worldwide.\nConcerns for the environment have led the oil majors to develop and implement a strict ongoing due diligence process when selecting their commercial partners. This vetting process has\nevolved into a sophisticated and comprehensive risk assessment of both the vessel operator and the vessel, including physical ship inspections, completion of vessel inspection\nquestionnaires performed by accredited inspectors and the production of comprehensive risk assessment reports. In the case of term charter relationships, additional factors are\nconsidered when awarding such contracts, including:\n• office assessments and audits of the vessel operator;\n• the operator’s environmental, health and safety record;\n• compliance with the standards of the International Maritime Organization (the “IMO”), a United Nations agency that issues international trade standards for shipping;\n• compliance with heightened industry standards that have been set by several oil companies;\n• shipping industry relationships, reputation for customer service, technical and operating expertise;\n• compliance with oil majors’ codes of conduct, policies and guidelines, including transparency, anti-bribery and ethical conduct requirements and relationships with third parties;\n• shipping experience and quality of ship operations, including cost-effectiveness;\n• quality, experience and technical capability of crews;\n• the ability to finance vessels at competitive rates and overall financial stability;\n• relationships with shipyards and the ability to obtain suitable berths;\n• construction management experience, including the ability to procure on-time delivery of new vessels according to customer specifications;\n• willingness to accept operational risks pursuant to the charter, such as allowing termination of the charter for force majeure events; and\n• competitiveness of the bid in terms of overall price.\nShould either we or our manager and sub-managers not continue to successfully clear the oil majors’ risk assessment processes on an ongoing basis, our tanker vessels’ present\nand future employment, as well as our relationship with our existing charterers and our ability to obtain new charterers, whether medium or long-term, could be adversely affected. Such a\nsituation may lead to the oil majors’ terminating existing charters and refusing to use our tanker vessels which would adversely affect the growth of our business, cash flows and\noperating results.\n7\nTable of Contents\nWe are new entrants to the tanker shipping business and may face difficulties in establishing our business.\nOur tanker-owning subsidiaries which comprise our business entered the tanker shipping business in 2021. As new entrants to the tanker shipping business in both the\nAframax/LR2 and Handysize segments, we may struggle to establish market share and broaden our customer base for our tanker operations in these highly competitive markets due to\nour lesser-known reputation, while incurring operating costs associated with the operation and upkeep of our tankers. Competitors with greater resources could enter and operate larger\ntanker fleets through consolidations or acquisitions, and many larger fleets that compete with us in each of these sectors may be able to offer more competitive prices and fleets while\nalso achieving scale economies in their fleet operating costs. Further, we likely possess less operational expertise relative to more experienced competitors and may be more heavily\nreliant on the knowledge and services of third-party managers for our commercial success. As of the date of this annual report, our manager, Castor Ships, has subcontracted, with our\nconsent, the technical management for all of our tanker vessels to third-party ship-management companies. Failure to partner with third-party providers with the appropriate expertise to\neffectively deliver our services could tarnish our reputation as a tanker vessel operator and impact the growth of our business, our financial condition and operating profits.\nThe age of our fleet may impact our ability to obtain financing and a decline in the market values of our vessels could limit the amount of funds that we can borrow, cause us to\nbreach certain financial covenants in our current or future credit facilities and/or result in impairment charges or losses on sale.\nThe fair market values of tanker vessels have generally experienced high volatility. The fair market values of our vessels depend on a number of factors, including:\n• prevailing level of charter rates;\n• general economic and market conditions affecting the shipping industry;\n• the types, sizes and ages of the vessels, including as compared to other vessels in the market;\n• supply of and demand for vessels;\n• the availability and cost of other modes of transportation;\n• distressed asset sales, including newbuilding contract sales below acquisition costs due to lack of financing;\n• cost of newbuildings;\n• governmental or other regulations, including those that may limit the useful life of vessels; and\n• the need to upgrade vessels as a result of environmental, safety, regulatory or charterer requirements, technological advances in vessel design or equipment or otherwise.\nIf the fair market values of our vessels decline, we might not be in compliance with various covenants in our term loan facility or credit facilities we enter into in the future, which\nrequires and/or may require the maintenance of a certain percentage of the fair market values of the vessels securing the facility to the principal outstanding amount of the respective\nfacility. See “—Our term loan credit facility contains, and we expect that any new or amended credit facility we enter into will contain, restrictive covenants that we may not be able\nto comply with due to economic, financial or operational reasons and may limit our business and financing activities.”\nIn addition, the average age of our fleet is older than the industry average for Aframax/LR2 and Handysize vessels and we may therefore be viewed as providing insufficient or only\nshort-term collateral. This could restrict our access to or terms of any financing and, if the fair market values of our vessels decline, our access to additional funds may be affected and/or\nwe may need to record impairment charges in our financial statements or incur losses on the sale of vessels which can adversely affect our financial results. Further, if vessel values are\nelevated at a time when we wish to acquire additional vessels, the cost of such acquisitions may increase and this could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition\nand operating results.\n8\nTable of Contents\nActs of piracy or other attacks on ocean-going vessels could adversely affect our business.\nActs of piracy have historically affected ocean-going vessels trading in regions of the world such as the South China Sea, the Indian Ocean and, in particular, the Gulf of Aden off\nthe coast of Somalia and the Gulf of Guinea region off Nigeria, which experienced increased incidents of piracy in recent years. Sea piracy incidents continue to occur with tanker vessels\nparticularly vulnerable to such attacks. Political conflicts have also resulted in attacks on vessels, mining of waterways and other efforts to disrupt international shipping. An attack on\none of our vessels or merely the perception that our vessels are a potential piracy or terrorist target could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\noperating results.\nFurther, if these piracy attacks occur in regions in which our vessels are deployed that insurers characterize as “war risk” zones or by the Joint War Committee as “war and strikes”\nlisted areas, premiums payable for such coverage could increase significantly and such insurance coverage may be more difficult to obtain, if available at all. In addition, crew costs,\nincluding costs that may be incurred to the extent we employ onboard security guards, could increase in such circumstances. We may not be adequately insured to cover losses from\nthese incidents. This may result in loss of revenues, increased costs and decreased cash flows to our customers, which could impair their ability to make payments to us under our\ncharters, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, cash flows, financial condition and operating results.\nPolitical instability, terrorist attacks, international hostilities and global public health threats can affect the seaborne transportation industry, which could adversely affect our\nbusiness.\nWe conduct most of our operations outside of the United States and our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and ability to pay dividends, if any, in the\nfuture may be adversely affected by changing economic, political and government conditions in the countries and regions where our vessels are employed or registered. Moreover, we\noperate in a sector of the economy that is likely to be adversely impacted by the effects of political conflicts.\nCurrently, the world economy faces a number of challenges, including public health concerns stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, trade tensions between the United States and\nChina and between the United States and the European Union, continuing turmoil and hostilities in the Middle East, the Korean Peninsula, North Africa, Venezuela, Iran and other\ngeographic areas and countries, continuing economic weakness in the European Union, geopolitical events such as the withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union (“Brexit”), the\ncontinuing threat of terrorist attacks around the world and slowing growth in China.\nIn particular, the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine and a severe worsening of Russia’s relations with Western economies has created significant uncertainty in global\nmarkets, including increased volatility in the prices of crude oil and certain refined petroleum products and shifts in trading patterns for such products that may continue into the future.\nThese changes are due in part to the imposition of sanctions against Russia and Belarus during 2022, which have contributed to increased volatility in the price of crude oil and refined\npetroleum products. See “—Our charterers calling on ports located in countries or territories that are the subject of sanctions or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government\n(including OFAC) or other authorities or failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) or similar laws could lead to monetary fines or penalties and\nadversely affect our reputation. Such failures and other events could adversely affect the market for our common shares” and “—Worldwide inflationary pressures could negatively\nimpact our results of operations and cash flows.” The shipping industry may be negatively affected by resulting rising costs and changing patterns of supply and demand caused by\nany of the foregoing factors.\n9\nTable of Contents\nAdditionally, in Europe, large sovereign debts and fiscal deficits, low growth prospects and high unemployment rates in a number of countries have contributed to the rise of\nEurosceptic parties, which would like their countries to leave the European Union. Brexit has increased the risk of additional trade protectionism and has created supply chain\ndisruptions. Similar events in other jurisdictions, could impact global markets, including foreign exchange and securities markets. Any resulting changes in currency exchange rates,\ntariffs, treaties and other regulatory matters could in turn adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe threat of future terrorist attacks around the world also continues to cause uncertainty in the world’s financial markets and international commerce and may affect our business,\noperating results and financial condition. Continuing conflicts and recent developments in the Middle East, including continuing unrest in Syria and Iran and the overthrow of\nAfghanistan’s democratic government by the Taliban, may lead to additional acts of terrorism and armed conflict around the world. This may contribute to further economic instability in\nthe global financial markets and international commerce. Additionally, any escalations between the United States and Iran could result in retaliation from Iran that could potentially affect\nthe shipping industry, through increased attacks on vessels in the Strait of Hormuz (which already experienced an increased number of attacks on and seizures of vessels in recent years,\nincluding the seizure of two Greek-flagged vessels in 2022). Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse impact on our operating results, revenues and costs. See also\n“—Acts of piracy on ocean-going vessels could adversely affect our business.”\nAlso, China and the United States have implemented certain increasingly protective trade measures with continuing trade tensions, including significant tariff increases, between\nthese countries. These trade barriers to protect domestic industries against foreign imports, depress shipping demand. Protectionist developments, such as the imposition of trade tariffs\nor the perception they may occur, may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions, and may significantly reduce global trade. Moreover, increasing trade protectionism\nmay cause an increase in (a) the cost of goods exported from regions globally, (b) the length of time required to transport goods and (c) the risks associated with exporting goods. Such\nincreases may significantly affect the quantity of goods to be shipped, shipping time schedules, voyage costs and other associated costs, which could have an adverse impact on our\ncharterers’ business, operating results and financial condition and could thereby affect their ability to make timely charter hire payments to us and to renew and increase the number of\ntheir time charters with us. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition, public health threats such as influenza and other highly communicable diseases or viruses, outbreaks of which have from time to time occurred in various parts of the\nworld in which we operate, including China, Japan and South Korea, which may even become pandemics, could lead to a significant decrease in demand for the transportation of crude\noil and/or refined petroleum products. Such events have and may also in the future adversely impact our operations, including timely rotation of our crews, the timing of completion of\nany outstanding or future newbuilding projects or repair works in drydock as well as the operations of our customers. Delayed rotation of crew may adversely affect the mental and\nphysical health of our crew and the safe operation of our vessels as a consequence.\nA cyber-attack could materially disrupt our business and may result to a significant financial cost to us.\nWe rely on information technology systems and networks in our operations, our vessels and administration of our business. Information systems are vulnerable to security\nbreaches by computer hackers and cyber terrorists. We rely on industry-accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain confidential and proprietary information\nmaintained on our information systems. However, these measures and technology may not adequately prevent security breaches. Our business operations could be targeted by\nindividuals or groups seeking to sabotage or disrupt our information technology systems and networks, to steal data, or to ask for ransom. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,\ngovernmental actions have occasionally urged organizations across industries to have their employees to operate on a rotational basis remotely, which significantly increases the risk of\ncybersecurity attacks. A successful cyber-attack could materially disrupt our operations, including the safety of our operations, or lead to unauthorized release, alteration or\nunavailability of information in our systems. Any such attack or other breach of our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating\nresults. In addition, the unavailability of our information systems or the failure of these systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt our business and could result in\ndecreased performance and increased operating costs, causing our business and operating results to suffer.\nIn 2017, the IMO adopted Resolution MSC.428(98) on Maritime Cyber Risk Management, which encourages administration to ensure that cyber risks are appropriately addressed in\nSMS no later than the first annual verification of the Company’s Document of Compliance (DOC) after January 1, 2021. While we are currently in compliance with the requirements of\nResolution MSC.428(98), the cybersecurity measures we maintain may not be sufficient to prevent the occurrence of a cybersecurity attack and/or incident. Any inability to prevent\nsecurity breaches (including the inability of our third-party vendors, suppliers or counterparties to prevent security breaches) could also cause existing clients to lose confidence in our\nIT systems and could adversely affect our reputation, cause losses to us or our customers and/or damage our brand. This might require us to create additional procedures for managing\nthe risk of cybersecurity, which could require additional expenses and/or capital expenditures. The impact of such regulations is difficult to predict at this time.\n10\nTable of Contents\nAdditionally, recent sanctions and decisions by third parties to divest from or curtail doing business with Russian interests have created a heightened risk for cyber-attacks. See\n“—Our charterers calling on ports located in countries or territories that are the subject of sanctions or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government (including OFAC) or other\nauthorities or failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) or similar laws could lead to monetary fines or penalties and adversely affect our\nreputation. Such failures and other events could adversely affect the market for our common shares” for further information on these sanctions. Russia has taken and may continue to\ntake retaliatory actions and enact countermeasures, including cyber-attacks and espionage against other countries and companies in the world, which may negatively impact such\ncountries in which we operate and/or companies to whom we provide services or receive services from. Any such attacks, whether widespread or targeted, could create significant\ndisruptions in our business and adversely impact our financial condition, cash flows and operating results.\nMajor outbreaks of diseases (such as COVID-19) and governmental responses thereto, have affected our crews and operations, and could adversely affect our business and\nfinancial condition.\nSince the beginning of 2020, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic around the world has negatively affected economic conditions, the supply chain, the labor market and the\ndemand for certain shipping sectors both regionally and globally. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in numerous actions taken by governments and governmental agencies in an\nattempt to mitigate the spread of the virus, including travel bans, quarantines and other emergency public health measures, and a number of countries implemented lockdown measures.\nThese measures have resulted in a significant reduction in global economic activity and extreme volatility in the global financial markets. In the past, the pandemic has caused delays and\nuncertainties relating to the operation of our vessels and has affected our ability to timely rotate the crews of our vessels. It has also caused delays and uncertainties in the shipping\nindustry generally relating to newbuilding projects and operators’ ability to timely dry-dock their vessels.\nWe expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our operations and the operations of our customers and suppliers and increase our operating costs. The magnitude\nof COVID-19’s long-term impact on our financial and operating results, which has not been material to date but could be material in the future, will depend on the length of time that the\npandemic continues, the ability to effectively vaccinate a large percentage of the population and whether subsequent waves of the virus happen globally or in certain geographic\nregions. Uncertainties regarding the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to result in sustained market volatility, which could impact our business, financial condition\nand cash flows to a greater extent. Governments have been approving large stimulus packages to mitigate the effects of the sudden decline in economic activity caused by the pandemic;\nhowever, we cannot predict the extent to which these measures will continue or will be sufficient to restore or sustain the business and financial condition of companies in the shipping\nindustry.\nIt remains difficult to determine the full impact of COVID-19 on our business in the long run. Effects of the ongoing pandemic have included or may include, among others:\n• deterioration of economic conditions and activity and of demand for shipping;\n• operational disruptions to us or our customers due to worker health risks and the effects of new regulations, directives or practices implemented in response to the pandemic\n(such as travel restrictions for individuals, delays in replacing crews and vessels, and quarantining and physical distancing);\n• delays in the loading and discharging of cargo on or from our vessels, vessel inspections and related certifications by class societies, customers or government agencies and\nmaintenance, modifications or repairs to, or dry-docking of, our existing vessels due to worker health or other business disruptions;\n• reduced cash flow as a result of the above and worsened financial condition, including potential liquidity constraints;\n• potential non-performance by counterparties relying on force majeure clauses and potential deterioration in the financial condition and prospects of our customers or other\nbusiness partners;\n• credit tightening or declines in global financial markets, including to the prices of our publicly traded securities and the securities of our peers, could make it more difficult for us\nto access capital; and\n• potential disruptions, delays or cancellations in the construction of new vessels, which could reduce our future growth opportunities.\n11\nTable of Contents\nThe occurrence or continued occurrence of any of the foregoing events or other epidemics or an increase in the severity or duration of the COVID-19 pandemic could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and operating results.\nIn particular, we face significant risks to our onshore or offshore personnel and operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which have resulted in increased operational costs\nmainly associated with crew embarkation, rotation and related logistical complications, which have not been material to date but could be material in the future. Our crews generally work\non a rotation basis, relying largely on international air transport for crew changes plan fulfillment. Quarantine restrictions placed on persons and limitations on commercial aviation and\nother forms of public transportation have at times delayed our crew in embarking or disembarking on our ships and resulted in additional operating complexities. While such delays have\nnot functionally affected our ability to sufficiently crew our vessels, such disruptions have affected the cost of rotating our crew. Any of the foregoing factors could impact our ability to\nmaintain a full crew synthesis onboard all our vessels at any given time.\nIn 2021 and during the first quarter of 2022, most of the countries around the globe maintained their strict COVID-19 health protocols, including the periodic imposition of strict\nlockdowns. In certain jurisdictions, shipowners experienced significant disruptions to their normal vessel operations, in part due to additional time expended to deviate from shipping\nroutes to positioning vessels in countries in which crew changes could be undertaken in compliance with applicable measures against COVID-19. Since the beginning of the second\nquarter of 2022, many countries began to downgrade their health quarantine measures for fully vaccinated seafarers and also started to re-establish air carrier connections between\ninternational destinations. As a result, crew change operations have become less expensive than before and the need to deviate from vessels’ normal trajectories to dock in “open”\ncountries has been reduced.\nAlthough public health and quarantine conditions appear to have improved in the majority of countries globally, uncertainty remains regarding the emergence of additional strains\nof COVID-19 and whether governments and health authorities around the globe will be forced to implement the same or similar quarantine measures as utilized previously. The\nreimplementation of quarantine, lockdowns, or other measures in response to COVID-19 could significantly increase the expenses we incur for precautionary protective measures (such\nas hotel isolation, PCR tests, etc.), as well as the costs we incur due to operational disruptions. For example, we may experience renewed difficulty in rotating our crews and may incur\nincreased fuel costs based on an increase in vessel deviations, repositioning and/or delays. Any of the foregoing factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition and operating results.\nOur charterers calling on ports located in countries or territories that are the subject of sanctions or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government (including OFAC) or other\nauthorities or failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) or similar laws could lead to monetary fines or penalties and adversely affect our\nreputation. Such failures and other events could adversely affect the market for our common shares.\nCertain countries (including certain regions of Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Syria), entities and persons are targeted by economic sanctions and embargoes\nimposed by the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions, and a number of those countries have been identified as state sponsors of terrorism by the U.S. Department of\nState. In particular, sanctions recently imposed in relation to the Russian invasion of Ukraine have created significant disruptions in the global economy and in the shipping industry.\nDuring 2022, economic sanctions were imposed by the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and a number of other countries on Russian financial institutions,\nbusinesses and individuals, as well as certain regions within the Donbas region of Ukraine. Certain of these sanctions have targeted the Russian oil and petroleum industry and, in\nparticular, the transport of Russian crude oil and refined petroleum products by maritime vessels. Several jurisdictions, including the United States, the United Kingdom, European Union\nand Canada, have adopted import bans of Russian energy products, such as crude oil and refined petroleum products. The United Kingdom and European Union have also introduced\nexport restrictions, which capture the provision of maritime vessels and supplies to or for use in Russia. They have also imposed additional restrictions on providing financing, financial\nassistance, technical assistance and brokering or other services that would further the provision of vessels to or for use in Russia. For example, the United Kingdom has barred the\nprovision of ships or services, including shipping services, facilitating the maritime transport of Russian crude oil, with effect from December 5, 2022, and refined oil products, with effect\nfrom February 5, 2023. The Group of Seven nations and the European Union have also imposed a price cap of $60 per barrel on Russian crude oil with effect from December 5, 2022 and\nintroduced a separate price cap on refined petroleum products with effect from February 5, 2023. These restrictions may affect our current or future charters.\n12\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, certain jurisdictions, such as Greece and the United States, have temporarily detained vessels suspected of violating sanctions. Countries, such as Canada, the United\nKingdom and the EU, have also broadly prohibited Russian-affiliated vessels from entering their waters and/or ports. Furthermore, certain of the oil majors, such as ExxonMobil,\nTotalEnergies and BP, have announced a freeze on investments in the Russian market or their intention to exit the region.\nAs a result, these bans and related trade sanctions have started to change trade patterns for crude oil and refined petroleum products. Russia is the third largest oil producer and\nthe second largest exporter of crude oil, and it will be difficult to replace Russian crude oil export share from other countries. As a result of these bans and related trade sanctions, the\nprice of crude oil and refined petroleum products have increased, which is likely to affect adversely global oil demand and reduce worldwide oil transport. While global shipping rates of\noil have generally increased since the commencement of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, especially because of increased ton mile demand due to changing trading patterns and the\nbanning of Russian oil tankers by several countries, it is uncertain what the ultimate result will be on the Company’s business and financial position. However, due to their effect on the\nglobal market for crude oil and petroleum products, current or additional sanctions could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, cash flows, financial condition and\noperating results.\nEconomic sanctions and embargo laws and regulations vary in their application with regard to countries, entities or persons and the scope of activities they subject to sanctions.\nThese sanctions and embargo laws and regulations may be strengthened, relaxed or otherwise modified over time. Any violation of sanctions or embargoes could result in the Company\nincurring monetary fines, penalties or other sanctions. In addition, certain institutional investors may have investment policies or restrictions that prevent them from holding securities of\ncompanies that have contacts with countries or entities or persons within these countries that are identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. We are required to\ncomply with such policies in order to maintain access to charterers and capital.\nCurrent or future counterparties of ours may be affiliated with persons or entities that are or may be in the future the subject of sanctions imposed by the governments of the United\nStates, the European Union, and/or other international bodies. Further, it is possible that, in the future, our vessels may call on ports located in sanctioned jurisdictions on charterers’\ninstructions, without our consent and in violation of their charter party. Moreover, our charterers may violate applicable sanctions and embargo laws and regulations as a result of\nactions that do not involve us or our vessels. As a result, we may be required to terminate existing or future contracts to which we, or our subsidiaries, are party.\nWe operate in a number of countries throughout the world, including countries known to have a reputation for corruption. We are committed to doing business in accordance with\napplicable anti-corruption laws, and have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics. However, we are subject to the risk that we, or our affiliated entities, or our or our affiliated\nentities’ respective officers, directors, employees or agents’ actions may be deemed to be in violation of such anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA. Any such violation could result\nin substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions.\nIf the Company, our affiliated entities, or our or their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, or any of our charterers are deemed to have violated economic sanctions\nand embargo laws, or any applicable anti-corruption laws, our results of operations may be adversely affected due to the resultant monetary fines, penalties or other sanctions. In\naddition, we may suffer reputational harm as a result of any actual or alleged violations. This may affect our ability to access U.S. capital markets and conduct our business, and could\nresult in some investors deciding, or being required, to divest their interest, or not to invest, in us. The determination by these investors not to invest in, or to divest from, our common\nshares may adversely affect the price at which our common shares trade. Investor perception of the value of our common shares may also be adversely affected by the consequences of\nwar, the effects of terrorism, civil unrest and governmental actions in the countries or territories in which we operate. Any of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and operating results.\nFurthermore, detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior management and\nadversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition as a result.\n13\nTable of Contents\nCompliance with safety and other vessel requirements imposed by classification societies may be costly and could reduce our net cash flows and negatively impact our results of\noperations.\nThe hull and machinery of every commercial vessel must be certified as being “in class” by a classification society recognized by the administrative body responsible for regulating\nvessels in the jurisdiction in which the vessel is registered (or “flagged”). The classification society certifies that a vessel is safe and seaworthy in accordance with the applicable rules\nand regulations of the country of registry of the vessel and the Safety of Life at Sea Convention.\nA vessel must undergo annual surveys, intermediate surveys and special surveys. In lieu of a special survey, a vessel’s machinery may be placed on a continuous survey cycle,\nunder which the machinery would be surveyed periodically over a five-year period. We expect our vessels to be on special survey cycles for hull inspection and continuous survey\ncycles for machinery inspection. Most vessels are also required to be dry-docked, or inspected by divers, every two to three years for inspection of underwater parts.\nWhile the Company believes that it has adequately budgeted for compliance with all currently applicable safety and other vessel operating requirements, newly enacted regulations\napplicable to the Company and its vessels may result in significant and unanticipated future expense. If any vessel does not maintain its class or fails any annual, intermediate or special\nsurvey, the vessel will be unable to trade between ports and will be unemployable, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and\noperating results.\nWe are subject to international laws and regulations and standards (including, but not limited to, environmental standards such as IMO 2020 for the low sulfur fuels and the\nInternational Ballast Water Convention for discharging of ballast water), as well as to regional requirements, such as European Union and American laws and regulations for the\nprevention of water pollution, each of which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In particular, new short-, medium- and long-term\nmeasures developed by the IMO and European Union to promote decarbonization and the reduction of greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions may adversely impact our operations\nand markets.\nOur operations are subject to numerous international, national, state and local laws, regulations, treaties and conventions in force in international waters and the jurisdictions in\nwhich our vessels operate or are registered, which can significantly affect the ownership and operation of our vessels. See “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview\n—Environmental and Other Regulations in the Shipping Industry” for a discussion of certain of these laws, regulations and standards. Compliance with such laws, regulations and\nstandards, where applicable, may require installation of costly equipment or implementation of operational changes and may affect the resale value or useful lives of our vessels. These\ncosts could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition, and operating results. A failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in\nadministrative and civil penalties, criminal sanctions or the suspension or termination of our operations.\nEnvironmental laws often impose strict liability for emergency response and remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances, which could subject us to liability\nwithout regard to whether we were negligent or at fault. See “—Risks involved in operating ocean-going vessels could affect our business and reputation.” and “The operation of\ntankers has unique operational risks associated with the transportation of oil”.\nIn connection with IMO 2020 regulations and requirements relating to fuel sulfur levels, as of the date of this annual report, we have transitioned to burning IMO compliant fuels as\nseven of our eight vessels are not equipped with scrubbers ( also known as Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems). As a result, such seven vessels currently utilize VLSFO containing up to\n0.5% sulfur content, whereas the vessel equipped with scrubbers may utilize high fuel oil containing up to 3.5% sulfur content. Notably, low sulfur fuel is more expensive than standard\nhigh fuel oil and may become more expensive or difficult to obtain as a result of increased demand. The price of VLSFO has increased as a result of the conflict in Ukraine, and,\nindicatively, the price for VLSFO in Singapore has risen significantly to $1,100 per metric ton in July 2022. Thereafter, a downward trend prevailed and, at the end of December 2022, the\nprice of VLSFO closed at approximately $620 per metric ton. As of February 9, 2023, the price of VLSFO in Singapore was around $656 per metric ton, but uncertainty regarding its future\ndirection and the availability of VLSFO remains. For further information, see “—Increases in bunker prices could affect our operating results and cash flows”.\nThe IMO has also imposed updated guidelines for ballast water management systems specifying the maximum amount of viable organisms allowed to be discharged from a vessel’s\nballast water. Depending on the date of the International Oil Pollution Prevention (IOPP) renewal survey, existing vessels constructed before September 8, 2017 must comply with the\nupdated D-2 standard on or after September 8, 2019. For most vessels, compliance with the D-2 standard involves installing onboard systems to treat ballast water and eliminate\nunwanted organisms. Currently, two of our vessels will be required to comply with the regulation at our IOPP renewal surveys scheduled for 2024. The costs of compliance may be\nsubstantial and adversely affect our revenues and profitability. The six remaining vessels in our fleet are currently in compliance with this regulation.\n14\nTable of Contents\nDue to concern over climate change, a number of countries, the European Union and the IMO have adopted regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These\nregulatory measures may include, among others, adoption of cap-and-trade regimes, carbon taxes, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy.\nFurther, although the emissions of GHG from international shipping currently are not subject to the Paris Agreement or the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention\non Climate Change, which required adopting countries to implement national programs to reduce emissions of certain gases, a new treaty may be adopted in the future that includes\nrestrictions on shipping emissions.\nIn addition, in March 2022 the SEC announced proposed rules with respect to climate-related disclosures, including with respect to greenhouse gas emissions and certain climate-\nrelated financial statement metrics, which would apply to foreign private issuers listed on U.S. national securities exchanges such as Toro. Compliance with such reporting requirements\n(if they are adopted) or any similar requirements may impose substantial obligations and costs on the Company. If the Company is unable to accurately measure and disclose required\nclimate-related data in a timely manner, it could be subject to penalties or civil actions in certain jurisdictions.\nIn June 2021, IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (“MEPC”) adopted amendments to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships\n(MARPOL) Annex VI that will require ships to reduce their CO2 and GHG emissions. These new requirements combine technical and operational approaches to improve the energy\nefficiency of ships for future GHG reduction measures. Beginning January 1, 2023, each vessel is required to comply with the new Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (“EEXI”).\nFurthermore, from 2023 to 2026, each vessel must initiate the collection of data for the reporting of its annual operational Carbon Intensity Indicator (“CII”) and CII rating. The IMO is\nrequired to review the effectiveness of the implementation of the CII and EEXI requirements by January 1, 2026 at the latest. Prior to the implementation of the new regulations under\nrevised Annex VI of MARPOL, official calculations and estimations suggested that merchant ships built before 2013, including some of our older vessels, may not fully comply with the\nEEXI requirements. Therefore, to ensure compliance with EEXI requirements many owners/operators may choose to limit engine power rather than apply energy-saving devices and/or\neffect certain alterations on existing propeller designs, as the reduction of engine power is a less costly solution than these measures. As of the date of this annual report, official\ncalculations had determined that two of our eight tanker vessels were in compliance with the EEXI requirements as of January 1, 2023. Our remaining six tanker vessels limit their engine\npower in order to comply with EEXI requirements in subsequent inspections for air pollution.\nThe engine power limitation is predicted to lead to reduced ballast and laden speeds (at scantling draft,) in the non-compliant vessels which will affect their commercial utilization\nbut also decrease the global availability of vessel capacity. Furthermore, required software and hardware alterations as well as documentation and recordkeeping requirements will\nincrease a vessel’s capital and operating expenditures.\nOn November 13, 2021, the Glasgow Climate Pact was announced following discussions at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (“COP26”). The Glasgow Climate\nPact calls for signatory states to voluntarily phase out fossil fuels subsidies. A shift away from these products could potentially affect the demand for our vessels and negatively impact\nour future business, operating results, cash flows and financial position. COP26 also produced the Clydebank Declaration, in which 22 signatory states (including the United States and\nUnited Kingdom) announced their intention to voluntarily support the establishment of zero-emission shipping routes. Governmental and investor pressure to voluntarily participate in\nthese green shipping routes could cause us to incur significant additional expenses to “green” our vessels.\nDevelopments in safety and environmental requirements relating to the recycling and demolition of vessels may result in escalated and unexpected costs.\nThe 2009 Hong Kong International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships, or the Hong Kong Convention, aims to ensure ships, being recycled\nonce they reach the end of their operational lives, do not pose any unnecessary risks to the environment, human health and safety. On November 28, 2019, the Hong Kong Convention\nwas ratified by the required number of countries but as of March 7, 2023, was not yet in force as the ratifying states do not represent 40% of world merchant shipping by gross tonnage.\nUpon the Hong Kong Convention’s entry into force, each ship sent for recycling will have to carry an inventory of its hazardous materials. The hazardous materials, the use or\ninstallation of which are prohibited in certain circumstances, are listed in an appendix to the Hong Kong Convention. Ships will be required to have surveys to verify their inventory of\nhazardous materials initially, throughout their lives and prior to the ship being recycled. When implemented, the foregoing requirement may lead to cost escalation by shipyards, repair\nyards and recycling yards. This may then result in a decrease in the residual scrap value of a vessel, and a vessel could potentially not cover the cost to comply with the latest\nrequirements, which may have an adverse effect on our future performance, cash flows, financial position and operating results.\n15\nTable of Contents\nFurther, on November 20, 2013, the European Parliament and the Council of the EU adopted the Ship Recycling Regulation, which, among other things, requires any non-EU flagged\nvessels calling at a port or anchorage of an EU member state, including ours, to set up and maintain an Inventory of Hazardous Materials from December 31, 2020. Such a system\nincludes information on the hazardous materials with a quantity above the threshold values specified in relevant EU Resolution and are identified in the ship’s structure and equipment.\nThis inventory must be properly maintained and updated, especially after repairs, conversions or unscheduled maintenance on board the ship.\nThe smuggling of drugs or other contraband onto our vessels may lead to governmental claims against us.\nWe expect that our vessels will call in ports in areas where smugglers attempt to hide drugs and other contraband on vessels, with or without the knowledge of crew members. To\nthe extent our vessels are found with contraband, whether with or without the knowledge of any of our crew, we may face governmental or other regulatory claims which could have an\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe are subject to international safety standards and the failure to comply with these regulations may subject us to increased liability, may adversely affect our insurance coverage\nand may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports.\nThe operation of our vessels is affected by the requirements set forth in the International Safety Management Code, or the ISM Code, promulgated by the IMO under the SOLAS\nConvention. The ISM Code requires ship owners, ship managers and bareboat charterers to develop and maintain an extensive “Safety Management System” that includes the adoption\nof a safety and environmental protection policy setting forth instructions and procedures for the safe operation of vessels and describing procedures for dealing with emergencies. In\naddition, vessel classification societies impose significant safety and other requirements on our vessels. Failure to comply with these regulations may subject us to increased liability,\nmay adversely affect our insurance coverage and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition\nand operating results.\nMaritime claimants could arrest our vessels, which could interrupt our cash flow and business.\nCrew members, suppliers of goods and services to a vessel, shippers and receivers of cargo and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against a vessel for unsatisfied\ndebts, claims or damages. In many jurisdictions, a maritime lien holder may enforce its lien by “arresting” or “attaching” a vessel through judicial proceedings. The arrest or attachment\nof our vessels could have significant ramifications for the Company, including off-hire periods and/or potential cancellations of charters, high costs incurred in discharging the maritime\nlien, other expenses to the extent such arrest or attachment is not covered under our insurance coverage, breach of covenants in certain of our credit facility and reputational damage.\nThis in turn could negatively affect the market for our shares and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to service or refinance\nour debt. In addition, in jurisdictions where the “sister ship” theory of liability applies, such as South Africa, a claimant may arrest the vessel that is subject to the claimant’s maritime lien\nand any “associated” vessel, which is any vessel owned or controlled by the same owner. In countries with “sister ship” liability laws, claims might be asserted against us or any of our\nvessels for liabilities of other vessels that we then own, compounding the negative effects of an arrest or attachment on the Company.\nGovernments could requisition our vessels during a period of war or emergency resulting in a loss of earnings.\nThe government of a vessel’s registry could requisition for title or seize a vessel. Requisition for title occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and becomes the owner. A\ngovernment could also requisition a vessel for hire. Requisition for hire occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and effectively becomes the charterer at dictated charter\nrates. Generally, requisitions occur during a period of war or emergency. Government requisition of our vessels could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial\ncondition and operating results.\n16\nTable of Contents\nIncreased inspection procedures and tighter import and export controls could increase costs and disrupt our business.\nInternational shipping is subject to various security and customs inspection and related procedures in countries of origin and destination and trans-shipment points. Inspection\nprocedures may result in the seizure of the contents of our vessels, delays in the loading, offloading, trans-shipment or delivery and the levying of customs duties, fines or other\npenalties against us.\nIt is possible that changes to inspection procedures could impose additional financial and legal obligations on us. Changes to inspection procedures could also impose additional\ncosts and obligations on our customers and may, in certain cases, render the shipment of certain types of cargo uneconomical or impractical. Any such changes or developments may\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur business has inherent operational risks, which may not be adequately covered by insurance.\nOur vessels and their cargoes are at risk of being damaged or lost because of events such as marine disasters, adverse weather conditions, mechanical failures, human error,\nenvironmental accidents, war, terrorism, piracy and other circumstances or events. In addition, transporting cargoes across a wide variety of international jurisdictions creates a risk of\nbusiness interruptions due to political circumstances in foreign countries, hostilities, labor strikes and boycotts, the potential changes in tax rates or policies, and the potential for\ngovernment expropriation of our vessels. Any of these events may result in loss of revenues, increased costs and decreased cash flows to our customers, which could impair their ability\nto make payments to us under our charters.\nWe procure insurance for our vessels against those risks that we believe the shipping industry commonly insures against. This insurance includes marine hull and machinery\ninsurance, protection and indemnity insurance, which include environmental damage, pollution insurance coverage, crew insurance, and, in certain circumstances, war risk insurance.\nCurrently, the amount of coverage for liability for pollution, spillage and leakage available to us on commercially reasonable terms through protection and indemnity associations and\nproviders of excess coverage is $1 billion per occurrence. In certain instances, we may be required by our pooling agreements to arrange for additional loss of hire cover.\nDespite the above policies, we may not be insured in amounts sufficient to address all risks and we or our pool managers may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage for\nour vessels in the future or may not be able to obtain certain coverage at reasonable rates. For example, in the past more stringent environmental regulations have led to increased costs\nfor, and in the future may result in the lack of availability of, insurance against risks of environmental damage or pollution.\nFurther, insurers may not pay particular claims. Our insurance policies contain deductibles for which we will be responsible and limitations and exclusions which may increase our\ncosts or lower our revenues. Moreover, insurers may default on claims they are required to pay. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nRisks Relating To Our Company\nWe may be dependent on a small number of charterers for the majority of our business.\nA small number of charterers have accounted for a significant part of our revenues and we expect this trend to continue in our operations. Indicatively, for the period ended\nDecember 31, 2021, we derived 48% of our operating revenues from two charterers and in the year ended December 31, 2022, derived 42% of our operating revenues from three pool\nmanagers. Between September 30, 2022 and December 12, 2022, all of our subsidiaries owning Aframax/LR2 vessels entered into separate agreements with V8 Pool Inc. (“V8”), for the\nparticipation of the respective vessels in the V8 Plus Pool (the “V8 Plus Pool”). In February 2023, the agreement relating to the M/T Wonder Sirius’s participation in the V8 Plus Pool was\nterminated and the vessel commenced a period time charter. For further information, see “Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—B. Related Party Transactions—\nThe V8 Plus Pool”. Consequently, seven of the eight vessels in our fleet are now employed in pools. All the charters and pool arrangements for our fleet have fixed terms, but may be\nterminated earlier due to certain events, such as a charterers and/or pools managers’ failure to make charter payments to us because of financial inability, disagreements with us or\notherwise. The ability of each of our counterparties to perform their obligations under a charter and/or pool arrangement with us depends on a number of factors that are beyond our\ncontrol and may include, among other things, general economic conditions, the condition of the shipping industry, prevailing prices for crude oil and petroleum-related products and the\noverall financial condition of the counterparty. Should a counterparty fail to honor its obligations under an agreement with us, we may be unable to realize revenue under that charter or\npool arrangement and could sustain losses. In addition, if we lose an existing charterer and/or pool manager, it may be difficult for us to promptly replace the revenue we derived from\nthat counterparty. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and operating results. For further information, see Note 1 to\nour Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements included elsewhere in this annual report.\n17\nTable of Contents\nWe may not be able to execute our growth strategy and we may not realize the benefits we expect from acquisitions or other strategic transactions.\nAs our business grows, we intend to acquire additional tanker vessels, including to replace existing vessels and reduce the average age of our fleet and to expand our activities,\nsubject to the conditions set out in the Toro Spin Off Resolutions. See “—We have limited the fields in which we focus our operations and this may have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results”. The reduction of the average age of our fleet has implications for various operating costs, the perceived desirability of our vessels\nto charterers and the ability to attract financing for our business on favorable terms or at all. Our future growth will primarily depend upon a number of factors, some of which may not be\nwithin our control. These factors include our ability to:\n• identify suitable vessels, including newbuilding slots at reputable shipyards and/or shipping companies for acquisitions at attractive prices;\n• realize anticipated benefits, such as new customer relationships, cost savings or cash flow enhancements from acquisitions;\n• obtain required financing for our existing and new operations;\n• integrate any acquired vessels, assets or businesses successfully with our existing operations, including obtaining any approvals and qualifications necessary to operate\nvessels that we acquire;\n• ensure, either directly or through our manager and sub-managers, that an adequate supply of qualified personnel and crew are available to manage and operate our growing\nbusiness and fleet;\n• improve our operating, financial and accounting systems and controls; and\n• cope with competition from other companies, many of which have significantly greater financial resources than we do, and may reduce our acquisition opportunities or cause us\nto pay higher prices.\nOur failure to effectively identify, acquire, develop and integrate any vessels could adversely affect our business, financial condition, investor sentiment and operating results.\nFinally, acquisitions may require additional equity issuances, which may dilute our common shareholders if issued at lower prices than the price they acquired their shares, or debt\nissuances (with amortization payments), both of which could lower our available cash. See “—Future issuances of additional shares, including as a result of an optional conversion of\nSeries A Preferred Shares, or the potential for such issuances, may impact the price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise capital through equity offerings.\nShareholders may experience significant dilution as a result of any such issuances.” If any such events occur, our financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe operate secondhand vessels with an age above the industry average which may lead to increased technical problems for our vessels and/or higher operating expenses or affect\nour ability to profitably charter our vessels, to comply with environmental standards and future maritime regulations and to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all and\nresult in a more rapid deterioration in our vessels’ market and book values.\nOur current fleet consists only of secondhand vessels. While we have inspected our vessels and we intend to inspect any potential future vessel acquisition, this does not provide\nus with the same knowledge about its condition that we would have had if the vessel had been built for and operated exclusively by us. Generally, purchasers of secondhand vessels do\nnot receive the benefit of warranties that purchasers of newbuilding vessels receive from the builders and the makers of the vessels that they acquire.\nThe average age of our current fleet is 17.8 years, compared to a tanker shipping industry average of 12.2 years. In general, the cost of maintaining a vessel in good operating\ncondition and operating it increases with the age of the vessel, because, amongst other things:\n• as our vessels age, typically, they become less fuel-efficient and more costly to maintain than more recently constructed vessels due to improvements in design, engineering\nand technology and due to increased maintenance requirements;\n18\nTable of Contents\n• cargo insurance rates increase with the age of a vessel, making our vessels more expensive to operate;\n• governmental regulations, environmental and safety or other equipment standards related to the age of vessels may also require expenditures for alterations or the addition of\nnew equipment to our vessels and may restrict the type of activities in which our vessels may engage.\nCharterers also have age restrictions on the vessels they charter and in the past, have actively discriminated against chartering older vessels, which may result in lower utilization of\nour vessels and, in turn, in lower revenues. Our charterers have a high and increasing focus on quality and compliance standards with their suppliers across the entire supply chain,\nincluding the shipping and transportation segment. Our continued compliance with these standards and quality requirements is vital for our operations. The charter hire rates and the\nvalue and operational life of a vessel are determined by a number of factors, including the vessel’s efficiency, operational flexibility and physical life. Efficiency includes speed, fuel\neconomy and the ability to load and discharge cargo quickly. Flexibility includes the ability to enter harbors, operate in extreme climates, utilize related docking facilities and pass-through\ncanals and straits. The length of a vessel’s physical life is related to its original design and construction, its maintenance and the impact of the stress of operations.\nDue to the age of our fleet, we may not be able to obtain external financing at all or at reasonable terms as our vessels may be seen as less valuable collateral. For further information\non the factors which could affect our ability to obtain financing, including the age of our fleet, see “—The age of our fleet may impact our ability to obtain financing and a decline in\nthe market values of our vessels could limit the amount of funds that we can borrow, cause us to breach certain financial covenants in our current or future credit facilities and/or\nresult in impairment charges or losses on sale”.\nWe face competition from companies with more modern vessels with more fuel-efficient designs than our vessels (“eco–vessels”). If new tankers are built that are more efficient or\nmore flexible or have longer physical lives than even the current eco-vessels, competition from the current eco-vessels and any more technologically advanced vessels could adversely\naffect the amount of charter hire payments we receive for our vessels once their charters expire and the resale value of our vessels could significantly decrease.\nWe cannot assure you that, as our vessels age, market conditions will justify expenditures to maintain or update our vessels or enable us to operate our vessels profitably during\nthe remainder of their useful lives or that we will be able to finance the acquisition of new vessels at the time that we retire or sell our aging vessels. This could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are reliant on spot-market oriented pools and spot voyage charters for a significant portion of our revenue, thereby exposing us to risk of losses based on short-term volatility in\nshipping rates.\nWe expect to employ in large part our vessels in the spot market, either in the voyage charter market or in spot-market oriented pools. Currently, all vessels in our fleet are employed\nin pools. The spot charter market is highly competitive and freight rates in this market have been volatile, fluctuating significantly based upon supply of and demand for vessels and\ncrude oil and/or refined petroleum products. Conversely, longer-term charter contracts have pre-determined rates over more extended periods of time providing, a fixed source of revenue\nto us. The successful operation of our vessels in the competitive spot charter market depends upon, among other things, our commercial and pool operators obtaining profitable spot\ncharters and minimizing, to the extent possible, time spent waiting for charters and time spent traveling unladen to pick up cargo. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in\nkeeping our vessels fully employed in these short-term markets, or that future spot revenues will be sufficient to enable such vessels to operate profitably.\nIn the past, there have been periods when revenues derived in the spot market have declined below the operating cost of vessels. If spot charter rates decline, then we may be\nunable to operate our vessels trading in the spot market profitably and/or meet our obligations, including payments on indebtedness. Furthermore, as charter rates for spot charters are\nfixed for a single voyage which may last up to several weeks, during periods in which spot charter rates are rising, we will generally experience delays in realizing the benefits from such\nincreases. A significant decrease in spot revenues or our inability to fully employ our vessels by taking advantage of the spot market would therefore adversely affect operating results,\nincluding our profitability and cash flows, with the result that our ability to serve our working capital and debt service needs could be impaired.\n19\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to certain risks with respect to our counterparties on contracts, and failure of such counterparties to meet their obligations could cause us to suffer losses or\nnegatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have entered into, and may enter into in the future, various contracts, including charter agreements, pool agreements, management agreements, shipbuilding contracts and\ncredit facilities. Such agreements subject us to counterparty risks. The ability of each of our counterparties to perform its obligations under a contract with us will depend on a number of\nfactors that are beyond our control and may include, among other things, general economic conditions, the condition of the maritime and offshore industries, the overall financial\ncondition of the counterparty, charter rates received for specific types of vessels, and various expenses. For example, the combination of a reduction of cash flow resulting from a decline\nin world trade and the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction in the ability of our charterers and/or pool operators to make payments to us. In\naddition, in depressed market conditions, our charterers and customers may no longer need a vessel that is then under charter or contract or may be able to obtain a comparable vessel at\nlower rates and our pool operators may not be able to profitably employ our participating vessels. As a result, charterers and customers may seek to renegotiate the terms of their\nexisting charter agreements or avoid their obligations under those contracts and pool operators may terminate the pool agreements or admit inability to comply with their obligations\nunder those agreements. This may have a significant impact on our revenues due to our concentrated customer base. For further details, see “—We may be dependent on a small number\nof charterers for the majority of our business”. We may also face these counterparty risks due to assignments. For example, the V8 Plus Pool agreement permits V8 to freely assign its\nrights under the agreement and/or sub-charter to a third-party for the purpose of capital financing. For further information, see “Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party\nTransactions—B. Related Party Transactions—The V8 Plus Pool.” Should a counterparty fail to honor its obligations under agreements with us, we could sustain significant losses\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe are dependent upon Castor Ships, a related party, and other third-party sub-managers for the management of our fleet and business and failure of such counterparties to meet\ntheir obligations could cause us to suffer losses or could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nThe management of our business, including, but not limited to, the commercial and technical management of our fleet as well as administrative, financial and other business\nfunctions, is carried out by Castor Ships, which is a company controlled by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Petros Panagiotidis. We are reliant on Castor Ships’ continued and\nsatisfactory provision of its services.\nAs of the date of this annual report, Castor Ships has subcontracted, with our consent, the technical management for all our eight vessels to third-party ship-management\ncompanies at its own expense. Our subcontracting arrangements with third-parties may expose us to risks such as low customer satisfaction with the service provided by these\nsubcontractors, increased operating costs compared to those we would achieve for our vessels, and an inability to maintain our vessels according to our standards or our current or\npotential customers’ standards.\nOur ability to enter into new charters and expand our customer relationships depends largely on our ability to leverage our relationship with our manager and its subcontractors and\ntheir reputations and relationships in the shipping industry. If any of these counterparties suffer material damage to their reputations or relationships, it may also harm our ability to\nrenew existing charters upon their expiration, obtain new charters or maintain satisfactory relationships with suppliers and other third parties. In addition, the inability of our manager to\nfix our vessels at competitive charter rates either due to prevailing market conditions at the time or due to its inability to provide the requisite quality of service, could adversely affect\nour revenues and profitability and we may have difficulty meeting our working capital and debt obligations.\nOur operational success and ability to execute our growth strategy will depend significantly upon the satisfactory and continued performance of these services by our manager\nand/or sub-managers, as well as their reputations. Any of the foregoing factors could have an adverse effect on our and their reputations and on our business, financial condition and\noperating results. Although we may have rights against our manager and/or sub-managers if they default on their obligations to us, our shareholders will share that recourse only\nindirectly to the extent that we recover funds.\n20\nTable of Contents\nOur term loan facility contains, and we expect that any new or amended credit facility we enter into will contain, restrictive covenants that we may not be able to comply with due\nto economic, financial or operational reasons and may limit our business and financing activities.\nThe operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our current $18.0 million term loan facility, and any new or amended credit facility we may enter into in the future, could\nadversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage, expand or pursue our business activities.\nFor example, our $18.0 million term loan facility requires the consent of our lenders to, among other things:\n• incur or guarantee additional indebtedness outside of our ordinary course of business;\n• charge, pledge or encumber our vessels;\n• change the flag, class, management or ownership of our vessels;\n• change the commercial and technical management of our vessels;\n• declare or pay any dividends or other distributions at a time when the Company has an event of default or the payment of such distribution would cause an event of default;\n• form or acquire any subsidiaries;\n• make any investments in any person, asset, firm, corporation, joint venture or other entity;\n• merge or consolidate with any other person;\n• change the ownership, beneficial ownership, control or management of the subsidiaries party to the facility and/or us as Guarantor, or of any of the secured vessels, if the effect\nof such change would be to materially change the ultimate legal and beneficial ownership in effect at the time the facility was executed; and\n• to enter into any demise charter contract or let our vessels under any pooling agreement whereby all of the vessel’s earnings are pooled or shared with any other person.\nOur $18.0 million term loan facility also requires us to comply with certain financial covenants, in each case subject to certain exceptions, including:\n(i) maintaining a certain minimum level of cash and cash equivalents, including a minimum level of cash for each vessel that is pledged in favor of the lender;\n(ii) maintaining a leverage ratio (calculated as the ratio of total bank debt less cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, divided by the aggregate market value of all fleet\nvessels) below a specified maximum; and\n(iii) maintaining a minimum net worth amount (calculated as the difference between the aggregate value of the fleet vessels adjusted for market values, and total bank debt).\nOur ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our current and/or future credit facilities may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing\neconomic, financial and industry conditions, interest rate developments, changes in the funding costs of our banks and changes in vessel earnings and asset valuations. If market or\nother economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. We may be obligated to prepay part of our outstanding debt in order to remain in\ncompliance with the relevant covenants in our current or future credit facilities. If we are in breach of any of the restrictions, covenants, ratios or tests in our current or future credit\nfacilities, or if we trigger a cross-default contained in our current or future credit facilities, a significant portion of our obligations may become immediately due and payable. We may not\nhave, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments. In addition, obligations under our current and/or future credit facilities are and are expected to be secured\nby our vessels, and if we are unable to repay debt under our current or future credit facilities, the lenders could seek to foreclose on those assets. Any of these factors could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFurthermore, any contemplated expenditures for vessel acquisitions will have to be at levels that do not breach the covenants of our loan facilities. If the estimated asset values of\nthe vessels in our fleet decrease, such decreases may limit the amounts we can draw down under our future credit facilities to purchase additional vessels, limit our ability to raise equity\ncapital and our ability to expand our fleet. If funds under our current or future credit facilities become unavailable or we need to repay them as a result of a breach of our covenants or\notherwise, we may not be able to perform our business strategy which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\n21\nTable of Contents\nOur outstanding debt is exposed to Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) Risk. If volatility in SOFR occurs, the interest on our indebtedness could be higher than\nprevailing market interest rates and our profitability, earnings and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to the risk of interest rate variations, principally in relation to SOFR, a secured rate published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Effective upon completion\nof the Spin Off, our $18.0 million term loan facility described in “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—B. Liquidity and Capital Resources—Our Borrowing\nActivities” bears interest at an annual rate of 3.20% over SOFR.\nThe use of SOFR-based rates is intended to replace rates based on the London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”) following the cessation of the publication of LIBOR rates\npreviously announced by regulators in the United Kingdom and the discontinuation of the use of LIBOR in the financial markets. Because SOFR is a secured rate backed by government\nsecurities (and therefore does not take into account bank credit risk), it may be lower than other reference rates, such as LIBOR. However, SOFR may rise following interest rate increases\neffected by the United States Federal Reserve (the “U.S. Federal Reserve”) and the U.S. Federal Reserve has recently raised U.S. interest rates in response to rising inflation. Further, as a\nsecured rate backed by government securities, SOFR may be less likely to correlate with the funding costs of financial institutions. As a result, parties may seek to adjust spreads relative\nto SOFR in underlying contractual arrangements. Therefore, the use of SOFR-based rates may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher or lower than the rates and\npayments that we experienced under our credit facility prior to our separation from Castor, where interest was based on LIBOR.\nThe $18.0 million term loan facility provides that interest may be based on SOFR and for the use of an alternate rate to SOFR in the event SOFR is phased-out. Further, our lender\nhas insisted on provisions that entitle it, following consultation with the borrowers and in the absence of agreement, in its discretion, and under certain market disruption events, to\nreplace SOFR as the base for the interest calculation with another benchmark or with its cost-of-funds rate. As a result, our lending costs under our credit facility could increase\nsignificantly.\nSOFR or any other replacement rate may be volatile, as alternative reference rates such as LIBOR having historically exhibited volatility. For example, the spread between LIBOR and\nthe prime lending rate widened significantly at times due to disruptions in the international credit markets. SOFR or any other replacement rate may behave similarly. Because the interest\nrate borne by our $18.0 million term loan facility fluctuates with changes in SOFR, if this volatility were to occur, it would affect the amount of interest payable on our debt.\nIn order to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations, we may from time to time use interest rate derivatives to effectively fix some of our floating rate debt obligations. We\ncurrently do not have any derivative instruments in place. SOFR is currently at a relatively low level but has recently shown signs of recovery and may rise further in the future as the\ncurrent low interest rate environment comes to an end. Our financial condition could be materially adversely affected at any time that we have not entered into interest rate hedging\narrangements to hedge our exposure to the interest rates applicable to our credit facility and any other financing arrangements we may enter into in the future. Conversely, the use of\nderivative instruments, if any, may not effectively protect us from adverse interest rate movements. The use of interest rate derivatives may result in substantial losses and may affect our\nresults through mark-to-market valuation of these derivatives. Also, adverse movements in interest rate derivatives may require us to post cash as collateral, which may impact our free\ncash position. Entering into swaps and derivatives transactions is inherently risky and presents various possibilities for incurring significant expenses.\nAny of the foregoing factors, including any combination of them, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flow and operating results.\nWe may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on acceptable terms, which may negatively impact our planned growth. In particular, we may rely on financial support from\nour Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Petros Panagiotidis, but cannot guarantee the availability of such funding.\nAs a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets generally and the solvency of counterparties, among other factors, the ability to obtain money from the credit markets\nhas become more difficult as many lenders have increased interest rates, enacted tighter lending standards, refused to refinance existing debt at all or on terms similar to current debt and\nreduced, and, in some cases, ceased to provide funding to borrowers. Due to these factors, we cannot be certain that financing or refinancing will be available if needed and to the extent\nrequired, on acceptable terms. The age of our fleet may also impact our ability to obtain new financing on favorable terms or at all and may hinder our plans to reduce the average age of\nour fleet through vessel acquisitions and/or replacements. See “—The age of our fleet may impact our ability to obtain financing and a decline in the market values of our vessels\ncould limit the amount of funds that we can borrow, cause us to breach certain financial covenants in our current or future credit facilities and/or result in impairment charges or\nlosses on sale”. If financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to enhance our existing business, complete additional vessel\nacquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities as they arise.\nOur Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Petros Panagiotidis, may provide loans to us. However, we cannot guarantee that such loans will be available to the Company or that they\nwill be available to on favorable terms. Even if we are able to borrow money from Mr. Panagiotidis, such borrowing could create a conflict of interest of management. See also “—Our\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, who may be deemed to own, directly or indirectly, 100% of our Series B Preferred Shares, has control over us.” Any of these factors could have\na material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\n22\nTable of Contents\nWe are a holding company, and we depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute funds to us to satisfy our financial and other obligations.\nWe are a holding company and have no significant assets other than the equity interests in our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries own all of our existing vessels, and subsidiaries we\nform or acquire will own any other vessels we may acquire in the future. All payments under our charters and/or pool arrangements are made to our subsidiaries. As a result, our ability\nto meet our financial and other obligations, and to pay dividends in the future, as and if declared, will depend on the performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to distribute funds\nto us. The ability of a subsidiary to make these distributions could be affected by a claim or other action by a third party, including a creditor, by the terms of our financing arrangements,\nor by the applicable law regulating the payment of dividends in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries are organized.\nIn particular, the applicable loan agreement entered into by certain of our subsidiaries prohibit such subsidiaries from paying any dividends to us if we or such subsidiary breach a\ncovenant in a loan agreement or any financing agreement we may enter into. See “—Our term loan facility contains, and we expect that any new or amended credit facility we enter\ninto will contain, restrictive covenants that we may not be able to comply with due to economic, financial or operational reasons and may limit our business and financing\nactivities.” If we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries, we will not be able to meet our liquidity needs unless we obtain funds from other sources, which we may not be able to\ndo.\nOur Board may never declare dividends.\nThe declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will always be subject to the discretion of our Board, restrictions contained in our current or future debt agreements and the\nrequirements of Marshall Islands law. If the Board determines to declare dividends, the timing and amount of any dividends declared will depend on, among other things, our earnings,\nfinancial condition and cash requirements and availability, our ability to obtain debt and equity financing on acceptable terms as contemplated by our growth strategy, our compliance\nwith the terms of our outstanding indebtedness and the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute funds to us. The tanker shipping industry is highly volatile, and we cannot predict with\ncertainty the amount of cash, if any, that will be available for distribution as dividends in any period. Also, there may be a high degree of variability from period to period in the amount of\ncash that is available for the payment of dividends.\nWe may incur expenses or liabilities or be subject to other circumstances in the future that reduce or eliminate the amount of cash that we have available for distribution as\ndividends, including as a result of the risks described herein. Our growth strategy contemplates that we will finance our acquisitions of additional vessels using cash from operations,\nthrough debt financings and/or from the net proceeds of future equity issuances on terms acceptable to us. If financing is not available to us on acceptable terms or at all, our Board may\ndetermine to finance or refinance acquisitions with cash from operations, which would reduce the amount of any cash available for the payment of dividends, if any.\nThe Republic of Marshall Islands laws generally prohibit the payment of dividends other than from surplus (retained earnings and the excess of consideration received for the sale\nof shares above the par value of the shares) or while a company is insolvent or would be rendered insolvent by the payment of such a dividend. We may not have sufficient surplus in\nthe future to pay dividends and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient funds or surplus to make distributions to us. We currently pay no cash dividends and we may never pay\ndividends.\n23\nTable of Contents\nWorldwide inflationary pressures could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nIt has been recently observed that worldwide economies have experienced inflationary pressures, with price increases seen across many sectors globally. For example, the U.S.\nconsumer price index, an inflation gauge that measures costs across dozens of items, rose 7% in December 2021 compared to the prior year, the fastest pace since June 1982, and further\nrose 6.5% in December 2022 compared to the prior year, driven in large part by increases in energy costs. It remains to be seen whether inflationary pressures will continue, and to what\ndegree, as central banks begin to respond to price increases. In the event that inflation becomes a significant factor in the global economy generally and in the shipping industry more\nspecifically, inflationary pressures would result in increased operating, voyage and administrative costs. Furthermore, the effects of inflation on the supply and demand of the products\nwe transport could alter demand for our services. Interventions in the economy by central banks in response to inflationary pressures may slow down economic activity, including by\naltering consumer purchasing habits and reducing demand for the crude oil and/or refined petroleum products we carry, and cause a reduction in trade. As a result, the volumes of goods\nwe deliver and/or charter rates for our vessels may be affected. Any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and operating results.\nFor additional information, see “—The Company is exposed to fluctuating demand and supply for maritime transportation services, as well as fluctuating prices of oil and petroleum\nproducts, and may be affected by a decrease in the demand for such products and the volatility in their prices”.\nIncreasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, lenders and other market participants with respect to our Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) policies\nmay impose additional costs on us or expose us to additional risks.\nCompanies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny relating to their ESG practices and policies. Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment\nfunds, lenders and other market participants are increasingly focused on ESG practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the implications and social cost of their\ninvestments. The increased focus and activism related to ESG and similar matters may hinder access to capital, as investors and lenders may decide to reallocate capital or to not commit\ncapital as a result of their assessment of a company’s ESG practices. Companies which do not adapt to or comply with investor, lender or other industry shareholder expectations and\nstandards, which are evolving, or which are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to\ndo so, may suffer from reputational damage and the business, financial condition, and/or stock price of such a company could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may face increasing pressures from investors, lenders and other market participants, who are increasingly focused on climate change, to prioritize sustainable energy practices,\nreduce our carbon footprint and promote sustainability. As a result, we may be required to implement more stringent ESG procedures or standards so that our existing and future\ninvestors and lenders remain invested in us and make further investments in us, especially given the highly focused and specific trade and transport of crude oil and refined petroleum\nproducts in which we are engaged. If we do not meet these standards, our business and/or our ability to access capital could be harmed.\nThese limitations in both the debt and equity capital markets may affect our ability to grow as our plans for growth may include accessing the equity and debt capital markets. If\nthose markets are unavailable, or if we are unable to access alternative means of financing on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be unable to implement our business strategy, which\ncould impair our ability to service our indebtedness. Further, it is likely that we will incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, comply with and implement\nwide-ranging ESG requirements. Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\n24\nTable of Contents\nWe are a new company, and our anti-fraud and corporate governance procedures might not be as advanced as those implemented by our listed peer competitors having a longer\npresence in the shipping industry.\nAs a publicly traded company, the SEC, Nasdaq Capital Market, and other regulatory bodies subject us to increased scrutiny on the way we manage and operate our business by\nurging us or mandating us to a series of actions that have nowadays become an area of focus among policymakers and investors. Listed companies are occasionally encouraged to\nfollow best practices and often must comply with these rules and/or practices addressing a variety of corporate governance and anti-fraud matters, such as director independence, board\ncommittees, corporate transparency, ethical behavior, sustainability and prevention of and controls relating to corruption and fraud. While we believe we follow all requirements that\nregulatory bodies may from time to time impose on us, our internal processes and procedures might not be as advanced or mature as those implemented by other listed shipping\ncompanies with a longer experience and presence in the U.S. capital markets, which could be an area of concern to our investors and expose us to greater operational risks.\nWe may be subject to litigation that, if not resolved in our favor and not sufficiently insured against, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe may, from time to time, be involved in various litigation matters. These matters may include, among other things, contract disputes, personal injury claims, environmental claims\nor proceedings, asbestos and other toxic tort claims, employment matters, governmental claims for taxes or duties, and other litigation that arises in the ordinary course of our business.\nWe cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any claim or other litigation matter, and the ultimate outcome of any litigation or the potential costs to resolve it may have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business. Insurance may not be applicable or sufficient in all cases and/or insurers may not remain solvent, which could have a material adverse effect on\nour financial condition.\nWe may have to pay tax on United States source income, which would reduce our earnings, cash from operations and cash available for distribution to our shareholders.\nUnder the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”), 50% of the gross shipping income of a vessel owning or chartering corporation, such as ourselves and our\nsubsidiaries, that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends, but that does not both begin and end, in the United States may be subject to a 4% U.S. federal income tax without\nallowance for deduction, unless that corporation qualifies for exemption from tax under Section 883 of the Code and the applicable Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.\nWe intend to take the position that we and each of our subsidiaries qualify for this statutory tax exemption for our 2021 and future taxable years. However, as discussed below under\n“Taxation—U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations—U.S. Federal Income Taxation of Our Company”, whether we qualify for this exemption in view of our share structure is unclear\nand there can be no assurance that the exemption from tax under Section 883 of the Code will be available to us. If we or our subsidiaries are not entitled to this exemption, we would be\nsubject to an effective 2% U.S. federal income tax on the gross shipping income we derive during the year that is attributable to the transport of cargoes to or from the United States. If\nthis tax had been imposed for our 2021 taxable year or for the year ended December 31, 2022, we anticipate that U.S source income taxes of approximately $206,174 and $960,181 would be\nrecognized for these periods, respectively, and we have included a reserve for these amounts in our Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements. However, there can be no assurance that\nsuch taxes would not be materially higher or lower in future taxable years.\nA change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation, of any country in which we operate could result in a higher tax rate on our worldwide earnings, which could\nresult in a significant negative impact on our earnings and cash flows from operations.\nWe conduct our operations through subsidiaries which can trade worldwide. Tax laws and regulations are highly complex and subject to interpretation. Consequently, we are\nsubject to changing tax laws, treaties and regulations in and between countries in which we operate. Our income tax expense, if any, is based upon our interpretation of tax laws in effect\nin various countries at the time that the expense was incurred. A change in these tax laws, treaties or regulations, or in the interpretation thereof, could result in a materially higher tax\nexpense or a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings, and such change could be significant to our financial results. If any tax authority successfully challenges our\noperational structure, or the taxable presence of our operating subsidiaries in certain countries, or if the terms of certain income tax treaties are interpreted in a manner that is adverse to\nour structure, or if we lose a material tax dispute in any country, our effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings could increase substantially. An increase in our taxes could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows from these operations. Moreover, in February 2023, the Marshall Islands was added to a list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for\ntax purposes, commonly referred to as the “EU blacklist”. The effect of the EU blacklist, including whether and when the European Union will remove the Marshall Islands from the EU\nblacklist, any legislation that the Marshall Islands may enact with a view toward being removed from the EU blacklist, how the European Union may react to such legislation, and how\ncounterparties will react to the EU blacklist, is unclear and could potentially have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur subsidiaries may be subject to taxation in the jurisdictions in which its activities are conducted. The amount of any such taxation may be material and would reduce the\namounts available for distribution to us.\n25\nTable of Contents\nWe are dependent on our management and their ability to hire and retain key personnel and their ability to devote sufficient time and attention to their respective roles. In\nparticular, we are dependent on the retention and performance of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Petros Panagiotidis.\nOur success will depend upon our and our management’s ability to hire and retain key members of our management team and the ability of our management team to devote\nsufficient time and attention to their respective roles in light of outside business interests. In particular, we are dependent upon the performance of our Chairman and Chief Executive\nOfficer, Petros Panagiotidis, who has outside business interests in Castor and other ventures. Mr. Panagiotidis will devote such portion of his business time and attention to our\nbusiness as is appropriate and will also devote substantial time to Castor’s business and other business and/or investment activities that Mr. Panagiotidis maintains now or in the future.\nMr. Panagiotidis’ intention to provide adequate time and attention to other ventures will preclude him from devoting substantially all his time to our business. Further, the loss of\nMr. Panagiotidis, either to outside business interests or for unrelated reasons, or resignation of Mr. Panagiotidis from any of his current managerial roles could adversely affect our\nbusiness prospects and financial condition. Any difficulty in hiring and retaining key personnel generally could also adversely affect our results of operations. We do not maintain “key\nman” life insurance on any of our officers.\nRisks Relating To Our Common Shares\nOur share price may be highly volatile and, as a result, investors in our common shares could incur substantial losses.\nThe stock market in general, and the market for shipping companies in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated or disproportionate to the\noperating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may experience rapid and substantial losses on their investment in our common shares that are\nunrelated to our operating performance. Our stock price may exhibit similar volatility, which may cause our common shares to trade above or below what we believe to be their\nfundamental value. Furthermore, significant historical fluctuations in the market price of Castor’s common shares have been accompanied by reports of strong and atypical retail investor\ninterest, including on social media and online forums, and, as Castor distributed our common shares to its common shareholders in connection with the Spin Off, we may experience\nsimilar patterns of investment.\nMarket volatility and trading patterns may create several risks for investors, including but not limited to the following:\n• the market price of our common shares may experience rapid and substantial increases or decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects, or macro or industry\nfundamentals;\n• to the extent volatility in our common shares is caused by a “short squeeze” in which coordinated trading activity causes a spike in the market price of our common shares as\ntraders with a short position make market purchases to avoid or to mitigate potential losses, investors may purchase common shares at inflated prices unrelated to our financial\nperformance or prospects, and may thereafter suffer substantial losses as prices decline once the level of short-covering purchases has abated; and\n• if the market price of our common shares declines, you may be unable to resell your shares at or above the price at which you acquired them. We cannot assure you that the\nequity issuance of our common shares will not fluctuate, increase or decline significantly in the future, in which case you could incur substantial losses.\nWe may incur rapid and substantial increases or decreases in our stock price in the foreseeable future that may not coincide in timing with the disclosure of news or developments\nby or affecting us. Accordingly, the market price of our common shares may decline or fluctuate rapidly, regardless of any developments in our business. Overall, there are various\nfactors, many of which are beyond our control, that could negatively affect the market price of our common shares or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common\nshares, which include but are not limited to:\n• investor reaction to our business strategy;\n• the sentiment of the significant number of retail investors whom we believe, will hold our common shares, in part due to direct access by retail investors to broadly available\ntrading platforms, and whose investment thesis may be influenced by views expressed on financial trading and other social media sites and online forums;\n26\nTable of Contents\n• the amount and status of short interest in our common shares, access to margin debt, trading in options and other derivatives on our common shares and any related hedging\nand other trading factors;\n• our continued compliance with the listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market and any action we may take to maintain such compliance, such as a reverse stock split;\n• regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries, especially changes in laws or regulations applicable to our industry;\n• variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n• our ability or inability to raise additional capital and the terms on which we raise it;\n• our dividend strategy;\n• our continued compliance with our debt covenants;\n• variations in the value of our fleet;\n• declines in the market prices of stocks generally;\n• trading volume of our common shares;\n• sales of our common shares by us or our shareholders;\n• speculation in the press or investment community about our Company, our industry or our securities;\n• general economic, industry and market conditions; and\n• other events or factors, including those resulting from such events, or the prospect of such events, including war, terrorism and other international conflicts, public health\nissues including health epidemics or pandemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and natural disasters such as fire, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornados or other\nadverse weather and climate conditions, whether occurring in the United States or elsewhere, could disrupt our operations or result in political or economic instability.\nIn addition, the Spin Off could temporarily increase the volatility of our share price for a variety of reasons. For example, it is possible that some of our shareholders will sell our\ncommon shares as a result of the Spin Off, for reasons such as our business profile or market capitalization as a standalone company not fitting their investment objectives. Volatility in\nour share price may also increase as the market evaluates our and Castor’s prospects as independent publicly traded companies. There can be no assurance that the effects of any such\nvolatility in share price would be borne equally among us and Castor. The sale of significant volumes of our common shares, or the perception in the market that this will occur, may\ndecrease their market price and have an adverse impact on our business, including due to Nasdaq minimum bid price requirements.\nSome companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their common shares have been subject to securities class-action litigation. If instituted against us, such\nlitigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition,\noperating results and growth prospects. There can be no guarantee that the price of our common shares will remain at or rise above its post-Distribution level or that future sales of our\ncommon shares will not be at prices lower than those initially distributed or sold to investors.\nThe combined post-Distribution value of Castor and Toro’s shares may not equal or exceed the pre-Distribution value of Castor shares.\nCastor common shares are listed and traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market and Toro common shares are also listed and traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market. We cannot assure you\nthat the combined trading prices of Castor common shares and Toro common shares after March 7, 2023, as adjusted for any changes in the combined capitalization of these companies,\nwill be equal to or greater than the trading price of Castor common shares prior to March 7, 2023. Until the market has fully evaluated the business of Toro, the price at which shares of\nToro common shares trade may fluctuate significantly. Similarly, until the market has fully evaluated the business of Castor without the business of Toro, the price at which Castor\ncommon shares trades may fluctuate significantly. See also “¾Our share price may be highly volatile, and as a result, investors in our Common Shares could incur substantial losses.”\nFuture issuances of additional shares, including as a result of an optional conversion of Series A Preferred Shares, or the potential for such issuances, may impact the price of our\ncommon shares and could impair our ability to raise capital through equity offerings. Shareholders may experience significant dilution as a result of any such issuances.\nToro has an authorized share capital of 3,900,000,000 common shares that it may issue without further shareholder approval. Our growth strategy may require the issuance of a\nsubstantial amount of additional shares. Based on market conditions, we may also opportunistically seek to issue equity securities, including additional common shares. We cannot\nassure you at what price the offering of our shares in the future, if any, will be made but they may be offered and sold at a price significantly below the current trading price of our\ncommon shares or the acquisition price of common shares by shareholders and may be at a discount to the trading price of our common shares at the time of such sale. Purchasers of the\ncommon shares we sell, as well as our existing shareholders, will experience significant dilution if we sell shares at prices significantly below the price at which they invested.\n27\nTable of Contents\nThe Series A Preferred Shares are convertible, in whole or in part, at their holder’s option, to common shares at any time and from time to time from and after the third anniversary of\ntheir issue date and prior to the seventh anniversary of such date. Subject to certain adjustments, the “Conversion Price” for any conversion of the Series A Preferred Shares shall be the\nlower of (i) 150% of the VWAP of our common shares over the five consecutive trading day period commencing on and including the Distribution Date, and (ii) the VWAP of our common\nshares over the 10 consecutive trading day period expiring on the trading day immediately prior to the date of delivery of written notice of the conversion; provided, that, in no event\nshall the Conversion Price be less than $2.50. The number of common shares to be issued to a converting holder shall be equal to the quotient of (i) the aggregate stated amount of the\nSeries A Preferred Shares converted plus Accrued Dividends (but excluding any dividends declared but not yet paid) thereon on the date on which the conversion notice is delivered\ndivided by (ii) the Conversion Price. If converted by Castor, Castor will have registration rights in relation to the common shares issued upon conversion. See “Item 7. Major\nShareholders and Related Party Transactions—B. Related Party Transactions—Contribution and Spin Off Distribution Agreement”. The issuance of additional common shares upon\nconversion of the Series A Preferred Shares could result in significant dilution to our shareholders at the time of conversion.\nIn addition, we may issue additional common shares or other equity securities of equal or senior rank in the future in connection with, among other things, debt prepayments or\nfuture vessel acquisitions, without shareholder approval, in a number of circumstances. To the extent that we issue restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, options or warrants\nto purchase our common shares in the future and those stock appreciation rights, options or warrants are exercised or as the restricted stock units vest, our shareholders may experience\nfurther dilution. Holders of shares of our common shares have no preemptive rights that entitle such holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or\nseries and, therefore, such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our shareholders.\nOur issuance of additional common shares or other equity securities of equal or senior rank, or the perception that such issuances may occur, could have the following effects:\n• our existing shareholders’ proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease;\n• the earnings per share and the per share amount of cash available for dividends on our common shares (as and if declared) could decrease;\n• the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding common share could be diminished;\n• the market price of our common shares could decline; and\n• our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional securities at a time and price that we deem appropriate could be impaired.\nThe market price of our common shares could also decline due to sales, or the announcements of proposed sales, of a large number of common shares by our large shareholders\n(including sales of common shares issued upon conversion, if any, of the Series A Preferred Shares), or the perception that these sales could occur.\nWe are incorporated in the Marshall Islands, which does not have a well-developed body of corporate and case law.\nWe are organized in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which does not have a well-developed body of corporate or case law, and as a result, shareholders may have fewer rights\nand protections under Marshall Islands law than under a typical jurisdiction in the United States. Our corporate affairs are governed by our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and by\nthe Marshall Islands Business Corporations Act (the “BCA”). The provisions of the BCA resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the United States.\nHowever, there have been few judicial cases in the Marshall Islands interpreting the BCA. The rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under the laws of the Marshall Islands are\nnot as clearly established as the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in the United States. The rights of shareholders of\ncompanies incorporated in the Marshall Islands may differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in the United States. While the BCA provides that its provisions\nshall be applied and construed in a manner to make them uniform with the laws of the State of Delaware and other states with substantially similar legislative provisions, there have been\nfew, if any, court cases interpreting the BCA in the Marshall Islands and we cannot predict whether Marshall Islands courts would reach the same conclusions as U.S. courts. Thus, you\nmay have difficulty in protecting your interests in the face of actions by our management, directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in\na United States jurisdiction which has developed a relatively more substantial body of case law.\n28\nTable of Contents\nWe are incorporated in the Marshall Islands, and the majority of our officers and directors are non-U.S. residents. It may be difficult to serve legal process or enforce judgments\nagainst us, our directors or our management.\nWe are incorporated under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and substantially all of our assets are located outside of the United States. Our principal executive\noffice is located in Cyprus. In addition, the majority of our directors and officers are non-residents of the United States, and substantially all of their assets are located outside the United\nStates. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for you to bring an action against us or against these individuals in the United States if you believe that your rights have been\ninfringed under securities laws or otherwise. Even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind, the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands and of other jurisdictions may\nprevent or restrict you from enforcing a judgment against our assets or our directors and officers. Although you may bring an original action against us or our affiliates in the courts of\nthe Marshall Islands, and the courts of the Marshall Islands may impose civil liability, including monetary damages, against us or our affiliates for a cause of action arising under\nMarshall Islands law, it may be impracticable for you to do so.\nOur Bylaws contain exclusive forum provisions that may limit a shareholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable.\nOur Bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the High Court of the Republic of the Marshall Islands shall be the sole and exclusive\nforum for asserting any internal corporate claim, intra-corporate claim or claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine and that the United States District Court for the Southern District\nof New York shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any action asserting a claim arising under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. If the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York does not have jurisdiction over the claims assigned to it by our exclusive forum provisions, any other federal district court of the United States may hear\nsuch claims.\nWhile the validity of exclusive forum provisions has been upheld under the law of certain jurisdictions, uncertainty remains as to whether our exclusive forum provisions will be\nfully or partially recognized by all jurisdictions. If a court were to find either exclusive forum provision contained in our articles of association to be inapplicable or unenforceable (in\nwhole or in part) in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial\ncondition.\nThe exclusive forum provision in our Bylaws will not relieve us of our duties to comply with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and our shareholders\nwill not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations. In particular, Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all claims\nbrought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder, and Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for\nfederal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder.\nOur exclusive forum provision may limit a shareholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors or other employees or increase\nthe costs associated with bringing litigation against us or our directors, employees or officers, which may discourage lawsuits against such parties.\nWe are subject to certain anti-takeover provisions that could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition, or could make it difficult for our\nshareholders to replace or remove our current Board, and could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.\nSeveral provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws could make it difficult for our shareholders to change the composition of our Board in any one year, preventing them\nfrom changing the composition of management. In addition, the same provisions may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that shareholders may consider favorable.\nThese provisions include:\n29\nTable of Contents\n• authorizing our Board to issue “blank check” preferred shares without shareholder approval;\n• providing for a classified Board with staggered, three-year terms;\n• establishing certain advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board or for proposing matters that can be acted on by shareholders at shareholder\nmeetings;\n• prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n• limiting the persons who may call special meetings of shareholders; and\n• establishing supermajority voting provisions with respect to amendments to certain provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws.\nOn the Distribution Date, our Board declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a “Right”), for each outstanding common share and adopt a shareholder rights plan,\nas set forth in the Shareholder Protection Rights Agreement (the “Rights Agreement”) to be entered into between Toro and Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, Inc., as rights agent.\nEach Right allows its holder to purchase from Toro one common share (or one one-thousandth of a share of Series C Participating Preferred Shares), for the Exercise Price of $22 once the\nRights become exercisable. This portion of a Series C Participating Preferred Share will give the shareholder approximately the same dividend, voting and liquidation rights as would one\ncommon share. The Rights Agreement is intended to protect shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics. In general terms, it imposes a significant penalty upon any\nperson or group that acquires 15% or more of our outstanding common shares without the approval of our Board. If a shareholder’s beneficial ownership of our common shares as of the\ntime of the public announcement of the rights plan and associated dividend declaration is at or above the applicable threshold, that shareholder’s then-existing ownership percentage\nwould be grandfathered, but the rights would become exercisable if at any time after such announcement, the shareholder increases its ownership percentage by 1% or more. Our\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Petros Panagiotidis, and Mr. Panagiotidis’ controlled affiliates are exempt from these provisions. For a full description of the rights plan, see “Item\n10. Additional Information—B. Shareholder Protection Rights Agreement”.\nThe Rights may have anti-takeover effects. The Rights will cause substantial dilution to any person or group that attempts to acquire us without the approval of our Board. As a\nresult, the overall effect of the Rights may be to render more difficult or discourage any attempt to acquire us. Because our Board can approve a redemption of the Rights for a permitted\noffer, the Rights should not interfere with a merger or other business combination approved by our Board.\nIn addition to the Rights above, we have issued 40,000 Series B Preferred Shares representing 99.8% of the aggregate voting power of our total issued and outstanding share\ncapital. See “—Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who may be deemed to beneficially own, directly or indirectly, 100% of our Series B Preferred Shares, will have control over\nus” and “Item 10. Additional Information—B. Memorandum and Articles of Association.”\nFurther, our lender has imposed provisions prohibiting or limiting a change of control, subject to certain exceptions, on our currently sole credit facility. See “—Our term loan\nfacility contains, and we expect that any new or amended credit facility we enter into will contain, restrictive covenants that we may not be able to comply with due to economic,\nfinancial or operational reasons and may limit our business and financing activities.” Our management agreements similarly permit our manager to terminate these agreements in the\nevent of a change of control. For further information on our management agreements, see “Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions — B. Related Party\nTransactions” and Note 3 to our Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements included elsewhere in this annual report.\nThe foregoing anti-takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public shareholders to benefit from a change in control and, as a result, may adversely affect the\nmarket price of our common shares and your ability to realize any potential change of control premium.\n30\nTable of Contents\nOur Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who may be deemed to beneficially own, directly or indirectly, 100% of our Series B Preferred Shares, has control over us.\nOur Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Petros Panagiotidis, may be deemed to beneficially own, directly or indirectly, all of the 40,000 outstanding shares of our Series B\nPreferred Shares. The shares of Series B Preferred Shares each carry 100,000 votes. The Series B Preferred Shares represent 0.4% of our total issued and outstanding share capital and\n99.8% of the aggregate voting power of our total issued and outstanding share capital. By his ownership of 100% of our Series B Preferred Shares, Mr. Panagiotidis has control over our\nactions. The interests of Mr. Panagiotidis may be different from your interests.\nWe are an “emerging growth company”, and we cannot be certain if the reduced requirements applicable to emerging growth companies make our securities less attractive to\ninvestors.\nWe are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As an emerging growth company, we are not required to\ncomply with, among other things, the auditor attestation requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”). Investors may find our securities less\nattractive because we rely on this provision. If investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and prices of such\nsecurities may be more volatile.\nWe are a foreign private issuer and, as a result, are not subject to U.S. proxy rules and will be subject to Exchange Act reporting obligations that, to some extent, are more lenient\nand less frequent than those of a U.S. domestic public company.\nWe report under the Exchange Act as a non-U.S. company with foreign private issuer status. Because we qualify as a foreign private issuer under the Exchange Act, we are exempt\nfrom certain provisions of the Exchange Act that are applicable to U.S. domestic public companies, including (i) the sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies,\nconsents or authorizations in respect of a security registered under the Exchange Act, (ii) the sections of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their stock\nownership and trading activities and liability for insiders who profit from trades made in a short period of time, and (iii) the rules under the Exchange Act requiring the filing with the SEC\nof quarterly reports on Form 10-Q containing unaudited financial and other specified information, or current reports on Form 8-K, upon the occurrence of specified significant events. In\naddition, foreign private issuers are not required to file their annual report on Form 20-F until four months after the end of each financial year, while U.S. domestic issuers that are large\naccelerated filers are required to file their annual report on Form 10-K within 60 days after the end of each fiscal year. Foreign private issuers are also exempt from Regulation FD, aimed at\npreventing issuers from making selective disclosures of material information. As a result of the above, you may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies\nthat are not foreign private issuers or controlled companies.\nIn addition, as a foreign private issuer, we are also entitled to rely on exceptions from certain corporate governance requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nAs a result, you may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are not foreign private issuers.\nU.S. tax authorities could treat us as a “passive foreign investment company”, which could have adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. shareholders.\nA foreign corporation will be treated as a “passive foreign investment company” (a “PFIC”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes if either (1) at least 75% of its gross income for any\ntaxable year consists of certain types of “passive income” or (2) at least 50% of the average value of the corporation’s assets produce or are held for the production of those types of\n“passive income”. For purposes of these tests, “passive income” includes dividends, interest, and gains from the sale or exchange of investment property and rents and royalties other\nthan rents and royalties which are received from unrelated parties in connection with the active conduct of a trade or business. For purposes of these tests, income derived from the\nperformance of services does not constitute “passive income,” whereas rental income would generally constitute “passive income” to the extent not attributable to the active conduct of\na trade or business. U.S. shareholders of a PFIC are subject to a disadvantageous U.S. federal income tax regime with respect to the income derived by the PFIC, the distributions they\nreceive from the PFIC and the gain, if any, they derive from the sale or other disposition of their shares in the PFIC.\n31\nTable of Contents\nWe do not believe that we will be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year. However, our status as a PFIC is determined on an annual basis and will depend upon the operations of our\nvessels and our other activities during each taxable year. In this regard, we intend to treat the gross income we derive or are deemed to derive from our time chartering, pool arrangements\nand/or voyage chartering activities as services income, rather than rental income. Accordingly, we believe that our income from our chartering and/or pool activities does not constitute\n“passive income,” and the assets that we own and operate in connection with the production of that income do not constitute passive assets.\nThere is, however, no direct legal authority under the PFIC rules addressing our method of operation, in particular, in the event that all our vessels are employed in pools.\nAccordingly, no assurance can be given that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), or a court of law will accept our position, and there is a risk that the IRS or a court of law\ncould determine that we are a PFIC. Moreover, no assurance can be given that we would not constitute a PFIC for any taxable year in which we become unable to acquire vessels in a\ntimely fashion or if there were to be changes in the nature and extent of our operations.\nIf the IRS were to find that we are or have been a PFIC for any taxable year, our U.S. shareholders would face adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences and information\nreporting obligations. Under the PFIC rules, unless those shareholders made an election available under the Internal Revenue Code (which election could itself have adverse\nconsequences for such shareholders, as discussed below under “Item 10. Additional Information—E. Taxation—U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations—Passive Foreign\nInvestment Company Status and Significant Tax Consequences”), such shareholders would be liable to pay U.S. federal income tax upon excess distributions and upon any gain from\nthe disposition of our common shares at the then prevailing income tax rates applicable to ordinary income plus interest as if the excess distribution or gain had been recognized ratably\nover the shareholder’s holding period of our common shares. Please see the section of this annual report entitled “Item 10. Additional Information—E. Taxation—U.S. Federal Income\nTax Considerations—Passive Foreign Investment Company Status and Significant Tax Consequences” for a more comprehensive discussion of the U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences to U.S. shareholders if we are treated as a PFIC.\nRisks Relating to our Preferred Shares\nOur Series A Preferred Shares rank senior to our common shares with respect to dividends, distributions and payments upon liquidation and are convertible into our common\nshares, which could have an adverse effect on the value of our common shares.\nDividends on the Series A Preferred Shares accrue and are cumulative from their issue date and are payable quarterly on each distribution payment date declared by the Board, out\nof funds legally available for such purpose. The dividend rate for the period from, and including, the issue date to, but excluding, the seventh anniversary of the issue date (the “reset\ndate”) will be 1.00% per annum of the stated amount of $1,000 per share; however, for each quarterly dividend period commencing on or after the reset date, the dividend rate will be the\ndividend rate in effect for the prior quarterly dividend period multiplied by a factor of 1.3, provided that the dividend rate will not exceed 20% per annum in respect of any quarterly\ndividend period.\nThe rights of the holders of our Series A Preferred Shares rank senior to the obligations to holders of our common shares. This means that, unless accumulated dividends have been\npaid or set aside for payment on all of our outstanding Series A Preferred Shares for all past completed dividend periods, no distributions may be declared or paid on our common shares\nsubject to limited exceptions. Likewise, in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, no distribution of our assets may be made to holders of our\ncommon shares until we have paid to holders of our Series A Preferred Shares a liquidation preference equal to $1,000 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.\nIn addition, our Series A Preferred Shares are convertible, in whole or in part, at their holder’s option, to common shares at any time and from time to time from and after the third\nanniversary of their issue date and prior to the seventh anniversary of such date. The conversion of our Series A Preferred Shares could result in significant dilution to our shareholders\nat the time of conversion. See also “—Risks Relating to our Common Shares—Future issuances of additional shares, including as a result of an conversion of Series A Preferred\nShares, or the potential for such issuances, may impact the price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise capital through equity offerings. Shareholders may\nexperience significant dilution as a result of any such issuances.”\nAccordingly, the existence of the Series A Preferred Shares and the ability of a holder to convert the Series A Preferred Shares into common shares on or after the third and prior to\nthe seventh anniversary of their issue date could have a material adverse effect on the value of our common shares. See “Item 10. Additional Information—B. Memorandum and\nArticles of Incorporation—Description of the Series A Preferred Shares” for a more detailed description of the Series A Preferred Shares.\n32\nTable of Contents\nRisks Relating to the Distribution\nBecause there has not been any public market for our common shares, the market price and trading volume of our common shares may be volatile.\nPrior to the Distribution, there will have been no regular way trading market for our common shares. We cannot predict the extent to which investors’ interest will lead to a liquid\ntrading market and whether the market price of our common shares may be volatile. The market price of our common shares could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including in\nresponse to the risk factors listed in this annual report or for reasons unrelated to our specific performance, such as reports by industry analysts, investor perceptions, or negative\ndevelopments for our customers, competitors or suppliers, as well as general economic and industry conditions. For factors which could cause ongoing volatility in our share price,\nplease refer to “Our share price may be highly volatile, and as a result, investors in our common shares could incur substantial losses”. Fluctuations in the post-Distribution market\nprice for our shares may cause combined post-Distribution value of Castor and Toro’s shares to be less than the pre-Distribution value of Castor shares. See “The combined post-\nDistribution value of Castor and Toro’s shares may not equal or exceed the pre-Distribution value of Castor shares”.\nWe have limited the fields in which we focus our operations and this may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn connection with the Spin Off, on November 15, 2022, our Board resolved, among other things, to focus our efforts on our current business of tanker shipping services, that we\nhave no interest or expectancy to participate or pursue any opportunity in areas of business outside of the tanker shipping business nor that Petros Panagiotidis, our director, Chairman,\nChief Executive Officer and controlling shareholder and his affiliates, such as Castor Ships, offer or inform us of any such opportunity. This does not, however, preclude us from\npursuing opportunities outside of the tanker shipping business if in the future our Board determines to do so. Nonetheless, focusing our efforts on the tanker shipping business may\nreduce the scope of opportunities we may exploit and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nSimilarly, Castor’s board has resolved, among other things, to focus its efforts on its current business of dry bulk shipping services, that Castor has no interest or expectancy to\nparticipate or pursue any opportunity in areas of business outside of the dry bulk shipping business nor that Petros Panagiotidis, its director, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief\nFinancial Officer and controlling shareholder and his affiliates will offer or inform it of any such opportunity. This does not preclude Castor, however, from pursuing opportunities\noutside of the dry bulk shipping business if in the future Castor’s board determines to do so, including in the tanker shipping business, and in the fourth quarter of 2022, Castor entered\nthe containershipping industry following the purchase of two containership vessels.\nOur failure to obtain an opportunity that our Board deems in the interest of our shareholders may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nSee also “Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—B. Related Party Transactions—The Spin Off Resolutions.”\nThe Distribution may result in significant tax liability.\nWe do not expect that the Distribution will qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Therefore, we expect that the receipt by Castor shareholders of\ncommon shares of our Company in the Distribution would be a taxable distribution, and each U.S. holder that receives our common shares in the Distribution would be treated as if the\nU.S. holder had received a distribution equal to the fair market value of such stock that was distributed to it, which, in the case of Castor’s shareholders, would generally be treated first\nas a taxable dividend to the extent of such holder’s pro rata share of Castor’s earnings and profits, then as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of the holder’s tax basis in its\nCastor common shares, and thereafter as capital gain with respect to any remaining value. The amount of any such taxes to Castor shareholders may be substantial.\nAlthough we do not expect that the Distribution will qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Castor, which is not a U.S. corporation, will not be subject to\nU.S. federal income tax as a result of the distribution of our common shares.\n33\nTable of Contents\nOur historical financial results may not be representative of our results as a separate, standalone company.\nThe historical financial information we have included in this annual report has been derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Castor and does\nnot necessarily reflect what our financial position, results of operations or cash flows would have been had we been a separate, standalone company during the periods presented.\nAlthough Castor did account for our business as two separate business segments , we were not operated as a separate, standalone company for the historical periods presented. The\nhistorical information does not necessarily indicate what our results of operations, financial position, cash flows or costs and expenses will be in the future.\nWe may incur material costs and expenses as a result of our separation from Castor, such as those related to compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nWe may incur costs and expenses greater than those we currently incur as a result of our separation from Castor. These increased costs and expenses may arise from various\nfactors, including financial reporting and costs associated with complying with federal securities laws, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the\n“Sarbanes-Oxley Act”). We cannot assure you that these costs will not be material to our business.\nIn particular, compliance, or lack thereof, with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may have a material effect on our business. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires any company\nsubject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. securities laws to do a comprehensive evaluation of its and its consolidated subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting. To\ncomply with this statute, we are required to document and test our internal control procedures, our management is required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control\nover financial reporting. If our management cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or our auditors identify material weaknesses in our\ninternal controls or our internal controls are not effective, investor confidence in our financial results may weaken, and our stock price may suffer.\n34\nTable of Contents\nITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY\nA. History and Development of the Company\nToro was incorporated by Castor under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands on July 29, 2022 as Tankco Shipping Inc., to serve as the holding company of the Toro\nSubsidiaries. On March 7, 2023, Castor contributed to us the Toro Subsidiaries, in exchange for all of our issued and outstanding common shares, the issue of 140,000 Series A Preferred\nShares to Castor and the issue of 40,000 Series B Preferred Shares to Pelagos, against payment of their nominal value. On March 7, 2023, Castor distributed all of our common shares on a\npro rata basis to its holders of common stock. Our common shares commenced trading on March 7, 2023 on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “TORO”.\nWe are an independent, growth-oriented shipping company that acquires, owns, charters and operates oceangoing tanker vessels and provides worldwide seaborne transportation\nservices for crude oil and refined petroleum products. As of the date of this annual report, we maintain a fleet of eight tanker vessels with an aggregate cargo carrying capacity of\n0.7 million dwt and an average fleet age of 17.8 years. As of December 31, 2022, our fleet comprised of eight vessels.\nUnder pre-existing agreements between various parties and our shipowning subsidiaries, the majority of vessels comprising our fleet are currently contracted to operate in pools.\nOOuurr ccoommmmeerrcciiaall ssttrraatteeggyy pprriimmaarriillyy ffooccuusseess oonn ddeeppllooyyiinngg oouurr fflleeeett uunnddeerr aa mmiixx ooff ppoooollss,, vvooyyaaggee cchhaarrtteerrss aanndd ttiimmee cchhaarrtteerrss aaccccoorrddiinngg ttoo oouurr aasssseessssmmeenntt ooff mmaarrkkeett ccoonnddiittiioonnss.. WWee aaddjjuusstt\nthe mix of these charters to take advantage of the relatively stable cash flows and high utilization rates for our vessels associated with period time charters, to profit from attractive trip\ncharter rates during periods of strong charter market conditions associated with voyage charters or to take advantage of high utilization rates for our vessels along with exposure to\nattractive charter rates during periods of strong charter market conditions when employing our vessels in pools. As of the date of this annual report, seven of the eight vessels in our\nFleet were employed in pools and one was employed in a period time charter. Such arrangements will be reevaluated by management on a periodic basis.\nWe intend to expand our fleet in the future and may acquire additional tankers, including to replace existing vessels and to reduce the average age of our fleet, and potentially, if our\nBoard so determines, may acquire vessels in other sectors, based on, in each case, our assessment of market conditions and subject to the conditions set out in the Toro Spin Off\nResolutions. We intend to acquire additional vessels principally in the secondhand market, including acquisitions from third-parties, and we may also acquire additional vessels from\nrelated parties, provided that such related party acquisitions are negotiated and conducted on an arms-length basis. We may also enter into newbuilding contracts to the extent that we\nbelieve they present attractive opportunities. For an overview of our fleet, please see “—B. Business Overview—Our fleet.”\nOur principal executive office is at 223 Christodoulou Chatzipavlou Street, Hawaii Royal Gardens, 3036 Limassol, Cyprus.

None of the information contained on, or that can be accessed through, these websites is\nincorporated into or forms a part of this annual report.\nFleet Development and Vessel Capital Expenditures\nIn 2021, our fleet grew from zero vessels to nine vessels through the acquisition by Castor of nine tanker vessels, one of which was sold to a third-party on May 9, 2022 and\ndelivered to that party on July 15, 2022. For further information on these vessel acquisitions and the financing transaction associated with certain of these vessel acquisitions, see “—B.\nBusiness Overview—Our fleet”, “Item 5. Operation and Financial Review and Prospects—B. Liquidity and Capital Resources—Our Borrowing Activities” and Notes 5 and 6 to our\nCombined Carve-Out Financial Statements included in this annual report.\nAs of the date of this annual report, six of our eight tanker vessels are equipped with a ballast water treatment system (“BWTS”). In connection with our separation from Castor, we\nhave assumed obligations under contracts for the purchase and installation of a BWTS on two non-equipped vessels. We retrofitted one of these vessels in February 2023 and currently\nexpect to retrofit the two remaining vessels in 2024, obtaining operational flexibility worldwide.\n35\nTable of Contents\nAs of the date of this annual report, it is estimated that the contractual obligations related to the purchases of BWTS for these two remaining tanker vessels, excluding installation\ncosts, will be approximately €1.2 million (or $1.3 million on the basis of a Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange rate of €1.0000/$1.06749 as of December 31, 2022), all of which are due in 2024.\nDuring the period ended December 31, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2022, we made capital expenditures of $1.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively, for the installation of\nBWTS on our vessels.\nB. Business Overview\nWe operate tanker vessels that engage in the worldwide transportation of crude oil and refined petroleum products using our Aframax/LR2 tankers, which transport crude oil, and\nHandysize tankers, which transport refined petroleum products. As a result of the different characteristics of our Aframax/LR2 tanker vessels and Handysize tanker vessels and\ndifferences in the transportation of crude oil versus the transportation of crude oil and refined petroleum products in terms of trading routes and cargo handling, we have determined that\nwe operate in two reportable segments: (i) the Aframax/LR2 tanker segment and (ii) the Handysize tanker segment. The reportable segments reflect the internal organization of the\nCompany and the way the chief operating decision maker reviews the operating results and allocates capital within the Company. During the year ended December 31, 2022, our\nAframax/LR2 tanker vessels operated under time charter contracts, voyage charter contracts and pools entered into by certain of the Toro Subsidiaries, while our Handysize vessels\noperated in a Handysize pool. We do not disclose geographic information relating to our segments. When the Company charters a vessel to a charterer, the charterer is free, subject to\ncertain exemptions, to trade the vessel worldwide and, as a result, the disclosure of geographic information is impracticable. For further information, see Note 12 to our Combined Carve-\nOut Financial Statements included elsewhere in this annual report.\nOur Fleet\nThe following table summarizes key information about our fleet as of March 7, 2023:\nEstimated Estimated Latest\nCapacity Year Country of Type of Gross Charter Earliest Charter Charter\nVessel Name (dwt) Built Construction Charter Rate ($/day) Expiration Expiration\nAframax/LR2 Segment(1)\nM/T Wonder Polaris 115,351 2005 S.

The vessel was\ndelivered to its new owners on July 15, 2022.\n(2) The vessel is currently participating in the V8 Plus Pool, a pool operating Aframax tankers aged fifteen (15) years or more that is managed by V8 Plus Management Pte Ltd., a\ncompany in which Petros Panagiotidis has a minority equity interest.\n(3) In February 2023, the agreement relating to the M/T Wonder Sirius’s participation in the V8 Plus Pool was terminated and the vessel commenced a period time charter.\n(4) The vessel is currently participating in an unaffiliated tanker pool specializing in the employment of Handysize tanker vessels.\nChartering of our Fleet\nWe intend to actively market our vessels predominantly in the spot voyage market and/or enter into pool arrangements but may also enter into time charter contracts in order to\nsecure optimal employment in the tanker shipping market.\nCharter rates in the spot market are volatile and sometimes fluctuate on a seasonal and year-to-year basis. Fluctuations derive from imbalances in the availability of cargoes for\nshipment and the number of vessels available at any given time to transport these cargoes, as well as supply and demand for crude oil and oil products carried by ocean-going vessels\ninternationally. Vessels operating in the spot market generate revenue that is less predictable than those under period time charters but may enable us to capture increased profit margins\nduring periods of improvements in the tanker shipping market. Downturns in the crude oil and refined petroleum product industries could result in a reduction in profit margins and lead\nto losses. Based on market conditions, we may opportunistically look to employ more of our tanker vessels in the spot market under time charter contracts, voyage charter contracts\nand/or pooling arrangements.\n36\nTable of Contents\nVoyage charters involve a charterer engaging a vessel for a particular journey. A voyage contract is made for the use of a vessel, for which we are paid freight (a fixed amount per\nton of cargo carried or a lump sum amount) on the basis of transporting cargo from a loading port to a discharge port. Depending on charterparty terms, freight can be fully prepaid, or be\npaid upon reaching the discharging destination upon delivery of the cargo, at the discharging destination but before discharging, or during a ship’s voyage. Revenues from voyage\ncharters are typically tied to prevailing market rates and may therefore be more volatile than rates from other charters, such as time charters.\nTime charters involve a charterer engaging a vessel for a set period of time. Time charter agreements may have extension options ranging from months to, sometimes, years and are\ntherefore viewed as providing more predictable cash flows over the period of the engagement than may otherwise be attainable from other charter arrangements. The time charter party\ngenerally provides, among others, typical warranties regarding the speed and the performance of the vessel as well as owner protective restrictions such that the vessel is sent only to\nsafe ports by the charterer, subject always to compliance with applicable sanction laws and war risks, and carry only lawful and non-hazardous cargo. We typically enter into time\ncharters ranging from one month to 12 months and in isolated cases on longer terms depending on market conditions. The charterer has the full discretion over the ports visited,\nshipping routes and vessel speed, subject to the owner’s protective restrictions. Under our time charter agreements, whereby our vessels are utilized by a charterer for a set duration of\ntime, the charterer pays a fixed or floating daily hire rate and other compensation costs related to the contracts.\nA pool consists of a group of vessels of similar types and sizes provided by various owners for the purpose of enabling a centralized pool operator to engage those vessels\ncommercially. Pools employ experienced commercial charterers and operators who have close working relationships with customers and brokers, while technical management is separate\nfrom pool operations. Their main objective is to enter into arrangements for the employment and operation of the pool vessels, so as to secure for the pool participants the highest\ncommercially available earnings per vessel on the basis of pooling the net revenues of the pool vessels and dividing it between the pool participants based on the terms of the pool\nagreement. Pool vessels are marketed as a single group of vessels, primarily in the spot market but also from time to time for time charters, and all revenues earned from the operation of\nthe pool vessels are aggregated together and, after deduction of all costs involved in the operation of the pool, shared between the pool participants based on an agreed key. The size\nand scope of pools enable them to achieve larger economies of scale and to have better negotiating power with all procurement vendors (e.g., bunker suppliers, port agents, towing\ncompanies, etc.) and as a result they are able to reduce their costs for such items. They also achieve geographic diversification by deploying their pool vessels in both Atlantic and\nPacific markets while arbitraging from spread opportunities. The diversification in revenue streams due to typically broader shipping capabilities of pool fleet vessels and/or more\naccessible customer base, alongside payments to pool participants on a set schedule, can stabilize revenues for pool participants, though this may be offset by volatility in spot rates.\nFurthermore, due to their large fleets, pools can make vessels available for prompt cargoes (which are usually priced at higher than market rates) on short notice and thus they are able to\ncapture the premium of such prompt cargoes. Pools also have higher market visibility, which provides them with opportunities not available to smaller tanker market participants. By\nbeing able to reduce costs and optimize revenues, pools aim to outperform the industry benchmark indices by utilizing their size and sophistication and improving utilization rates for\nparticipating vessels through various methods, including securing backhaul voyages and contracts of affreightment. For further information on our charters and charter terms, please\nrefer to “Item 5. Operation and Financial Results Review—A. Operating Results—Hire Rates and the Cyclical Nature of the Industry”.\nAs of March 7, 2023, seven of our eight tanker vessels were participating in pools and one Aframax/LR2 vessel was employed in a period time charter.\n37\nTable of Contents\nManagement of our Business\nOur vessels are commercially and technically managed by Castor Ships, a company controlled by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Petros Panagiotidis. Castor Ships\nmanages our business overall and provides us with crew management, technical management, operational employment management, insurance management, provisioning, bunkering,\ncommercial, chartering and administrative services, including, but not limited to, securing employment for our fleet, arranging and supervising the vessels’ commercial operations,\nhandling all of the Company’s vessel sale and purchase transactions, undertaking related shipping projects, management advisory and support services, accounting and audit support\nservices, as well as other associated services requested from time to time by us and our ship-owning subsidiaries. Castor Ships may choose to subcontract these services to other\nparties at its discretion. As of the date of this annual report, Castor Ships has subcontracted the technical management of all of our tanker vessels to third-party ship-management\ncompanies. Castor Ships pays, at its own expense, these technical management companies a fee for the services it has subcontracted to them, without burdening the Company with any\nadditional cost.\nIn exchange for the above management services, we and our subsidiaries pay Castor Ships (i) a flat quarterly management fee in the amount of $0.75 million for the management and\nadministration of our business, (ii) a daily fee of $975 per vessel for the provision of ship management services under separate ship management agreements entered into by our\nshipowning subsidiaries, (iii) a commission of 1.25% on all gross income received from the operation of our vessels and (iv) a commission of 1% on each consummated sale and purchase\ntransaction.\nFor further information, see “Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—B. Related Party Transactions.”\nEnvironmental and Other Regulations in the Shipping Industry\nGovernment regulations and laws significantly affect the ownership and operation of our fleet. We are subject to international conventions and treaties, national, state and local\nlaws and regulations in force in the countries in which our vessels may operate or are registered relating to safety and health and environmental protection including the storage,\nhandling, emission, transportation and discharge of hazardous and non-hazardous materials, and the remediation of contamination and liability for damage to natural resources.\nCompliance with such international conventions, laws, regulations, insurance and other requirements entails significant expense, including for vessel modifications and the\nimplementation of certain operating procedures.\nA variety of government and private entities subject our vessels to both scheduled and unscheduled inspections. These entities include the local port authorities (applicable\nnational authorities such as the United States Coast Guard (“USCG”), harbor master or equivalent), classification societies, flag state administrations (countries of registry) and\ncharterers, particularly terminal operators. Certain of these entities require us to obtain permits, licenses, certificates and other authorizations for the operation of our vessels. Failure to\nmaintain necessary permits or approvals could require us to incur substantial costs or result in the temporary suspension of the operation of our vessels.\nIncreasing environmental concerns have created a demand for vessels that conform to stricter environmental standards. We are required to maintain operating standards for our\nvessels that emphasize operational safety, quality maintenance, continuous training of our officers and crews and compliance with United States, European Union and international\nregulations. We believe that the operation of our vessels is in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that our vessels have all material permits,\nlicenses, certificates or other authorizations necessary for the conduct of our operations. However, because such laws and regulations frequently change and may impose increasingly\nstricter requirements, we cannot predict the ultimate cost of complying with these requirements, or the impact of these requirements on the resale value or useful lives of our vessels. In\naddition, a serious marine incident that causes significant adverse environmental impact could result in additional legislation or regulation that could have a material adverse effect on\nour business, financial condition and operating results.\nInternational Maritime Organization\nThe International Maritime Organization, the United Nations agency for maritime safety and the prevention of pollution by vessels (the “IMO”), has adopted the International\nConvention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto, collectively referred to as MARPOL 73/78 and herein as “MARPOL”,\nthe International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea of 1974 (“SOLAS Convention”), and the International Convention on Load Lines of 1966. MARPOL establishes environmental\nstandards relating to oil leakage or spilling, garbage management, sewage, air emissions, handling and disposal of noxious liquids and the handling of harmful substances in packaged\nforms. MARPOL is applicable to dry bulk, tanker, containers, LPG and LNG carriers, among other vessels, and is broken into six Annexes, each of which regulates a different source of\npollution. Annex I relates to oil leakage or spilling; Annexes II and III relate to harmful substances carried in bulk in liquid or in packaged form, respectively; Annexes IV and V relate to\nsewage and garbage management, respectively. Annex VI, which relates to air emissions, was separately adopted by the IMO in September of 1997; new emissions standards, titled IMO-\n2020, took effect on January 1, 2020.\n38\nTable of Contents\nAir Emissions\nIn September of 1997, the IMO adopted Annex VI to MARPOL to address air pollution from vessels. Effective May 2005, Annex VI sets limits on sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxide\nemissions from all commercial vessel exhausts and prohibits “deliberate emissions” of ozone-depleting substances (such as halons and chlorofluorocarbons), emissions of volatile\ncompounds from cargo tanks, and the shipboard incineration of specific substances. Annex VI also includes a global cap on the sulfur content of fuel oil and allows for special areas to\nbe established with more stringent controls on sulfur emissions, as explained below. Emissions of “volatile organic compounds” from certain tankers and shipboard incineration (from\nincinerators installed after January 1, 2000) of certain substances (such as polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs) are also prohibited. We believe that our vessels are currently compliant in\nall material respects with these requirements.\nThe Marine Environment Protection Committee, or “MEPC,” adopted amendments to Annex VI regarding emissions of sulfur oxide, nitrogen oxide, particulate matter and ozone\ndepleting substances, which entered into force on July 1, 2010. The amended Annex VI seeks to further reduce air pollution by, among other things, implementing a progressive\nreduction of the amount of sulfur contained in any fuel oil used on board ships. On October 27, 2016, at its 70th session, the MEPC agreed to implement a global 0.5% m/m sulfur oxide\nemissions limit (reduced from 3.50%) starting from January 1, 2020. This limitation can be met by using low-sulfur compliant fuel oil, alternative fuels, or certain exhaust gas cleaning\nsystems. Ships are now required to obtain bunker delivery notes and International Air Pollution Prevention Certificates from their flag states that specify sulfur content. Additionally, at\nMEPC 73, amendments to Annex VI to prohibit the carriage of bunkers above 0.5% sulfur on ships not equipped with exhaust gas cleaning systems were adopted and took effect on\nMarch 1, 2020. These regulations subject ocean-going vessels to stringent emissions controls and may cause us to incur substantial costs. As of the date of this annual report, one of\nour vessels is equipped with a scrubber while our remaining vessels are not equipped with scrubbers and we have transitioned to burning IMO compliant fuels.\nSulfur content standards are even stricter within certain “Emission Control Areas”, or (“ECAs”). As of January 1, 2015, ships operating within an ECA were not permitted to use fuel\nwith sulfur content in excess of 0.1% m/m. Amended Annex VI establishes procedures for designating new ECAs. Currently, the IMO has designated four ECAs, including specified\nportions of the Baltic Sea area, North Sea area, North American area and United States Caribbean area. Ocean-going vessels in these areas are subject to more stringent emission\ncontrols and may cause us to incur additional costs. Other areas in China are subject to local regulations that impose stricter emission controls. If other ECAs are approved by the IMO,\nor other new or more stringent requirements relating to emissions from marine diesel engines or port operations by vessels are adopted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\n(“EPA”) or the other jurisdictions where we operate, compliance with these regulations could entail significant capital expenditures or otherwise increase the costs of our operations.\nAmended Annex VI also establishes new tiers of stringent nitrogen oxide emissions standards for marine diesel engines, depending on their date of installation. At the MEPC\nmeeting held from March to April 2014, amendments to Annex VI were adopted which address the date on which Tier III Nitrogen Oxide (“NOx”) standards in ECAs will go into effect.\nUnder the amendments, Tier III NOx standards apply to ships that operate in the North American and U.S. Caribbean Sea ECAs designed for the control of NOx produced by vessels\nwith a marine diesel engine installed and constructed on or after January 1, 2016. Tier III requirements could apply to areas that will be designated for Tier III NOx in the future As all of\nthe vessels currently comprising our Fleet were built prior to 2016, we are not affected by Tier III requirements from an operational perspective. Similarly, our vessels are not subject to\nTier II NOx, which regulates nitrogen dioxide emissions from vessels built on or after January 1, 2011, and our vessels are currently in compliance with Tier I NOx requirements. However,\nwe may acquire additional vessels that are subject to Tier II or Tier III NOx in the future and/or additional trading restrictions could be imposed upon vessels that are currently in\ncompliance with Tier I or II NOx standards, each of which may cause us to incur additional capital expenses and/or other compliance costs. At MEPC 70 and MEPC 71, the MEPC\napproved the North Sea and Baltic Sea as ECAs for nitrogen oxide for ships built on or after January 1, 2021. The EPA promulgated equivalent (and in some respects stricter) emissions\nstandards in 2010. As determined at the MEPC 70, the new Regulation 22A of MARPOL Annex VI became effective as of March 1, 2018, and requires ships above 5,000 gross tonnage to\ncollect and report annual data on fuel oil consumption to an IMO database, with the first year of data collection having commenced on January 1, 2019. The IMO intends to use such\ndata as the first step in its roadmap (through 2023) for developing its strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships, as discussed further below.\nAs of January 1, 2013, MARPOL made mandatory certain measures relating to energy efficiency for ships. All ships are now required to develop and implement Ship Energy\nEfficiency Management Plans (“SEEMPS”), and new ships must be designed in compliance with minimum energy efficiency levels per capacity mile as defined by the Energy Efficiency\nDesign Index (“EEDI”). Under these measures, by 2025, all new ships built will be 30% more energy efficient than those built in 2014. Additionally, MEPC 75 adopted amendments to\nMARPOL Annex VI which brings forward the effective date of the EEDI’s “phase 3” requirements from January 1, 2025 to April 1, 2022 for several ship types, including gas carriers,\ngeneral cargo ships, and LNG carriers. This may require us to incur additional operating or other costs for those vessels built after January 1, 2013. Further, MEPC 75 proposed draft\namendments requiring that, on or before January 1, 2023, all ships above 400 gross tonnage must have an approved SEEMP on board. For ships above 5,000 gross tonnage, the SEEMP\nwould need to include certain mandatory content.\n39\nTable of Contents\nIn addition to the recently implemented emission control regulations, the IMO has been devising strategies to reduce greenhouse gases and carbon emissions from ships.\nAccording to its latest announcement, IMO plans to initiate measures to reduce CO2 emissions by at least 40% by 2030 and 70% by 2050 from the levels in 2008. It also plans to\nintroduce measures to reduce GHG emissions by 50% by 2050 from the 2008 levels. These are likely to be achieved by setting energy efficiency requirements and encouraging ship\nowners to use alternative fuels such as biofuels, and electro-/synthetic fuels such as hydrogen or ammonia and may also include limiting the speed of the ships. However, there is still\nuncertainty regarding the exact measures that the IMO will undertake to achieve these targets. IMO-related uncertainty is also a factor discouraging ship owners from ordering newbuild\nvessels, as these vessels may have high future environmental compliance costs.\nIn June 2021, IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (“MEPC”) adopted amendments to MARPOL Annex VI that will require ships to reduce their greenhouse gas\nemissions. These amendments combine technical and operational approaches to improve the energy efficiency of ships, also providing important building blocks for future GHG\nreduction measures. The new measures require the IMO to review the effectiveness of the implementation of the Carbon Intensity Indicator (“CII”) and Energy Efficiency Existing Ship\nIndex (“EEXI”) requirements, by January 1, 2026 at the latest. EEXI is a technical measure and will apply to ships above 400 GT. It indicates the energy efficiency of the ship compared to\na baseline and is based on a required reduction factor (expressed as a percentage relative to the EEDI baseline). On the other hand, CII is an operational measure which specifies carbon\nintensity reduction requirements for vessels with 5,000 GT and above. The CII determines the annual reduction factor needed to ensure continuous improvement of the ship’s\noperational carbon intensity within a specific rating level. The operational carbon intensity rating would be given on a scale of A, B, C, D or E indicating a major superior, minor superior,\nmoderate, minor inferior, or inferior performance level, respectively. The performance level would be recorded in the ship’s SEEMP. A ship rated D or E for three consecutive years would\nhave to submit a corrective action plan to show how the required index (C or above) would be achieved. Further, the European Union has endorsed a binding target of at least 55%\ndomestic reduction in economy wide GHG reduction by 2030 compared to 1990. The amendments to MARPOL Annex VI (adopted in a consolidated revised Annex VI) are expected to\nenter into force on November 1, 2022, with the requirements for EEXI and CII certification coming into effect from January 1, 2023. This means that the first annual reporting on carbon\nintensity will be completed in 2023, with the first rating given in 2024. We are also required to comply with requirements relating to new European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (“EU\nETS”) regulations for carbon emissions for voyages of vessels above 5000 GT departing from or arriving to ports in the European Union phased in from the beginning of 2024, with an\nimplementation scheme of 40% of emissions and ending in 2026 with 100% of the emissions produced by these voyages.\nWe may incur costs to comply with these revised standards including the introduction of new emissions software platform applications which will enable continuous monitoring of\nCIIs as well as automatic generation of CII reports, amendment of SEEMP part II plans and adoption and implementation of ISO 500001 procedures. Additional or new conventions, laws\nand regulations may be adopted that could require the installation of expensive emission control systems and could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and\noperating results.\nSafety Management System Requirements\nThe SOLAS Convention was amended to address the safe manning of vessels and emergency training drills. The Convention of Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims (the\n“LLMC”) sets limitations of liability for a loss of life or personal injury claim, or a property claim against ship owners. We believe that our vessels are in substantial compliance with\nSOLAS and LLMC standards.\nUnder Chapter IX of the SOLAS Convention, or the International Safety Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (the “ISM Code”), our\noperations are also subject to environmental standards and requirements. The ISM Code requires the party with operational control of a vessel to develop an extensive safety\nmanagement system that includes, among other things, the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy, as well as a cybersecurity risk policy, setting forth instructions and\nprocedures for operating its vessels safely and describing procedures for responding to emergencies. We rely upon the safety management system that we and our technical\nmanagement team have developed for compliance with the ISM Code. The failure of a vessel owner or bareboat charterer to comply with the ISM Code may subject such party to\nincreased liability, decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports.\n40\nTable of Contents\nThe ISM Code requires that vessel operators obtain a safety management certificate for each vessel they operate. This certificate evidences compliance by a vessel’s management\nwith the ISM Code requirements for a safety management system. No vessel can obtain a safety management certificate unless its manager has been awarded a document of compliance,\nissued by each flag state, under the ISM Code. We have obtained applicable documents of compliance for our offices and safety management certificates for our vessels for which the\ncertificates are required by the IMO. The document of compliance and safety management certificate are renewed as required.\nRegulation II-1/3-10 of the SOLAS Convention on goal-based ship construction standards for oil tankers stipulates that ships over 150 meters in length must have adequate\nstrength, integrity and stability to minimize risk of loss or pollution.\nAmendments to the SOLAS Convention Chapter VII apply to vessels transporting dangerous goods and require those vessels be in compliance with the International Maritime\nDangerous Goods Code (“IMDG Code”). Effective January 1, 2018, the IMDG Code includes (1) updates to the provisions for radioactive material, reflecting the latest provisions from\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency, (2) new marking, packing and classification requirements for dangerous goods, and (3) new mandatory training requirements. Amendments\nwhich took effect on January 1, 2020, also reflect the latest material from the UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods, including (1) new provisions regarding IMO\ntype 9 tank, (2) new abbreviations for segregation groups, and (3) special provisions for carriage of lithium batteries and of vehicles powered by flammable liquid or gas.\nThe IMO has also adopted the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (“STCW”). As of February 2017, all seafarers are\nrequired to meet the STCW standards and be in possession of a valid STCW certificate. Flag states that have ratified SOLAS and STCW generally authorize the classification societies\nto undertake surveys to confirm compliance on their behalf.\nThe IMO’s Maritime Safety Committee and MEPC, respectively, each adopted relevant parts of the International Code for Ships Operating in Polar Water (the “Polar Code”). The\nPolar Code, which entered into force on January 1, 2017, covers design, construction, equipment, operational, training, search and rescue as well as environmental protection matters\nrelevant to ships operating in the waters surrounding the two poles. It also includes mandatory measures regarding safety and pollution prevention as well as recommendatory\nprovisions. The Polar Code applies to new ships constructed after January 1, 2017, and from January 1, 2018, ships constructed before January 1, 2017 are required to meet the relevant\nrequirements by the earlier of their first intermediate or renewal survey.\nFurthermore, recent action by the IMO’s Maritime Safety Committee and United States agencies indicates that cybersecurity regulations for the maritime industry are likely to be\nfurther developed in the near future in an attempt to combat cybersecurity threats. Companies are required from January 2021 to develop additional procedures for monitoring\ncybersecurity in addition to those required by the IMO, which could require additional expenses and/or capital expenditures.\nFuel Regulations in Arctic Waters\nMEPC 76 adopted amendments to MARPOL Annex I (addition of a new regulation 43A) to introduce a prohibition on the use and carriage for use as fuel of heavy fuel oil (HFO) by\nships in Arctic waters on and after July 1, 2024. The prohibition will cover the use and carriage for use as fuel of oils having a density at 15°C higher than 900 kg/m3 or a kinematic\nviscosity at 50°C higher than 180 mm2/s. Ships engaged in securing the safety of ships, or in search and rescue operations, and ships dedicated to oil spill preparedness and response\nwould be exempted. Ships which meet certain construction standards with regard to oil fuel tank protection would need to comply on and after July 1, 2029.\nPollution Control and Liability Requirements\nThe IMO has negotiated international conventions that impose liability for pollution in international waters and the territorial waters of the signatories to such conventions. For\nexample, the IMO adopted an International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments (the “BWM Convention”) in 2004. The BWM\nConvention entered into force on September 8, 2017. The BWM Convention requires ships to manage their ballast water to remove, render harmless, or avoid the uptake or discharge of\nnew or invasive aquatic organisms and pathogens within ballast water and sediments. The BWM Convention’s implementing regulations call for a phased introduction of mandatory\nballast water exchange requirements, to be replaced in time with mandatory concentration limits, and require all ships to carry a ballast water record book and an international ballast\nwater management certificate.\n41\nTable of Contents\nOn December 4, 2013, the IMO Assembly passed a resolution revising the application dates of the BWM Convention so that the dates are triggered by the entry into force date and\nnot the dates originally in the BWM Convention. This, in effect, makes all vessels delivered before the entry into force date “existing vessels” and allows for the installation of ballast\nwater management systems on such vessels at the first International Oil Pollution Prevention (“IOPP”) renewal survey following entry into force of the convention. The MEPC adopted\nupdated guidelines for approval of ballast water management systems (G8) at MEPC 70. At MEPC 71, the schedule regarding the BWM Convention’s implementation dates was also\ndiscussed and amendments were introduced to extend the date existing vessels are subject to certain ballast water standards. Those changes were adopted at MEPC 72. Ships over 400\ngross tons generally must comply with a “D-1 standard,” requiring the exchange of ballast water only in open seas and away from coastal waters. The “D-2 standard” specifies the\nmaximum amount of viable organisms allowed to be discharged, and compliance dates vary depending on the IOPP renewal dates. Depending on the date of the IOPP renewal survey,\nexisting vessels must comply with the D-2 standard on or after September 8, 2019. For most ships, compliance with the D-2 standard will involve installing onboard systems to treat\nballast water and eliminate unwanted organisms. Ballast water management systems, which include systems that make use of chemical, biocides, organisms or biological mechanisms, or\nwhich alter the chemical or physical characteristics of the ballast water, must be approved in accordance with IMO Guidelines (Regulation D-3). As of October 13, 2019, MEPC 72’s\namendments to the BWM Convention took effect, making the Code for Approval of Ballast Water Management Systems, which governs assessment of ballast water management\nsystems, mandatory rather than permissive, and formalized an implementation schedule for the D-2 standard. Under these amendments, all ships must meet the D-2 standard by\nSeptember 8, 2024. Significant costs may be incurred to comply with these regulations. Additionally, in November 2020, MEPC 75 adopted amendments to the BWM Convention which\nwould require a commissioning test of the ballast water management system for the initial survey or when performing an additional survey for retrofits. This analysis will not apply to\nships that already have an installed BWM system certified under the BWM Convention. These amendments entered into force on June 1, 2022. To date we have made $1.5 million in\ncapital expenditures relating to the installation of BWTS on our vessels. For further information on these installations, see “—A. History and Development of the Company—Fleet\nDevelopment and Vessel Capital Expenditures.”\nMandatory mid-ocean exchange ballast water treatment requirements under the BWM Convention may increase the cost of compliance may increase for ocean carriers and may\nhave a material effect on our operations. However, many countries already regulate the discharge of ballast water carried by vessels from country to country to prevent the introduction\nof invasive and harmful species via such discharges. The U.S., for example, requires vessels entering its waters from another country to conduct mid-ocean ballast exchange, or\nundertake some alternate measure, and to comply with certain reporting requirements. Ballast water compliance requirements could adversely affect our business, results of operations,\ncash flows and financial condition.\nThe IMO also adopted the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage (the “Bunker Convention”) to impose strict liability on ship owners\n(including the registered owner, bareboat charterer, manager or operator) for pollution damage in jurisdictional waters of ratifying states caused by discharges of bunker fuel. The Bunker\nConvention requires registered owners of ships over 1,000 gross tons to maintain insurance for pollution damage in an amount equal to the limits of liability under the applicable national\nor international limitation regime (but not exceeding the amount calculated in accordance with the LLMC). With respect to non-ratifying states, liability for spills or releases of oil carried\nas fuel in ship’s bunkers typically is determined by the national or other domestic laws in the jurisdiction where the events or damages occur.\nShips are required to maintain a certificate attesting that they maintain adequate insurance to cover an incident. In jurisdictions such as the United States where the Bunker\nConvention has not been adopted, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, along with various legislative schemes and common law standards of conduct govern, and liability is imposed either on\nthe basis of fault or on a strict-liability basis.\nAnti-Fouling Requirements\nIn 2001, the IMO adopted the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-fouling Systems on Ships (the “Anti-fouling Convention”). The Anti-fouling Convention,\nwhich entered into force on September 17, 2008, prohibits the use of organotin compound coatings to prevent the attachment of mollusks and other sea life to the hulls of vessels.\nVessels of over 400 gross tons engaged in international voyages are also required to undergo an initial survey before the vessel is put into service or before an International Anti-fouling\nSystem Certificate is issued for the first time; and subsequent surveys when the anti-fouling systems are altered or replaced.\n42\nTable of Contents\nIn June 2021, MEPC 76 adopted amendments to the Anti-fouling Convention to prohibit the use of biocide cybutryne contained in anti-fouling systems, which would apply to ships\nfrom January 1, 2023, or, for ships already bearing such an anti-fouling system, at the next scheduled renewal of the system after that date, but no later than 60 months following the last\napplication to the ship of such a system, as studies have proven that the substance is harmful to a variety of marine organisms.\nCompliance Enforcement\nNoncompliance with the ISM Code or other IMO regulations may subject the ship owner or bareboat charterer to increased liability, may lead to decreases in available insurance\ncoverage for affected vessels and may result in the denial of access to, or detention in, some ports. The USCG and European Union authorities have indicated that vessels not in\ncompliance with the ISM Code by applicable deadlines will be prohibited from trading in U.S. and European Union ports, respectively. As of the date of this annual report, our vessels\nare ISM Code certified through their respective third-party managers. Castor Ships has obtained the interim documents of compliance in order to operate the vessels in accordance with\nthe ISM Code and all other international and regional requirements that are applicable to our vessels. However, there can be no assurance that such certificates will be maintained in the\nfuture. The IMO continues to review and introduce new regulations. It is impossible to predict what additional regulations, if any, may be passed by the IMO and what effect, if any,\nsuch regulations might have on our operations.\nUnited States Regulations\nThe U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act\nThe U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) established an extensive regulatory and liability regime for the protection and cleanup of the environment from oil spills. OPA affects all\n“owners and operators” whose vessels trade or operate within the U.S., its territories and possessions or whose vessels operate in U.S. waters, which includes the U.S.’s territorial sea\nand its 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone around the U.S. The U.S. has also enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”),\nwhich applies to the discharge of hazardous substances other than oil, except in limited circumstances, whether on land or at sea. OPA and CERCLA both define “owner and operator” in\nthe case of a vessel as any person owning, operating or chartering by demise, the vessel. Both OPA and CERCLA impact our operations.\nUnder OPA, vessel owners and operators are “responsible parties” and are jointly, severally and strictly liable (unless the spill results solely from the act or omission of a third party,\nan act of God or an act of war) for all containment and clean-up costs and other damages arising from discharges or threatened discharges of oil from their vessels, including bunkers\n(fuel). OPA defines these other damages broadly to include:\n(i) injury to, destruction or loss of, or loss of use of, natural resources and related assessment costs;\n(ii) injury to, or economic losses resulting from, the destruction of real and personal property;\n(iii) loss of subsistence use of natural resources that are injured, destroyed or lost;\n(iv) net loss of taxes, royalties, rents, fees or net profit revenues resulting from injury, destruction or loss of real or personal property, or natural resources;\n(v) lost profits or impairment of earning capacity due to injury, destruction or loss of real or personal property or natural resources; and\n(vi) net cost of increased or additional public services necessitated by removal activities following a discharge of oil, such as protection from fire, safety or health hazards, and loss\nof subsistence use of natural resources.\nOPA contains statutory caps on liability and damages; such caps do not apply to direct clean-up costs. Effective December 12, 2019, the USCG adjusted the limits of OPA liability\nfor non-tank vessels, edible oil tank vessels, and any oil spill response vessels, to the greater of $1,200 per gross ton or $997,100 (subject to periodic adjustment for inflation). These\nlimits of liability do not apply if an incident was proximately caused by the violation of an applicable U.S. federal safety, construction or operating regulation by a responsible party (or its\nagent, employee or a person acting pursuant to a contractual relationship), or a responsible party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. The limitation on liability similarly does not\napply if the responsible party fails or refuses to (i) report the incident as required by law where the responsible party knows or has reason to know of the incident; (ii) reasonably\ncooperate and assist as requested in connection with oil removal activities; or (iii) without sufficient cause, comply with an order issued under the Federal Water Pollution Act (Section\n311 (c), (e)) or the Intervention on the High Seas Act.\n43\nTable of Contents\nCERCLA contains a similar liability regime whereby owners and operators of vessels are liable for cleanup, removal and remedial costs, as well as damages for injury to, or\ndestruction or loss of, natural resources, including the reasonable costs associated with assessing the same, and health assessments or health effects studies. There is no liability if the\ndischarge of a hazardous substance results solely from the act or omission of a third party, an act of God or an act of war. Liability under CERCLA is limited to the greater of $300 per\ngross ton or $5.0 million for vessels carrying a hazardous substance as cargo and the greater of $300 per gross ton or $500,000 for any other vessel. These limits do not apply (rendering\nthe responsible person liable for the total cost of response and damages) if the release or threat of release of a hazardous substance resulted from willful misconduct or negligence, or the\nprimary cause of the release was a violation of applicable safety, construction or operating standards or regulations. The limitation on liability also does not apply if the responsible\nperson fails or refused to provide all reasonable cooperation and assistance as requested in connection with response activities where the vessel is subject to OPA.\nOPA and CERCLA each preserve the right to recover damages under existing law, including maritime tort law. OPA and CERCLA both require owners and operators of vessels to\nestablish and maintain with the USCG evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to meet the maximum amount of liability to which the particular responsible person may be subject.\nVessel owners and operators may satisfy their financial responsibility obligations by providing a proof of insurance, a surety bond, qualification as a self-insurer or a guarantee. We\ncomply and plan to be in compliance going forward with the USCG’s financial responsibility regulations by providing applicable certificates of financial responsibility.\nThe 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico resulted in additional regulatory initiatives or statutes, including higher liability caps under OPA, new regulations\nregarding offshore oil and gas drilling, and a pilot inspection program for offshore facilities. Several of these initiatives and regulations have been or may be revised. For example, the\nU.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement’s (“BSEE”) revised Production Safety Systems Rule (“PSSR”), effective December 27, 2018, modified and relaxed certain\nenvironmental and safety protections under the 2016 PSSR. Additionally, the BSEE amended the Well Control Rule, effective July 15, 2019, which rolled back certain reforms regarding the\nsafety of drilling operations, and the Trump administration had proposed leasing new sections of U.S. waters to oil and gas companies for offshore drilling. The effects of these\nproposals and changes are currently unknown, and recently, the Biden administration issued an executive order temporarily blocking new leases for oil and gas drilling in federal waters.\nWhile a U.S. federal court has since granted an injunction against this executive order, the sale of a large number of previously auctioned oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico has\nrecently been blocked by another U.S. federal court. The U.S. Department of Justice is currently appealing the injunction against the executive order. Compliance with any new\nrequirements of OPA and future legislation or regulations applicable to the operation of our vessels could impact the cost of our operations or demand for our vessels and adversely\naffect our business.\nOPA specifically permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries, provided they accept, at a\nminimum, the levels of liability established under OPA and some states have enacted legislation providing for unlimited liability for oil spills, including bunker fuel spills. Many U.S.\nstates that border a navigable waterway have enacted environmental pollution laws that impose strict liability on a person for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of\noil or a release of a hazardous substance. Some of these laws are more stringent than U.S. federal law in some respects. Moreover, some states have enacted legislation providing for\nunlimited liability for discharge of pollutants within their waters, although in some cases, states which have enacted this type of legislation have not yet issued implementing regulations\ndefining shipowners’ responsibilities under these laws. The Company intends to be in compliance with all applicable state regulations in the relevant ports where the Company’s vessels\ncall.\nWe currently maintain pollution liability coverage insurance in the amount of $1.0 billion per incident for our vessels. If the damages from a catastrophic spill were to exceed our\ninsurance coverage, it could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\n44\nTable of Contents\nOther United States Environmental Initiatives\nThe U.S. Clean Air Act of 1970 (including its amendments of 1977 and 1990) (“CAA”) requires the EPA to promulgate standards applicable to emissions of greenhouse gasses,\nvolatile organic compounds and other air contaminants. The CAA requires states to adopt State Implementation Plans, some of which regulate emissions resulting from vessel loading\nand unloading operations which may affect our vessels.\nThe U.S. Clean Water Act (“CWA”) prohibits the discharge of oil, hazardous substances and ballast water in U.S. navigable waters unless authorized by a duly issued permit or\nexemption and imposes strict liability in the form of penalties for any unauthorized discharges. The CWA also imposes substantial liability for the costs of removal, remediation and\ndamages and complements the remedies available under OPA and CERCLA.\nThe EPA and the USCG have also enacted rules relating to ballast water discharge, compliance with which requires the installation of equipment on our vessels to treat ballast water\nbefore it is discharged or the implementation of other port facility disposal arrangements or procedures at potentially substantial costs, and/or otherwise restrict our vessels from\nentering U.S. waters. The EPA will regulate these ballast water discharges and other discharges incidental to the normal operation of certain vessels within United States waters pursuant\nto the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act (“VIDA”), which was signed into law on December 4, 2018 and replaces the 2013 Vessel General Permit (“VGP”) program (which authorizes\ndischarges incidental to operations of commercial vessels and contains numeric ballast water discharge limits for most vessels to reduce the risk of invasive species in U.S. waters,\nstringent requirements for exhaust gas scrubbers, and requirements for the use of environmentally acceptable lubricants) and current Coast Guard ballast water management regulations\nadopted under the U.S. National Invasive Species Act, such as mid-ocean ballast exchange programs and installation of approved USCG technology for all vessels equipped with ballast\nwater tanks bound for U.S. ports or entering U.S. waters. VIDA establishes a new framework for the regulation of vessel incidental discharges under the CWA, requires the EPA to\ndevelop performance standards for those discharges within two years of enactment, and requires the U.S. Coast Guard to develop implementation, compliance and enforcement\nregulations within two years of the EPA’s promulgation of standards. Under VIDA, all provisions of the 2013 VGP and USCG regulations regarding ballast water treatment remain in force\nand effect until the EPA and U.S. Coast Guard regulations are finalized. Non-military, non-recreational vessels greater than 79 feet in length must continue to comply with the\nrequirements of the VGP, including submission of a Notice of Intent (“NOI”) or retention of a PARI form and submission of annual reports. We have submitted NOIs for our vessels\nwhere required. Compliance with the EPA, U.S. Coast Guard and state regulations could require the installation of ballast water treatment equipment on our vessels which have not\nalready installed this equipment or the implementation of other port facility disposal procedures as a result of which we may incur additional capital expenditures or may otherwise have\nto restrict certain of our vessels from entering U.S. waters.\nEuropean Union Regulations\nIn October 2009, the European Union amended a directive to impose criminal sanctions for illicit ship-source discharges of polluting substances, including minor discharges, if\ncommitted with intent, recklessly or with serious negligence and the discharges individually or in the aggregate result in deterioration of the quality of water. Aiding and abetting the\ndischarge of a polluting substance may also lead to criminal penalties. The directive applies to all types of vessels, irrespective of their flag, but certain exceptions apply to warships or\nwhere human safety or that of the ship is in danger. Criminal liability for pollution may result in substantial penalties or fines and increased civil liability claims. Regulation (EU) 2015/757\nof the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2015 (amending EU Directive 2009/16/EC) governs the monitoring, reporting and verification of carbon dioxide emissions from\nmaritime transport, and, subject to some exclusions, requires companies with ships over 5,000 gross tonnage to monitor and report carbon dioxide emissions annually, which may cause\nus to incur additional expenses.\nThe European Union has adopted several regulations and directives requiring, among other things, more frequent inspections of high-risk ships, as determined by type, age and\nflag as well as the number of times the ship has been detained. The European Union also adopted and extended a ban on substandard ships and enacted a minimum ban period and a\ndefinitive ban for repeated offenses. The regulation also provided the European Union with greater authority and control over classification societies, by imposing more requirements on\nclassification societies and providing for fines or penalty payments for organizations that failed to comply. Furthermore, the EU has implemented regulations requiring vessels to use\nreduced sulfur content fuel for their main and auxiliary engines. The EU Directive 2005/33/EC (amending Directive 1999/32/EC) introduced requirements parallel to those in MARPOL\nAnnex VI relating to the sulfur content of marine fuels. In addition, the EU imposed a 0.1% maximum sulfur requirement for fuel used by ships at berth in the Baltic, the North Sea and the\nEnglish Channel (the so called “SOx-Emission Control Area”). As of January 2020, EU member states must also ensure that ships in all EU waters, except the SOx-Emission Control Area,\nuse fuels with a 0.5% maximum sulfur content.\nOn September 15, 2020, the European Parliament voted to include greenhouse gas emissions from the maritime sector in the European Union’s carbon market. This will require\nshipowners to buy permits to cover these emissions. On July 14, 2021, the EU Commission proposed legislation to amend the EU ETS to include shipping emissions which will be phased\nin beginning in 2023.\n45\nTable of Contents\nGreenhouse Gas Regulation\nCurrently, the emissions of greenhouse gases from international shipping are not subject to the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,\nwhich entered into force in 2005 and pursuant to which adopting countries have been required to implement national programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with targets\nextended through 2020. International negotiations are continuing with respect to a successor to the Kyoto Protocol, and restrictions on shipping emissions may be included in any new\ntreaty. In December 2009, more than 27 nations, including the U.S. and China, signed the Copenhagen Accord, which includes a non-binding commitment to reduce greenhouse gas\nemissions. The 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris resulted in the Paris Agreement, which entered into force on November 4, 2016 and does not directly limit\ngreenhouse gas emissions from ships. The U.S. initially entered into the agreement, but on June 1, 2017, the Trump administration announced that the United States intended to withdraw\nfrom the Paris Agreement, and the withdrawal became effective on November 4, 2020. On January 20, 2021, U.S. President Biden signed an executive order to rejoin the Paris Agreement,\nwhich took effect on February 19, 2021.\nAt MEPC 70 and MEPC 71, a draft outline of the structure of the initial strategy for developing a comprehensive IMO strategy on reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from ships\nwas approved. In accordance with this roadmap, in April 2018, nations at the MEPC 72 adopted an initial strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships. The initial strategy\nidentifies “levels of ambition” to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including (1) decreasing the carbon intensity from ships through implementation of further phases of the EEDI for\nnew ships; (2) reducing carbon dioxide emissions per transport work, as an average across international shipping, by at least 40% by 2030, pursuing efforts towards 70% by 2050,\ncompared to 2008 emission levels; and (3) reducing the total annual greenhouse emissions by at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008 while pursuing efforts towards phasing them out\nentirely. The initial strategy notes that technological innovation, alternative fuels and/or energy sources for international shipping will be integral to achieve the overall ambition. The\nMEPC 76 adopted amendments to MARPOL Annex VI that will require ships to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. These amendments combine technical and operational\napproaches to improve the energy efficiency of ships, in line with the targets established in the 2018 Initial IMO Strategy for Reducing GHG Emissions from Ships and provide important\nbuilding blocks for future GHG reduction measures. The new measures will require all ships to calculate their EEXI following technical means to improve their energy efficiency and to\nestablish their annual operational carbon intensity indicator (CII) and CII rating. Carbon intensity links the GHG emissions to the transport work of ships. These regulations could cause\nus to incur additional substantial expenses.\nThe EU made a unilateral commitment to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions from its member states by 20% of 1990 levels by 2020. The EU also committed to reduce its\nemissions by 20% under the Kyoto Protocol’s second period from 2013 to 2020. Starting in January 2018, large ships over 5,000 gross tonnage calling at EU ports are required to collect\nand publish data on carbon dioxide emissions and other information. As previously discussed, implementation of regulations relating to the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions from\nthe maritime sector in the European Union’s carbon market is also forthcoming.\nIn the United States, the EPA issued a finding that greenhouse gases endanger the public health and safety, adopted regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions from certain\nmobile sources, and proposed regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions from large stationary sources. However, in March 2017, U.S. President Trump signed an executive order to\nreview and possibly eliminate elements of the EPA’s plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Subsequent rules rolled back standards to control methane and volatile organic compound\nemissions from new oil and gas facilities. However, the Biden administration recently directed the EPA to publish a rules suspending, revising or rescinding certain of these regulations.\nThe EPA and/or individual U.S. states could enact additional environmental regulations that would affect our operations.\nAny passage of climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by the IMO, the EU, the U.S. or other countries where we operate, or any treaty adopted at the international\nlevel to succeed or further implement the Kyoto Protocol or Paris Agreement which further restricts emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to make significant financial\nexpenditures which we cannot predict with certainty at this time. Even in the absence of climate control legislation, our business may be indirectly affected to the extent that climate\nchange results in sea level changes or increases in extreme weather events.\n46\nTable of Contents\nInternational Labour Organization\nThe International Labour Organization is a specialized agency of the UN that has adopted the Maritime Labor Convention 2006 (“MLC 2006”). A Maritime Labor Certificate and a\nDeclaration of Maritime Labor Compliance is required to ensure compliance with the MLC 2006 for all ships that are 500 gross tonnage or over and are either engaged in international\nvoyages or flying the flag of a Member and operating from a port, or between ports, in another country. Our vessels are certified as per MLC 2006 and, we believe, in substantial\ncompliance with the MLC 2006.\nVessel Security Regulations\nSince the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 in the United States, there have been a variety of initiatives intended to enhance vessel security such as the U.S. Maritime\nTransportation Security Act of 2002 (“MTSA”). To implement certain portions of the MTSA, the USCG issued regulations requiring the implementation of certain security requirements\naboard vessels operating in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and at certain ports and facilities, some of which are regulated by the EPA.\nSimilarly, Chapter XI-2 of the SOLAS Convention imposes detailed security obligations on vessels and port authorities and mandates compliance with the International Ship and\nPort Facility Security Code (“the ISPS Code”). The ISPS Code is designed to enhance the security of ports and ships against terrorism. To trade internationally, a vessel must attain an\nInternational Ship Security Certificate (“ISSC”) from a recognized security organization approved by the vessel’s flag state. Ships operating without a valid certificate may be detained,\nexpelled from, or refused entry at port until they obtain an ISSC. The various requirements, some of which are found in the SOLAS Convention, include, for example, onboard installation\nof automatic identification systems to provide a means for the automatic transmission of safety-related information from among similarly equipped ships and shore stations, including\ninformation on a ship’s identity, position, course, speed and navigational status; onboard installation of ship security alert systems, which do not sound on the vessel but only alert the\nauthorities on shore; the development of vessel security plans; ship identification number to be permanently marked on a vessel’s hull; a continuous synopsis record kept onboard\nshowing a vessel’s history including the name of the ship, the state whose flag the ship is entitled to fly, the date on which the ship was registered with that state, the ship’s\nidentification number, the port at which the ship is registered and the name of the registered owner(s) and their registered address; and compliance with flag state security certification\nrequirements.\nThe USCG regulations, intended to align with international maritime security standards, exempt non-U.S. vessels from MTSA vessel security measures, provided such vessels have\non board a valid ISSC that attests to the vessel’s compliance with the SOLAS Convention security requirements and the ISPS Code. Future security measures could have a significant\nfinancial impact on us. We intend to comply with the various security measures addressed by MTSA, the SOLAS Convention and the ISPS Code.\nThe cost of vessel security measures has also been affected by the escalation in the frequency of acts of piracy against ships, notably off the coast of Somalia in the Gulf of Aden\nand off the coast of Nigeria in the Gulf of Guinea. Substantial loss of revenue and other costs may be incurred as a result of detention of a vessel or additional security measures, and the\nrisk of uninsured losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity and operating results. Costs are incurred in taking additional security measures in accordance\nwith Best Management Practices to Deter Piracy, notably those contained in the BMP5 industry standard.\n47\nTable of Contents\nInspection by Classification Societies\nThe hull and machinery of every commercial vessel must be classed by a classification society authorized by its country of registry. The classification society certifies that a vessel\nis safe and seaworthy in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the country of registry of the vessel and SOLAS. Most insurance underwriters make it a condition for\ninsurance coverage and lending that a vessel be certified “in class” by a classification society which is a member of the International Association of Classification Societies, the IACS.\nThe IACS has adopted harmonized Common Structural Rules, or the Rules, which apply to oil tankers contracted for construction on or after July 1, 2015. The Rules attempt to create a\nlevel of consistency between IACS Societies. Our vessels are certified as being “in class” by the applicable IACS Classification Societies (e.g., American Bureau of Shipping, Lloyd’s\nRegister of Shipping, Nippon Kaiji Kyokai, etc.).\nA vessel must undergo annual surveys, intermediate surveys, dry-dockings and special surveys. In lieu of a special survey, a vessel’s machinery may be on a continuous survey\ncycle, under which the machinery would be surveyed periodically over a five-year period. Every vessel is also required to be dry-docked every 30 to 36 months for inspection of the\nunderwater parts of the vessel. If any vessel does not maintain its class and/or fails any annual survey, intermediate survey, dry-docking or special survey, the vessel will be unable to\ncarry cargo between ports and will be unemployable and uninsurable which could cause us to be in violation of certain covenants in our loan agreements. Any such inability to carry\ncargo or to be employed, or any such violation of covenants, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nRisk of Loss and Liability Insurance\nGeneral\nThe operation of any cargo vessel includes risks such as mechanical failure, physical damage, collision, property loss, cargo loss or damage and business interruption due to\npolitical circumstances in foreign countries, piracy incidents, hostilities and labor strikes. In addition, there is always an inherent possibility of marine disaster, including oil spills and\nother environmental events, and the liabilities arising from owning and operating vessels in international trade. We and our pool operators carry insurance coverage as customary in the\nshipping industry. However, not all risks can be insured, specific claims may be rejected, and we might not be always able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates.\nAny of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nHull and Machinery Insurance\nWe procure hull and machinery insurance, protection and indemnity insurance, which includes environmental damage and pollution insurance, war risk insurance, freight and\ndemurrage and defense insurance for all tanker vessels in our fleet. In certain instances where our vessels participating in a pool transit through high-risk areas, the pool operator\narranges for kidnap and ransom loss of hire insurance for a specified duration on our behalf.\nProtection and Indemnity Insurance\nProtection and indemnity insurance is provided by mutual protection and indemnity associations, or “P&I Associations” or clubs, and covers our third-party liabilities in\nconnection with our shipping activities. This includes third-party liability and other related expenses of injury or death of crew, passengers and other third parties, loss or damage to\ncargo, claims arising from collisions with other vessels, damage to other third-party property, pollution arising from oil or other substances, and salvage, towing and other related costs,\nincluding wreck removal.\nOur current protection and indemnity insurance coverage for pollution is $1 billion per vessel per incident. There are 13 P&I Associations that comprise the “International Group”, a\ngroup of P&I Associations that insure approximately 90% of the world’s commercial tonnage and have entered into a pooling agreement to reinsure each association’s liabilities. The\nInternational Group’s website states that the pool provides a mechanism for sharing all claims in excess of $10 million up to, currently, approximately $3.1 billion. As a member of a P&I\nAssociation, which is a member of the International Group, we are subject to calls payable to the associations based on our claim records as well as the claim records of all other members\nof the individual associations and members of the shipping pool of P&I Associations comprising the International Group.\nCompetition\nWe operate in markets that are highly competitive. The process of obtaining new employment for our fleet generally involves intensive screening, and competitive bidding, and\noften extends for several months. We compete for charters on the basis of price, vessel location, size, age and condition of the vessel, as well as on our reputation as an owner and\noperator. Demand for tanker vessels fluctuates in line with the main patterns of trade for Aframax/LR2 and Handysize tanker cargoes and varies according to supply and demand for such\nproducts. Ownership of tanker vessels is highly fragmented.\n48\nTable of Contents\nPermits and Authorizations\nWe are required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain certain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to our vessels. The kinds of permits,\nlicenses and certificates required depend upon several factors, including the commodity transported, the waters in which the vessel operates, the nationality of the vessel’s crew and the\nage of a vessel. We have been able to obtain all permits, licenses and certificates currently required to permit our vessels to operate. Additional laws and regulations, environmental or\notherwise, may be adopted which could limit our ability to do business or increase our cost of doing business.\nSeasonality\nBased on the Toro Subsidiaries’ historical data and industry trends, we expect demand for our Aframax/LR2 and Handysize vessels to exhibit seasonal variations and, as a result,\ncharter and freight rates to fluctuate. These variations may result in quarter-to-quarter volatility in our operating results for our vessels when trading in the spot trip or voyage charter\nmarket or if on period time charter when a new time charter is being entered into. Seasonality in the tanker shipping sector in which we operate could materially affect our operating\nresults and cash flows.\nC. Organizational Structure\nWe were incorporated by Castor in the Republic of the Marshall Islands on July 29, 2022, with our principal executive offices located at 223 Christodoulou Chatzipavlou Street,\nHawaii Royal Gardens, 3036 Limassol, Cyprus.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS\nThe following discussion of the results of our operations and our financial condition should be read in conjunction with the Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements and the\nnotes to those statements included in “Item 18. Financial Statements.” This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. See\n“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many\nfactors, including those set forth in “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors.” For example, the Company’s business could be materially and adversely affected by the risks, or the\npublic perception of the risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic. All dollar amounts referred to in this discussion and analysis are expressed in U.S. dollars except where indicated\notherwise.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe combined carve-out financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 and period ended December 31, 2021 (the “Combined Carve-Out\nFinancial Statements”), included elsewhere in this annual report were derived from the historical consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Castor. These financial\nstatements reflect the combined carve-out historical results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Company in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nHistorically, separate financial statements have not been prepared for the Company, and Castor’s tanker shipping business, which commenced late in the first quarter of 2021.\nAccordingly, no comparative financial information exists for periods ended prior to the period ended December 31, 2021. The Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements are presented\nusing the historical carrying costs of the assets and liabilities of the Toro Subsidiaries from the dates of their incorporation. The Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements are presented\nas if such businesses had been combined throughout the periods presented and operating and other information with respect to our business is presented as of and for the period ended\nDecember 31, 2021 and year ended December 31, 2022. All intercompany accounts and transactions between the entities comprising the Company have been eliminated in the\naccompanying Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements.\nThe combined carve-out statements of comprehensive loss in the Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements reflect expense allocations made to the Company by Castor of its\ngeneral and administrative expenses for items such as audit, legal and consultancy services, and other corporate expenses. The general and administrative expenses incurred by Castor\nhave been allocated on a pro rata basis within General and administrative expenses of the Company based on the proportion of the number of ownership days of the Toro Subsidiaries’\nvessels to the total ownership days of Castor’s fleet.\nManagement believes the assumptions underlying the Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements, including the assumptions regarding allocating general and administrative\nexpenses, to be reasonable reflections of the utilization of services provided to, or the benefit received by, the Company during the periods presented. Nevertheless, the Combined\nCarve-Out Financial Statements may not be indicative of the Company’s future performance and may not include all the actual expenses that would have been incurred by the Company\nas an independent publicly traded company or reflect the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows that would have been reported if the Company had been a\nstandalone entity during the periods presented.\nA. Operating Results\nPrincipal factors impacting our business, results of operations and financial condition\nOur results of operations are affected by numerous factors. The principal factors that have impacted the business during the fiscal periods presented in the following discussion\nand analysis and that are likely to continue to impact our business are the following:\n• The levels of demand and supply of seaborne cargoes and vessel tonnage in the tanker shipping industry and within our Aframax/LR2 and Handysize segments;\n• The cyclical nature of the shipping industry in general and its impact on charter and freight rates and vessel values;\n• The successful implementation of a growth business strategy, including the ability to obtain equity and debt financing at acceptable and attractive terms to fund future capital\nexpenditures and/or to implement this business strategy;\n• The global economic growth outlook and trends;\n• Economic, regulatory, political and governmental conditions that affect shipping and the tanker shipping industry, including international conflict or war (or threatened war),\nsuch as between Russia and Ukraine;\n• The employment and operation of our fleet including the utilization rates of our vessels;\n50\nTable of Contents\n• The ability to successfully employ our vessels at economically attractive rates and the strategic decisions regarding the employment mix of our fleet in the voyage, time charter\nand pool markets, as our charters expire or are otherwise terminated;\n• Management of the operational, financial, general and administrative elements involved in the conduct of our business and ownership of our fleet, including the effective and\nefficient management of our fleet by our manager and its sub-managers, and each of their suppliers;\n• The number of charterers and pool operators who use our services and the performance of their obligations under their agreements, including their ability to make timely\npayments to us;\n• The ability to maintain solid working relationships with our existing charterers and pool operators and our ability to increase the number of our charterers through the\ndevelopment of new working relationships;\n• The vetting approvals by oil majors of our manager and/or sub-managers for the management of our tanker vessels;\n• Dry-docking and special survey costs and duration, both expected and unexpected;\n• Our borrowing levels and the finance costs related to our outstanding debt as well as our compliance with our debt covenants;\n• Management of our financial resources, including banking relationships and of the relationships with our various stakeholders; and\n• Major outbreaks of diseases (such as COVID-19) and governmental responses thereto; and\n• The level of any distribution on all classes of our shares.\nThese factors are volatile and in certain cases may not be within our control. Accordingly, past performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance, and it is difficult to\npredict future performance with any degree of certainty.\nHire Rates and the Cyclical Nature of the Industry\nOne of the factors that impacts our profitability is the hire, freight and pool rates at which we are able to fix our vessels. The shipping industry is cyclical with attendant volatility in\nrates and, as a result, profitability. The tanker shipping sector has been characterized by long and short periods of imbalances between supply and demand, causing charter rates to be\nvolatile.\nThe degree of charter rate volatility among different types of tanker vessels has varied widely, and charter rates for these vessels have also varied significantly in recent years.\nFluctuations in charter rates result from changes in the supply and demand for vessel capacity and changes in the supply and demand for the crude oil and refined petroleum products\ncarried by oceangoing vessels internationally. The factors and the nature, timing, direction and degree of changes in industry conditions affecting the supply and demand for vessels are\nunpredictable to a great extent and outside our control.\nOur vessel deployment strategy seeks to maximize revenues throughout industry cycles while maintaining cash flow stability and foreseeability. Our gross revenues on a\nstandalone basis for the year ended December 31, 2022 consisted predominantly of hire earned under voyage charter contracts, as well as revenue under time charter contracts and pool\nrevenues. For a description of these chartering arrangements, refer to “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Chartering of Our Fleet”.\nThe tanker shipping industry has also varied significantly. The spot tanker market performed strongly in 2022, particularly after the first quarter and overall 2022 was one of the best\nyears for spot crude tanker trades since 2000. Deadweight carrying capacity of the tanker fleet increased by approximately 3.4% in 2022, as compared to 1.6% in 2021, while demand for\ncrude oil and products is expected to continue at a high pace. During 2022, the spot tanker market improved after an initial period of increased volatility following the invasion of Ukraine\nby Russia and the subsequent imposition of sanctions against Russia. However, the spot tanker market remains volatile and subject to uncertainty due to such invasion and its ongoing\neffects on global demand for and supply of crude oil and refined petroleum products. Volatility in charter rates in the tanker market may affect the value of tanker vessels, which\noccasionally follow the trends of tanker charter rates, and similarly affects our earnings, cash flows and liquidity.\nOur future gross revenues may be affected by the commercial strategy including the decisions regarding the employment mix of our fleet among time and voyage charters and pool\narrangements. See Note 9 to our Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements included elsewhere in this annual report for a breakdown of revenues per category.\n51\nTable of Contents\nEmployment and operation of our fleet\nAnother factor that impacts our profitability is the employment and operation of our fleet. The profitable employment of our fleet is highly dependent on the levels of demand and\nsupply in the tanker shipping industry, our commercial strategy including the decisions regarding the employment mix of our fleet among time and voyage charters and pool\narrangements, as well as our manager’s and sub-managers’ ability to leverage our relationships with existing or potential customers. As a new entrant to the tankers business, our\ncustomer base is currently concentrated to a small number of charterers and pool manager. In the year ended December 31, 2022, 41% of our revenues were earned on pool arrangements\nentered into with three pool managers. The breadth of our customer base has and will continue to impact the profitability of our business. Further, the effective operation of our fleet\nmainly requires regular maintenance and repair, effective crew selection and training, ongoing supply of our fleet with the spares and the stores that it requires, contingency response\nplanning, auditing of our vessels’ onboard safety procedures, arrangements for our vessels’ insurance, chartering of the vessels, training of onboard and on shore personnel with\nrespect to the vessels’ security and security response plans (ISPS), obtaining of ISM certifications, compliance with environmental regulations and standards and performing the\nnecessary audit for the vessels within the year of taking over a vessel and the ongoing performance monitoring of the vessels.\nFinancial, general and administrative management\nThe management of financial, general and administrative elements involved in the conduct of our business and ownership of our vessels requires us to manage our financial\nresources, which includes managing banking relationships, administrating our bank accounts, managing our accounting system, records and financial reporting, monitoring and ensuring\ncompliance with the legal and regulatory requirements affecting our business and assets and managing our relationships with our service providers and customers.\nImportant Measures and Definitions for Analyzing Results of Operations\nOur management uses the following metrics to evaluate our operating results, including our operating results at the segment level, and to allocate capital accordingly:\nTotal vessel revenues. Total vessel revenues are generated from voyage charters, time charters and pool arrangements. Total vessel revenues are affected by the number of vessels\nin our fleet, hire and freight rates and the number of days a vessel operates which, in turn, are affected by several factors, including the amount of time that we spend positioning our\nvessels, the amount of time that our vessels spend in dry-dock undergoing repairs, maintenance and upgrade work, the age, condition and specifications of our vessels, and levels of\nsupply and demand in the seaborne transportation market. Total vessel revenues are also affected by our commercial strategy related to the employment mix of our fleet between vessels\non time charters, vessels operating on voyage charters and vessels in pools.\nWe measure revenues in each segment for three separate activities: (i) time charter revenues, (ii) voyage charter revenues, and (iii) pool revenues. For a breakdown of vessel\nrevenues for the period ended December 31, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2022, please refer to Note 12 to our Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements included elsewhere in\nthis annual report. For a description of these types of chartering arrangements, refer to “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Chartering of Our Fleet”.\nVoyage expenses. Our voyage expenses primarily consist of bunker expenses, port and canal expenses and brokerage commissions paid in connection with the chartering of our\nvessels. Voyage expenses are incurred primarily during voyage charters or when the vessel is repositioning or unemployed. Bunker expenses, port and canal dues increase in periods\nduring which vessels are employed on voyage charters because these expenses are in this case borne by us. Under a time charter, the charterer pays substantially all the vessel voyage\nrelated expenses. Under pooling arrangements, voyage expenses are borne by the pool operator. Gain/loss on bunkers may also arise where the cost of the bunker fuel sold to the new\ncharterer is greater or less than the cost of the bunker fuel acquired.\nOperating expenses. We are responsible for vessel operating costs, which include crewing, expenses for repairs and maintenance, the cost of insurance, tonnage taxes, the cost of\nspares and consumable stores, lubricating oils costs, communication expenses, and ship management fees. Expenses for repairs and maintenance tend to fluctuate from period to period\nbecause most repairs and maintenance typically occur during periodic drydocking. Our ability to control our vessels’ operating expenses also affects our financial results. Daily vessel\noperating expenses are calculated by dividing fleet operating expenses by the Ownership days for the relevant period.\nOff-hire. Off-hire is the period our fleet is unable to perform the services for which it is required under a charter for reasons such as scheduled repairs, vessel upgrades, dry-\ndockings or special or intermediate surveys or other unforeseen events.\nDry-docking/Special Surveys. We periodically dry-dock and/or perform special surveys on our fleet for inspection, repairs and maintenance and any modifications to comply with\nindustry certification or governmental requirements. Our ability to control our dry-docking and special survey expenses and our ability to complete our scheduled dry-dockings and/or\nspecial surveys on time also affects our financial results. Dry-docking and special survey costs are accounted for under the deferral method whereby the actual costs incurred are\ndeferred and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the period through the date the next survey is scheduled to become due.\nOwnership Days. Ownership Days are the total number of calendar days in a period during which we owned a vessel. Ownership Days are an indicator of the size of our fleet over a\nperiod and determine both the level of revenues and expenses recorded during that specific period.\n52\nTable of Contents\nAvailable Days. Available Days are the Ownership Days in a period less the aggregate number of days our vessels are off-hire due to scheduled repairs, dry-dockings or special or\nintermediate surveys. The shipping industry uses Available Days to measure the aggregate number of days in a period during which vessels are available to generate revenues. Our\ncalculation of Available Days may not be comparable to that reported by other companies.\nOperating Days. Operating Days are the Available Days in a period after subtracting unscheduled off-hire and idle days.\nFleet Utilization. Fleet Utilization is calculated by dividing the Operating Days during a period by the number of Available Days during that period. Fleet Utilization is used to\nmeasure a company’s ability to efficiently find suitable employment for its vessels and minimize the number of days that its vessels are off-hire for reasons such as major repairs, vessel\nupgrades, dry-dockings or special or intermediate surveys and other unforeseen events.\nDaily Time Charter Equivalent (“TCE”) Rate. The Daily Time Charter Equivalent Rate (“Daily TCE Rate”), is a measure of the average daily revenue performance of a vessel. The\nDaily TCE Rate is not a measure of financial performance under U.S. GAAP (i.e., it is a non-GAAP measure) and should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of financial\nperformance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We calculate Daily TCE Rate by dividing total revenues (time charter and/or voyage charter revenues, and/or pool revenues, net\nof charterers’ commissions), less voyage expenses, by the number of Available Days during that period. Under a time charter, the charterer pays substantially all the vessel voyage\nrelated expenses. However, we may incur voyage related expenses when positioning or repositioning vessels before or after the period of a time or other charter, during periods of\ncommercial waiting time or while off-hire during dry-docking or due to other unforeseen circumstances. Under voyage charters, the majority of voyage expenses are generally borne by\nus whereas for vessels in a pool, such expenses are borne by the pool operator. The Daily TCE Rate is a standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare\nperiod-to-period changes in a company’s performance and, management believes that the Daily TCE Rate provides meaningful information to our investors since it compares daily net\nearnings generated by our vessels irrespective of the mix of charter types (i.e., time charter, voyage charter or other) under which our vessels are employed between the periods while it\nfurther assists our management in making decisions regarding the deployment and use of our vessels and in evaluating our financial performance. Our calculation of the Daily TCE\nRates may not be comparable to that reported by other companies. See below for a reconciliation of Daily TCE rate to Vessel revenue, net, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP\nmeasure.\nDaily vessel operating expenses. Daily vessel operating expenses are calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses for the relevant period by the Ownership Days for such\nperiod.\nEBITDA. EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, does not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income,\ncash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We define EBITDA as earnings before interest and finance\ncosts (if any), net of interest income, taxes (when incurred), depreciation and amortization of deferred dry-docking costs. EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by\nmanagement and external users of financial statements to assess our operating performance. We believe that EBITDA assists our management by providing useful information that\nincreases the comparability of our operating performance from period to period and against the operating performance of other companies in our industry that provide EBITDA\ninformation. This increased comparability is achieved by excluding the potentially disparate effects between periods or companies of interest, other financial items, depreciation and\namortization and taxes, which items are affected by various and possibly changing financing methods, capital structure and historical cost basis and which items may significantly affect\nnet income between periods. We believe that including EBITDA as a measure of operating performance benefits investors in (a) selecting between investing in us and other investment\nalternatives and (b) monitoring our ongoing financial and operational strength. EBITDA as presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. See\nbelow for a reconciliation of EBITDA to Net Income/(Loss), the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure.\nThe following tables reconcile our combined and per segment Daily TCE Rate and our combined EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and present operational\nmetrics of the Company on a combined basis and per operating segment for the periods presented (amounts in U.S. dollars, except for utilization and days).\n53\nTable of Contents\nReconciliation of Daily TCE Rate to Total vessel revenues — Combined\nPeriod ended Year ended\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2021 2022\nTotal vessel revenues $ 29,264,268 $ 111,885,865\nVoyage expenses - including commissions from related party (11,059,518) (29,319,414)\nTCE revenues $ 18,204,750 $ 82,566,451\nAvailable Days 1,814 3,037\nDaily TCE Rate $ 10,036 $ 27,187\nReconciliation of Daily TCE Rate to Total vessel revenues — Aframax/LR2 Tanker Segment\nPeriod ended Year ended\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2021 2022\nTotal vessel revenues $ 26,559,413 $ 96,248,212\nVoyage expenses – including commissions from related party (11,003,925) (29,100,348)\nTCE revenues $ 15,555,488 $ 67,147,864\nAvailable Days 1,446 2,307\nDaily TCE Rate $ 10,758 $ 29,106\nReconciliation of Daily TCE Rate to Total vessel revenues — Handysize Tanker Segment\nPeriod ended Year ended\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2021 2022\nTotal vessel revenues $ 2,704,855 $ 15,637,653\nVoyage expenses - including commissions from related party (55,593) (219,066)\nTCE revenues $ 2,649,262 $ 15,418,587\nAvailable Days 368 730\nDaily TCE Rate $ 7,199 $ 21,121\nOperational Metrics Combined\nPeriod ended Year ended\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2021 2022\nDaily vessel operating expenses $ 6,671 $ 6,969\nOwnership Days 1,853 3,115\nAvailable Days 1,814 3,037\nOperating Days 1,796 3,028\nFleet Utilization 99% 100%\nDaily TCE Rate $ 10,036 $ 27,187\nEBITDA $ 3,115,260 $ 58,881,032\n54\nTable of Contents\nOperational Metrics — Aframax/LR2 Tanker Segment\nPeriod ended Year ended\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2021 2022\nDaily vessel operating expenses $ 6,761 $ 7,290\nOwnership Days 1,446 2,385\nAvailable Days 1,446 2,307\nOperating Days 1,428 2,298\nFleet Utilization 99% 100%\nDaily TCE Rate $ 10,758 $ 29,106\nOperational Metrics — Handysize Tanker Segment\nPeriod ended Year ended\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2021 2022\nDaily vessel operating expenses $ 6,352 $ 5,921\nOwnership Days 407 730\nAvailable Days 368 730\nOperating Days 368 730\nFleet Utilization 100% 100%\nDaily TCE Rate $ 7,199 $ 21,121\nReconciliation of EBITDA to Net (loss)/income – Combined\nPeriod ended Year ended\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2021 2022\nNet (loss)/income $ (1,430,391) 49,926,415\nDepreciation and amortization 3,834,117 7,294,476\nInterest and finance costs, net(1) 505,360 699,960\nU.S. source income taxes 206,174 960,181\nEBITDA $ 3,115,260 $ 58,881,032\n(1) Includes interest and finance costs and interest income, if any.\n55\nTable of Contents\nCombined Results of Operations\nYear ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the period ended December 31, 2021\nPeriod ended Year ended Change -\nDecember 31, 2021 December 31, 2022 Amount\nTotal vessel revenues $ 29,264,268 $ 111,885,865 $ 82,621,597\nExpenses:\nVoyage expenses (including commissions to related party) (11,059,518) (29,319,414) (18,259,896)\nVessel operating expenses (12,361,871) (21,708,290) (9,346,419)\nManagement fees to related parties (1,853,850) (2,833,500) (979,650)\nDepreciation and amortization (3,834,117) (7,294,476) (3,460,359)\nGeneral and administrative expenses(1) (889,096) (2,093,347) (1,204,251)\nProvision for doubtful accounts — (266,732) (266,732)\nGain on sale of vessel — 3,222,631 3,222,631\nOperating (loss)/income (734,184) 51,592,737 52,326,921\nInterest and finance costs, net(2) (505,360) (699,960) (194,600)\nForeign exchange gains/(losses) 15,327 (6,181) (21,508)\nUS source income taxes (206,174) (960,181) (754,007)\nNet (loss)/income and comprehensive (loss)/income $ (1,430,391) $ 49,926,415 $ 51,356,806\n(1) Includes $326,642 and $624,087 charged by Castor Ships in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively, under management\narrangements between Castor Ships and Castor. The management arrangements were amended by mutual consent with effect from July 1, 2022. See Note 3 to the Combined Carve-\nOut Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this annual report.\n(2) Includes interest and finance costs, net of interest income, if any.\nTotal vessel revenues\nTotal vessel revenues, net of charterers’ commissions, for our tanker fleet increased to $111.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, from $29.3 million in the period ended\nDecember 31, 2021. This increase was largely driven by (i) the increase in our Available Days to 3,037 days in the year ended December 31, 2022, from 1,814 days in the period ended\nDecember 31, 2021, and (ii) the improved Aframax/LR2 and Handysize tanker markets, as compared to the corresponding period in 2021.\nVoyage expenses\nVoyage expenses for our tanker fleet increased by $18.2 million, to $29.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, from $11.1 million in the period ended December 31, 2021. This\nincrease in voyage expenses is mainly associated with the increase in the Ownership Days of our tanker vessels, to 3,115 days in the year ended December 31, 2022 from 1,853 days in the\nperiod ended December 31, 2021, and their associated commercial activities. During the year ended December 31, 2022, our Aframax/LR2 segment operated predominantly under voyage\ncharters, resulting in increased bunker consumption costs (affected also by the significant rise in bunker fuel costs as compared with the corresponding period in 2021) and increased\nport expenses. Increased brokerage commission expenses, corresponding to the increase in vessel revenues discussed above, also contributed to the increase in voyage expenses.\n56\nTable of Contents\nVessel Operating Expenses\nThe increase in operating expenses by $9.3 million, to $21.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, from $12.4 million in the period ended December 31, 2021, mainly reflects the\nincrease in the Ownership Days of our fleet to 3,115 in the year ended December 31, 2022, from 1,853 in the corresponding period in 2021.\nManagement Fees\nManagement fees for our tanker fleet in the year ended December 31, 2022, amounted to $2.8 million, whereas, in the period ended December 31, 2021, management fees totaled $1.9\nmillion. This increase in management fees is due to the increase in the total number of Ownership Days of our fleet for which our managers charged us a daily management fee as well as\nthe increased management fees following our entry into the Amended and Restated Master Management Agreement with effect from July 1, 2022.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation expenses for our tanker fleet increased to $6.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, from $3.6 million in the period ended December 31, 2021 as a result of the\nincrease in the Ownership Days of our fleet. Dry-dock and special survey amortization charges amounted to $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to a charge of\n$0.2 million in the period ended December 31, 2021. This variation in dry-dock amortization charges primarily resulted from the increase in dry-dock amortization days from 175 days\nduring the period ended December 31, 2021, to 563 dry-dock amortization days in the year ended December 31, 2022.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses in the year ended December 31, 2022, amounted to $2.1 million, whereas, in the period ended December 31, 2021, general and administrative\nexpenses totaled $0.9 million and reflect expense allocations made to the Company by Castor based on the proportion of the number of Ownership Days of the tanker fleet vessels to the\ntotal Ownership Days of Castor’s fleet. These expenses consisted mainly of administration costs charged by Castor Ships, investor relations, legal, audit and consultancy fees.\nGain on sale of vessel\nOn July 15, 2022, we concluded the sale of the M/T Wonder Arcturus which we sold, pursuant to an agreement dated May 9, 2022, for a cash consideration of $13.15 million. The sale\nresulted in net proceeds to the Company of $12.6 million and the Company recording a net sale gain of $3.2 million.\nInterest and finance costs, net\nInterest and finance costs, net amounted to $0.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, whereas, in the period ended December 31, 2021, interest and finance costs, net\namounted to $0.5 million. This variation mainly derives from (i) the higher level of weighted average outstanding debt during the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared with the\nweighted average debt that was outstanding during the period ended December 31, 2021 and (ii) the increase of the weighted average interest rate on our long-term debt from 3.3% in the\nperiod ended December 31, 2021 to 4.9% in the year ended December 31, 2022.\nYear ended December 31, 2022, compared to the period ended December 31, 2021 — Aframax/LR2 Tanker Segment\nPeriod ended Year ended Change -\nDecember 31, 2021 December 31, 2022 amount\nTotal vessel revenues $ 26,559,413 $ 9​ 6,248,212 $ 69,688,799\nExpenses:\nVoyage expenses (including commissions to related party) (11,003,925) (29,100,348) (18,096,423)\nVessel operating expenses (9,776,724) (17,386,009) (7,609,285)\nManagement fees to related parties (1,433,950) (2,167,000) (733,050)\nDepreciation and amortization (3,087,764) (5,889,352) (2,801,588)\nProvision for doubtful accounts — (266,732) (266,732)\nGain on sale of vessel — 3,222,631 3,222,631\nSegment Operating income $ 1​ ,257,050 $ 44,661,402 $ 43,404,352\n57\nTable of Contents\nTotal vessel revenues\nVessel revenues for our Aframax/LR2 tanker fleet amounted to $96.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, whereas, in the period ended December 31, 2021, vessel revenues\namounted to $26.6 million. This variation is mainly due to (i) the increased revenues our Aframax/LR2 tanker fleet earned in the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the\ncorresponding period in 2021, as a result of an improved Aframax/LR2 tanker market, and (ii) the increase in our Available Days to 2,307 days in the year ended December 31, 2022, from\n1,446 days in the period ended December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2022, our Aframax/LR2 tanker fleet earned on average a Daily TCE Rate of $29,106, compared to\nan average Daily TCE Rate of $10,758 earned during the period ended December 31, 2021.\nVoyage Expenses\nVoyage expenses for our Aframax/LR2 tanker fleet amounted to $29.1 million and $11.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, and the period ended December 31, 2021,\nrespectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we operated mostly under voyage charters, under which we bear voyage expenses such as bunkers and port and canal dues,\nwhereas, in the corresponding period in 2021 our Aframax/LR2 tanker fleet operated mostly under time charters under which these expenses are generally borne by our charterers. Voyage\nexpenses for our Aframax/LR2 fleet during the year ended December 31, 2022, consisted primarily of bunker consumption expenses amounting to $20.4 million (which were also affected\nby the increase of bunker fuel costs), port expenses amounting to $5.8 million and brokerage commissions, both third-party and related party, amounting to $2.9 million.\nVessel Operating Expenses\nThe increase in operating expenses by $7.6 million, to $17.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, from $9.8 million in the period ended December 31, 2021, mainly reflects the\nincrease in the Ownership Days of our Aframax/LR2 vessels in our fleet to 2,385 days in the year ended December 31, 2022, from 1,446 days in the corresponding period in 2021.\nManagement Fees\nManagement fees for our Aframax/LR2 tanker fleet in the year ended December 31, 2022, amounted to $2.2 million, whereas, in the corresponding period of 2021, management fees\ntotaled $1.4 million. This increase in management fees is due to the increase in the total number of Ownership Days of the Aframax/LR2 tanker fleet for which our managers charged us a\ndaily management fee as well as the increased management fees following our entry into the Amended and Restated Master Management Agreement.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation expenses for our Aframax/LR2 tanker fleet increased to $5.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, from $3.1 million in the period ended December 31, 2021 as a\nresult of the increase in the Ownership Days of our Aframax/LR2 tanker fleet. Dry-dock and special survey amortization charges in the year ended December 31, 2022 of $0.4 million relate\nto the amortization of the M/T Wonder Musica in this period, as the vessel underwent its scheduled dry-docking repairs during the second quarter of 2022. No such charges were\nincurred in the period ended December 31, 2021.\n58\nTable of Contents\nGain on sale of vessel\nRefer to discussion under “Combined Results of Operations — Gain on sale of vessel” above for details on the sale of the M/T Wonder Arcturus.\nYear ended December 31, 2022, compared to the period ended December 31, 2021 — Handysize Tanker Segment\nPeriod ended Year ended Change -\nDecember 31, 2021 December 31, 2022 Amount\nTotal vessel revenues $ 2,704,855 $​ 15,637,653 $ 12,932,798\nExpenses:\nVoyage expenses (including commissions to related party) (55,593) (219,066) (163,473)\nVessel operating expenses (2,585,147) (4,322,281) (1,737,134)\nManagement fees to related parties (419,900) (666,500) (246,600)\nDepreciation and amortization (746,353) (1,405,124) (658,771)\nSegment Operating (loss)/income $ (1,102,138) $​ 9,024,682 $ 10,126,820\nTotal Vessel revenues\nVessel revenues for our Handysize tanker fleet amounted to $15.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, whereas, in the period ended December 31, 2021, vessel revenues\namounted to $2.7 million. The increase is mainly due to (i) the increase in the segment’s Available Days from 368 days in the period ended December 31, 2021 to 730 days in the year\nended December 31, 2022, and (ii) the improvement in the Handysize tanker market, reflected in the increase in the Handysize fleet average Daily TCE Rate from $7,199 in the period ended\nDecember 31, 2021 to $21,121 in the year ended December 31, 2022.\nVoyage Expenses\nVoyage expenses for our Handysize tanker fleet amounted to $0.2 million and $0.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, and the period ended December 31, 2021, respectively.\nThis increase is mainly due to the increased brokerage commission expenses, corresponding to the increase in vessel revenues as discussed above.\nVessel Operating Expenses\nThe increase in operating expenses for our Handysize tanker fleet by $1.7 million, to $4.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, from $2.6 million in the corresponding period\nof 2021, mainly reflects the increase in the Ownership Days of our Handysize fleet to 730 days in the year ended December 31, 2022, up from 407 days in the period ended December 31,\n2021.\nManagement Fees\nManagement fees for our Handysize tanker fleet in the year ended December 31, 2022, amounted to $0.7 million, whereas, in the period ended December 31, 2021, management fees\ntotaled $0.4 million. This increase in management fees is mainly due to the increase in the Ownership Days of our Handysize tanker fleet for which our managers charged us a daily\nmanagement fee as well as the increased management fees following our entry into the Amended and Restated Master Management Agreement.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation expenses for our Handysize tanker fleet increased to $1.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, from $0.6 in the period ended December 31, 2021 as a result of\nthe increase in the Ownership Days of our Handysize tanker fleet. Dry-dock amortization charges in the year ended December 31, 2022, and the period ended December 31, 2021\namounted to $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively. In the period ended December 31, 2021, dry-dock amortization charges relate to the M/T Wonder Mimosa which underwent its\nscheduled dry-dock and special survey from late May 2021 and up to early July 2021.\nImplications of Being an Emerging Growth Company\nWe are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified\nreduced public company reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:\n• an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement of management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the emerging growth company’s internal controls over financial\nreporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley; and\n• an exemption from compliance with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, requiring mandatory audit firm rotation\nor a supplement to the auditor’s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and financial statements.\nWe may choose to take advantage of some or all of these reduced reporting requirements. We may take advantage of these provisions until the last day of the fiscal year following\nthe fifth anniversary of the date we first sell our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or such earlier time that we are no\nlonger an emerging growth company. We will cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $1.235 billion in “total annual gross revenues” during our most recently\ncompleted fiscal year, if we become a “large accelerated filer” with a public float of more than $700 million, as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal\nquarter or as of any date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt over the three-year period prior to such date. For as long as we take advantage of the\nreduced reporting obligations, the information that we provide shareholders may be different from information provided by other public companies.\n59\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised\naccounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private\ncompanies. See “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Common Shares—We are an ‘emerging growth company’ and we cannot be certain if the reduced\nrequirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our securities less attractive to investors.” We have irrevocably elected to opt out of such extended transition\nperiod.\nB. Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe operate in a capital-intensive industry, and we expect to finance the purchase of additional vessels and other capital expenditures through a combination of cash from\noperations, proceeds from equity offerings, and borrowings from debt transactions. Our liquidity requirements relate to servicing the principal and interest on our debt, funding capital\nexpenditures and working capital (which includes maintaining the quality of our vessels and complying with international shipping standards and environmental laws and regulations)\nand maintaining cash reserves for the purpose of satisfying certain minimum liquidity restrictions contained in our credit facility. In accordance with our business strategy, other liquidity\nneeds may relate to funding potential investments in new vessels and maintaining cash reserves against fluctuations in operating cash flows. Our funding and treasury activities are\nintended to maximize investment returns while maintaining appropriate liquidity.\nTwo of our subsidiaries, Rocket Shipping Co. and Gamora Shipping Co., have entered into an $18.0 million term loan facility. In connection with the Spin Off, we have amended this\nfacility and replaced Castor as guarantor for it. See “—Our Borrowing Activities” below. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $41.8\nmillion and $5.0 million, respectively (both of which exclude $0.7 million of cash restricted under our debt agreement). Cash and cash equivalents are primarily held in U.S. dollars.\nWorking capital is equal to current assets minus current liabilities. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 we had a working capital surplus of $48.2 million and $5.7 million,\nrespectively.\nWe believe that our current sources of funds and those that we anticipate to internally generate for a period of at least the next twelve months from the date of this annual report,\nwill be sufficient to fund the operations of our fleet, meet our normal working capital requirements and service the principal and interest on our debt for that period.\nAs noted above, acquisitions may require additional equity issuances, which may dilute our common shareholders if issued at lower prices than the price they acquired their shares,\nor debt issuances (with amortization payments), both of which could lower our available cash. See “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Company—We\nmay not be able to execute our growth strategy and we may not realize the benefits we expect from acquisitions or other strategic transactions.”\nFor a discussion of our management agreements with our related-party manager and relevant fees charged, see “Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—B.\nRelated Party Transactions.”\nCapital Expenditures\nFrom time to time, we make capital expenditures in connection with vessel acquisitions and vessels upgrades and improvements (either for the purpose of meeting regulatory or\nlegal requirements or for the purpose of complying with requirements imposed by classification societies). We currently finance our capital expenditures using cash from operations and\ndebt issuances and expect to continue to do so in the future, though in the future, we may also utilize, subject to market conditions, equity issuances as a source of funding. As of\nDecember 31, 2022 and as of the date of this annual report, we did not have any commitments for capital expenditures related to vessel acquisitions.\nWe had originally entered into contracts to purchase and install BWTS on five of our tankers, one of which, the M/T Wonder Arcturus, was sold on May 9, 2022, and delivered to its\nnew owners on July 15, 2022, following which the BWTS installation contract on such vessel was cancelled. As of the date of this annual report, we have completed and put into use the\nBWTS installation on two of the four remaining contracted tankers, the M/T Wonder Mimosa in July 2021 and M/T Wonder Formosa in February 2023. The contracted BWTS system\ninstallations on the other two vessels are expected to be concluded during 2024. As of December 31, 2022, it was estimated that the remaining contractual obligations related to these\npurchases, excluding installation costs, would be on aggregate approximately €1.2 million (or $1.3 million on the basis of a Euro/US Dollar exchange rate of €1.0000/$1.06749 as of\nDecember 31, 2022), all of which are due in 2024 and nothing due in 2023 for the February 2023 installation.\nA failure to fulfill our capital expenditure commitments generally results in a forfeiture of advances paid with respect to the contracted acquisitions and a write-off of capitalized\nexpenses. In addition, we may also be liable for other damages for breach of contract(s). Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and\noperating results.\nEquity Transactions\nAs of the date of this annual report, we have not raised capital through equity financing. In the future, we may utilize equity financing to fund our capital requirements.\n60\nTable of Contents\nOur Borrowing Activities\nAs of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, $13.3 million and $16.3 million, respectively, of gross indebtedness was outstanding under our $18.0 million term loan facility\nattributable to our Aframax/LR2 segment. Of the December 31, 2022, outstanding amount, $2.7 million matures in the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2023, of which $0.7 million\nhas been repaid as of the date of this annual report.\nBorrowing commitments, as of December 31, 2022, relating to debt and interest repayments under our credit facility, amounted to $15.0 million, of which $3.6 million matures in less\nthan one year. The calculation of interest payments has been made assuming interest rates based on the LIBOR specific to our credit facility as of December 31, 2022, and our applicable\nmargin rate. In connection with and effective upon the Spin Off, the interest on our credit facility is based on SOFR.\nAs of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, we also were in compliance with all the financial and liquidity covenants contained in this debt agreement.\n$18.0 Million Term Loan Facility\nThe following is a summary of our $18.0 million term loan facility, as amended, entered into by two of our wholly owned tanker vessel ship-owning subsidiaries, Rocket Shipping Co.\nand Gamora Shipping Co., and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the relevant agreement, which is attached as an exhibit hereto and incorporated by reference into\nthis annual report on Form 20-F.\nOn April 27, 2021, Rocket Shipping Co. and Gamora Shipping Co., entered into a $18.0 million term loan facility with Alpha Bank S.A. The facility was drawn down in two tranches\non May 7, 2021. This facility has a term of four years from the drawdown date, bears interest at a 3.20% margin over LIBOR (prior to the Spin Off) or SOFR (from and after the Spin Off)\nper annum and is repayable in (a) 16 quarterly instalments (installments 1 to 4 in the amount of $850,000 and installments 5 to 16 in the amount of $675,000) and (b) a balloon installment in\nthe amount of $6.5 million payable at maturity.\nThe above facility is secured by a first preferred mortgage and first priority general assignment covering earnings, insurances and requisition compensation over the vessels owned\nby the borrowers (the M/T Wonder Sirius and the M/T Wonder Polaris), an earnings account pledge, shares security deed relating to the shares of the vessels’ owning subsidiaries,\nmanager’s undertakings and was initially guaranteed by Castor. We have amended the $18.0 million term loan facility and replaced Castor as Guarantor, such that Castor no longer has\nany obligations under such facility. The facility also contains certain new customary minimum liquidity restrictions and financial covenants that require the borrowers to maintain (i) a\ncertain amount of minimum level of cash and cash equivalents, including a minimum level of cash for each vessel that is pledged in favor of the lender, (ii) a leverage ratio (which is\ncalculated as the ratio of total bank debt less cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, divided by the aggregate market value of all fleet vessels) below a specified maximum and\n(iii) a minimum net worth ratio (which is calculated as the difference between the aggregate value of the fleet vessels adjusted for market values, and total bank debt). For further\ninformation on our $18.0 million term loan facility, see Note 6 to the Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements included elsewhere in this annual report.\nCash Flows\nYear ended December 31, 2022, compared to the period ended December 31, 2021\nThe following table summarizes our net cash flows provided by/(used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 and the period ended\nDecember 31, 2021. For further details, please refer to the Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements included elsewhere in this annual report.\nFor the period For the Year\nended ended\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2021 2022\nNet cash (used in)/provided by operating activities (4,415,044) 41,538,209\nNet cash (used in)/provided by investing activities (111,288,060) 11,788,681\nNet cash provided by/(used in) financing activities 121,366,515 (16,510,675)\n61\nTable of Contents\nOperating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $41.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, consisting of net income of $49.9 million, non-cash\nadjustments related to depreciation and amortization of $7.4 million, gain on sale of the M/T Wonder Arcturus of $3.2 million, provision for doubtful accounts of $0.3 million and a net\nincrease of $10.9 million in working capital. For the period ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in operating activities amounted to $4.4 million, consisting of net loss of $1.4 million,\nnon-cash adjustments related to depreciation and amortization of $3.9 million and a net increase of $5.9 million in working capital. The $45.9 million increase in net cash from operating\nactivities in the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared with the period ended December 31, 2021 reflects mainly the increase in net income which was largely driven by the increase\nin ownership days and the improvement of the charter rates earned by the Aframax/LR2 and Handysize tanker vessels of our fleet.\nInvesting Activities: Net cash provided by investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2022 amounting to $11.8 million mainly reflect the net proceeds from the sale of the\nM/T Wonder Arcturus amounting to $12.6 million and the payments in the current period of initial vessel and BWTS installation expenses amounting to $0.8 million. Net cash used in\ninvesting activities amounting to $111.3 million for the period ended December 31, 2021, mainly reflects the cash outflows associated with (i) the acquisition of seven of our Aframax/LR2\ntanker vessels and our two Handysize tanker vessels and (ii) the BWTS installation performed during the second quarter and concluded early in the third quarter of 2021 on the M/T\nWonder Mimosa.\nFinancing Activities: Net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 amounting to $16.5 million, relates to (i) a net decrease in net parent investment\namounting to $13.4 million, and (ii) $3.1 million of period scheduled principal repayments in connection with our $18.0 million term loan facility. Net cash provided by financing activities\nduring the period ended December 31, 2021 amounting to $121.4 million, relates to (i) net contributions from Castor amounting to $105.5 million used for the acquisition of vessels (as\ndiscussed above and further under Note 6 of our Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements included elsewhere in this annual report) and (ii) the $17.6 million net loan proceeds, as offset\nby (iii) $1.7 million of period scheduled principal repayments in connection with our $18.0 million term loan facility.\nNet cash contributions from Castor to Toro are accounted for through the ‘Net parent investment account’. Accordingly, none of Castor’s cash, cash equivalents or debt at the\ncorporate level have been assigned to Toro in the Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements.\nC. Research and Development, Patents and Licenses, Etc.\nNot applicable.\nD. Trend Information\nOur results of operations depend primarily on the charter rates that we are able to realize. Charter hire rates paid for tanker vessels are primarily a function of the underlying balance\nbetween vessel supply and demand. For a discussion regarding the market performance, please see “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—A. Operating Results—\nCyclical Nature of the Industry.”\nThere can be no assurance as to how long charter rates will remain at their current levels or whether they will improve or deteriorate and, if so, when and to what degree. That may\nhave a material adverse effect on our future growth potential and our profitability. Also, the Company’s business could be adversely affected by the risks, or the public perception of the\nrisks and travel restrictions related to the resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the Company’s business could be adversely affected by the risks related to the conflict in\nUkraine and the severe worsening of Russia’s relations with Western economies that has created significant uncertainty in global markets, including increased volatility in the prices of\ncrude oil and certain refined petroleum products and shifts in the trading patterns for such products which may continue into the future. The Company is unable to reasonably predict\nthe estimated length or severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine on future operating results.\nFurthermore, many economies worldwide have experienced inflationary pressures. In particular, the global price of oil was highly volatile during 2022. For further information, see\n“Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—The Company is exposed to fluctuating demand and supply for maritime transportation services, as well as fluctuating prices of oil and\nrefined petroleum products, and may be affected by a decrease in the demand for such products and the volatility in their prices”. Such inflationary pressures and disruptions could\nadversely impact our operating costs and demand and supply for the crude oil and/or refined petroleum products we transport. It remains to be seen whether inflationary pressures will\ncontinue, and to what degree, as central banks begin to respond to price increases. Interventions in the economy by central banks in response to inflationary pressures may slow down\neconomic activity, reducing demand for the crude oil and/or refined petroleum products we carry, and cause a reduction in trade. As a result, the volumes of crude oil and/or refined\npetroleum products we deliver and/or charter rates for our vessels may be affected. These factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and\noperating results.\n62\nTable of Contents\nE. Critical Accounting Estimates\nCritical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and\nhave had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. On a\nregular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with\nU.S. GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences\ncould be material. For a description of our significant accounting policies, please read “Item 18. Financial Statements” and more precisely Note 2 of the Combined Carve-Out Financial\nStatements included elsewhere in this annual report.\nVessel Impairment\nThe Company reviews for impairment on its vessels held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances (such as market conditions, obsolescence or damage to the asset,\npotential sales and other business plans) may result in the fair value of vessel being less than its carrying amount indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be\nrecoverable. When the estimate of undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to be generated by the use of the asset is less than its carrying amount, we are\nrequired to evaluate the asset for an impairment loss. Measurement of the impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset.\nThe carrying values of our vessels may not represent their fair market value at any point in time since the market prices of second-hand vessels tend to fluctuate with changes in\ncharter rates and the cost of newbuilds. Historically, both charter rates and vessel values tend to be cyclical.\nOur estimates of basic market value assume that the vessels are all in good and seaworthy condition without need for repair and, if inspected, would be certified in class without\nnotations of any kind. Our estimates are based on the estimated market values for the vessels received from a third-party independent shipbroker approved by our financing providers.\nVessel values are highly volatile. Accordingly, our estimates may not be indicative of the current or future basic market value of the vessels or prices that could be achieved if the vessels\nwere to be sold.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022, the charter-free market value of all our vessels exceeded their carrying value. Thus, no undiscounted cash flow tests were deemed\nnecessary to be performed for any of our vessels.\nWe perform undiscounted cash flow tests when necessary, as an impairment analysis, in which we made estimates and assumptions relating to determining the projected\nundiscounted net operating cash flows by considering the following:\n• the charter revenues from existing time charters for the fixed fleet days;\n• the estimated vessel operating expenses and voyage expenses;\n• the estimated dry-docking expenditures;\n• an estimated gross daily charter rate for the unfixed days (based on the ten-year average of the historical one-year time charter rates available for each type of vessel) over the\nremaining economic life of each vessel, excluding days of scheduled off-hires and net of commissions;\n• the residual value of vessels;\n• management fees;\n• an estimated utilization rate; and\n• the remaining estimated life of our vessels.\nThe net operating undiscounted cash flows are then compared with the vessels’ net book value plus unamortized dry-docking costs. The difference, if any, between the carrying\namount of the vessel plus unamortized dry-docking costs and their fair value is recognized in the Company’s accounts as impairment loss.\nAlthough we believe that the assumptions used to evaluate potential impairment, which are largely based on the historical performance of our fleet, are reasonable and appropriate,\nsuch assumptions are highly subjective. There can be no assurance as to how charter rates and vessel values will fluctuate in the future. Charter rates may, from time to time throughout\nour vessels’ lives, remain for a considerable period of time at depressed levels which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability, and future assessments of vessel impairment.\n63\nTable of Contents\nOur assumptions, based on historical trends, and our accounting policies are as follows:\n• our secondhand vessels are depreciated from the date of their acquisition through their remaining estimated useful life. We estimate the full useful life of vessels to be 25 years\nfrom the date of initial delivery from the shipyard;\n• the estimated useful life of vessels takes into account commercial considerations and regulatory restrictions;\n• the estimated charter rates are based on rates under existing vessel contracts and thereafter at market rates at which we expect we can re-charter our vessels based on market\ntrends. We believe that the ten-year average historical time charter rate is appropriate (or less than ten years if appropriate data is not available) for the following reasons:\n• it reflects more accurately the earnings capacity of the type, specification, deadweight capacity and average age of our vessels;\n• it reflects the type of business conducted by us (period as opposed to spot);\n• it is an appropriate period to capture the volatility of the market and includes numerous market highs and lows so as to be considered a fair estimate based on past\nexperience; and\n• respective data series are adequately populated;\n• estimates of vessel utilization, including estimated off-hire time are based on the historical experience of our fleet;\n• estimates of operating expenses and dry-docking expenditures are based on historical operating and dry-docking costs based on the historical experience of our fleet and our\nexpectations of future operating requirements;\n• vessel residual values are a product of a vessel’s lightweight tonnage and an estimated scrap rate; and\n• the remaining estimated lives of our vessels used in our estimates of future cash flows are consistent with those used in our depreciation calculations.\nThe impairment test that we conduct, when required, is most sensitive to variances in future time charter rates.\nITEM 6. DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES\nA. Directors and Senior Management\nSet forth below are the names, ages and positions of our directors and executive officer. Our Board currently consists of three directors. Our Board is divided into three classes of\ndirectors (Class A, Class B and Class C).

Major Shareholders\nBased on information available to us, including information contained in public filings, there were no beneficial owners of 5% or more of our common shares. The following table\nsets forth certain information regarding the beneficial ownership of the common shares and Series B Preferred Shares of all of our directors and officers.\nThe percentage of beneficial ownership is based on 9,461,009 common shares outstanding.\nName of Beneficial Owner No. of Common Shares Percentage\nAll executive officers and directors as a group(1)(2) — —%\n(1) Neither any member of our Board or executive officer individually, nor all of them taken as a group, hold more than 1% of our outstanding common shares.\n(2) Petros Panagiotidis holds 11,240 common shares (or 0.12% of the common shares outstanding) and, indirectly, 40,000 Series B Preferred Shares (representing all such Series B\nPreferred Shares outstanding, each Series B Preferred Share having the voting power of 100,000 common shares). The common shares and Series B Preferred Shares held by Mr.\nPanagiotidis represent 99.8% of the aggregate voting power of our total issued and outstanding share capital. Please see “Item 10. Additional Information—B. Memorandum and\nArticles of Association” for a description of the rights of the holder of our Series B Preferred Shares relative to the rights of the holders of our common shares.\nAll of our common shareholders are entitled to one vote for each common share held. As of March 7, 2023 there were 6 holders of record of Castor’s common shares, five of which\nhave a U.S. mailing address, and who are expected to receive our common shares in the Distribution. One of these holders is CEDE & Co., a nominee company for The Depository Trust\nCompany, which held approximately 99.85% of Castor’s outstanding common shares as of such date. The beneficial owners of the common shares held by CEDE & Co. may include\npersons who reside outside the United States.\nB. Related Party Transactions\nFrom time to time, we have entered into agreements and have consummated transactions with certain related parties. We may enter into related party transactions from time to time\nin the future. Related party transactions are subject to review and approval of a special committee composed solely of independent members of our Board.\nManagement, Commercial and Administrative Services\nOur vessels are commercially and technically managed by Castor Ships, a company controlled by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer under a master management agreement\nentered into between Toro, Toro’s shipowning subsidiaries and Castor Ships with effect as of the date of the Distribution (the “Master Management Agreement”). The following is a\nsummary of such agreement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the relevant agreement, which is attached as an exhibit hereto and incorporated by reference into\nthis annual report on Form 20-F.\nCastor Ships manages our business overall and provides us with a wide range of shipping services such as crew management, technical management, operational employment\nmanagement, insurance management, provisioning, bunkering, accounting and audit support services, commercial, chartering and administrative services, including, but not limited to,\nsecuring employment for our fleet, arranging and supervising the vessels’ commercial operations, providing technical assistance where requested in connection with the sale of a vessel,\nnegotiating loan and credit terms for new financing upon request and providing general corporate and administrative services, among other matters. Castor Ships shall generally not be\nliable to us for any loss, damage, delay or expense incurred during the provision of the foregoing services, except insofar as such events arise from Castor Ships or its employees’ fraud,\ngross negligence or willful misconduct (for which our recovery will be limited to two times the Flat Management Fee, as defined below). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Castor Ships\nshall in no circumstances be responsible for the actions of the crews of our vessels. We have also agreed to indemnify Castor Ships in certain circumstances. Under the terms of the\nMaster Management Agreement, our shipowning subsidiaries have also entered into separate management agreements appointing Castor Ships as commercial and technical manager of\ntheir vessels (collectively, the “Ship Management Agreements”).\nCastor Ships may choose to subcontract some of these services to other parties at its discretion. As of the date of this annual report, Castor Ships had subcontracted, with our\nconsent, the technical management of all our eight tanker vessels to third-party ship-management companies. Castor Ships pays, at its own expense, these third-party management\ncompanies a fee for the services it has subcontracted to them, without burdening the Company with any additional cost.\n67\nTable of Contents\nIn exchange for these services, we pay Castor Ships (i) a flat quarterly management fee in the amount of $0.75 million for the management and administration of our business (the\n“Flat Management Fee”), (ii) a commission of 1.25% on all gross income received from the operation of our vessels, and (iii) a commission of 1% on each consummated sale and purchase\ntransaction. In addition, each of our vessel owning subsidiaries pays Castor Ships a daily fee of $975 per vessel for the provision of commercial and technical ship management services\nprovided under the Ship Management Agreements (the “Ship Management Fee”). The Ship Management Fee and Flat Management Fee will be adjusted annually for inflation on each\nanniversary of the Master Management Agreement’s effective date. We may also reimburse Castor Ships for extraordinary fees and costs, such as the costs of repairs, maintenance or\nstructural changes to our vessels.\nThe Master Management Agreement has a term of eight years from its effective date and this term automatically renews for a successive eight-year term on each anniversary of the\neffective date, starting from the first anniversary of the effective date, unless the agreements are terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions contained therein. In the event that\nthe Master Management Agreement is terminated by the Company or is terminated by Castor Ships due to a material breach of the Master Management Agreement by the Company or a\nchange of control in the Company (including certain business combinations, such as a merger or the disposal of all or substantially all of our assets or changes in key personnel such as\nour current directors or Chief Executive Officer), Castor Ships shall be entitled to a termination fee equal to seven times the total amount of the Flat Management Fee calculated on an\nannual basis. This termination fee is in addition to any termination fees provided for under each Ship Management Agreement.\nThe V8 Plus Pool\nIn the period between September 30, 2022, and December 12, 2022, the M/T Wonder Polaris, M/T Wonder Sirius, M/T Wonder Bellatrix, M/T Wonder Musica, M/T Wonder Avior and\nM/T Wonder Vega, entered into a series of separate agreements with V8, a member of the Navig8 Group of companies, for the participation of the vessels in the V8 Plus Pool. In February\n2023, the agreement relating to the M/T Wonder Sirius’s participation in the V8 Plus Pool was terminated and the vessel commenced a period time charter. The V8 Plus Pool is managed by\nV8 Plus Management Pte Ltd., a company in which Petros Panagiotidis has a minority equity interest. The following description of such agreements’ terms does not purport to be\ncomplete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to the Form of Pooling Agreement, which is included as an exhibit to this annual report and incorporated by reference\ninto this annual report on Form 20-F.\nUnder the terms of the respective agreements, the vessels shall participate in the V8 Plus Pool for a minimum period of six months, subject to certain rights of suspension and/or\nearly termination. During the period of the vessels’ participation, each shall be provided with certain commercial management services and entered into charters by the pool manager. In\nreturn for such services, the pool manager is entitled to a $250 daily fee and customary 2% commission on all income received under charters and contracts of affreightment. The relevant\nToro Subsidiary will receive its proportional share of pool revenues, subject to adjustments for expenses, among other factors. Each Toro Subsidiary is entitled to elect one voting\nrepresentative to the pool’s committee, which approves (i) the basis for calculating pool costs and (ii) requirements under which pool participants may be required to make additional\ncontributions to the pool’s working capital. Certain of the agreements contain trading restrictions for vessels not yet fully equipped with BWTS. The agreement was negotiated and\napproved by the Special Committee.\nThe Spin Off Resolutions\nOn November 15, 2022 and December 30, 2022, our Board resolved, among other things, (i) to focus our efforts on our current business of tanker shipping services, (ii) that we have\nno interest or expectancy to participate or pursue any opportunity in areas of business outside of the tanker shipping business and (iii) that Petros Panagiotidis, our director, Chairman,\nChief Executive Officer and controlling shareholder and his affiliates, such as Castor Ships, are not required to offer or inform us of any such opportunity. This does not preclude us,\nhowever, from pursuing opportunities outside of the tanker shipping business if in the future our Board determines to do so. Nevertheless, focusing our efforts on tanker shipping may\nreduce the scope of opportunities we may exploit.\nSimilarly on November 15, 2022 and December 30, 2022, Castor’s board resolved, among other things, (i) to focus its efforts on its current business of dry bulk shipping services,\n(ii) that Castor has no interest or expectancy to participate or pursue any opportunity in areas of business outside of the dry bulk shipping business and (iii) that Petros Panagiotidis, its\ndirector, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and controlling shareholder and his affiliates are not required to offer or inform it of any such opportunity. This does\nnot preclude Castor from pursuing opportunities outside of its declared business focus area, including in the tanker shipping business, if in the future Castor’s board determines to do\nso.\nMr. Panagiotidis will devote such portion of his business time and attention to our business as is appropriate and will also devote substantial time to Castor’s business and other\nbusiness and/or investment activities that Mr. Panagiotidis maintains now or in the future. Mr. Panagiotidis’ intention to provide adequate time and attention to other ventures will\npreclude him from devoting substantially all his time to our business. Our Board and Castor’s board have each resolved to accept this arrangement.\n68\nTable of Contents\nContribution and Spin Off Distribution Agreement\nThe following description of the Contribution and Spin Off Distribution Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to the\nContribution and Spin Off Distribution Agreement, which is included as an exhibit to this annual report and incorporated by reference herein. The terms of the transactions which are the\nsubject of the Contribution and Spin Off Distribution Agreement were negotiated and approved by the Special Committee.\nWe entered into the Contribution and Spin Off Distribution Agreement with Castor, pursuant to which (i) Castor contributed the Toro Subsidiaries to us in exchange for all our\nissued and outstanding common shares and 140,000 Series A Preferred Shares and the issue of 40,000 Series B Preferred Shares to Pelagos against payment of their nominal value,\n(ii) Castor agreed to indemnify us and our vessel-owning subsidiaries for any and all obligations and other liabilities arising from or relating to the operation, management or employment\nof vessels or subsidiaries it retains after to the Distribution Date and we agreed to indemnify Castor for any and all obligations and other liabilities arising from or relating to the\noperation, management or employment of the vessels contributed to us or our vessel-owning subsidiaries, and (iii) we agreed to replace and replaced Castor as guarantor under the\n$18.0 million term loan facility. The Contribution and Spin Off Distribution Agreement also provided for the settlement or extinguishment of certain liabilities and other obligations\nbetween us and Castor.\nUnder the Contribution and Spin Off Distribution Agreement, Castor distributed all of our outstanding common shares to holders of its common shares, with one of our common\nshares being distributed for every ten shares of Castor’s common shares held by Castor stockholders as of the Record Date.\nFurther, the Contribution and Spin Off Distribution Agreement provides for certain registration rights to Castor relating to the common shares, if any, issued upon conversion of the\nSeries A Preferred Shares (the “Registerable Securities”). Such securities will cease to be registerable by us upon the earliest of (i) their sale pursuant to an effective registration\nstatement, (ii) their eligibility for sale or sale pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act, and (iii) the time at which they cease to be outstanding. Subject to Castor timely providing us with\nall information and documents reasonably requested by us in connection with such filings and to certain blackout periods, we have agreed to file, as promptly as practicable and in any\nevent no later than 30 calendar days after a request by Castor, one or more registration statements to register Registrable Securities then held by Castor and to use our reasonable best\nefforts to have each such registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable after such filing and keep such registration statement continuously effective until such\nregistration rights terminate. All fees and expenses incident to our performance of our obligations in connection with such registration rights shall be borne solely by us and Castor shall\npay any transfer taxes and fees and expenses of its counsel relating to a sale of Registrable Securities. These registration rights shall terminate on (i) the date occurring after the seventh\nanniversary of the original issue date of the Series A Preferred Shares on which Castor owns no Registrable Securities or (ii) if earlier, the date on which Castor owns no Series A\nPreferred Shares and no Registerable Securities.\nAny and all agreements and commitments, currently existing between us and our subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Castor and its subsidiaries, on the other hand, terminated as of\nMarch 7, 2023. None of these arrangements and commitments is deemed material to the Company. In particular, our vessel-owning subsidiaries ceased to be parties to the master\nmanagement agreement among Castor, its subsidiaries and Castor Ships that is currently in effect and entered into the Master Management Agreement with Toro and Castor Ships\ndescribed above. Our vessel-owning subsidiaries ceased to be party to certain custodial and Cash Pooling Deeds entered into individually by each of such subsidiaries and Castor\nMaritime SCR Corp. and entered into substantively similar cash management and custodial arrangements with our wholly owned treasury subsidiary, Toro RBX Corp.. Under the\nContribution and Spin Off Distribution Agreement, we also agreed to reimburse Castor for transaction expenses incurred in connection with our separation from Castor, such as adviser\nand filing fees.\nC. Interests of Experts and Counsel\nNot applicable.\n69\nTable of Contents\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nA. Consolidated Statements and other Financial Information\nPlease see “Item 18. Financial Statements.”\nLegal Proceedings\nTo our knowledge, we are not currently a party to any legal proceedings that, if adversely determined, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of\noperations or liquidity. As such, we do not believe that pending legal proceedings, taken as a whole, should have any significant impact on our financial statements. We are, and from\ntime to time in the future may be, subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, principally personal injury and property casualty claims. While we expect\nthat these claims would be covered by our existing insurance policies, those claims, even if lacking merit, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.\nDividend Policy\nWe are a recently formed company and have a limited performance record and operating history. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to pay dividends at all, and\nour ability to pay dividends will be subject to the limitations set forth below and under “Item 3. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Common Shares—Our Board may never declare\ndividends.”\nUnder our Bylaws, our Board may declare and pay dividends in cash, stock or other property of the Company. Any dividends declared will be in the sole discretion of the Board and\nwill depend upon factors such as earnings, increased cash needs and expenses, restrictions in any of our agreements (including our current and future credit facilities), overall market\nconditions, current capital expenditure programs and investment opportunities, and the provisions of Marshall Islands law affecting the payment of distributions to shareholders (as\ndescribed below), and will be subject to the priority of our Series A Preferred Shares. The foregoing is not an exhaustive list of factors which may impact the payment of dividends.\nDividends on our Series A Preferred Shares accrue and are cumulative from their issue date and are payable quarterly, assuming dividends have been declared by our Board or any\nauthorized committee thereof out of legally available funds for such purpose. From, and including, their issue date to, but excluding, the seventh anniversary of the issue date (the “reset\ndate”), the dividend rate for the Series A Preferred Shares will be 1.00% per annum of the stated amount of $1,000 per share; for each quarterly dividend period commencing on or after\nthe reset date, the dividend rate will be the dividend rate in effect for the prior quarterly dividend period multiplied by a factor of 1.3; provided, however, that the dividend rate will not\nexceed 20% per annum in respect of any quarterly dividend period. We may redeem the Series A Preferred Shares at any time on or after the reset date, in whole or in part, at a redemption\nprice of $1,000 per share plus an amount equal to all accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon to the date of redemption, whether or not declared.\nThe Series A Preferred Shares are convertible, in whole or in part, at their holder’s option, to Common Shares at any time and from time to time from and after the third anniversary of\ntheir issue date and prior to the reset date. Subject to certain adjustments, the “Conversion Price” for any conversion of the Series A Preferred Shares shall be the lower of (i) 150% of the\nVWAP of our common shares over the five consecutive trading day period commencing on and including March 7, 2023, and (ii) the VWAP of our Common Shares over the 10\nconsecutive trading day period expiring on the trading day immediately prior to the date of delivery of written notice of the conversion; provided, that, in no event shall the Conversion\nPrice be less than $2.50. The number of Common Shares to be issued to a converting holder shall be equal to the quotient of (i) the aggregate stated amount of the Series A Preferred\nShares converted plus Accrued Dividends (but excluding any dividends declared but not yet paid) thereon on the date on which the conversion notice is delivered divided by (ii) the\nConversion Price.\nIn the event that we declare a dividend of the stock of a subsidiary which we control, the holder(s) of the Series B Preferred Shares are entitled to receive preferred shares of such\nsubsidiary. Such preferred shares will have at least substantially identical rights and preferences to our Series B Preferred Shares and will be issued pro rata to holder(s) of the Series B\nPreferred Shares. The Series B Preferred Shares have no other dividend or distribution rights.\nSee “Item 10. Additional Information—B. Memorandum and Articles of Association” for more detailed descriptions of the Series A Preferred Shares and Series B Preferred Shares.\nMarshall Islands law provides that we may pay dividends on and redeem any shares of capital stock only to the extent that assets are legally available for such purposes. Legally\navailable assets generally are limited to our surplus, which essentially represents our retained earnings and the excess of consideration received by us for the sale of shares above the\npar value of the shares. In addition, under Marshall Islands law, we may not pay dividends on or redeem any shares of capital stock if we are insolvent or would be rendered insolvent by\nthe payment of such a dividend or the making of such redemption.\nAny dividends paid by us may be treated as ordinary income to a U.S. shareholder. Please see the section entitled “Item 10. Additional Information—E. Taxation—U.S. Federal\nIncome Tax Considerations—U.S. Federal Income Taxation of U.S. Holders—Distributions” for additional information relating to the U.S. federal income tax treatment of our dividend\npayments, if any are declared in the future.\nWe have not paid any dividends to our shareholders as of the date of this annual report.\n70\nTable of Contents\nB.

Shareholders of any series or class of shares are entitled to vote upon any proposed amendment, whether or not entitled to vote thereon\nby the Articles of Incorporation, if such amendment would (i) increase or decrease the par value of the shares of such series or class, or (ii) alter or change the powers, preferences or\nspecial rights of the shares of such series or class so as to adversely affect them. Such class vote would be conducted in addition to the vote of all shares entitled to vote upon the\namendment and requires approval by an affirmative majority of the voting power of the affected series or class.\n72\nTable of Contents\nPurpose\nOur purpose is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may now or hereafter be organized under the BCA. However, our Board has resolved to focus our\nefforts on our current business of tanker shipping services. See “Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—B. Related Party Transactions—The Spin Off\nResolutions” for further details. Our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, as amended, do not impose any limitations on the ownership rights of our shareholders.\nShareholders’ Meetings\nThe time and place of our annual meeting of shareholders is determined by our Board. Our first annual meeting of shareholders was held on November 15, 2022. Special meetings of\nthe shareholders, unless otherwise prescribed by law, may be called for any purpose or purposes permitted under applicable law (i) at any time by the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer\nor President of the Company or a majority of the Board and (ii) by shareholders holding more than 50% of the voting rights in the Company. No other person or persons are permitted to\ncall a special meeting, unless otherwise prescribed by law.\nAuthorized Capitalization\nUnder our Articles of Incorporation, our authorized capital stock consists of 3,900,000,000 common shares, par value $0.001 per share, of which 9,461,009 common shares were\nissued and outstanding, and 100,000,000 preferred shares, par value $0.001 per share, of which 140,000 Series A Preferred Shares and 40,000 Series B Preferred Shares were issued and\noutstanding as of the date of this annual report and no Series C Participating Preferred Shares were authorized as of the same time. Authorization for the issuance of Series C\nParticipating Preferred Shares in connection with our Rights Agreement is valid until the expiry of such agreement. See “Item 10. Additional Information—B. Memorandum and Articles\nof Association—Shareholder Protection Rights Agreement” for additional details.\nOn November 14, 2022, Castor, in its capacity as our sole shareholder, authorized our Board to effect one or more reverse stock splits of our common shares issued and outstanding\nat the time of the reverse stock split at a cumulative exchange ratio of between one-for-two and one-for-five hundred shares. Our Board may determine, in its sole discretion, whether to\nimplement any reverse stock split by filing an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation, as well as the specific timing and ratio, within such approved range of ratios; provided that\nany such reverse stock split or splits are implemented prior to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders in 2026. This authorization was intended to provide us the means to\nmaintain compliance with the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, and in particular the minimum bid price requirement, if required, as well as to realize certain\nbeneficial effects of a higher trading price for our common shares, including the ability to appeal to certain investors and potentially increased trading liquidity under appropriate\ncircumstances.\nDescription of the Common Shares\nFor a description of our common shares, see Exhibit 2.2 (Description of Securities).\nPreferred Shares\nOur Articles of Incorporation authorize our Board to establish one or more series of preferred shares and to determine, with respect to any series of preferred shares, the terms and\nrights of that series, including:\n• the designation of the series;\n• the number of shares of the series;\n• the preferences and relative, participating, option or other special rights, if any, and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such series; and\n• the voting rights, if any, of the holders of the series.\nDescription of the Series A Preferred Shares\nThe number of designated Series A Preferred Shares initially is 140,000 and the “stated amount” per Series A Preferred Share is $1,000. We have issued all Series A Preferred Shares\nto Castor. The Series A Preferred Shares have the following characteristics:\n• Ranking.

So long as any Series A Preferred Share remains outstanding, unless full Accrued Dividends on all outstanding\nSeries A Preferred Shares through and including the most recently completed Dividend Period have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been\nset aside for payment, no dividend may be declared or paid or set aside for payment, and no distribution may be made, on any Junior Stock, other than a dividend payable solely\nin stock that ranks junior to the Series A Preferred Shares in the payment of dividends and in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the\nCompany. “Accrued Dividends” means, with respect to Series A Preferred Shares, an amount computed at the Annual Rate from, as to each share, the date of issuance of such\nshare to and including the date to which such dividends are to be accrued (whether or not such dividends have been declared), less the aggregate amount of all dividends\npreviously paid on such share.\nSo long as any Series A Preferred Share remains outstanding, unless full Accrued Dividends on all outstanding Series A Preferred Shares through and including the most\nrecently completed Dividend Period have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside for payment, no monies may be paid or made\navailable for a sinking fund for the redemption or retirement of Junior Stock, nor shall any shares of Junior Stock be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for\nconsideration by us, directly or indirectly, other than (i) as a result of (x) a reclassification of Junior Stock, or (y) the exchange or conversion of one share of Junior Stock for or\ninto another share of stock that ranks junior to the Series A Preferred Shares in the payment of dividends and in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or\nwinding up of the Company; or (ii) through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of stock that rank junior to the Series A Preferred\nShares in the payment of dividends and in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company.\n• Redemption. The Series A Preferred Shares are perpetual and have no maturity date. We may, at our option, redeem the Series A Preferred Shares in whole or in part, at any time\nand from time to time after the Reset Date, at a cash redemption price equal to the stated amount, together with an amount equal to all Accrued Dividends to, but excluding, the\nredemption date.\n• Conversion Rights. The Series A Preferred Shares are convertible, at their holder’s option, to common shares, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time from and after\nthe third anniversary of the Issue Date until but excluding the Reset Date. Subject to certain adjustments, the “Conversion Price” for any conversion of the Series A Preferred\nShares shall be the lower of (i) 150% of the VWAP of our common shares over the five consecutive trading day period commencing on and including the Distribution Date, and\n(ii) the VWAP of our common shares over the 10 consecutive trading day period expiring on the trading day immediately prior to the date of delivery of written notice of the\nconversion; provided, that, in no event shall the Conversion Price be less than $2.50. The number of common shares to be issued to a converting holder shall be equal to the\nquotient of (i) the aggregate stated amount of the Series A Preferred Shares converted plus Accrued Dividends (but excluding any dividends declared but not yet paid) thereon\non the date on which the conversion notice is delivered divided by (ii) the Conversion Price. Castor will have registration rights in relation to the common shares issued upon\nconversion. See “Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—B. Related Party Transactions—Contribution and Spin Off Distribution Agreement”. The\nSeries A Preferred Shares otherwise are not convertible into or exchangeable for property or shares of any other series or class of our capital stock.\n• Liquidation Rights. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, before any distribution or\npayment out of our assets may be made to or set aside for the holders of any Junior Stock, holders of Series A Preferred Shares will be entitled to receive out of our assets\nlegally available for distribution to our shareholders an amount equal to the stated amount per share ($1,000), together with an amount equal to all Accrued Dividends to the\ndate of payment whether or not earned or declared (the “Liquidation Preference”). If the Liquidation Preference has been paid in full to all holders of Series A Preferred Shares\nand all holders of any class or series of our stock that ranks on a parity with Series A Preferred Shares in the distribution of assets on liquidation, dissolution or winding up of\nthe Company, the holders of Junior Stock will be entitled to receive all of our remaining assets according to their respective rights and preferences.\n75\nTable of Contents\n• Voting Rights. Except as indicated below or otherwise required by law, the holders of the Series A Preferred Shares do not have any voting rights.\n○ Right to Elect Directors on Nonpayment of Dividends. If and whenever dividends payable on Series A Preferred Shares or any class or series of our stock that ranks on a\nparity with the Series A Preferred Shares in the payment of dividends (“Dividend Parity Stock”) having voting rights equivalent to those described in this paragraph\n(“Voting Parity Stock”) have not been declared and paid (or, in the case of Series A Preferred Shares and Voting Parity Stock bearing dividends on a cumulative basis, shall\nbe in arrears) in an aggregate amount equal to full dividends for at least six quarterly Dividend Periods or their equivalent (whether or not consecutive) (a “Nonpayment\nEvent”), the number of directors then constituting our Board shall be automatically increased by (i) one, if at such time the Board consists of eight or fewer directors or\n(ii) two, if at such time the Board consists of nine or more directors, and the holders of Series A Preferred Shares, together with the holders of any outstanding Voting\nParity Stock then entitled to vote for additional directors, voting together as a single class in proportion to their respective stated amounts, shall be entitled to elect the\nadditional director or two directors, as the case may be (the “Preferred Share Directors”); provided that our Board shall at no time include more than two Preferred Share\nDirectors (including, for purposes of this limitation, all directors that the holders of any series of voting preferred shares are entitled to elect pursuant to like voting rights).\nWhen (i) Accrued Dividends have been paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for payment thereof set aside) in full on the Series A Preferred Shares after a Nonpayment\nEvent, and (ii) the rights of holders of any Voting Parity Stock to participate in electing the Preferred Share Directors shall have ceased, the right of holders of the Series A\nPreferred Shares to participate in the election of Preferred Share Directors shall cease (but subject always to the revesting of such voting rights in the case of any future\nNonpayment Event), the terms of office of all the Preferred Share Directors shall forthwith terminate, and the number of directors constituting our Board shall automatically\nbe reduced accordingly. Any Preferred Share Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding Series A\nPreferred Shares and Voting Parity Stock, when they have the voting rights described above (voting together as a single class in proportion to their respective stated\namounts). The Preferred Share Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter that shall come before our Board for a vote.\n○ Other Voting Rights. So long as any Series A Preferred Shares are outstanding, in addition to any other vote or consent of shareholders required by law or by our Articles\nof Incorporation, the vote or consent of the holders of at least two thirds of the Series A Preferred Shares at the time outstanding, voting together with any other series of\npreferred shares that would be adversely affected in substantially the same manner and entitled to vote as a single class in proportion to their respective stated amounts\n(to the exclusion of all other series of preferred shares), given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at any meeting called for the purpose,\nwill be necessary for effecting or validating: (i) any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of our Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws that would alter or change\nthe voting powers, preferences or special rights of the Series A Preferred Shares so as to affect them adversely; (ii) the issuance of Dividend Parity Stock if the Accrued\nDividends on all outstanding Series A Preferred Shares through and including the most recently completed Dividend Period have not been paid or declared and a sum\nsufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside for payment; (iii) any amendment or alteration of the Articles of Incorporation to authorize or create, or increase the\nauthorized amount of, any shares of any class or series or any securities convertible into shares of any class or series of our capital stock ranking prior to Series A in the\npayment of dividends or in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company; or (iv) any consummation of (x) a binding share\nexchange or reclassification involving the Series A Preferred Shares, (y) a merger or consolidation of the Company with another entity (whether or not a corporation), or (z)\na conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance of the Company into another entity or an entity organized under the laws of another jurisdiction, unless in each case\n(A) the Series A Preferred Shares remain outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which we are not the surviving or resulting entity,\nor any such conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance, the Series A Preferred Shares are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving or\nresulting entity or its ultimate parent, and (B) such shares remaining outstanding or such preference securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences,\nprivileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions, and limitations and restrictions thereof, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders\nthereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and restrictions and limitations thereof, of the Series A Preferred Shares immediately prior to such\nconsummation, taken as a whole. The foregoing voting rights do not apply in connection with the creation or issuance of Series C Participating Preferred Shares of the\nCompany substantially in the form approved by the Board in connection with the Shareholder Protection Rights Agreement.\n• No Preemptive Rights; No Sinking Fund. Holders of the Series A Preferred Shares do not have any preemptive rights. The Series A Preferred Shares will not be subject to any\nsinking fund or any other obligation of us for their repurchase or retirement.\n76\nTable of Contents\nDescription of the Series B Preferred Shares\nOn March 7, 2023, we issued all of our 40,000 authorized Series B Preferred Shares to Pelagos. Pelagos is a company controlled by Petros Panagiotidis, our Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer and Castor’s Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. As a result, we are controlled by Pelagos and it may be more difficult to effect a change of\ncontrol of us.\nThe Series B Preferred Shares have the following characteristics:\n• Conversion. The Series B Preferred Shares are not convertible into common shares.\n• Distributions. In the event that we declare a dividend of the stock of a subsidiary which we control, the holder(s) of the Series B Preferred Shares are entitled to receive\npreferred shares of such subsidiary. Such preferred shares will have at least substantially identical rights and preferences to our Series B Preferred Shares and be issued in an\nequivalent number to our Series B Preferred Shares. The Series B Preferred Shares have no other dividend or distribution rights.\n• Voting. Each Series B Preferred Share has the voting power of 100,000 common shares and counts for 100,000 votes for purposes of determining quorum at a meeting of\nshareholders, subject to adjustment to maintain a substantially identical voting interest in Toro following the (i) creation or issuance of a new series of shares of the Company\ncarrying more than one vote per share to be issued to any person other than holders of the Series B Preferred Shares, except for the creation (but not the issuance) of Series C\nParticipating Preferred Shares substantially in the form approved by the Board and included as an exhibit to this annual report, without the prior affirmative vote of a majority of\nvotes cast by the holders of the Series B Preferred Shares or (ii) issuance or approval of common shares pursuant to and in accordance with the Shareholder Protection Rights\nAgreement. The Series B Preferred Shares vote together with common shares as a single class, except that the Series B Preferred Shares vote separately as a class on\namendments to the Articles of Incorporation that would materially alter or change the powers, preference or special rights of the Series B Preferred Shares.\n• Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up. Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the Series B Preferred Shares shall have the same liquidation rights\nas and pari passu with the common shares up to their par value of $0.001 per share and, thereafter, the Series B Preferred Shares have no right to participate further in the\nliquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company.\nDescription of the Series C Participating Preferred Shares\nAs of the date of this annual report, no Series C Participating Preferred Shares were authorized in connection with our Rights Agreement (as defined below). See “Item 10.\nAdditional Information—B. Memorandum and Articles—Shareholder Protection Rights Agreement”. If issued, the Series C Participating Preferred Shares will, among other things:\n• not be redeemable;\n• entitle holders to dividend payments in an amount per share equal to the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and the aggregate per share amount (payable in\nkind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions other than a dividend payable in our common shares or a subdivision of our outstanding common shares (by\nreclassification or otherwise), declared on our common shares; and\n• entitle holders to 1,000 votes per Series C Participating Preferred Share on all matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the Company.\nEach one one-thousandth of a Series C Participating Preferred Share issued in connection with the Rights Agreement should approximate the value of one common share.\n77\nTable of Contents\nShareholder Protection Rights Agreement\nOn the Distribution Date, our Board declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a “Right” or the “Rights”), for each outstanding common share and adopted a\nshareholder rights plan, as set forth in the Shareholder Protection Rights Agreement (the “Rights Agreement”) to be entered into between the Company and Broadridge Corporate Issuer\nSolutions, Inc., as rights agent (the “Rights Agent”). Each Right entitles the holder to purchase from the Company, for $22, one common share (or one one-thousandth of a share of\nSeries C Participating Preferred Shares) and will become exercisable following the earlier of (i) the tenth business day (or other date designated by resolution of the Board) after any\nperson other than our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Petros Panagiotidis, or Mr. Panagiotidis’ controlled affiliates commences a tender offer that would result in such person\nbecoming the beneficial owner of a total of 15% or more of the common shares or (ii) the date of the “Flip-in” Trigger, as defined below. For additional details, see the Rights Agreement\nincluded as an exhibit to this annual report.\nThe rights plan adopted under the Rights Agreement and the Rights have the following characteristics:\n• Distribution and Transfer of the Rights. Our Board will declare a dividend of one Right for each share of our common shares outstanding. Prior to the Separation Time referred\nto below, the Rights would be evidenced by and trade with our common shares and would not be exercisable. After the Separation Time, we would cause the Rights Agent to\nmail Rights certificates to shareholders and the Rights would trade independent of the common shares. New Rights will accompany any new common shares of the Company\nissued after the Distribution until the Separation Time.\n• Separation Time. Rights would separate from our common shares and become exercisable following the earlier of (i) the tenth (10) business day (or other date designated by\nresolution of the Board) after any person (other than Mr. Panagiotidis or his controlled affiliates) commences a tender offer that would result in such person becoming the\nbeneficial owner of a total of 15% or more of the common shares or (ii) the date of the “Flip-in” Trigger.\n• Exercise of the Rights. On or after the Separation Time, each Right would initially entitle the holder to purchase, for $22 (the “Exercise Price”), one common share (or one one-\nthousandth of a share of Series C Participating Preferred Shares, such portion of a Series C Participating Preferred Share being designed to give the shareholder approximately\nthe same dividend, voting and liquidation rights as would one common share). Prior to exercise, the Right does not give its holder any dividend, voting, or liquidation rights.\n• “Flip-in” Trigger. Upon public announcement by the Company that any person other than Mr. Panagiotidis or his controlled affiliates (an “Acquiring Person”) has acquired\n15% or more of our outstanding common shares:\n(i) Rights owned by the Acquiring Person or transferees thereof would automatically be void; and\n(ii) each other Right will automatically become a right to buy, for the Exercise Price, that number of common shares of the Company (or equivalent fractional shares of Series C\nParticipating Preferred Shares) having a market value of twice the Exercise Price.\n• “Flip-over” Trigger. After an Acquiring Person has become such, (i) the Company may not consolidate or merge with any person, if the Company’s Board is controlled by the\nAcquiring Person or the Acquiring Person is the beneficial owner of 50% or more of the outstanding shares of our common shares, and the transaction is with the Acquiring\nPerson or its affiliate or associate or the shares owned by the Acquiring Person are treated differently from those of other shareholders, and (ii) the Company may not sell 50%\nor more of its assets if the Company’s Board is controlled by the Acquiring Person unless in either case proper provision is made so that each Right would thereafter become a\nright to buy, for the Exercise Price, that number of common shares of such other person having a market value of twice the Exercise Price.\n• Redemption. The Rights may be redeemed by the Board, at any time until a “Flip-in” Trigger has occurred, at a redemption price of $0.001 per Right.\n• Power to Amend. Our Board may amend the Rights Agreement in any respect until a “Flip-in” Trigger has occurred. Thereafter, our Board may amend the Rights Agreement in\nany respect not materially adverse to Rights holders generally.\n• Expiration. The Rights will expire on the tenth anniversary of the Distribution Date.\n78\nTable of Contents\nFurthermore, if any person (other than Mr. Panagiotidis or his controlled affiliates) acquires between 15% and 50% of our outstanding common shares, the Board may, in lieu of\nallowing Rights to be exercised, require each outstanding Right to be exchanged for one common share of the Company (or one one-thousandth of a share of Series C Participating\nPreferred Shares). The Board may enter into a trust agreement pursuant to which the Company would deposit into a trust its common shares that would be distributable to shareholders\n(excluding the Acquiring Person) in the event this exchange option is implemented.\nCertain synthetic interests in securities created by derivative positions, whether or not such interests are considered to be ownership of the underlying common shares or are\nreportable for purposes of Regulation 13D of the Exchange Act, as amended, are treated as beneficial ownership of the number of our common shares equivalent to the economic\nexposure created by the derivative position, to the extent our actual common shares are directly or indirectly held by counterparties to the derivatives contracts. Swaps dealers\nunassociated with any control intent or intent to evade the purposes of the Rights Agreement are excepted from such imputed beneficial ownership.\nThe Rights Agreement “grandfathers” the current level of ownership of persons who, prior to the date of the Rights Agreement, beneficially owned 15% or more of our outstanding\ncommon shares, so long as they do not purchase additional shares in excess of certain limitations. Such provisions also “grandfather” our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Petros\nPanagiotidis, and Mr. Panagiotidis’ controlled affiliates.\nThe Rights may have anti-takeover effects. The Rights will cause substantial dilution to any person or group that attempts to acquire us without the approval of our Board. As a\nresult, the overall effect of the Rights may be to render more difficult or discourage any attempt to acquire us. Because our Board can approve a redemption of the Rights for a permitted\noffer, the Rights should not interfere with a merger or other business combination approved by our Board.\nThe foregoing description of the Rights Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to the Rights Agreement, which is\nincluded as an exhibit to this annual report.\nListing and Markets\nOur common shares and associated Preferred Share Purchase Rights under the Rights Agreement are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol “TORO”.\nTransfer Agent\nThe registrar and transfer agent for our common shares is Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, Inc.\nExclusive Forum\nOur Bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the High Court of the Republic of Marshall Islands shall be the sole and exclusive\nforum for any internal corporate claim, intra-corporate claim, or claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine and that the United States District Court for the Southern District of New\nYork shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any claim arising under the Securities Act or Exchange Act. If the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York does\nnot have jurisdiction over the claims assigned to it by our exclusive forum provisions, any other federal district court of the United States may hear such claims. Any person or entity\npurchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of capital stock of the Company, shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to this exclusive forum provision.\nThe exclusive forum provision in our Bylaws will not relieve us of our duties to comply with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and our shareholders\nwill not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations. In particular, Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all claims\nbrought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder, and Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for\nfederal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder.\n79\nTable of Contents\nMarshall Islands Company Law Considerations\nFor a description of significant differences between the statutory provisions of the BCA and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware relating to shareholders’ rights,\nrefer to Exhibit 2.2 (Description of Securities).\nC. Material Contracts\nWe refer you to “Item 4. Information on the Company”, “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—B. Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Item 7. Major\nShareholders and Related Party Transactions—B. Related Party Transactions” for a discussion of certain material contracts to which we are a party as of the date of this annual report,\nwhich are also attached as exhibits to this annual report.\nD. Exchange Controls\nThe Marshall Islands impose no exchange controls on non-resident corporations.\nE. Taxation\nThe following is a discussion of the material Marshall Islands and U.S. federal income tax considerations relevant to a U.S. Holder and a Non-U.S. Holder, each as defined below,\nwith respect to the common shares. This discussion does not purport to deal with the tax consequences of owning common shares to all categories of investors, such as dealers in\nsecurities or commodities, traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for securities holdings, financial institutions, insurance companies, tax-exempt\norganizations, U.S. expatriates, persons liable for the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income, persons liable for the alternative minimum tax, persons who hold common\nshares as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion transaction or integrated investment, persons that purchase or sell common shares as part of a wash sale for tax purposes, U.S. Holders\nwhose functional currency is not the United States dollar, and investors that own, actually or under applicable constructive ownership rules, 10% or more of our common shares. This\ndiscussion deals only with holders who hold our common shares as a capital asset. You are encouraged to consult your own tax advisers concerning the overall tax consequences\narising in your own particular situation under U.S. federal, state, local or foreign law of the ownership of common shares. The discussion below is based, in part, on the description of our\nbusiness in this annual report above and assumes that we conduct our business as described in that section. Except as otherwise noted, this discussion is based on the assumption that\nwe will not maintain an office or other fixed place of business within the United States.\n80\nTable of Contents\nMarshall Islands Tax Consequences\nWe are incorporated in the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Under current Marshall Islands law, we are not subject to tax on income or capital gains, and no Marshall Islands\nwithholding tax will be imposed upon payments of dividends by us to our shareholders, and holders of our common shares that are not residents of or domiciled or carrying on any\ncommercial activity in the Republic of the Marshall Islands will not be subject to Marshall Islands tax on the sale or other disposition of our common shares.\nU.S. Federal Income Taxation of Our Company\nTaxation of Operating Income: In General\nUnless exempt from U.S. federal income taxation under the rules discussed below, a foreign corporation is subject to U.S. federal income taxation in respect of any income that is\nderived from the use of vessels, from the hiring or leasing of vessels for use on a time, voyage or bareboat charter basis, from the participation in a pool, partnership, strategic alliance,\njoint operating agreement, cost sharing arrangements or other joint venture it directly or indirectly owns or participates in that generates such income, or from the performance of\nservices directly related to those uses, which we refer to collectively as “shipping income,” to the extent that the shipping income is derived from sources within the United States. For\nthese purposes, 50% of shipping income that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends, but that does not begin and end, in the United States constitutes income from sources\nwithin the United States, which we refer to as “U.S. source gross shipping income” or USSGTI.\nShipping income attributable to transportation that begins and ends in the United States is U.S. source income. We are not permitted by law to engage in such transportation and\nthus will not earn income that is considered to be 100% derived from sources within the United States.\nShipping income attributable to transportation between non-U.S. ports is considered to be derived from sources outside the United States. Such income is not subject to U.S. tax.\nIf not exempt from tax under Section 883 of the Code, our USSGTI would be subject to a tax of 4% without allowance for any deductions (“the 4% tax”) as described below.\nExemption of Operating Income from U.S. Federal Income Taxation\nUnder Section 883 of the Code and the regulations thereunder, we will be exempt from the 4% tax on our USSGTI if:\n(1) we are organized in a foreign country that grants an “equivalent exemption” to corporations organized in the United States; and\n(2) either\n(a) more than 50% of the value of our stock is owned, directly or indirectly, by individuals who are “residents” of a foreign country that grants an “equivalent exemption” to\ncorporations organized in the United States (each such individual is a “qualified shareholder” and collectively, “qualified shareholders”), which we refer to as the “50%\nOwnership Test,” or\n(b) our stock is “primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market” in our country of organization, in another country that grants an “equivalent exemption”\nto U.S. corporations, or in the United States, which we refer to as the “Publicly-Traded Test”.\nThe Marshall Islands, the jurisdiction in which we and our ship-owning subsidiaries are incorporated, grants an “equivalent exemption” to U.S. corporations. Therefore, we will be\nexempt from the 4% on our USSGTI if we meet either the 50% Ownership Test or the Publicly-Traded Test.\nDue to the widely dispersed nature of the ownership of our common shares, it is highly unlikely that we could satisfy the requirements of the 50% Ownership Test. Therefore, we\nexpect to be exempt from the 4% tax on our USSGTI only if we are able to satisfy the Publicly-Traded Test.\nTreasury Regulations provide, in pertinent part, that stock of a foreign corporation must be “primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in the U.S. or in a\nqualified foreign country”. To be “primarily traded” on an established securities market, the number of shares of each class of our stock that are traded during any taxable year on all\nestablished securities markets in the country where they are listed must exceed the number of shares in each such class that are traded during that year on established securities markets\nin any other country. Our common shares, which are traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market, are expected to meet the test of being “primarily traded”.\n81\nTable of Contents\nTo be “regularly traded” one or more classes of our stock representing more than 50% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and of the total\nvalue of the stock that is listed must be listed on an established securities market (“the vote and value” test) and meet certain other requirements. Our common shares are listed on the\nNasdaq Capital Market, but do not represent more than 50% of the voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote. Our Series B Preferred Shares, which have super voting rights\nand have voting control but are not entitled to dividends, will not be listed. Thus, based on a strict reading of the vote and value test described above, our stock is not expected to be\n“regularly traded”.\nTreasury Regulations provide, in pertinent part, that a class of stock will not be considered to be “regularly traded” on an established securities market for any taxable year in which\n50% or more of such class of the outstanding shares of the stock is owned, actually or constructively under specified stock attribution rules, on more than half the days during the\ntaxable year by persons who each own 5% or more of the value of such class of the outstanding stock, which we refer to as the “5% Override Rule”. When more than 50% of the shares\nare owned by 5% shareholders, then we will be subject to the 5% Override Rule unless we can establish that among the shares included in the closely-held block of stock are a sufficient\nnumber of shares in that block to “prevent nonqualified shareholders in the closely held block from owning 50 percent or more of the stock”.\nWe believe our ownership structure meets the intent and purpose of the Publicly-Traded Test and the tax policy behind it even if it does not literally meet the vote and value\nrequirements. In our case, there is no closely held block because less than 5% shareholders in aggregate own more than 50% of the value of our stock. However, we expect that we would\nhave satisfied the Publicly-Traded Test if, instead of our current share structure, our common shares represented more than 50% of the voting power of our stock. In addition, we can\nestablish that nonqualified shareholders cannot exercise voting control over the corporation because a qualified shareholder controls the non-traded voting stock. Moreover, we believe\nthat the 5% Override Rule suggests that the Publicly-Traded Test should be interpreted by reference to its overall purpose, which we consider to be that Section 883 should generally be\navailable to a publicly traded company unless it is more than 50% owned, by vote or value, by nonqualified 5% shareholders. We therefore believe our particular stock structure, when\nconsidered by the U.S. Treasury in light of the Publicly-Traded Test enunciated in the regulations should be accepted as satisfying the exemption. Accordingly, we intend to take the\nposition that we qualify for the benefits of Section 883. However, there can be no assurance that our particular stock structure will be treated as satisfying the Publicly-Traded Test.\nAccordingly, there can be no assurance that we or our subsidiaries will qualify for the benefits of Section 883 for any taxable year.\nTaxation in the Absence of Exemption under Section 883 of the Code\nIf contrary to our position described above the IRS determines that we do not qualify for the benefits of Section 883 of the Code, USSGTI, to the extent not considered to be\n“effectively connected” with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business, as described below, would be subject to a 4% tax imposed by Section 887 of the Code on a gross basis, without the\nbenefit of deductions, which we refer to as the “4% gross basis tax regime”.\nTo the extent the benefits of the exemption under Section 883 of the Code are unavailable and USSGTI is considered to be “effectively connected” with the conduct of a U.S. trade\nor business, as described below, any such “effectively connected” U.S.-source shipping income, net of applicable deductions, would be subject to the U.S. federal corporate income tax\nimposed at a rate of 21%. In addition, we may be subject to the 30% “branch profits” tax on earnings effectively connected with the conduct of such U.S. trade or business, as\ndetermined after allowance for certain adjustments, and on certain interest paid or deemed paid attributable to the conduct of such U.S. trade or business.\nUSSGTI would be considered “effectively connected” with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business only if:\n• We have, or are considered to have, a fixed place of business in the United States involved in the earning of shipping income; and\n• substantially all our USSGTI is attributable to regularly scheduled transportation, such as the operation of a vessel that follows a published schedule with repeated sailings at\nregular intervals between the same points for voyages that begin or end in the United States.\nWe do not currently have, nor intend to have or permit circumstances that would result in having, any vessel operating to the United States on a regularly scheduled basis. Based\non the foregoing and on the expected mode of our shipping operations and other activities, we believe that none of our USSGTI will be “effectively connected” with the conduct of a\nU.S. trade or business.\n82\nTable of Contents\nU.S. Taxation of Gain on Sale of Vessels\nRegardless of whether we qualify for exemption under Section 883 of the Code, we do not expect to be subject to U.S. federal income taxation with respect to gain realized on a sale\nof a vessel, provided the sale is considered to occur outside of the United States under U.S. federal income tax principles. In general, a sale of a vessel will be considered to occur outside\nof the United States for this purpose if title to the vessel, and risk of loss with respect to the vessel, pass to the buyer outside of the United States. It is expected that any sale of a vessel\nby us will be considered to occur outside of the United States.\nU.S. Federal Income Taxation of U.S. Holders\nAs used herein, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of our common shares that is a U.S. citizen or resident, U.S. corporation or other U.S. entity taxable as a\ncorporation, an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source, or a trust if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary\njurisdiction over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) it has in place an election to be\ntreated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nIf a partnership holds our common shares, the tax treatment of a partner of such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and upon the activities of the\npartnership. If you are a partner in a partnership holding our common shares, you are encouraged to consult your tax adviser.\nNo ruling has been or will be requested from the IRS regarding any matter affecting the Company or its shareholders. The statements made here may not be sustained by a court if\ncontested by the IRS.\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of the Distribution\nGenerally, a distribution of property, such as our common shares, by a corporation (such as Castor) is taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes to both the distributing\ncorporation and its shareholders as described below. However, under Section 368(a)(1)(D) and Section 355 of the Code, a company may undergo a corporate division, such as Castor’s\ncontribution of its tanker shipping business to us, and distribute stock of a controlled corporation, as Castor will distribute our common shares in the distribution, on a tax-free basis if\nboth the distributing and controlled corporations are treated as having been engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business for the prior five years and certain other complex\nrequirements are met. Although the matter is not entirely clear, we do not expect that the Distribution will satisfy the requirements imposed by Section 355 of the Code and be treated as a\ntax-free corporate division for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nAssuming that the Distribution does not qualify as a tax-free corporate division under Section 355 of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. Holders that receive our\ncommon shares in the Distribution (including any fractional share deemed to be received by and sold on behalf of a U.S. Holder) will be treated as receiving a distribution from Castor.\nThe fair market value of our common shares distributed (including any fractional share deemed to be received by and sold on behalf of a U.S. Holder) will be treated as a dividend to the\nextent of Castor’s current and accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. We expect that, as of the close of the taxable year that includes\nthe date of the Distribution (without diminution for distributions made during the taxable year), Castor is likely to have a significant amount of current or accumulated earnings and\nprofits for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To the extent the Distribution represents a distribution in excess of such current or accumulated earnings and profits, for a U.S. Holder of\nCastor’s common shares, the fair market value of our common shares distributed (including any fractional share deemed to be received by and sold on behalf of a U.S. Holder) will be\ntreated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in its Castor common shares on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Once such U.S. Holder’s tax basis in its\nCastor common shares is reduced to zero, any remaining amount of the Distribution would be treated as capital gain to such U.S. Holder. Because Castor is not a U.S. corporation, U.S.\nHolders that are corporations will generally not be entitled to claim a dividends received deduction with respect to any distributions such corporate U.S. Holders receive from Castor. In\naddition, such U.S. Holders’ basis in our common shares received in the Distribution will equal the fair market value of such shares as of the date of the Distribution. Such U.S. Holders\nwill generally also begin a new holding period with respect to our common shares received in such a distribution as of the day after the Distribution.\n83\nTable of Contents\nDividends paid arising from the Distribution to a U.S. Holder of Castor shares who is an individual, trust or estate (in all cases, a “U.S. Individual Holder”) will generally be treated\nas ordinary income. However, if you are a U.S. Individual Holder, dividends that constitute qualified dividend income will be taxable to you at the preferential rates applicable to long-term\ncapital gains provided that you hold the shares for more than 60 days during the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date and meet other holding period\nrequirements. We believe that dividends arising with respect to Castor shares in the Distribution generally will be qualified dividend income provided that, in the year that you receive\nthe dividend, the Castor shares are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States. However, there is no assurance that any dividends arising from the\nDistribution will be eligible for these preferential rates in the hands of a U.S. Individual Holder.\nSpecial rules may apply to any “extraordinary dividend,” generally, a dividend arising from the Distribution by Castor in an amount which is equal to or in excess of 10% of a\nshareholder’s adjusted tax basis (or fair market value in certain circumstances) or dividends received within a one-year period that, in the aggregate, equal or exceed 20% of a\nshareholder’s adjusted tax basis (or fair market value upon the shareholder’s election) in a common share of Castor. If Castor is considered to pay an “extraordinary dividend” in the\nDistribution that is treated as “qualified dividend income,” then any loss derived by a U.S. Individual Holder from the sale or exchange of such common shares will be treated as long-\nterm capital loss to the extent of such dividend.\nIf you are a U.S. Holder, you should consult your tax adviser regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Distribution to you.\nDistributions\nSubject to the discussion of passive foreign investment companies, or PFIC, below, any distributions made by us with respect to our common shares to a U.S. Holder will generally\nconstitute dividends to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. Distributions in excess of such earnings and\nprofits will be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in his common shares on a dollar-for-dollar basis and thereafter as capital gain.\nHowever, we do not expect to calculate earnings and profits in accordance with U.S. federal income tax principles. Accordingly, you should expect to generally treat distributions we\nmake as dividends. Because we are not a U.S. corporation, U.S. Holders that are corporations will generally not be entitled to claim a dividends-received deduction with respect to any\ndistributions they receive from us. Dividends paid with respect to our common shares will generally be treated as “passive category income” for purposes of computing allowable\nforeign tax credits for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes.\nDividends paid on our common shares to a U.S. Individual Holder will generally be treated as ordinary income. However, if you are a U.S. Individual Holder, dividends that\nconstitute qualified dividend income will be taxable to you at the preferential rates applicable to long-term capital gains provided that you hold the shares for more than 60 days during\nthe 121-day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date and meet other holding period requirements. Dividends paid with respect to the shares generally will be qualified\ndividend income provided that, in the year that you receive the dividend, the shares are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States. Our common shares are\nlisted on the Nasdaq Capital Market and we therefore expect that dividends will be qualified dividend income.\nSpecial rules may apply to any “extraordinary dividend,” generally, a dividend paid by us in an amount which is equal to or in excess of 10% of a shareholder’s adjusted tax basis (or\nfair market value in certain circumstances) or dividends received within a one-year period that, in the aggregate, equal or exceed 20% of a shareholder’s adjusted tax basis (or fair market\nvalue upon the shareholder’s election) in a common share. If we pay an “extraordinary dividend” on our common shares that is treated as “qualified dividend income,” then any loss\nderived by a U.S. Individual Holder from the sale or exchange of such common shares will be treated as long-term capital loss to the extent of such dividend.\nSale, Exchange or other Disposition of Common Shares\nSubject to the discussion of our status as a PFIC below, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize taxable gain or loss upon a sale, exchange or other disposition of our common shares\nin an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized by the U.S. Holder from such sale, exchange or other disposition and the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in such stock. Such\ngain or loss will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period is greater than one year at the time of the sale, exchange or other disposition. Such capital\ngain or loss will generally be treated as U.S.-source income or loss, as applicable, for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes. A U.S. Holder’s ability to deduct capital losses is subject to certain\nlimitations.\n84\nTable of Contents\nPassive Foreign Investment Company Status and Significant Tax Consequences\nSpecial U.S. federal income tax rules apply to a U.S. Holder that holds stock in a foreign corporation classified as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, we will be\ntreated as a PFIC with respect to a U.S. Holder if, for any taxable year in which such holder held our common shares, either\n• at least 75% of our gross income for such taxable year consists of passive income (e.g., dividends, interest, capital gains and rents derived other than in the active conduct of a\nrental business); or\n• at least 50% of the average value of the assets held by the corporation during such taxable year produce, or are held for the production of, passive income.\nFor purposes of determining whether we are a PFIC, we will be treated as earning and owning our proportionate share of the income and assets, respectively, of any of our\nsubsidiaries’ corporations in which we own at least 25% of the value of the subsidiary’s stock. Income earned, or deemed earned, by us in connection with the performance of services\nwould not constitute “passive income” for these purposes. By contrast, rental income would generally constitute “passive income” unless we were treated under specific rules as\nderiving our rental income in the active conduct of a trade or business.\nIn general, income derived from the bareboat charter of a vessel will be treated as “passive income” for purposes of determining whether we are a PFIC and such vessel will be\ntreated as an asset which produces or is held for the production of “passive income”. On the other hand, income derived from the time charter of a vessel should not be treated as\n“passive income” for such purpose, but rather should be treated as services income; likewise, a time chartered vessel should generally not be treated as an asset which produces or is\nheld for the production of “passive income”.\nBased on our current assets and activities, we do not believe that we will be a PFIC for the current or subsequent taxable years. Although there is no legal authority directly on\npoint, and we are not relying upon an opinion of counsel on this issue, our belief is based principally on the position that, for purposes of determining whether we are a passive foreign\ninvestment company, the gross income we derive or are deemed to derive from the time and voyage chartering activities and pool arrangements of our wholly owned subsidiaries should\nconstitute services income, rather than rental income. Correspondingly, such income should not constitute passive income, and the assets that we or our wholly owned subsidiaries own\nand operate in connection with the production of such income, in particular, the vessels, should not constitute passive assets for purposes of determining whether we were a passive\nforeign investment company. We believe there is substantial legal authority supporting our position consisting of case law and IRS pronouncements concerning the characterization of\nincome derived from time charters and voyage charters as services income for other tax purposes. However, in the absence of any legal authority specifically relating to the statutory\nprovisions governing passive foreign investment companies, the IRS or a court could disagree with our position. In addition, although we intend to conduct our affairs in a manner to\navoid being classified as a passive foreign investment company with respect to any taxable year, we cannot assure you that the nature of our operations will not change in the future.\nAs discussed more fully below, if we were to be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year, a U.S. Holder would be subject to different U.S. federal income taxation rules depending on\nwhether the U.S. Holder makes an election to treat us as a “Qualified Electing Fund,” which election is referred to as a “QEF Election”. As discussed below, as an alternative to making a\nQEF Election, a U.S. Holder should be able to make a “mark-to-market” election with respect to our common shares, which election is referred to as a “Mark-to-Market Election”. A U.S.\nHolder holding PFIC shares that does not make either a “QEF Election” or “Mark-to-Market Election” will be subject to the Default PFIC Regime, as defined and discussed below in “Item\n10. Additional Information—E. Taxation—U.S. Federal Income Taxation of U.S. Holders—Taxation of U.S. Holders Not Making a Timely QEF or “Mark-to-Market” Election”.\nIf the Company were to be treated as a PFIC, a U.S. Holder would be required to file IRS Form 8621 to report certain information regarding the Company. If you are a U.S. Holder who\nheld our common shares during any period in which we are a PFIC, you are strongly encouraged to consult your tax adviser.\n85\nTable of Contents\nThe QEF Election\nIf a U.S. Holder makes a timely QEF Election, which U.S. Holder we refer to as an “Electing Holder,” the Electing Holder must report each year for United States federal income tax\npurposes his pro rata share of our ordinary earnings and our net capital gain, if any, for our taxable year that ends with or within the taxable year of the Electing Holder, regardless of\nwhether or not distributions were made by us to the Electing Holder. The Electing Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the common shares will be increased to reflect taxed but undistributed\nearnings and profits. Distributions of earnings and profits that had been previously taxed will result in a corresponding reduction in the adjusted tax basis in the common shares and will\nnot be taxed again once distributed. An Electing Holder would generally recognize capital gain or loss on the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common shares. It should be\nnoted that if any of our subsidiaries is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Holder must make a separate QEF Election with respect to each such\nsubsidiary.\nTaxation of U.S. Holders Making a “Mark-to-Market” Election\nIf we are a PFIC in a taxable year and our shares are treated as “marketable stock” in such year, you may make a mark-to-market election with respect to your shares. As long as our\ncommon shares are traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market, as they currently are and as they may continue to be, our common shares should be considered “marketable stock” for\npurposes of making the Mark-to-Market Election. However, a mark-to-market election generally cannot be made for equity interests in any lower-tier PFICs that we own, unless shares of\nsuch lower-tier PFIC are themselves “marketable”. As a result, even if a U.S. Holder validly makes a mark-to-market election with respect to our common shares, the U.S. Holder may\ncontinue to be subject to the Default PFIC Regime (described below) with respect to the U.S. Holder’s indirect interest in any of our subsidiaries that are treated as an equity interest in a\nPFIC. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisers in this regard.\nTaxation of U.S. Holders Not Making a Timely QEF or “Mark-to-Market” Election\nFinally, a U.S. Holder who does not make either a QEF Election or a Mark-to-Market Election with respect to any taxable year in which we are treated as a PFIC, or a U.S. Holder\nwhose QEF Election is invalidated or terminated, or a Non-Electing Holder, would be subject to special rules, or the Default PFIC Regime, with respect to (1) any excess distribution (i.e.,\nthe portion of any distributions received by the Non-Electing Holder on the common shares in a taxable year in excess of 125% of the average annual distributions received by the Non-\nElecting Holder in the three preceding taxable years, or, if shorter, the Non-Electing Holder’s holding period for the common shares), and (2) any gain realized on the sale, exchange,\nredemption or other disposition of the common shares.\nUnder the Default PFIC Regime:\n• the excess distribution or gain would be allocated ratably over the Non-Electing Holder’s aggregate holding period for the common shares;\n• the amount allocated to the current taxable year and any taxable year before we became a PFIC would be taxed as ordinary income; and\n• the amount allocated to each of the other taxable years would be subject to tax at the highest rate of tax in effect for the applicable class of taxpayer for that year, and an interest\ncharge for the deemed tax deferral benefit would be imposed with respect to the resulting tax attributable to each such other taxable year.\nAny distributions other than “excess distributions” by us to a Non-Electing Holder will be treated as discussed above under “Taxation—U.S. Federal Income Taxation of U.S.\nHolders—Distributions”.\nIf a Non-Electing Holder who is an individual dies while owning the common shares, such Non-Electing Holder’s successor generally would not receive a step-up in tax basis with\nrespect to the common shares.\nShareholder Reporting\nA U.S. Holder that owns “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value in excess of $50,000 (and in some circumstances, a higher threshold) may be required to file an\ninformation report with respect to such assets with its tax return. “Specified foreign financial assets” may include financial accounts maintained by foreign financial institutions, as well\nas the following, but only if they are held for investment and not held in accounts maintained by financial institutions: (i) stocks and securities issued by non-United States persons,\n(ii) financial instruments and contracts that have non-United States issuers or counterparties, and (iii) interests in foreign entities. Significant penalties may apply for failing to satisfy\nthis filing requirement. U.S. Holders are urged to contact their tax advisers regarding this filing requirement.\nU.S. Federal Income Taxation of “Non-U.S. Holders”\nA beneficial owner of our common shares (other than a partnership) that is not a U.S. Holder is referred to herein as a “Non-U.S. Holder”.\n86\nTable of Contents\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of the Distribution\nNon-U.S. Holders will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation with respect to our common shares received in the Distribution (including any fractional share deemed to be\nreceived by and sold on behalf of a Non-U.S. Holder), unless that income is effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by the Non-U.S. Holder in the United States.\nDividends on Common Shares\nNon-U.S. Holders generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax or withholding tax on dividends received from us with respect to our common shares, unless that income is\neffectively connected with a trade or business conducted by the Non-U.S. Holder in the United States. If the Non-U.S. Holder is entitled to the benefits of a U.S. income tax treaty with\nrespect to those dividends, that income is taxable only if it is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder in the United States.\nSale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Common Shares\nNon-U.S. Holders generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax or withholding tax on any gain realized upon the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common shares,\nunless:\n• the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by the Non-U.S. Holder in the United States. If the Non-U.S. Holder is entitled to the benefits of a U.S.\nincome tax treaty with respect to that gain, that gain is taxable only if it is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder in the United States; or\n• the Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of disposition and other conditions are met.\nIf the Non-U.S. Holder is engaged in a U.S. trade or business for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the income from the common shares, including dividends and the gain from the\nsale, exchange or other disposition of the stock that is effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax in the same\nmanner as discussed in the previous section relating to the taxation of U.S. Holders. In addition, in the case of a corporate Non-U.S. Holder, the earnings and profits of such Non-U.S.\nHolder that are attributable to effectively connected income, subject to certain adjustments, may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of 30%, or at a lower rate as may\nbe specified by an applicable U.S. income tax treaty.\nBackup Withholding and Information Reporting\nIf you are a U.S. Individual Holder, information reporting requirements, on IRS Form 1099, generally will apply to dividend payments or other taxable distributions made to you\nwithin the United States, and the payment of proceeds to you from the sale of common shares effected at a United States office of a broker.\nAdditionally, backup withholding may apply to such payments if you fail to comply with applicable certification requirements or (in the case of dividend payments) are notified by\nthe IRS that you have failed to report all interest and dividends required to be shown on your federal income tax returns.\nIf you are a Non-U.S. Holder, you are generally exempt from backup withholding and information reporting requirements with respect to dividend payments made to you outside the\nUnited States by us or another non-United States payor. You are also generally exempt from backup withholding and information reporting requirements in respect of dividend payments\nmade within the United States and the payment of the proceeds from the sale of common shares effected at a United States office of a broker, as long as either (i) you have furnished a\nvalid IRS Form W-8 or other documentation upon which the payor or broker may rely to treat the payments as made to a non-United States person, or (ii) you otherwise establish an\nexemption.\nPayment of the proceeds from the sale of common shares effected at a foreign office of a broker generally will not be subject to information reporting or backup withholding.\nHowever, a sale effected at a foreign office of a broker could be subject to information reporting in the same manner as a sale within the United States (and in certain cases may be\nsubject to backup withholding as well) if (i) the broker has certain connections to the United States, (ii) the proceeds or confirmation are sent to the United States or (iii) the sale has\ncertain other specified connections with the United States.\nYou generally may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules that exceed your income tax liability by filing a refund claim with the IRS.\n87\nTable of Contents\nOther Tax Considerations\nIn addition to the income tax consequences discussed above, the Company may be subject to tax, including tonnage taxes, in one or more other jurisdictions where the Company\nconducts activities. All our vessel-owning subsidiaries are subject to tonnage taxes. Generally, under a tonnage tax, a company is taxed based on the net tonnage of qualifying vessels\nsuch company operates, independent of actual earnings.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to various market risks, including foreign currency fluctuations, changes in interest rates and credit risk. Our activities expose us primarily to the financial risks of\nchanges in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as described below.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe international shipping industry is capital intensive, requiring significant amounts of investment provided in the form of long-term debt. As of the date of this annual report our\nterm loan facility contains a floating interest rate that fluctuates with changes in the financial markets and in particular changes in LIBOR. From and after March 7, 2023, the reference rate\nfor this term loan facility is SOFR. Currently we do not deem this change from LIBOR to SOFR to be material for our business. Increasing interest rates could increase our interest\nexpense and adversely impact our future results of operations. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our net effective exposure to floating interest rate fluctuations on our\noutstanding debt was $13.2 million and $16.3 million, respectively. Our interest expense is affected by changes in the general level of interest rates, particularly LIBOR and SOFR. As an\nindication of the extent of our sensitivity to interest rate changes, an increase in LIBOR or SOFR of 1% would have decreased our net income both in the period ended December 31, 2021\nand the year ended December 31, 2022 by approximately $0.1 million based upon our floating interest-bearing average debt level during these periods. We expect our sensitivity to\ninterest rate changes to increase in the future if we enter into additional debt agreements in connection with future vessel acquisitions and/or the unencumbered part of our existing fleet.\nFor further information on the risks associated with interest rates, please see “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Our outstanding debt is exposed to Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate (“SOFR”) Risk. If volatility in SOFR occurs, the interest on our indebtedness could be higher than prevailing market interest rates and our profitability, earnings\nand cash flows may be materially and adversely affected” for a discussion on the risks associated with SOFR and, to the extent relevant, LIBOR, among other matters.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe generate all of our revenues in U.S. dollars. A minority of our vessels’ operating expenses (approximately 0.9% for the period ended December 31, 2021 and 1.2% for the year\nended December 31, 2022) and of our general and administrative expenses (approximately 11.5% for the period ended December 31, 2021 and 9.9% for the year ended December 31, 2022)\nare in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro and Japanese Yen. For accounting purposes, expenses incurred in other currencies are converted into U.S. dollars at the\nexchange rate prevailing on the date of each transaction. We do not consider the risk from exchange rate fluctuations to be material for our results of operations because as of\nDecember 31, 2021 and as of December 31, 2022, these non-U.S. dollar expenses represented 0.7% and 0.4% our revenues, respectively. However, the portion of our business conducted\nin other currencies could increase in the future, which could increase our exposure to losses arising from exchange rate fluctuations.\nInflation Risk\nInflation has not had a material effect on our expenses in the preceding fiscal year. In the event that significant global inflationary pressures appear, these pressures would increase\nour operating costs.\nITEM 12.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nA. Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of December 31, 2022, our management conducted an evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, as amended, of the\neffectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.\nThe term disclosure controls and procedures is defined under SEC rules as controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be\ndisclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules\nand forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the\nreports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosure. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error\nand the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving\ntheir control objectives.\nOur management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives\nof the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control\nissues and instances of fraud, if any, within the partnership have been detected. Further, in the design and evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our management\nnecessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective\ncontrol system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nBased upon that evaluation, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures which include, without limitation, controls and\nprocedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management,\nas appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information that was required to be disclosed by us in\nreports we file or submit under the Exchange Act was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC.\nB. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange\nAct. Our internal controls were designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation and presentation of our financial statements\nfor external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\n90\nTable of Contents\nOur internal controls over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n• Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;\n• Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of Company’s management and directors; and\n• Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the\nfinancial statements.\nOur management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon the 2013 framework in Internal Control – Integrated\nFramework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management believes that our internal control over\nfinancial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022.\nHowever, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness\nto future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\nC. Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s\nreport was not subject to attestation by the Company’s registered public accounting firm, since, as an “emerging growth company”, we are exempt from having our independent auditor\nassess our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nD. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this annual report on Form 20-F that have materially affected, or\nare reasonably likely to affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nITEM 16. RESERVED\nITEM 16A. AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT\nThe Board has determined that Mr. Petros Zavakopoulos, who serves as Chairman of the Audit Committee, qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert” under SEC rules, and\nthat Mr. Zavakopoulos is “independent” under applicable Nasdaq rules and SEC standards.\nITEM 16B.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nPursuant to an exception under the Nasdaq listing standards available to foreign private issuers, we are not required to comply with all of the corporate governance practices\nfollowed by U.S. companies under the Nasdaq listing standards, which are available at www.nasdaq.com, because in certain cases we follow our home country (Marshall Islands)\npractice. Pursuant to Section 5600 of the Nasdaq Listed Company Manual, we are required to list the significant differences between our corporate governance practices that comply\nwith and follow our home country practices and the Nasdaq standards applicable to listed U.S. companies. Set forth below is a list of those differences:\n• Independence of Directors. The Nasdaq requires that a U.S. listed company maintain a majority of independent directors. Although our Board is currently comprised of three\ndirectors a majority of whom are independent, we cannot assure you that in the future we will have a majority of independent directors.\n• Executive Sessions. The Nasdaq requires that non-management directors meet regularly in executive sessions without management. The Nasdaq also requires that all\nindependent directors meet in an executive session at least once a year. As permitted under Marshall Islands law and our bylaws, our non-management directors do not\nregularly hold executive sessions without management.\n• Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee. The Nasdaq requires that a listed U.S. company have a nominating/corporate governance committee of independent directors\nand a committee charter specifying the purpose, duties and evaluation procedures of the committee. As permitted under Marshall Islands law and our bylaws, we do not\ncurrently have a nominating or corporate governance committee, nor do we expect to establish such committees.\n• Compensation Committee. The Nasdaq requires U.S. listed companies to have a compensation committee composed entirely of independent directors and a committee charter\naddressing the purpose, responsibility, rights and performance evaluation of the committee. As permitted under Marshall Islands law, we do not currently have a compensation\ncommittee. To the extent we establish such committee in the future, it may not consist of independent directors, entirely or at all.\n• Audit Committee. The Nasdaq requires, among other things, that a listed U.S. company have an audit committee with a minimum of three members, all of whom are independent.\nAs permitted by Nasdaq Rule 5615(a)(3), we follow home country practice regarding audit committee composition. Therefore, our audit committee is comprised of two\nindependent directors, Mr. Angelos Rounick Platanias and Mr. Petros Zavakopoulos. Although the members of our audit committee are independent, we are not required to\nensure their independence under Nasdaq Rule 5605(c)(2)(A) subject to compliance with Rules 10A-3(b)(1) and 10A-3(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n• Shareholder Approval Requirements. The Nasdaq requires that a listed U.S. company obtain prior shareholder approval for certain issuances of authorized stock or the\napproval of, and material revisions to, equity compensation plans. As permitted under Marshall Islands law and our bylaws, we do not intend seek shareholder approval prior to\nissuances of authorized stock or the approval of and material revisions to equity compensation plans.\n• Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Nasdaq requires U.S. companies to adopt and disclose corporate governance guidelines. The guidelines must address, among other\nthings: director qualification standards, director responsibilities, director access to management and independent advisers, director compensation, director orientation and\ncontinuing education, management succession and an annual performance evaluation of the Board. We are not required to adopt such guidelines under Marshall Islands law\nand we have not and do not intend to adopt such guidelines.\n93\nTable of Contents\nITEM 16H.

Predecessor (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, the related combined carve-out\nstatements of comprehensive (loss)/income, changes in net parent investment, and cash flows, for the period from January 13, 2021 to December 31, 2021 and for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial\nposition of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period January 13, 2021 to December 31, 2021 and for the year\nended December 31, 2022 and, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits.\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the\nCompany in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the\nfinancial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control\nover financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on\nthe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond\nto those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the\naccounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Deloitte Certified Public Accountants S.A.\nAthens, Greece\nMarch 8, 2023\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2022.\nF-2\nTable of Contents\nTORO CORP.

(“Toro”, or the “Company”), include the subsidiaries (the “Toro Subsidiaries”, or the “Toro\nPredecessors”) comprising the former Aframax/LR2 and Handysize tanker segments (collectively, its “tanker fleet”) of Castor Maritime Inc. (“Castor”, or the “Parent”). The\naccompanying combined carve-out financial statements are those of the Toro Subsidiaries (as listed below) for all periods presented using the historical carrying costs of the assets and\nthe liabilities of these companies from the dates of their incorporation. All companies are incorporated under the laws of the Marshall Islands.\nToro was formed on July 29, 2022 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Castor under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands under the name Tankco Shipping Inc. and changed\nits name to Toro Corp. on September 29, 2022. On March 7, 2023, Castor separated its tanker fleet from its dry bulk and container fleet by, among other actions, contributing to Toro its\ninterest in the subsidiaries comprising its tanker fleet, each owning, as of December 31, 2022, one tanker vessel and Elektra Shipping Co. in exchange for (i) 9,461,009 common shares of\nToro’s, (ii) the issuance to Castor of 140,000 1.00% Series A Fixed rate Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Shares of Toro having a stated amount of $1,000 per share and a par\nvalue of $0.001 per share and (iii) the issuance to Pelagos Holdings Corp, a company controlled by the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, of 40,000 Series B preferred\nshares of Toro, par value $0.001 per share. The Toro common shares were distributed on March 7, 2023 pro rata to the shareholders of record of Castor as of February 22, 2023. The\ntanker fleet is currently engaged in the worldwide transportation of crude oil and refined petroleum products.\nCastor Ships S.A., a corporation incorporated under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (“Castor Ships”), a related party controlled by Petros Panagiotidis, with effect\nfrom July 1, 2022 provides ship management and chartering services to the vessels owned by the Toro Subsidiaries through subcontracting agreements with unrelated third-party\nmanagers, entered into with Toro’s consent, for all eight of the Toro’s tanker vessels. During the period ended December 31, 2021 and until June 30, 2022, Castor Ships provided only\ncommercial ship management and chartering services to the Toro Subsidiaries.\nPavimar S.A., a corporation incorporated under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (“Pavimar”) and related party controlled by the sister of Petros Panagiotidis, Ismini\nPanagiotidis, provided technical, crew and operational management services to such vessels in the period ended December 31, 2021 and until June 30, 2022. Effective July 1, 2022, the\ntechnical management agreements entered into between Pavimar and the Company’s tanker vessel owning subsidiaries were terminated by mutual consent.\nThe Toro Subsidiaries which are included in the Company’s combined carve-out financial statements for the periods presented are listed below.\nToro Subsidiaries:\nDelivery date\nCountry of Date of Year to Vessel\nCompany incorporation incorporation Vessel Name DWT Built owning company\n1 Rocket Shipping Co.

PREDECESSOR\nNOTES TO COMBINED CARVE-OUT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in U.S. Dollars – unless otherwise stated)\n1. Basis of Presentation and General information: (continued)\nCharterers or pool managers that individually accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s total vessel revenues (as percentages of total vessel revenues), were as follows:\nPeriod Ended Year Ended\nDecember 31, December 31,\nCharterer/Pool manager 2021 2022\nA 31% —%\nB 17% —%\nC —% 17%\nD —% 14%\nE —% 11%\nTotal 48% 42%\nThe comparative combined carve-out Statements of Comprehensive (Loss)/Income, Cash Flows and Changes in Net Parent Investment and related notes represent the period from\nJanuary 13, 2021 (the inception date of Rocket and Gamora, which were the earliest subsidiaries incorporated) to December 31, 2021.\nThe accompanying combined carve-out financial statements include the accounts of the legal entities comprising the Company as discussed above. These combined carve-out\nfinancial statements are derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Castor and are presented on a carve-out basis. The combined carve-out financial\nstatements and accompanying notes reflect the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). These financial statements are presented as if such businesses had been combined throughout the periods presented. All intercompany\naccounts and transactions between the entities comprising the Company have been eliminated in the accompanying combined carve-out financial statements.\nNet Parent contributions to equity, finance part or all of the acquisition cost of the vessels owned by the Toro Subsidiaries are accounted for through the net parent investment\naccount. Net parent investment represents Castor’s interest in the Company’s net assets including the Company’s accumulated (loss)/income, and the net cash contributions from and to\nCastor. Transactions with Castor are reflected in the accompanying combined carve-out statements of cash flows as a financing activity, and in the combined carve-out changes in net\nparent investment and combined carve-out balance sheets as “Net parent investment”.\nThe combined carve-out statements of comprehensive (loss)/income reflect expense allocations made to the Company by Castor of its general and administrative expenses.\nManagement has estimated these additional expenses to be $0.9 million for the period ended December 31, 2021, and $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. See Note 3\n“Transactions with Related Parties” for further information on expenses allocated by Castor. Both the Company and Castor consider the basis on which the expenses have been allocated\nto be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or the benefit received by the Company during the periods presented. Nevertheless, the combined carve-out\nfinancial statements may not be indicative of the Company’s future performance and may not include all the actual expenses that would have been incurred by the Company as an\nindependent publicly traded company or reflect the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows that would have been reported if the Company had been a stand-\nalone entity during the periods presented.\nThe Company has no common capital structure for the combined business and, accordingly, has not presented historical (loss)/income per common share.\nF-8\nTable of Contents\nTORO CORP. PREDECESSOR\nNOTES TO COMBINED CARVE-OUT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in U.S. Dollars – unless otherwise stated)\n2. Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements:\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of the accompanying combined carve-out financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect\nthe reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and\nexpenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include vessel valuations, the valuation of amounts due from charterers, residual value and the useful life of the vessels.\nActual results may differ from these estimates.\nOther comprehensive income/(loss)\nThe Company follows the accounting guidance relating to comprehensive income/(loss), which requires separate presentation of certain transactions that are recorded directly as\ncomponents of net parent investment. The Company has no other comprehensive loss items and, accordingly, comprehensive loss equals net income/ (loss) for the periods presented.\nForeign currency translation\nThe Company’s reporting and functional currency is the U.S. Dollar (“USD”). Transactions incurred in other currencies are translated into USD using the exchange rates in effect at\nthe time of the transactions. At the balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in other currencies are translated into USD to reflect the end-of-period\nexchange rates and any gains or losses are included in the statement of comprehensive loss.\nCash and cash equivalents\nThe Company considers highly liquid investments such as time deposits and certificates of deposit with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash may comprise of (i) minimum liquidity collateral requirements or minimum required cash deposits that are required to be maintained under the Company’s financing\narrangements, (ii) cash deposits in so-called “retention accounts” which may only be used as per the Company’s borrowing arrangements for the purpose of serving the loan\ninstallments coming due or, (iii) other cash deposits required to be retained until other specified conditions prescribed in the Company’s debt agreements are met. In the event that the\nobligation to maintain such deposits is expected to elapse within the next operating cycle, these deposits are classified as current assets. Otherwise, they are classified as non-current\nassets.\nAccounts receivable trade, net\nThe amount shown as trade receivables, net, at the balance sheet date, includes receivables from charterers for hire, freight, pool revenue, and other potential sources of income\n(such as ballast bonus compensation and/or holds cleaning compensation, etc.) under the Company’s charter contracts and/or pool arrangements, net of any provision for doubtful\naccounts. At each balance sheet date, all potentially uncollectible accounts are assessed individually for purposes of determining the appropriate provision for doubtful accounts. No\nprovision for doubtful accounts was recorded as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, a provision for doubtful accounts of $266,732 is recorded.\nInventories\nInventories consist of bunkers, lubricants and provisions on board each vessel. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the\nestimated selling price less reasonably predictable costs of disposal and transportation. Cost is determined by the first in, first out method. Inventories consist of bunkers during periods\nwhen vessels are unemployed, undergoing dry-docking or special survey, in which case, they are also stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and cost is also determined by\nthe first in, first out method.\nF-9\nTable of Contents\nTORO CORP. PREDECESSOR\nNOTES TO COMBINED CARVE-OUT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in U.S. Dollars – unless otherwise stated)\n2. Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements: (continued)\nIntangible Assets/Liabilities Related to Time Charters Acquired\nWhen and where the Company identifies any assets or liabilities associated with the acquisition of a vessel, the Company records all such identified assets or liabilities at fair value.\nFair value is determined by reference to market data obtained by independent broker’s valuations. The valuations reflect the fair value of the vessel with and without the attached time\ncharter and the cost of the acquisition is then allocated to the vessel and the intangible asset or liability on the basis of their relative fair values. The intangible asset or liability is\namortized as an adjustment to revenues over the assumed remaining term of the acquired time charter and is classified as non-current asset or liability, as applicable, in the accompanying\nbalance sheet.\nInsurance Claims\nThe Company records insurance claim recoveries for insured losses incurred on damage to fixed assets, for insured crew medical expenses and for loss of hire for certain of its\nvessels that maintain such kind of insurance. Insurance claim recoveries are recorded, net of any deductible amounts, at the time when (i) the Company’s vessels suffer insured damages\nor at the time when crew medical expenses are incurred, (ii) recovery is probable under the related insurance policies, (iii) the Company can estimate the amount of such recovery\nfollowing submission of the insurance claim and (iv) provided that the claim is not subject to litigation.\nVessels, net\nVessels, net are stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation. The cost of a vessel consists of the contract price plus any direct expenses incurred upon acquisition, including\nimprovements, delivery expenses and other expenditures to prepare the vessel for its intended use which is to provide worldwide integrated transportation services. Subsequent\nexpenditures for conversions and major improvements are also capitalized when they appreciably extend the life, increase the earning capacity or improve the efficiency or safety of a\nvessel; otherwise these amounts are charged to expense as incurred.\nVessels’ depreciation\nDepreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of a vessel, after considering the estimated salvage value. Each vessel’s salvage value is\nequal to the product of its lightweight tonnage and estimated scrap rate. Salvage values are periodically reviewed and revised, if needed, to recognize changes in conditions, new\nregulations or for other reasons. Revisions of salvage value affect the depreciable amount of the vessels and affect depreciation expense in the period of the revision and future periods.\nManagement estimates the useful life of its vessels to be 25 years from the date of initial delivery from the shipyard, whereas, secondhand vessels are depreciated from the date of their\nacquisition through their remaining estimated useful life.\nImpairment of long lived assets\nThe Company reviews its vessels for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a vessel may not be recoverable. When the\nestimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the use of a vessel is less than its carrying amount, the Company evaluates the vessel for an impairment loss.\nMeasurement of the impairment loss is based on the fair value of the vessel in comparison to its carrying value, including any related intangible assets and liabilities. In this respect,\nmanagement regularly reviews the carrying amount of its vessels in connection with their estimated recoverable amount.\nDry-docking and special survey costs\nDry-docking and special survey costs are accounted for under the deferral method whereby the actual costs incurred are deferred and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the\nperiod through the date the next survey is scheduled to become due. Costs deferred are limited to actual costs incurred at the yard and parts used in the dry-docking or special survey.\nCosts deferred include expenditures incurred relating to shipyard costs, hull preparation and painting, inspection of hull structure and mechanical components, steelworks, machinery\nworks, and electrical works as well as lodging and subsistence of personnel sent to the yard site to supervise. If a dry-dock and/or a special survey is performed prior to its scheduled\ndate, the remaining unamortized balance is immediately expensed. Unamortized balances of vessels that are sold are written-off and included in the calculation of the resulting gain or\nloss in the period of a vessel’s sale. The amortization charge related to dry-docking costs and special survey costs is presented within Depreciation and amortization in the\naccompanying combined carve-out statement of comprehensive loss.\nF-10\nTable of Contents\nTORO CORP. PREDECESSOR\nNOTES TO COMBINED CARVE-OUT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in U.S. Dollars – unless otherwise stated)\n2. Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements: (continued)\nRevenue and expenses recognition\nThe Company currently generates its revenues from time charter contracts, voyage charter contracts and pool arrangements. Under a time charter agreement, a contract is entered\ninto for the use of a vessel for a specific period of time and a specified daily charter hire rate. Under a voyage charter agreement, a contract is made for the use of a vessel for a specific\nvoyage to transport a specified agreed upon cargo at a specified freight rate per ton or occasionally a lump sum amount. A part of the Company’s revenues is also generated from pool\narrangements, determined in accordance with the profit-sharing mechanism specified within each pool agreement.\nRevenues related to time charter contracts\nThe Company accounts for its time charter contracts as operating leases pursuant to ASC 842 “Leases”. The Company has determined that the non-lease component in its time\ncharter contracts relates to services for the operation of the vessel, which comprise of crew, technical and safety services, among others. The Company further elected to adopt the\npractical expedient that provides it with the discretion to recognize lease revenue as a combined single lease component for all time charter contracts (operating leases) since it\ndetermined that the related lease component and non-lease component have the same timing and pattern of transfer and the predominant component is the lease. The Company\nqualitatively assessed that more value is ascribed to the use of the asset (i.e., the vessel) rather than to the services provided under the time charter agreements.\nLease revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable rental periods of such charter agreements, as rental service is provided, beginning when a vessel is\ndelivered to the charterer until it is redelivered back to the Company, and is recorded as part of vessel revenues in the Company’s statement of comprehensive income/(loss). Revenues\ngenerated from variable lease payments are recognized in the period when changes in facts and circumstances on which the variable lease payments are based occur. Deferred revenue\nincludes (i) cash received prior to the balance sheet date for which all criteria to recognize as lease revenue have not yet been met as at the balance sheet date and, accordingly, is related\nto revenue earned after such date and (ii) deferred contract revenue such as deferred ballast compensation earned as part of a lease contract. Lease revenue is shown net of commissions\npayable directly to charterers under the relevant time charter agreements. Charterers’ commissions represent discount on services rendered by the Company and no identifiable benefit is\nreceived in exchange for the consideration provided to the charterer. Apart from the agreed hire rate, the owner may be entitled to additional income, such as ballast bonus, which is\nconsidered as reimbursement of owner’s expenses and is recognized together with the lease component over the duration of the charter. The Company made an accounting policy\nelection to recognize the related ballast costs, which mainly consist of bunkers, incurred over the period between the charter party date or the prior redelivery date (whichever is latest)\nand the delivery date to the charterer, as contract fulfillment costs (please also refer to Voyage expenses below).\nRevenues related to voyage charter contracts\nThe Company accounts for its voyage charter contracts following the provisions of ASC 606, Revenue from contracts with customers. The Company has determined that its voyage\ncharter agreements do not contain a lease because the charterer under such contracts does not have the right to control the use of the vessel since the Company retains control over the\noperations of the vessel, the terms of the voyage charter are predetermined, and any change requires the Company’s consent and are therefore considered service contracts.\nThe Company assessed the provisions of ASC 606 and concluded that there is one single performance obligation when accounting for its voyage charters, which is to provide the\ncharterer with an integrated cargo transportation service within a specified period of time. In addition, the Company has concluded that voyage charter contracts meet the criteria to\nrecognize revenue over time as the charterer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the Company’s performance. As a result of the foregoing, voyage revenue derived\nfrom voyage charter contracts is recognized from the time when a vessel arrives at the load port until completion of cargo discharge. Demurrage income, which is considered a form of\nvariable consideration, is included in voyage revenues, and represents payments by the charterer to the vessel owner when loading or discharging time exceeds the stipulated time in the\nvoyage charter agreements.\nUnder a voyage charter agreement, the Company incurs and pays for certain voyage expenses, primarily consisting of bunkers consumption, brokerage commissions, port and canal\ncosts.\nF-11\nTable of Contents\nTORO CORP. PREDECESSOR\nNOTES TO COMBINED CARVE-OUT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in U.S. Dollars – unless otherwise stated)\n2. Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements: (continued)\nRevenues related to pool contracts\nAs from the second quarter of 2021, the Company employed certain of its tanker vessels under pool agreements. Pool revenue for each vessel is determined in accordance with the\nprofit-sharing mechanism specified within each pool agreement. In particular, the Company’s pool managers aggregate the revenues and expenses of all of the pool participants and\ndistribute the net earnings to participants, as applicable:\n• based on the pool points attributed to each vessel (which are determined by vessel attributes such as cargo carrying capacity, speed, fuel consumption, and construction and\nother characteristics); or\n• by making adjustments to account for the cost performance, the bunkering fees and the trading capabilities of each vessel and the number of days the vessel participated in\nthe pool in the period (excluding off-hire days).\nThe Company records revenue generated from the pools in accordance with ASC 842, Leases, since it assesses that a vessel pool arrangement is a variable time charter with the\nvariable lease payments recorded as income in profit or loss in the period in which the changes in facts and circumstances on which the variable lease payments are based occur.\nVoyage expenses\nVoyage expenses, consist of: (a) port, canal and bunker expenses unique to a particular charter that the Company incurs primarily when its vessels operate under voyage charter\narrangements or during repositioning periods, and (b) brokerage commissions. All voyage expenses are expensed as incurred, except for contract fulfilment costs which are capitalized to\nthe extent the Company, in its reasonable judgement, determines that they (i) are directly related to a contract, (ii) will be recoverable and (iii) enhance the Company’s resources by\nputting the Company’s vessel in a location to satisfy its performance obligation under a contract pursuant to the provisions of ASC 340-40 “Other assets and deferred costs”. These\ncapitalized contract costs are amortized on a straight-line basis as the related performance obligations are satisfied. Costs to fulfill the contract prior to arriving at the load port primarily\nconsist of bunkers which are deferred and amortized during the voyage period. These capitalized contract fulfilment costs are recorded under “Deferred charges, net” in the\naccompanying balance sheet. At the inception of a time charter, the Company records the difference between the cost of bunker fuel delivered by the terminating charterer and the\nbunker fuel sold to the new charterer as a bunker gain or loss within voyage expenses.\nAccounting for Financial Instruments\nThe principal financial assets of the Company consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, amounts due from related parties and trade receivables, net. The principal\nfinancial liabilities of the Company consist of trade and other payables, accrued liabilities, long-term debt and amounts due to related parties.\nFair value measurements\nThe Company follows the provisions of ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” which defines, and provides guidance as to the measurement of fair value. ASC 820\ncreates a hierarchy of measurement and indicates that, when possible, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority (Level 1) to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority (Level 3) to unobservable data, for\nexample, the reporting entity’s own data. Under the standard, fair value measurements are separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy.\nF-12\nTable of Contents\nTORO CORP. PREDECESSOR\nNOTES TO COMBINED CARVE-OUT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in U.S. Dollars – unless otherwise stated)\n2. Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements: (continued)\nRepairs and Maintenance\nAll repair and maintenance expenses including underwater inspection expenses are expensed in the period incurred. Such costs are included in Vessel operating expenses in the\naccompanying combined carve-out statement of comprehensive loss.\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company engages in the operation of Aframax/LR2 and Handysize tanker vessels which have been identified as two reportable segments as a result of the different\ncharacteristics of these two asset classes. The reportable segments reflect the internal organization of the Company and the way the chief operating decision maker reviews the operating\nresults and allocates capital within the Company. The accounting policies applied to the reportable segments are the same as those used in the preparation of the Company’s financial\nstatements. When the Company charters a vessel to a charterer, the charterer is free to trade the vessel worldwide and, as a result, the disclosure of geographic information is\nimpracticable.\nFinancing Costs\nCosts associated with long-term debt, including but not limited to, fees paid to lenders, fees required to be paid to third parties on the lender’s behalf in connection with debt\nfinancing or refinancing, or any unamortized portion thereof, are presented by the Company as a reduction of long-term debt. Such fees are deferred and amortized in interest and finance\ncosts during the life of the related debt instrument using the effective interest method. Any unamortized balance of costs relating to loans repaid or refinanced is expensed in interest and\nfinance costs in the period in which the repayment or refinancing occurs, in accordance with the debt extinguishment guidance. Any unamortized balance of costs relating to refinanced\nlong-term debt is deferred and amortized over the term of the credit facility in the period that such refinancing occurs, subject to the provisions of the accounting guidance prescribed\nunder 470-50, Debt—Modifications and Extinguishments.\nCommitments and contingencies\nCommitments are recognized when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying\neconomic benefits will be required to settle this obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and\nadjusted to reflect the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation. Contingent liabilities are not recognized in the financial statements but are\ndisclosed unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote. Contingent assets are not recognized in the financial statements but are disclosed\nwhen an inflow of economic benefits is probable.\nAssets held for sale: The Company classifies a group of assets as being held for sale when all of the following criteria, enumerated under ASC 360 “Property, Plant, and\nEquipment”, are met: (i) management has committed to a plan to sell the assets; (ii) the assets are available for immediate sale in their present condition; (iii) an active program to locate a\nbuyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the assets have been initiated; (iv) the sale of the assets is probable, and transfer of the assets is expected to qualify for\nrecognition as a completed sale within one year; (v) the assets are being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to their current fair value; and (vi) actions\nrequired to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. Long-lived assets classified as held for sale\nare measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. The resulting difference, if any, is recorded under “Impairment loss” in the combined carve-out\nstatements of comprehensive (loss)/income. An asset ceases being depreciated once it meets the held for sale classification criteria.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements:\nManagement does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s combined\ncarve-out financial statements.\nF-13\nTable of Contents\nTORO CORP.

Transactions with Related Parties:\nDuring the period ended December 31, 2021, and the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred the following charges in connection with related party transactions,\nwhich are included in the accompanying combined carve-out financial statements:\nPeriod ended Year ended\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2021 2022\nManagement fees-related parties\nManagement fees – Pavimar (b) $ 1,308,600 $ 977,400\nManagement fees – Castor Ships (a) 545,250 1,856,100\nIncluded in Voyage expenses\nCharter hire commissions – Castor Ships (a) $ 372,037 $ 1,437,276\nIncluded in General and administrative expenses\nAdministration fees – Castor Ships (a) $ 326,642 $ 624,087\nIncluded in Gain on sale of vessel\nSale & purchase commission – Castor Ships (a) $ — $ 131,500\nAs of December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2022, balances with related parties consisted of the following:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2021 2022\nAssets:\nDue from Pavimar (b) – current $ — $ —\nDue from Pavimar (b) – non-current 810,437 —\nDue from Castor Ships (a) – current — 558,327\nDue from Castor Ships (a) – non-current — 1,708,474\nLiabilities:\nDue to Pavimar (b) – current $ 2,319,913 $ —\nVoyage commissions, management fees and other expenses due to Castor Ships (a) 158,800 —\n3. Transactions with Related Parties: (continued)\n(a) Castor Ships:\nDuring the period ended December 31, 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2022, Castor Ships provided the Toro Subsidiaries with commercial ship management, chartering and\nadministrative services, including, but not limited to, securing employment for the vessels, arranging and supervising the vessels’ commercial functions, handling all vessel sale and\npurchase transactions, undertaking related shipping project and management advisory and support services, as well as other associated services requested from time to time by the Toro\nSubsidiaries (the “Ship Management Agreements”). In exchange for these services, the Toro Subsidiaries paid Castor Ships (i) a daily fee of $250 per vessel for the provision of the\nservices under the Ship Management Agreements, (ii) a commission of 1.25% on all charter agreements arranged by Castor Ships and (iii) a commission of 1% on each vessel sale and\npurchase transaction.\nEffective July 1, 2022, Castor entered into an Amended and Restated Master Management Agreement with Castor Ships. Under such agreement, Castor Ships has agreed to provide\nCastor, including the Toro Subsidiaries, with a broad range of management services such as crew management, technical management, operational employment management, insurance\nmanagement, provisioning, bunkering, accounting and audit support services, commercial, chartering and administrative services, including, but not limited to, securing employment for\nthe Company’s fleet, arranging and supervising the vessels’ commercial operations, providing technical assistance where requested in connection with the sale of a vessel, negotiating\nloan and credit terms for new financing upon request and providing general corporate and administrative services, among other matters, which it may choose to subcontract to other\nparties at its discretion. Castor Ships shall generally not be liable to the Company for any loss, damage, delay or expense incurred during the provision of the foregoing services, except\ninsofar as such events arise from Castor Ships or its employees’ fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct (for which our recovery will be limited to two times the Flat Management\nFee, as defined below).\nIn exchange for these services, Castor, including the Toro Subsidiaries, pay Castor Ships (i) a flat quarterly management fee in the amount of $0.75 million for the management and\nadministration of their business (the “Flat Management Fee”), (ii) a commission of 1.25% on all gross income received from the operation of their vessels, and (iii) a commission of 1% on\neach consummated sale and purchase transaction. In addition, each of Castor’s subsidiaries have agreed to pay Castor Ships a daily fee of $975 per tanker vessel for the provision of\ncommercial and technical ship management services provided under the ship management agreements (the “Ship Management Fee”). The Ship Management Fee and Flat Management\nFee will be adjusted annually for inflation on each anniversary of the effective date of the Amended and Restated Master Management Agreement. Castor will also reimburse Castor\nShips for extraordinary fees and costs, such as the costs of extraordinary repairs, maintenance or structural changes to Castor’s vessels. The Amended and Restated Master\nManagement Agreement has a term of eight years from its effective date and this term automatically renews for a successive eight-year term on each anniversary of the effective date,\nstarting from the first anniversary of the effective date, unless the agreements are terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions contained therein, in which case the payment of a\ntermination fee equal to seven times the total amount of the Flat Management Fee calculated on an annual basis may be due in certain circumstances. As part of the spin off of the\nCompany, on March 7 2023, Toro entered into a master management agreement with Castor Ships with respect to its vessels in substantially the same form as Castor’s Amended and\nRestated Master Management Agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2022, in accordance with the provisions of the Amended and Restated Master Management Agreement, Castor Ships had subcontracted to two third-party ship\nmanagement companies the technical management of all the Company’s vessels. Castor Ships pays, at its own expense, the tanker third-party technical management companies a fee for\nthe services it has subcontracted to them, without any additional cost to Castor.\nDuring the period ended December 31, 2021, and the year ended December 31, 2022, the Toro Subsidiaries were charged by Castor Ships with (i) management fees amounting to $\n545,250 and $ 1,856,100, respectively, which are included in Management fees to related parties in the accompanying combined carve-out statements of comprehensive (loss)/income, and\n(ii) charter hire commissions amounting to $372,037 and $1,437,276, respectively, which are included in ‘Voyage expenses’ in the accompanying combined carve-out statements of\ncomprehensive (loss)/income.

Transactions with Related Parties: (continued)\nIn addition, part of the general and administrative expenses incurred by Castor has been allocated on a pro rata basis within General and administrative expenses of the Company\nbased on the proportion of the number of ownership days of the Toro Subsidiaries’ vessels to the total ownership days of Castor’s fleet. These expenses consisted mainly of\nadministration costs charged by Castor Ships, investor relations, legal, audit and consultancy fees. During the period ended December 31, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2022,\nadministration fees charged by Castor Ships to Castor that were allocated to the Company amounted to $326,642 and $624,087, respectively and are included in ‘General and\nadministrative expenses’ in the accompanying combined carve-out statements of comprehensive (loss)/income.\nThe Amended and Restated Master Management Agreement also provides for an advance funding equal to one month of vessel daily operating costs to be placed with Castor\nShips as a working capital guarantee, refundable in case a vessel is no longer under Castor Ship’s management. As of December 31, 2022, such advances amounted to $1,708,474 and are\npresented in ‘Due from related parties, non-current’, in the accompanying combined balance sheet. In connection with the subcontracting services rendered by the third-party ship-\nmanagement companies, the Company had, as of December 31, 2022, paid Castor Ships working capital guarantee deposits aggregating to the amount of $1,210,437 and a net amount of\n$57,619 was due from Castor Ships in relation to operating expenses payments made by it on behalf of Castor. As a result, as of December 31, 2022, the net amount of $558,327 (i.e net of\n$709,729 as mentioned above), was due from Castor Ships which is presented in ‘Due from related parties, current’ in the accompanying combined carve-out balance sheet.\n(b) Pavimar:\nDuring the period ended December 31, 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2022, Pavimar provided the Toro Subsidiaries with a wide range of shipping services, including crew\nmanagement, technical management, operational management, insurance management, provisioning, bunkering, vessel accounting and audit support services, which it could choose to\nsubcontract to other parties at its discretion (the “Technical Management Agreements”) in exchange for which Pavimar was paid a daily fee of $600 per vessel. Effective July 1, 2022, the\ntechnical management agreements entered into between Pavimar and the Company’s tanker vessel owning subsidiaries were terminated by mutual consent. In connection with such\ntermination, Pavimar and the tanker vessel owning subsidiaries agreed to mutually discharge and release each other from any past and future liabilities arising from the respective\nagreements.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and through June 30, 2022, Pavimar had subcontracted the technical management of all tanker vessels and the operational management of six tanker\nvessels to third-party ship-management companies. These third-party management companies provided technical and operational management to the respective vessels for a fixed\nannual fee which was paid by Pavimar at its own expense. In connection with the subcontracting services rendered by the third-party ship-management companies, as of December 31,\n2021, working capital guarantee deposits amounting to $1,310,437 were owed from Pavimar. As of December 31, 2021, $810,437 of these guarantee deposits is presented in ‘Due from\nrelated party, non-current’ and $500,000 is netted within ‘Due to related parties, current’. In addition, Pavimar and its subcontractor third-party managers made payments for operating\nexpenses with funds paid from the Toro Subsidiaries to Pavimar. As of December 31, 2021, $2,819,913 was owed to Pavimar in relation to expenditures made by Pavimar on behalf of the\nToro Subsidiaries. As a result, as of December 31, 2021, a net amount of $2,319,913 was due from the Company to Pavimar and its subcontracting third-party managers which are\npresented in ‘Due to related parties, current’, in the accompanying combined carve-out balance sheets.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and taking into account the termination of technical management agreements with effect from July 1, 2022, there are no remaining obligations from Pavimar\nto the Company.\nDuring the period ended December 31, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2022, management fees under the Technical Management Agreements amounted to $1,308,600 and\n$977,400, respectively, and are separately presented in ‘Management fees to related parties’ in the accompanying combined carve-out statements of comprehensive income\n(loss)/income.\n(c) Pool Agreement\nIn the period between September 30, 2022, and December 12, 2022, all Aframax/LR2 tanker vessels, entered into a series of separate agreements with V8 Pool Inc., a member of Navig8\nGroup of companies, for the participation of the vessels in the V8 plus pool (the “V8 Plus Pool”), a pool operating Aframax tankers aged fifteen (15) years or more.

All the 2021 Vessel Acquisitions were concluded on delivery during the period ended December 31, 2021 and were financed with the net contributions from\nCastor and the net debt proceeds further discussed under Note 6. All vessels except two were acquired charter free. The vessels Wonder Polaris and Wonder Sirius were on a time\ncharter with expiration within one year. A separate agreement was entered into with the prior owner, the charterer and the new owner to novate the time charter to the Company, as the\npurchase of the vessels did not automatically entail the transfer of the charter. The Company considered whether any value should be assigned to the attached charter party agreements\nnovated for vessels Wonder Polaris and Wonder Sirius and concluded that the contracted daily charter rate were at market rates by obtaining independent broker valuations that\nreflected the fair value of the vessel with and without the attached time charter and hence no allocation of value was assigned to the agreements.\nThe Company accounted for all its acquisitions as acquisition of assets, as the fair values of the vessels are concentrated in a single identifiable asset.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, there were no acquisitions.\nThe Company reviewed all its vessels for impairment, and none were found to be impaired at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022.\n(c) Vessels Disposal:\nDue to a favorable offer, on May 9, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with an unaffiliated third party for the sale of the M/T Wonder Arcturus, for a gross sale price of\n$13.15 million. The vessel was delivered to its new owners on July 15, 2022. In connection with the subject sale, the Company recognized during the third quarter of 2022 a net gain of\n$3.2 million which is separately presented in ‘Gain on sale of vessel’ in the accompanying combined statements of comprehensive (loss)/income.\nAs of December 31, 2022, two vessels in the Company’s fleet having an aggregate carrying value of $24.8 million were first priority mortgaged as security for their respective loan\nfacility (Note 6).\n6.

PREDECESSOR\nNOTES TO COMBINED CARVE-OUT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in U.S. Dollars – unless otherwise stated)\n6. Long-Term Debt: (continued)\n$18.0 Million Term Loan Facility\nOn April 27, 2021, Rocket and Gamora, entered into a $18.0 million senior secured term loan facility with Alpha Bank S.A. The facility was drawn down in two tranches on May 7,\n2021. This facility has a term of four years from the drawdown date, bears interest at a margin over LIBOR per annum and is repayable in (a) sixteen (16) quarterly instalments (1 to 4 in the\namount of $850,000 and 5 to 16 in the amount of $675,000) and (b) a balloon installment in the amount of $6.5 million, such balloon instalment payable at maturity together with the last\nrepayment instalment.\nThe above facility is secured by first preferred mortgage and first priority general assignment covering earnings, insurances and requisition compensation over the vessels owned\nby the borrowers, (the Wonder Sirius and the Wonder Polaris), an earnings account pledge, shares security deed relating to the shares of the vessels’ owning subsidiaries, manager’s\nundertakings and, as of December 31, 2022, was guaranteed by the Parent. In connection with the contribution of the Toro Subsidiaries to Toro, Toro replaced Parent as Guarantor under\nthis senior secured credit facility. The facility will also contain certain new customary minimum liquidity restrictions and financial covenants that require the borrowers to (i) maintain a\ncertain level of minimum free liquidity per collateralized vessel and (ii) meet a specified minimum security requirement ratio, which is the ratio of the aggregate market value of the\nmortgaged vessels plus the value of any additional security and the value of the minimum liquidity deposits referred to above, to the aggregate principal amounts due under the facility.\nThis facility’s net proceeds were used to fund the 2021 Vessel Acquisitions (Note 5) and for general corporate purposes.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company did not enter into any new or amended loan agreements and made scheduled principal repayments amounting to $3.1 million\nwith respect to its $18.0 Million Term Loan Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the borrowers were in compliance with all financial covenants prescribed in the above debt agreement.\nRestricted cash as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022, non-current, comprises $0.7 million of minimum liquidity deposits required pursuant to the $18.0 Million Term Loan\nFacility.\nThe annual principal payments for the Toro Subsidiaries’ outstanding debt arrangement as of December 31, 2022, required to be made after the balance sheet date, are as follows:\nTwelve-month period ending December 31, Amount\n2023 $ 2,700,000\n2024 2,700,000\n2025 7,850,000\nTotal long-term debt $ 13,250,000\nThe weighted average interest rate on long-term debt for the period ended December 31, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2022, was 3.3% and 4.9%, respectively.\nTotal interest incurred on long-term debt for the period ended December 31, 2021, and the year ended December 31, 2022, amounted to $383,186 and $719,105, respectively, and is\nincluded in Interest and finance costs (Note 11) in the accompanying combined carve-out statements of comprehensive (loss)/income.\nF-17\nTable of Contents\nTORO CORP. PREDECESSOR\nNOTES TO COMBINED CARVE-OUT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in U.S. Dollars – unless otherwise stated)\n7. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Disclosures:\nThe principal financial assets of the Company consist of cash at banks, restricted cash, trade accounts receivable and amounts due from related parties. The principal financial\nliabilities of the Company consist of trade accounts payable, amounts due to related parties and long-term debt.\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments:\n• Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable trade, net, amounts due from/to related party/(ies) and accounts payable: The carrying values reported in the combined carve-\nout balance sheets for those financial instruments are reasonable estimates of their fair values due to their short-term maturity nature. Cash and cash equivalents are\nconsidered Level 1 items as they represent liquid assets with short term maturities. The carrying value approximates the fair market value for interest bearing cash classified as\nrestricted cash, non-current and is considered Level 1 item of the fair value hierarchy.\n• Long-term debt: The secured credit facility discussed in Note 6, has a recorded value which is a reasonable estimate of its fair value due to its variable interest rate and is thus\nconsidered Level 2 item in accordance with the fair value hierarchy as LIBOR rates are observable at commonly quoted intervals for the full terms of the loans.\nConcentration of credit risk: Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of cash and cash\nequivalents, due from related parties and trade accounts receivable. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents, consisting mostly of deposits, with high credit qualified financial\ninstitutions. The Company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of the financial institutions in which it places its deposits. The Company limits its credit risk with\naccounts receivable by performing ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition.\n8. Commitments and Contingencies:\nVarious claims, lawsuits, and complaints, including those involving government regulations and product liability, arise in the ordinary course of the shipping business. In addition,\nlosses may arise from disputes with charterers, pool operators, agents, insurance and other claims with suppliers relating to the operations of the Company’s vessels. Currently,\nmanagement is not aware of any such claims or contingent liabilities, which should be disclosed, or for which a provision should be established in the accompanying combined carve-\nout financial statements.\nThe Company accrues for the cost of environmental liabilities when management becomes aware that a liability is probable and is able to reasonably estimate the probable exposure.\nCurrently, management is not aware of any such claims or contingent liabilities that should be disclosed or for which a provision should be established in the accompanying combined\ncarve-out financial statements. The Company is covered for liabilities associated with the vessels’ actions to the maximum limits as provided by Protection and Indemnity (P&I) Clubs,\nmembers of the International Group of P&I Clubs.\nF-18\nTable of Contents\nTORO CORP. PREDECESSOR\nNOTES TO COMBINED CARVE-OUT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in U.S. Dollars – unless otherwise stated)\n(a) Commitments under Contracts for BWTS Installation\nAs of December 31, 2022, there are commitments relating to two installations expected to be concluded during 2024. It is estimated that the remaining contractual obligations related\nto these purchases, excluding installation costs, will be on aggregate approximately €1.2 million (or $1.3 million on the basis of a Euro/US Dollar exchange rate of €1.0000/$1.06749 as of\nDecember 31, 2022), all of which are due in 2024. These costs will be capitalized and depreciated over the remainder of the life of each vessel.\n9. Vessel Revenues:\nThe Company generates its revenues from time charters, voyage contracts and pool arrangements.\nThe Company typically enters into time charters ranging from one month to twelve months and in isolated cases on longer terms depending on market conditions. The charterer has\nthe full discretion over the ports visited, shipping routes and vessel speed, subject to the owner protective restrictions discussed below. Time charter agreements may have extension\noptions that range over certain time periods, usually months. The time charter party generally provides, among others, typical warranties regarding the speed and the performance of the\nvessel as well as owner protective restrictions such that the vessel is sent only to safe ports by the charterer, subject always to compliance with applicable sanction laws and war risks,\nand carry only lawful and non-hazardous cargo.\nVessels are also chartered under voyage charters, where a contract is made for the use of a vessel under which the Company is paid freight on the basis of transporting cargo from a\nloading port to a discharge port. Depending on charterparty terms, freight can be fully prepaid, or be paid upon reaching the discharging destination upon delivery of the cargo, at the\ndischarging destination but before discharging, or during a ship’s voyage.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company employed all of its vessels in pools. The main objective of pools is to enter into arrangements for the employment and operation of the pool\nvessels, so as to secure for the pool participants the highest commercially available earnings per vessel on the basis of pooling the revenue and expenses of the pool vessels and\ndividing it between the pool participants based on the terms of the pool agreement. The Company typically enters into pool arrangements for a minimum period of six months, subject to\ncertain rights of suspension and/or early termination.\nAs of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, trade accounts receivable, net, related to voyage charters, amounted to $2,462,714 and $3,046,863, respectively. This decrease by\n$584,149 trade accounts receivable, net was mainly attributable to the timing of collections. As of December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2022, deferred assets related to voyage charters\nwere $25,335 and $0, respectively, and are presented under ‘Deferred charges’ (Current) in the accompanying combined carve-out balance sheets. This change was mainly attributable to\nthe timing of commencement of revenue recognition. The unamortized portion of deferred assets as of December 31, 2021, amounting to $25,335 was recognized as revenue in the first\nquarter of 2022.\n10.

S. and (b) either (i) more than 50 percent of the value of the company’s stock is owned, directly or indirectly, by individuals who are “residents” of the company’s\ncountry of organization or of another foreign country that grants an “equivalent exemption” to corporations organized in the U.S. (the “50% Ownership Test”) or (ii) the company’s stock\nis “primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market” in its country of organization, in another country that grants an “equivalent exemption” to U.S. corporations, or in\nthe U.S. (the “Publicly-Traded Test”). Marshall Islands, the jurisdiction where the Toro Subsidiaries are incorporated, grants an equivalent exemption to United States corporations.\nTherefore, the Company is exempt from United States federal income taxation with respect to U.S.-source shipping income if either the 50% Ownership Test or the Publicly Traded Test is\nmet.\nIn the Company’s case, it expects that it would satisfy the Publicly-Traded Test if its common shares represented more than 50% of the voting power of its stock, and it can\nestablish that nonqualified shareholders cannot exercise voting control over the corporation because a qualified shareholder controls the non-traded voting stock. The Company\ntherefore believes its stock structure, when considered by the U.S. Treasury in light of the Publicly-Traded Test enunciated in the regulations, satisfies the intent and purpose of the\nexemption. This position is uncertain and was disclosed to the Internal Revenue Service when the Company filed its U.S. tax returns for 2021. It will be disclosed again when the\nCompany files its U.S. tax returns for 2022.\nBecause the position stated above is uncertain, the Company has recorded a provision of $206,174 for the period ended December 31, 2021 and $960,181 for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 for U.S. source gross transportation income tax in the accompanying combined carve-out statement of comprehensive income.\n14. Subsequent Events:\nCompletion of the Spin-Off: On March 7, 2023, Castor completed the spin-off of the Company. On that day, Castor distributed all of the Company’s common shares outstanding to\nits holders of common stock of record at the close of business on February 22, 2023 at a ratio of one Company common share for every ten Castor common shares. As part of the spin-\noff, the Company entered into various other agreements effecting the separation of its business from Castor including a master management agreement with Castor Ships with respect to\nits vessels in substantially the same form as the Castor’s Master Management Agreement for its vessels and a Contribution and Spin-Off Distribution Agreement, pursuant to which,\namong other things, (i) the Company agreed to indemnify Castor for any and all obligations and other liabilities arising from or relating to the operation, management or employment of\nthe vessels contributed to it or its vessel-owning subsidiaries and Castor agreed to indemnify the Company and its vessel-owning subsidiaries for any and all obligations and other\nliabilities arising from or relating to the operation, management or employment of vessels or subsidiaries that Castor retains after the Distribution Date, and (ii) the Company replaced\nCastor as guarantor under the $18.0 Million Term Loan Facility. The Contribution and Spin-Off Distribution Agreement also provided for the settlement or extinguishment of certain\nliabilities and other obligations between the Company and Castor and provides to Castor with certain registration rights relating to Company’s common shares, if any, issued upon\nconversion of Company’s Series A preferred shares issued to Castor in connection with the spin-off.\nF-21\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the stockholder and the Board of Directors of Toro Corp.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Toro Corp. and its subsidiary (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022, the related consolidated statements of\ncomprehensive loss, shareholder’s equity, and cash flows, for the period July 29,2022 (date of inception) to December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the\n“financial statements”).

Basis of Presentation and General information: (continued)\nThe Balance sheet, Statement of Comprehensive Loss, Cash Flow and Changes in Total Stockholders’ equity and related notes represent the period from July 29, 2022 (the inception\ndate) to December 31, 2022.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) and\napplicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Toro and its wholly owned\nsubsidiary, Toro RBX Corp. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.\n2. Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements:\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses\nduring the reporting period. Significant estimates include vessel valuations, the valuation of amounts due from charterers, residual value and the useful life of the vessels. Actual results\nmay differ from these estimates.\nOther comprehensive income/(loss)\nThe Company follows the accounting guidance relating to consolidated comprehensive income/(loss), which requires separate presentation of certain transactions that are recorded\ndirectly as components in Stockholder’s deficit. The Company has no other comprehensive loss items and, accordingly, comprehensive loss equals net income/ (loss) for the period\npresented.\nForeign currency translation\nThe Company’s reporting and functional currency is the U.S. Dollar (“USD”). Transactions incurred in other currencies are translated into USD using the exchange rates in effect at\nthe time of the transactions. At the balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in other currencies are translated into USD to reflect the end-of-period\nexchange rates and any gains or losses are included in the statement of comprehensive loss.\nLoss Per Share\nThe computation of basic loss per share is based on the weighted average number of common stock outstanding during the period. The computation of basic loss per share is\ncalculated by dividing by the weighted average number of shares.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements:\nManagement does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s financial\nstatements.\n3. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Disclosures:\nThe principal financial liabilities of the Company consist of cash overdraft.\n• The carrying value reported of Cash overdraft is a reasonable estimate of its fair value due to short-term maturity and is considered Level 1 item in fair value hierarchy.\nF-28\nTORO CORP.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in U.S. Dollars – unless otherwise stated)\n4. Interest and Finance Costs:\nThe amount of $32 which is presented in the statement of comprehensive loss is related to bank charges.\n5.

The Toro Series A Preferred Shares are convertible, in whole or in\npart, at their holder’s option, to Toro common shares from and after the third anniversary of their issue date and prior to the seventh anniversary of such date at the lower of (i) 150% of\nthe volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) of Toro’s common shares over the five consecutive trading day period commencing on and including the Distribution Date, and (ii) the\nVWAP of the Toro common shares over the 10 consecutive trading day period expiring on the trading day immediately prior to the date of delivery of written notice of the conversion;\nprovided, that, in no event shall the conversion price be less than $2.50.\nOn the Distribution Date, Castor distributed all of the Company common shares outstanding to its holders of common stock of record at the close of business on February 22, 2023\n(the “Record Date”).

The vessel management agreements with Castor Ships previously entered into for each of the vessels by the applicable vessel-owning\nToro Subsidiary will remain in effect for each such vessel.\nF-29\nTORO CORP.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in U.S. Dollars – unless otherwise stated)\nIn addition, as part of the Spin-Off, the Company entered into various other agreements effecting the separation of its business from Castor including a Contribution and Spin-Off\nDistribution Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, (i) Castor agreed to indemnify the Company and its vessel-owning subsidiaries for any and all obligations and other\nliabilities arising from or relating to the operation, management or employment of vessels or subsidiaries Castor retains after the Distribution Date and Company agreed to indemnify\nCastor for any and all obligations and other liabilities arising from or relating to the operation, management or employment of the vessels contributed to it or its vessel-owning\nsubsidiaries, and (ii) the Company agreed to replace Castor as guarantor under the $18.0 Million Term Loan Facility upon completion of the Spin-Off. The Contribution and Spin-Off\nDistribution Agreement also provided for the settlement or extinguishment of certain liabilities and other obligations between Castor and Toro and provides Castor with certain\nregistration rights relating to Toro’s common shares, if any, issued upon conversion of the Toro Series A preferred shares issued to Castor in connection with the Spin-Off.\nFollowing the successful completion of the Spin Off Toro will reimburse Castor for expenses related to the Spin off that have been incurred by Castor, provided that Toro will not\nreimburse Castor for any of these expenses that were incurred or paid by any of the Toro subsidiaries of Castor up to March 7, 2023.\nF-30\nExhibit 2.2\nDESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT’S SECURITIES REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934\nAs of the date of the annual report to which this exhibit is being filed, Toro Corp.

We encourage you to refer to our Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws and the Rights Agreement for additional\ninformation.\nCapitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings given to them in our Annual Report.\nOUR SHARE CAPITAL\nUnder our Articles of Incorporation our authorized capital stock consists of 4,000,000,000 registered shares, of which 3,900,000,000 are designated as common shares, par value\n$0.001 per share, and 100,000,000 are designated as preferred shares, par value $0.001 per share. As of March 7, 2023, we had issued and outstanding 9,461,009 common shares, 140,000\n1.00% Series A Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Shares and 40,000 Series B Preferred Shares. No Series C Participating Preferred Shares were authorized as of the\nsame time. Our common shares and associated Rights are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “TORO”.\nAny amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to alter our capital structure requires approval by an affirmative majority of the voting power of the total number of shares\nissued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereon. Shareholders of any series or class of shares are entitled to vote upon any proposed amendment, whether or not entitled to vote\nthereon by the Articles of Incorporation, if such amendment would (i) increase or decrease the par value of the shares of such series or class, or, (ii) alter or change the powers,\npreferences or special rights of the shares of such series or class so as to adversely affect them. Such class vote would be conducted in addition to the vote of all shares entitled to vote\nupon the amendment and requires approval by an affirmative majority of the voting power of the affected series or class.\nDESCRIPTION OF COMMON SHARES\nHolders of common shares do not have conversion, sinking fund, redemption or pre-emptive rights to subscribe to any of our securities.

Pelagos is a company controlled by Petros Panagiotidis, our Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer. As a result, we are controlled by Pelagos and it may be more difficult to effect a change of control of us.\nDividend Rights\nSubject to preferences that may be applicable to any outstanding preferred shares, including the Series A Preferred Shares, holders of common shares are entitled to receive\nratably all dividends, if any, declared by our Board out of funds legally available for dividends.\nOur Series A Preferred Shares provide that holders of Series A Preferred Shares shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by our Board, but only out of funds legally\navailable therefor, cumulative cash dividends at the Annual Rate and no more, payable quarterly in arrears on the 15th day of each January, April, July and October, respectively, in each\nyear, beginning on April 15, 2023 (each, a “Dividend Payment Date”), with respect to the Dividend Period ending on the day preceding such respective Dividend Payment Date. So long\nas any Series A Preferred Share remains outstanding, unless full Accrued Dividends on all outstanding Series A Preferred Shares through and including the most recently completed\nDividend Period have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside for payment, no dividend may be declared or paid or set aside for payment,\nand no distribution may be made, on any Junior Stock, other than a dividend payable solely in stock that ranks junior to the Series A Preferred Shares in the payment of dividends and in\nthe distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company.\nFor purposes of the Series A Preferred Shares:\n(i) “Accrued Dividends” means an amount computed at the Annual Rate from, as to each share, the date of issuance of such share to and including the date to which such\ndividends are to be accrued (whether or not such dividends have been declared), less the aggregate amount of all dividends previously paid on such share;\n(ii) “Annual Rate” means (A) from, and including, March 7, 2023 to, but excluding, the seventh anniversary of such date (the “Reset Date”), 1.00% per annum of the stated\namount and (B) for each Dividend Period commencing on or after the Reset Date, the Annual Rate in effect for the prior Dividend Period multiplied by a factor of 1.3; provided, however,\nthat in no event will the Annual Rate on the Series A Preferred Shares exceed 20% per annum in respect of any Dividend Period;\n(iii) “Dividend Period” means each period commencing on (and including) a Dividend Payment Date and continuing to (but not including) the next succeeding Dividend\nPayment Date, except that the first Dividend Period for the initial issuance of the Series A Preferred Shares shall commence on (and include) March 7, 2023; and\n(iv) “Junior Stock” means, with respect to the Series A Preferred Shares, our common shares, the Series B Preferred Shares and any class or series of our stock that ranks junior\nto the Series A Preferred Shares in the payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up.\nSo long as any Series A Preferred Share remains outstanding, unless full Accrued Dividends on all outstanding Series A Preferred Shares through and including the most\nrecently completed Dividend Period have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside for payment, no monies may be paid or made available for\na sinking fund for the redemption or retirement of Junior Stock, nor shall any shares of Junior Stock be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by us, directly or\nindirectly, other than (i) as a result of (x) a reclassification of Junior Stock, or (y) the exchange or conversion of one share of Junior Stock for or into another share of stock that ranks\njunior to the Series A Preferred Shares in the payment of dividends and in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company; or (ii) through the use\nof the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of stock that rank junior to the Series A Preferred Shares in the payment of dividends and in the distribution of\nassets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company.\nLiquidation Rights\nUpon our dissolution or liquidation or winding up of our affairs, whether voluntary or involuntary, after payment in full of all amounts required to be paid to creditors and to the\nholders of preferred shares having liquidation preferences, including the Series A Preferred Shares, the holders of our common shares are entitled to receive pro rata our remaining assets\navailable for distribution.\nOur Series A Preferred Shares provide that in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, before any\ndistribution or payment out of our assets may be made to or set aside for the holders of any Junior Stock, holders of Series A Preferred Shares will be entitled to receive out of our assets\nlegally available for distribution to our shareholders an amount equal to the stated amount per Series A Preferred Share ($1,000), together with an amount equal to all Accrued Dividends\nto the date of payment whether or not earned or declared (the “Liquidation Preference”).

Each Right entitles the holder to purchase from the Company, for $22, one common share (or one one-thousandth of a share of Series C Participating Preferred Shares) and\nwill become exercisable following the earlier of (i) the tenth business day (or other date designated by resolution of the Board) after any person other than our Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer, Petros Panagiotidis, or Mr. Panagiotidis’ controlled affiliates commences a tender offer that would result in such person becoming the beneficial owner of a total of 15%\nor more of the common shares or (ii) the date of the “Flip-in” Trigger, as defined below.\nThe rights plan adopted under the Rights Agreement and the Rights have the following characteristics:\n• Distribution and Transfer of the Rights. Our Board will declare a dividend of one Right for each share of our common shares outstanding. Prior to the Separation Time\nreferred to below, the Rights would be evidenced by and trade with our common shares and would not be exercisable. After the Separation Time, we would cause the\nRights Agent to mail Rights certificates to shareholders and the Rights would trade independent of the common shares. New Rights will accompany any new common\nshares of the Company issued after the Distribution until the Separation Time.\n• Separation Time. Rights would separate from our common shares and become exercisable following the earlier of (i) the tenth (10) business day (or other date\ndesignated by resolution of the Board) after any person (other than Mr. Panagiotidis or his controlled affiliates) commences a tender offer that would result in such\nperson becoming the beneficial owner of a total of 15% or more of the common shares or (ii) the date of the “Flip-in” Trigger.\n• Exercise of the Rights. On or after the Separation Time, each Right would initially entitle the holder to purchase, for $22 (the “Exercise Price”), one common share (or\none one-thousandth of a share of Series C Participating Preferred Shares, such portion of a Series C Participating Preferred Share being designed to give the\nshareholder approximately the same dividend, voting and liquidation rights as would one common share). Prior to exercise, the Right does not give its holder any\ndividend, voting, or liquidation rights.\n• “Flip-in” Trigger. Upon public announcement by the Company that any person other than Mr. Panagiotidis or his controlled affiliates (an “Acquiring Person”) has\nacquired 15% or more of our outstanding common shares:\n(i) Rights owned by the Acquiring Person or transferees thereof would automatically be void; and\n(ii) each other Right will automatically become a right to buy, for the Exercise Price, that number of common shares of the Company (or equivalent fractional shares\nof Series C Participating Preferred Shares) having a market value of twice the Exercise Price.\n• “Flip-over” Trigger. After an Acquiring Person has become such, (i) the Company may not consolidate or merge with any person, if the Company’s Board is\ncontrolled by the Acquiring Person or the Acquiring Person is the beneficial owner of 50% or more of the outstanding shares of our common shares, and the\ntransaction is with the Acquiring Person or its affiliate or associate or the shares owned by the Acquiring Person are treated differently from those of other\nshareholders, and (ii) the Company may not sell 50% or more of its assets if the Company’s Board is controlled by the Acquiring Person unless in either case proper\nprovision is made so that each Right would thereafter become a right to buy, for the Exercise Price, that number of common shares of such other person having a\nmarket value of twice the Exercise Price.\n• Redemption. The Rights may be redeemed by the Board, at any time until a “Flip-in” Trigger has occurred, at a redemption price of $0.001 per Right.\n• Power to Amend. Our Board may amend the Rights Agreement in any respect until a “Flip-in” Trigger has occurred. Thereafter, our Board may amend the Rights\nAgreement in any respect not materially adverse to Rights holders generally.\n• Expiration. The Rights will expire on the tenth anniversary of the Distribution Date.\nFurthermore, if any person (other than Mr. Panagiotidis or his controlled affiliates) acquires between 15% and 50% of our outstanding common shares, the Board may, in lieu of\nallowing Rights to be exercised, require each outstanding Right to be exchanged for one common share of the Company (or one one-thousandth of a share of Series C Participating\nPreferred Shares). The Board may enter into a trust agreement pursuant to which the Company would deposit into a trust its common shares that would be distributable to shareholders\n(excluding the Acquiring Person) in the event this exchange option is implemented.\nCertain synthetic interests in securities created by derivative positions, whether or not such interests are considered to be ownership of the underlying common shares or are\nreportable for purposes of Regulation 13D of the Exchange Act, as amended, are treated as beneficial ownership of the number of our common shares equivalent to the economic\nexposure created by the derivative position, to the extent our actual common shares are directly or indirectly held by counterparties to the derivatives contracts. Swaps dealers\nunassociated with any control intent or intent to evade the purposes of the Rights Agreement are excepted from such imputed beneficial ownership.\nThe Rights Agreement “grandfathers” the current level of ownership of persons who, prior to the date of the Rights Agreement, beneficially owned 15% or more of our\noutstanding common shares, so long as they do not purchase additional shares in excess of certain limitations. Such provisions also “grandfather” our Chairman and Chief Executive\nOfficer, Petros Panagiotidis, and Mr. Panagiotidis’ controlled affiliates.\nThe Rights may have anti-takeover effects. The Rights will cause substantial dilution to any person or group that attempts to acquire us without the approval of our Board. As\na result, the overall effect of the Rights may be to render more difficult or discourage any attempt to acquire us. Because our Board can approve a redemption of the Rights for a\npermitted offer, the Rights should not interfere with a merger or other business combination approved by our Board.\nMarshall Islands Company Considerations\nOur corporate affairs are governed by our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and by the BCA. The provisions of the BCA resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a\nnumber of states in the United States. While the BCA provides that its provisions shall be applied and construed in a manner to make them uniform with the laws of the State of Delaware\nand other states of the United States of America with substantially similar legislative provisions, there have been few, if any, court cases interpreting the BCA in the Marshall Islands and\nwe cannot predict whether Marshall Islands courts would reach the same conclusions as courts in the United States. As a result, you may have more difficulty protecting your interests\nin the face of actions by our management, directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a U.S. jurisdiction which has developed a\nsubstantial body of case law. The following table outlines significant differences between the statutory provisions of the BCA and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware\nrelating to shareholders’ rights.\nMarshall Islands Delaware\nShareholder Meetings\nMay be held at a time and place as designated in the bylaws.
