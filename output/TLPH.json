(Nasdaq: TLPH), (\"Talphera\"), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for use in medically supervised settings, today announced third quarter 2024 financial results and provided a corporate update.\n\n\"Our NEPHRO CRRT study has gained momentum, with activated study sites now screening patients and two additional sites to begin screening in the fourth quarter. We're actively engaged with new high-volume sites we expect to further contribute to enrollment rates in the first half of 2025. While we are not providing specific guidance on the study completion date, with execution of our plan to improve enrollment rates and activation of additional study sites, we anticipate the study to be completed next year,\" stated Vince Angotti, Talphera Chief Executive Officer. \"As a reminder, this is not a prolonged study as the primary endpoint is measured at 24 hours with a patient completing the study at 72 hours,\" continued Angotti.\n\nDr. Shakil Aslam, Talphera Chief Medical Officer, added, \"I remain convinced that nafamostat, if approved, will provide the first FDA-approved regional anticoagulant for CRRT, potentially avoiding the risks of systemic anticoagulation that occurs with heparin. After engagement and discussion with numerous clinicians and the NEPHRO investigators, we have identified opportunities to further improve patient screening and enrollment for a timely completion of the study.\"\n\n**Third quarter 2024 and recent highlights**\n\n  * The first patient was enrolled in the NEPHRO CRRT study in August 2024.\n  * Five clinical sites have been activated and are screening patients, with multiple patients now having completed the study. Two additional large-volume clinical sites are expected to be screening patients in the fourth quarter. The NEPHRO CRRT study will enroll 166 patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) at up to 14 clinical sites across the United States. The primary endpoint of the study is the mean post-filter activated clotting time for circuits infused with nafamostat compared to placebo over the first 24 hours.\n  * In October, we met with several physicians, nurses and NEPHRO CRRT study principal investigators at the American Society of Nephrology's Kidney Week 2024 in San Diego, confirming dissatisfaction with the current anticoagulants and validating the target product profile of nafamostat and its potential as a much-needed alternative anticoagulant for CRRT.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Information**\n\n  * The cash, cash equivalents and investments balance was $11.1 million as of September 30, 2024.\n  * Combined R&D and SG&A expenses for the third quarter of 2024 totaled $3.7 million compared to $3.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. Excluding non-cash stock-based compensation expense, these amounts were $3.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $3.0 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in combined R&D and SG&A expenses in the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to an increase in costs associated with the NEPHRO study, partially offset by lower SG&A expenses.\n  * For the third quarter of 2024, the Company recognized net loss from continuing operations of $3.4 million, as compared to net loss of $1.4 million for the third quarter of 2023, largely due to the change in fair value of the Company's warrant liability. The divestment of DSUVIA represents a discontinued operation; accordingly, all historical operating results for the business are reflected within discontinued operations. There were no DSUVIA related expenses in the third quarter of 2024.\n  * Net loss attributable to common shareholders for the third quarter of 2024 was $3.4 million, or $0.13 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $1.4 million, or $0.08 per basic and diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast Information**\n\nTalphera will hold a conference call and webcast at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time/1:30 p.m. Pacific Standard Time to discuss the results and provide an update on the Company's business.\n\nInvestors who wish to participate in the conference call may do so by dialing 1-800-836-8184 for North American callers, or 1-646-357-8785 (toll applies) for international callers outside of Canada.

Talphera's lead product candidate, Niyad™ is a lyophilized formulation of nafamostat and is currently being studied under an investigational device exemption (IDE) as an anticoagulant for the extracorporeal circuit, and has received Breakthrough Device Designation status from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nThis release is intended for investors only. For additional information about Talphera, please visit [www.talphera.com](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4301601-1&h=2432488787&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.talphera.com%2F&a=www.talphera.com).\n\n**About Niyad and nafamostat**\n\nNafamostat is a broad spectrum, synthetic serine protease inhibitor with anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory and potential anti-viral activities. Niyad™ is a lyophilized formulation of nafamostat and is currently being studied under an IDE, as an anticoagulant for the extracorporeal circuit, and has received Breakthrough Device Designation Status from the FDA. Talphera's registrational study of Niyad™ is named the NEPHRO CRRT (**N** afamostat **E** fficacy in **Ph** ase 3 **R** egistrational **C** ontinuous **R** enal **R** eplacement **T** herapy) study. An ICD-10 procedural code, XY0YX37, has been issued for the extracorporeal introduction of nafamostat. The ICD-10 code is a specific/billable code that can be used to indicate a procedure. LTX-608 is a proprietary nafamostat formulation for direct IV infusion that may be investigated and developed for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), acute pancreatitis or as an anti-viral treatment, amongst other potential targets.\n\n**About the NEPHRO CRRT Study**\n\nThe NEPHRO Study, which has received central IRB approval, is designed as a prospective, double-blinded trial to be conducted at up to 14 U.S. hospital intensive care units. The study will enroll and evaluate 166 adult patients undergoing renal replacement therapy, who cannot tolerate heparin or are at risk for bleeding. The primary endpoint of the study is mean post-filter activated clotting time using Niyad versus placebo over the first 24 hours. Key secondary endpoints include filter lifespan, number of filter changes over 72 hours, number of transfusions over 72 hours and dialysis efficacy (based on urea concentration) over the first 24 hours.\n\n**Forward-looking statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements based upon Talphera's current expectations and assumptions.
