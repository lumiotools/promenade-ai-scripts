(NASDAQ: RCM) (“R1” or the “Company”), a leading provider of technology-driven solutions that transform the patient experience and financial performance of healthcare providers, today announced results for the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nThird Quarter 2024 Results:\n\n  * Revenue of $656.8 million, up $84.0 million or 14.7% compared to the same period last year.\n  * GAAP net loss of $19.9 million, compared to net income of $1.3 million in the same period last year.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $148.2 million, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $161.5 million in the same period last year.\n\n\n\nThe quarter reflects impacts to both revenue and costs as a result of recent vendor and customer outages.\n\n“R1 continued to successfully execute the onboarding of our newest end-to-end partner while navigating previously disclosed industry and customer-specific technology outages,” stated Jennifer Williams, R1 CFO. “We are proud of the work our global associates are doing on behalf of our customers and remain committed to delivering positive outcomes for the provider industry.”\n\n**Guidance**\n\nDue to the previously announced proposed acquisition of R1, the Company is not providing financial guidance.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn order to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the information used by R1’s management team in financial and operational decision making, the Company supplements its GAAP consolidated financial statements with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP cost of services, non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, and net debt. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as GAAP net income (loss) before net interest income/expense, income tax provision/benefit, depreciation and amortization expense, including the amortization of cloud computing arrangement implementation fees, share-based compensation expense, CoyCo 2, L.P. (“CoyCo 2”) share-based compensation expense, and certain other items, including costs incurred in connection with acquisition and integration initiatives, including costs related to the proposed Merger, exit activities, strategic and transformation initiatives to improve the Company’s business alignment and cost structure, review of strategic alternatives, and stockholder litigation. Non-GAAP cost of services is defined as GAAP cost of services less share-based compensation expense, CoyCo 2 share-based compensation expense, and depreciation and amortization expense attributed to cost of services. Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses is defined as GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses less share-based compensation expense, CoyCo 2 share-based compensation expense, and depreciation and amortization expense attributed to selling, general and administrative expenses. Net debt is defined as debt less cash and cash equivalents, inclusive of restricted cash. Adjusted EBITDA guidance is reconciled to operating income guidance, the most closely comparable available GAAP measure.\n\nOur board of directors and management team use adjusted EBITDA as (i) one of the primary methods for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations and (ii) a performance evaluation metric in determining achievement of certain executive incentive compensation programs, as well as for incentive compensation programs for employees. Non-GAAP cost of services and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses are used to calculate adjusted EBITDA. Net debt is used as a supplemental measure of our liquidity.\n\nTables 4 through 7 present a reconciliation of GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

(NASDAQ: RCM) (“R1” or the “Company”), a leading provider of technology-driven solutions that transform the patient experience and financial performance of healthcare providers, today announced results for the three months ended June 30, 2024.\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Results:\n\n  * Revenue of $627.9 million, up $67.2 million or 12.0% compared to the same period last year.\n  * GAAP net loss of $7.6 million, compared to net loss of $1.0 million in the same period last year.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $156.1 million, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $142.9 million in the same period last year.\n\n\n\nThe quarter reflects impacts to both revenue and costs as a result of recent vendor and customer outages.\n\n“Our second quarter results reflect the strength of R1’s technology platform, our focus on delivering excellent customer results, and our ability to execute on our growth strategy while navigating industry and customer specific events,” stated Lee Rivas, R1’s CEO. “R1 remains committed to executing against our technology roadmap while leveraging our global scale to drive increased value for our customers and partners.”\n\n**Proposed Acquisition by TowerBrook and CD &R**\n\nOn August 1, 2024, R1 announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by investment funds affiliated with TowerBrook Capital Partners (“TowerBrook”) and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (“CD&R”), in an all-cash transaction. Under the terms of the agreement, TowerBrook and CD&R will acquire all the outstanding common stock that TowerBrook does not currently own for $14.30 per share. The transaction has been unanimously approved by a Special Committee of the R1 Board of Directors comprised solely of independent directors, and following the recommendation of the Special Committee, R1’s Board approved the transaction. Upon completion of the transaction, R1 will become a private company and its shares will no longer trade on Nasdaq. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the year, subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of stockholder approval and regulatory approvals.\n\n**Guidance**\n\nDue to the recently proposed acquisition, R1 is not providing financial guidance.\n\n**Webcast Information**\n\nR1’s management team will make available a pre-recorded call today at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the Company’s financial results. To access the pre-recorded call, please dial 888-596-4144 (646-968-2525 outside the U.S. and Canada) using conference code number 9123341. The pre-recorded call will also be available at the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at [ir.r1rcm.com](http://ir.r1rcm.com).\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn order to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the information used by R1’s management team in financial and operational decision making, the Company supplements its GAAP consolidated financial statements with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP cost of services, non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, and net debt. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as GAAP net income (loss) before net interest income/expense, income tax provision/benefit, depreciation and amortization expense, including the amortization of cloud computing arrangement implementation fees, share-based compensation expense, CoyCo 2, L.P. (“CoyCo 2”) share-based compensation expense, and certain other items, including acquisition and integration costs, various exit activities costs, strategic and transformation initiatives costs, costs related to organization changes to improve business alignment and cost structure, and costs related to review of strategic alternatives and stockholder litigation. Non-GAAP cost of services is defined as GAAP cost of services less share-based compensation expense, CoyCo 2 share-based compensation expense, and depreciation and amortization expense attributed to cost of services. Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses is defined as GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses less share-based compensation expense, CoyCo 2 share-based compensation expense, and depreciation and amortization expense attributed to selling, general and administrative expenses. Net debt is defined as debt less cash and cash equivalents, inclusive of restricted cash. Adjusted EBITDA guidance is reconciled to operating income guidance, the most closely comparable available GAAP measure.\n\nOur board of directors and management team use adjusted EBITDA as (i) one of the primary methods for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations and (ii) a performance evaluation metric in determining achievement of certain executive incentive compensation programs, as well as for incentive compensation programs for employees. Non-GAAP cost of services and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses are used to calculate adjusted EBITDA. Net debt is used as a supplemental measure of our liquidity.\n\nTables 4 through 7 present a reconciliation of GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

(NASDAQ: RCM) (“R1” or the “Company”), a leading provider of technology-driven solutions that transform the patient experience and financial performance of healthcare providers, today announced results for the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nThird Quarter 2024 Results:\n\n  * Revenue of $656.8 million, up $84.0 million or 14.7% compared to the same period last year.\n  * GAAP net loss of $19.9 million, compared to net income of $1.3 million in the same period last year.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $148.2 million, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $161.5 million in the same period last year.\n\n\n\nThe quarter reflects impacts to both revenue and costs as a result of recent vendor and customer outages.\n\n“R1 continued to successfully execute the onboarding of our newest end-to-end partner while navigating previously disclosed industry and customer-specific technology outages,” stated Jennifer Williams, R1 CFO. “We are proud of the work our global associates are doing on behalf of our customers and remain committed to delivering positive outcomes for the provider industry.”\n\n**Guidance**\n\nDue to the previously announced proposed acquisition of R1, the Company is not providing financial guidance.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn order to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the information used by R1’s management team in financial and operational decision making, the Company supplements its GAAP consolidated financial statements with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP cost of services, non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, and net debt. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as GAAP net income (loss) before net interest income/expense, income tax provision/benefit, depreciation and amortization expense, including the amortization of cloud computing arrangement implementation fees, share-based compensation expense, CoyCo 2, L.P. (“CoyCo 2”) share-based compensation expense, and certain other items, including costs incurred in connection with acquisition and integration initiatives, including costs related to the proposed Merger, exit activities, strategic and transformation initiatives to improve the Company’s business alignment and cost structure, review of strategic alternatives, and stockholder litigation. Non-GAAP cost of services is defined as GAAP cost of services less share-based compensation expense, CoyCo 2 share-based compensation expense, and depreciation and amortization expense attributed to cost of services. Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses is defined as GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses less share-based compensation expense, CoyCo 2 share-based compensation expense, and depreciation and amortization expense attributed to selling, general and administrative expenses. Net debt is defined as debt less cash and cash equivalents, inclusive of restricted cash. Adjusted EBITDA guidance is reconciled to operating income guidance, the most closely comparable available GAAP measure.\n\nOur board of directors and management team use adjusted EBITDA as (i) one of the primary methods for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations and (ii) a performance evaluation metric in determining achievement of certain executive incentive compensation programs, as well as for incentive compensation programs for employees. Non-GAAP cost of services and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses are used to calculate adjusted EBITDA. Net debt is used as a supplemental measure of our liquidity.\n\nTables 4 through 7 present a reconciliation of GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Business Description and Basis of Presentation\nBusiness Description\nR1 RCM Inc. (the “Company”) is a leading provider of technology-driven solutions that transform the financial performance and patient experience for health\nsystems, hospitals, and physician groups. The Company’s scalable operating models complement a healthcare organization’s infrastructure, driving sustainable\nimprovements to net patient revenue and cash flows while driving revenue yield, reducing operating costs, and enhancing the patient experience.\n(cid:0)$ (cid:0)F (cid:0)F (cid:0)O(cid:0)D (cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)$ (cid:0)F (cid:0)T (cid:0)X (cid:0)L(cid:0)V (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q\nOn January 17, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of the revenue cycle management (“RCM”) business (“Acclara”) of Providence Health &\nServices – Washington (“Providence”) and certain of its affiliates (the “Acclara Acquisition”). Concurrently with the closing of the acquisition and as part of the\nconsideration thereof, the Company issued a warrant to acquire up to 12,192,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at an initial exercise price of\n$10.52 per share, of the Company to Providence (the “Providence Warrant”). The Company acquired 100% of the equity interests in Acclara. For further details on\nthe total consideration paid, see Note 2, Acquisitions.\nThe acquisition of Acclara extends the Company’s ability to deploy advanced technology solutions and drive execution to improve customer and patient\noutcomes. In conjunction with the acquisition, the Company began a 10-year partnership with Providence for comprehensive revenue cycle services that leverage\nthe breadth of integrated technology and services capabilities of both the Company and Acclara.\n(cid:0)7 (cid:0)D (cid:0)N (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:16)(cid:0)3 (cid:0)U (cid:0)L(cid:0)Y (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)0 (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)J (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)$ (cid:0)J (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)H (cid:0)P (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W\nOn July 31, 2024, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Raven Acquisition Holdings, LLC, a Delaware\nlimited liability company (“Parent”), and Project Raven Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”, and\ntogether with Parent, the “Buyer Parties”), providing for, among other things and on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, the merger of Merger\nSub with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation (the “Merger”). If the Merger is consummated, the Company’s common\nstock will be de-listed from Nasdaq and de-registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as promptly as practicable following the closing of\nthe Merger. Parent and Merger Sub are affiliates of Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC and TowerBrook Capital Partners L.P., which is an affiliate of TCP-ASC ACHI\nSeries LLLP (“TCP-ASC”).\nPrior to the closing of the Merger, one or more stockholders of the Company (collectively, the “Rollover Stockholders”) may each enter into a rollover\nagreement with Raven TopCo, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership and an indirect parent entity of Parent (“Holdings”), or any subsidiary of Holdings that is\nwholly owned prior to the closing (each, a “Holdings Subsidiary”), on terms mutually agreeable among Parent and the parties to such agreement (collectively, the\n“Rollover Agreements”), pursuant to which, among other things, each such Rollover Stockholder will, immediately prior to the closing, transfer or contribute a\nnumber of shares of common stock of the Company (the “Rollover Shares”) to Holdings or a Holdings subsidiary in exchange for equity interests of Holdings or\nsuch Holdings Subsidiary having an equivalent value, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the applicable Rollover Agreement. The holders of the\nRollover Shares, if any, will not be entitled to receive the per share consideration described below in respect of the Rollover Shares.\n9\nAt the effective time of the Merger each share of common stock of the Company outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (other\nthan shares held by the Company, its subsidiaries, Parent, Merger Sub or TCP-ASC or by stockholders who have properly and validly exercised their statutory\nrights of appraisal in respect of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware) will be cancelled and\nextinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $14.30, without interest thereon.\nOn September 13, 2024, the waiting period applicable to the Merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, expired.\nThe consummation of the Merger remains subject to the mutual conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, the: (i) affirmative vote\nof the holders of a majority of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company to adopt the Merger Agreement and (ii) the absence of any law or\norder restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger. In addition, the obligation of each party to consummate the Merger is conditioned upon the other\nparty’s representations and warranties being true and correct (subject to certain customary materiality exceptions) and the other party having performed in all\nmaterial respects its covenants, obligations and conditions under the Merger Agreement. The obligation of the Buyer Parties to consummate the Merger is also\nsubject to the absence of a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement).\nThe Company agreed to pay Parent $250.0 million in cash upon the termination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances. Parent agreed to pay\nthe Company $550.0 million in cash upon the termination of the Merger Agreement under certain other circumstances.\nPursuant to the rules adopted by the SEC, the Company prepared and filed with the SEC, a Definitive Proxy Statement and amended Transaction Statement\non Schedule 13E-3 (together with the Buyer Parties) on October 16, 2024, containing more information about the Merger Agreement and the Merger. The special\nmeeting of stockholders to adopt the Merger Agreement and related matters is scheduled to be held virtually on November 14, 2024.\nTransaction costs incurred related to the Merger have been classified as Other Expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive\nIncome (Loss) (Unaudited). See Note 9, Other Expenses, for further details.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect the Company’s financial position as of September 30, 2024, the results of operations of\nthe Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the cash flows of the Company for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023. These financial statements include the accounts of R1 RCM Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, including Acclara and its subsidiaries since the\ndate of acquisition. All material intercompany amounts have been eliminated in consolidation. These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) for interim financial reporting and as required by the rules and regulations of the\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures required for complete financial statements are\nnot included herein. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair presentation of the\ninterim financial information, have been included. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the\nresults that may be expected for any other interim period or for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024.\nWhen preparing financial statements in conformity with GAAP, the Company makes a number of significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments in the\npreparation of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. For a discussion of the Company’s significant accounting policies and other\ninformation, the unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements\nincluded in the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024 (the “2023 Form 10-K”).\n10\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards and Disclosures\nIn June 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic\n820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions (“ASU 2022-03”). ASU 2022-03 clarifies that a contractual sale\nrestriction on an equity security should not be considered in measuring the security’s fair value. The Company prospectively adopted ASU 2022-03 effective\nJanuary 1, 2024. Adoption of the new standard required changes to the valuation method used in accounting for equity consideration in business combinations\noccurring after January 1, 2024. There were no current period changes to equity consideration related to prior transactions to be evaluated under this guidance.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”).\nASU 2023-07 expands annual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment\nexpenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15,\n2024. The Company is currently in the process of determining the impact that ASU 2023-07 will have on its consolidated financial statement disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”). ASU 2023-09\nexpands the disclosure requirements for income taxes, specifically related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently in the process of determining the impact that ASU 2023-09 will have on its consolidated financial\nstatement disclosures.\n2. Acquisitions\nAssets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at their estimated fair value on the date of the acquisition. The difference\nbetween the purchase price amount and the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill on the balance sheet if the purchase\nprice exceeds the estimated net fair value or as a bargain purchase gain on the income statement if the purchase price is less than the estimated net fair value. The\nallocation of the purchase price may be modified through the end of the measurement period, which is up to one year after the acquisition date, as more information\nis obtained about the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition.\n(cid:0)$ (cid:0)F (cid:0)F (cid:0)O(cid:0)D (cid:0)U (cid:0)D\nOn January 17, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Acclara for a final purchase price of $786.1 million, inclusive of purchase price adjustments\nbased on the final determination of the closing net working capital. The following table summarizes the fair value of the total consideration paid:\nFair Value\nCash consideration (1) $ 726.3\nIssuance of Providence Warrant (2) 59.8\nTotal consideration $ 786.1\n(1) Cash consideration includes the repayment of Acclara’s pre-existing credit facility at closing, which was not assumed by the Company. During the three\nmonths ended June 30, 2024, the Company finalized the closing net working capital as defined in the purchase agreement, which resulted in additional\nconsideration due to the seller of $0.1 million that was paid in the third quarter of 2024.\n(2) The provisional, undiscounted fair value of the Providence Warrant was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The warrant is subject\nto a three-year lock-up period and expires five years from the issuance date.\n11\nThe Company funded the cash portion of the consideration and associated transaction expenses with a combination of cash on hand and the incurrence of\nadditional indebtedness. See Note 6, Debt.\nThe purchase price has been provisionally allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date.\nThe fair value estimates are pending finalization of the valuation of intangible assets and income and non-income related taxes. Accordingly, management considers\nthe balances shown in the following table to be preliminary, and there could be adjustments to the consolidated financial statements, including changes in our\namortization expense related to the valuation of intangible assets acquired and their respective useful lives.\nThe preliminary fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is:\nPurchase Price Allocation\nTotal purchase consideration $ 786.1\nAllocation of consideration to assets acquired and liabilities assumed:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 64.3\nAccounts receivable 47.8\nProperty, equipment and software 6.6\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 12.3\nIntangible assets 374.0\nGoodwill 416.2\nOther assets 8.1\nAccounts payable (4.6)\nCustomer liabilities (1.2)\nAccrued compensation and benefits (21.8)\nOperating lease liabilities (16.2)\nDeferred income tax liabilities (82.4)\nOther liabilities (17.0)\nNet assets acquired $ 786.1\nThe intangible assets preliminarily identified in conjunction with the Acclara Acquisition are as follows:\nUseful Life Gross Carrying Value\nCustomer Relationships 12 years $ 374.0\nThe goodwill recognized is primarily attributable to synergies that are expected to be achieved by leveraging the R1 operating model to deliver services to\nAcclara customers upon integration. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The change in the carrying amount of goodwill\nfrom December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 is solely attributable to the goodwill recognized in conjunction with the Acclara Acquisition.\nAs part of the acquisition, the Company recognized an indemnification asset of $4.5 million for indirect tax and income tax related to potential pre-transaction\nclose tax obligations of Acclara. The indemnification asset was valued with the assistance of third-party tax experts and is a best estimate based on information\navailable to the Company at the closing of the transaction. If the pre-transaction close tax obligations exceed the amount of the indemnification asset, the seller is\nliable for the incremental amount.\n12\nIncluded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are net\nservices revenue of $71.5 million and $199.1 million and net income before income taxes of $4.9 million and $0.7 million, respectively, related to the operations of\nAcclara since the acquisition date of January 17, 2024.\n(cid:0)0 (cid:0)H (cid:0)D (cid:0)V (cid:0)X (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)P (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)S (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)G (cid:0)M(cid:0)X (cid:0)V (cid:0)W(cid:0)P (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)V\nThe Company had various measurement period adjustments due to additional information received since the Acclara Acquisition. The significant adjustments\nincluded a $1.9 million decrease to taxes payable and a $2.2 million decrease in deferred tax liability related to a revised tax provision estimate. The offset of these\nadjustments was recorded to goodwill.\nPro Forma Results\nThe following table summarizes, on a pro forma basis, the combined results of the Company as though the Acclara Acquisition had occurred on January 1,\n2023. These pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of the actual consolidated results had the acquisition occurred as of that date or of the future\nconsolidated operating results for any period.\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet services revenue $ 656.8 $ 646.5 $ 1,900.4 $ 1,911.3\nNet loss $ (16.7) $ (17.7) $ (35.6) $ (76.5)\nAdjustments, net of the income tax effects, that were made to net loss related to (i) depreciation and amortization to reflect the fair value of identified assets\nacquired, (ii) share-based compensation expense for awards replaced in connection with the acquisition, (iii) paying off Acclara’s debt and incurrence of debt by the\nCompany, (iv) the timing of acquisition-related costs, and (v) accounting policy alignment.\n3. Intangible Assets\nThe following table provides the gross carrying value and accumulated amortization for each major class of definite-lived intangible assets at September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nGross Carrying Accumulated Gross Carrying Accumulated\nValue Amortization Net Book Value Value Amortization Net Book Value\nCustomer relationships $ 791.9 $ (101.1) $ 690.8 $ 417.9 $ (60.5) $ 357.4\nTechnology 1,238.8 (424.3) 814.5 1,238.8 (299.5) 939.3\nTrade name 23.5 (20.0) 3.5 23.5 (9.5) 14.0\nTotal intangible assets $ 2,054.2 $ (545.4) $ 1,508.8 $ 1,680.2 $ (369.5) $ 1,310.7\nThe fair value of the identifiable intangible assets was determined in the period of their acquisition utilizing an income approach to derive the present value of\nfuture cash flows from developed technology, customer relationships, and trade name.\nIntangible asset amortization expense was $58.6 million and $175.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and $50.4\nmillion and $151.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Amortization expense for intangible assets is included in cost of\nservices on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). The Company has no indefinite-lived intangible assets.\n13\nEstimated annual amortization expense related to intangible assets with definite lives as of September 30, 2024 is as follows:\nRemainder of 2024 $ 58.6\n2025 220.0\n2026 219.4\n2027 219.4\n2028 219.3\n2029 141.8\nThereafter 430.3\nTotal $ 1,508.8\n4. Revenue Recognition\nRevenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer, and presented net of any sales incentives and amounts collected on\nbehalf of third parties. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a service to a customer, which is\ntypically over the contract term. Estimates of variable consideration are included in revenue to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative\nrevenue will not occur once the uncertainty is resolved.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nIn the following table, revenue is disaggregated by source of revenue:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet operating fees $ 413.0 $ 368.0 $ 1,169.1 $ 1,086.8\nIncentive fees 22.4 30.1 59.7 84.5\nModular and other fees (1) 221.4 174.7 659.8 507.8\nNet services revenue $ 656.8 $ 572.8 $ 1,888.6 $ 1,679.1\n(1) Modular and other fees is comprised of service fees related to solutions focused on revenue recovery, clinical integrity, revenue optimization, and\nregulatory navigation as well as functional outsourcing solutions focused on driving revenue cycle improvements.\n14\nContract Balances\nThe following table provides information about contract assets, net and contract liabilities from contracts with customers:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nContract assets, net\nCurrent $ 100.8 $ 94.4\nNon-current 43.3 37.7\nTotal contract assets, net $ 144.1 $ 132.1\nContract liabilities\nCurrent (1) $ 12.1 $ 9.1\nNon-current (2) 12.3 14.5\nTotal contract liabilities $ 24.4 $ 23.6\n(1) Current contract liabilities include $2.2 million and $2.4 million classified in the current portion of customer liabilities - related party as of September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n(2) Non-current contract liabilities include $10.4 million and $11.8 million classified in the non-current portion of customer liabilities - related party as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nSignificant changes in the carrying amount of contract assets, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were as follows:\nContract Assets, net\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 $ 132.1\nRevenue recognized 299.6\nAmounts transferred to Accounts receivable, net (287.1)\nWrite-offs (1) (0.5)\nBalance as of September 30, 2024 $ 144.1\n(1) During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company wrote off the contract asset balance related to a private physician-owned for-profit\nhealthcare network in the United States, who filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on May 6, 2024.\n15\nContract Liabilities\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 $ (23.6)\nAdvanced billings as of January 1, 2024 (1) (69.6)\nAdvanced billings recognized 69.6\nAdditions (12.6)\nRevenue recognized (2) 11.8\nBalance as of September 30, 2024 $ (24.4)\n(1) The Company records advanced billings to contract liabilities and accounts receivable on the first day of the respective service period, which billings are\nearned during the quarter.\n(2) Revenue recognized includes $1.7 million and $6.7 million of revenue recognition for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,\nrelating to the contract liabilities balance at the beginning of the period.\nTransaction Price Allocated to the Remaining Performance Obligations\nThe following table includes estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially\nunsatisfied) at the end of the reporting period. The estimated revenue does not include amounts of variable consideration that are constrained.\nNet operating fees Incentive fees\nRemainder of 2024 $ 36.8 $ 14.4\n2025 78.2 24.5\n2026 51.7 —\n2027 13.4 —\n2028 5.6 —\n2029 1.9 —\nThereafter 2.5 —\nTotal $ 190.1 $ 38.9\nThe amounts presented in the table above include variable fee estimates of the Company’s physician group RCM services contracts, fixed fees, and forecasted\nincentive fees. Fixed fees are typically recognized ratably as the performance obligation is satisfied and forecasted incentive fees are measured cumulatively over\nthe contractually defined performance period.\nThe Company does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations with an original expected duration of one year or less. The Company\nhas elected certain of the optional exemptions from the disclosure requirements for remaining performance obligations for specific situations in which an entity\nneed not estimate variable consideration to recognize revenue. Accordingly, the Company applies a practical expedient to its modular RCM solutions and does not\ndisclose information about variable consideration from remaining performance obligations when the Company has a right to consideration from a customer in an\namount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the entity’s performance completed to date.\n5. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\nAccounts receivable is comprised of invoiced and unbilled balances due from modular services and end-to-end RCM customers, which are presented net after\nconsidering cost reimbursements owed to end-to-end RCM customers.\n16\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nBilled receivables $ 268.1 $ 218.5\nUnbilled receivables 115.7 99.2\nAllowance for credit losses (27.8) (48.3)\nTotal accounts receivable, net (1) $ 356.0 $ 269.4\n(1) Includes $38.4 million and $26.1 million for accounts receivable - related party, net as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe Company evaluates its accounts receivable for expected credit losses monthly. Accounts receivable due from end-to-end RCM customers are evaluated\nindividually as it was determined that the unique nature and scope of our operating partner agreements make the circumstances around credit losses dissimilar.\nAccounts receivable due from modular service customers are evaluated using the pooling approach due to the homogeneous population of the receivables. The\nCompany maintains an estimated allowance for credit losses to reduce its accounts receivable to the amount that it believes will be collected. This allowance is\nbased on the Company’s historical experience, the length of time a balance has been outstanding, and the Company’s assessment of each customer’s ability to pay,\nwhich is based on input from key Company personnel assigned to the customer, the status of ongoing operations with the customer, and business and industry\nfactors, such as significant shifts in the healthcare environment that could impact the customer’s financial health.\nChanges in the allowance for credit losses on a consolidated basis related to accounts receivable are as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nBeginning balance $ 26.6 $ 31.6 $ 48.3 $ 15.2\nProvision (recoveries) (1) 1.4 7.5 3.2 24.1\nWrite-offs (2) (0.2) (0.9) (23.7) (1.1)\nEnding balance $ 27.8 $ 38.2 $ 27.8 $ 38.2\n(1) During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company increased the allowance for credit losses by $11.6 million to fully reserve the\noutstanding accounts receivable exposure for the physician RCM customer that ceased operations and is in the process of liquidation pursuant to a Chapter\n11 plan approved by the bankruptcy court in March 2024.\n(2) During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had $23.7 million in write-offs, which primarily related to the balance previously fully\nreserved in 2023 of the physician RCM customer that ceased operations in the third quarter of 2023 and is in the process of liquidation pursuant to a Chapter\n11 plan approved by the bankruptcy court in March 2024.\n17\n6. Debt\nThe carrying amounts of debt consist of the following:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nSenior Revolver (1) $ 60.0 $ —\nTerm A Loans 1,116.0 1,162.5\nTerm B Loans 1,060.6 493.8\nUnamortized discount and issuance costs (27.1) (18.8)\nTotal debt 2,209.5 1,637.5\nLess: Current maturities (72.8) (67.0)\nTotal long-term debt $ 2,136.7 $ 1,570.5\n(1) As of September 30, 2024, the Company had $60.0 million in borrowings outstanding, $1.4 million letters of credit outstanding, and $538.6 million of\navailability under the $600.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (“Senior Revolver”).\nSecond Amendment to the Second A&R Credit Agreement\nIn conjunction with the closing of the Acclara Acquisition, the Company entered into Amendment No. 2 (the “Second Amendment”) to the second\namended and restated credit agreement (the “Second A&R Credit Agreement”) executed on June 21, 2022. For further details on the Second A&R Credit\nAgreement, see Note 10 of the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s 2023 Form 10-K. Pursuant to the Second Amendment,\namong certain other amendments, the lenders named in the Second Amendment agreed, severally and not jointly, to extend additional borrowings in the form\nof Term B Loans (the “Incremental Term B Loans” and together with the then existing senior secured term B loan, the “Term B Loans”) to the Company in an\naggregate principal amount equal to $575.0 million. The Company used the proceeds of the Incremental Term B Loans, together with cash on hand and\nborrowings of $80.0 million under the Senior Revolver, to finance (i) the cash consideration for the Acclara Acquisition and (ii) fees and costs incurred in\nconnection with the acquisition and related transactions. In conjunction with entering into the Second Amendment, the Company incurred $10.6 million and\ncapitalized $5.7 million of debt issuance costs.\nThe initial senior secured term A loan (the “Existing Term A Loan”) and Senior Revolver mature on July 1, 2026, the incremental senior secured term A\nloan (together with the Existing Term A Loan, the “Term A Loans”) matures on June 21, 2027, and the Term B Loans mature on June 21, 2029.\nThe variable interest rate as of September 30, 2024 was 7.10% for the Term A Loans and Senior Revolver and 7.85% for the Term B Loans.\nThe Second A&R Credit Agreement contains a number of financial and non-financial covenants. The Company was in compliance with all of the\ncovenants in the Second A&R Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024.

As of September 30, 2024, the Company\nhad recorded $0.2 million of unrealized gains in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to foreign currency hedges. The Company estimates that\n$0.2 million of gains reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss are expected to be reclassified into cost of services within the next 12 months.\nThe net gains reclassified into cost of services were as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n$ — $ 0.5 $ 0.1 $ 1.3\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges had maturities extending no later than\nDecember 31, 2024, and had a total notional value of $53.2 million.\nThe Company also utilizes cash flow hedges to reduce variability in interest cash flows from its outstanding debt. As of September 30, 2024, the Company\nhad recorded $3.8 million of unrealized gains in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to interest rate swaps. The Company estimates that $3.8 million of\ngains reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss are expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months.\nThe net gains reclassified into interest expense were as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n$ 3.0 $ 2.8 $ 8.9 $ 7.2\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company’s interest rate swaps extended no later than June 30, 2025, and had a total notional value of $500.0 million.\n19\nThe Company also utilizes fair value hedges to manage its currency risk arising from its global business services centers. These contracts typically have a\nterm of one month in order to manage currency risks between the timing of transaction costs and payment. For the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024, respectively, the Company had recognized $0.1 million and $0.1 million of gains in earnings related to foreign currency forward contracts designated as fair\nvalue hedges. The Company had no outstanding fair value hedges as of September 30, 2024. The fair value of derivative instruments designated as fair value\nhedges was $0.0 million of unrealized gains as of December 31, 2023.\nThe classification of the fair value of derivative instruments designated as hedges within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023 were as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nForeign currency forward contracts\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets $ 0.2 $ 0.5\nOther accrued expenses — —\nTotal foreign currency forward contracts $ 0.2 $ 0.5\nInterest rate swaps\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets $ 3.8 $ 8.7\nOther assets — 0.9\nTotal interest rate swaps $ 3.8 $ 9.6\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, the accumulated gain, net of tax, recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss was\n$3.0 million and $7.5 million.\nThe Company classifies cash flows from its derivative programs as cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Fair\nvalues for derivative financial instruments are based on prices computed using third-party valuation models and are classified as Level 2 in accordance with the\nthree-level hierarchy of fair value measurements.\n8. Share-Based Compensation\nThe total share-based compensation expense relating to the Company’s stock options, RSUs, and performance-based restricted stock units (“PBRSUs”) that\nhas been included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) was as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended September\nSeptember 30, 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nShare-Based Compensation Expense Allocation Details:\nCost of services $ 6.9 $ 12.4 $ 30.8 $ 32.1\nSelling, general and administrative 9.1 7.7 28.7 22.2\nTotal share-based compensation expense (1) $ 16.0 $ 20.1 $ 59.5 $ 54.3\nRelated tax benefits $ 1.5 $ 4.2 $ 11.1 $ 11.5\n20\n(1) Included in total share-based compensation expense are (i) $9.2 million and $12.7 million, of share-based compensation expense for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, respectively, of CoyCo 2, L.P., a shareholder of the Company (“CoyCo 2”), and (ii) $1.7 million and $5.4 million,\nrespectively, of share-based compensation expense of CoyCo 2 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. This expense relates to equity\nawards held by certain Cloudmed employees that were modified as part of the Company’s acquisition of Revint Holdings, LLC (“Cloudmed”) into awards of\nCoyCo 2 and were granted for services that benefit the Company’s operations. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the share-based\ncompensation expense related to these equity awards was accelerated on a prospective basis as a result of the anticipated closing of the Merger.\nThe Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. Excess tax benefits and shortfalls for share-based payments are recognized in income tax expense and\nincluded in operating activities. The Company recognized the following income tax expense/(benefit) associated with vesting and exercises of equity awards:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n$ 0.4 $ (0.1) $ 1.1 $ (1.3)\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of its service-based options as of their grant dates. The volatility for the\noptions was calculated based on an analysis of historical volatility. The Company assesses progress and achievement on PBRSUs by reviewing historical\nperformance to date, along with any adjustments which have been approved by the Human Capital Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors to the reported\nperformance, and latest projections to determine the probable outcome of the awards. The current estimates are then compared to the scoring metrics and any\nnecessary adjustments are reflected in the current period to update share-based compensation expense to the current performance expectations. A Monte Carlo\nsimulation was used to estimate the fair value of the Unvested Units (as defined in the 2023 Form 10-K), which are being amortized over a period of 4 years on a\nstraight-line basis. The volatility for the Unvested Units was calculated based on an analysis of historical and implied volatility.\nStock options\nA summary of the activity relating to stock options during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is shown below:\nWeighted-\nAverage\nExercise\nOptions Price\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023 2,647,202 $ 3.41\nExercised (486,114) 2.95\nOutstanding at September 30, 2024 2,161,088 $ 3.52\nOutstanding, vested and exercisable at September 30, 2024 2,161,088 $ 3.52\nOutstanding, vested and exercisable at December 31, 2023 2,647,202 $ 3.41\n21\nRestricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units\nA summary of the activity relating to RSUs and PBRSUs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is shown below:\nWeighted-\nAverage Grant\nDate Fair Value\nRSUs PBRSUs RSU PBRSU\nOutstanding and unvested at December 31, 2023 3,330,236 6,128,821 $ 17.66 $ 19.36\nGranted 4,000,127 1,529,657 11.09 12.59\nVested (1,701,746) (462,927) 15.12 26.65\nForfeited (534,436) (485,770) 13.55 17.95\nOutstanding and unvested at September 30, 2024 5,094,181 6,709,781 $ 13.78 $ 17.42\nShares surrendered for taxes for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 573,263 162,550\nCost of shares surrendered for taxes for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 (in millions) $ 7.2 $ 2.4\nShares surrendered for taxes for the nine months ended September 30,\n2023 381,066 903,658\nCost of shares surrendered for taxes for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 (in millions) $ 6.2 $ 13.1\nRSUs granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, include an aggregate 1,983,791 RSUs of the Company that were issued upon consummation\nof the Acclara Acquisition to replace outstanding unvested options of Acclara.\nThe Company’s RSU and PBRSU agreements allow employees to surrender to the Company shares of common stock upon vesting of their RSUs and\nPBRSUs in lieu of their payment of the required personal employment-related taxes. Shares surrendered for payment of personal employment-related taxes are held\nin treasury.\nOutstanding PBRSUs vest upon satisfaction of both time-based and performance-based conditions. Depending on the award, performance condition targets\nmay include cumulative adjusted EBITDA, end-to-end RCM agreement growth, modular sales revenue, or other specific performance factors. Depending on the\npercentage level at which the performance-based conditions are satisfied, the number of shares vesting could be between 0% and 200% of the number of PBRSUs\noriginally granted. Based on the established targets, the maximum number of shares that could vest for all outstanding PBRSUs is 13,419,562.\n9. Other Expenses\nOther expenses are incurred in connection with acquisition and integration initiatives, exit activities, strategic and transformation initiatives to improve our\nbusiness alignment and cost structure, review of strategic alternatives, stockholder litigation, and for the three months ended September 30, 2024, costs related to\nthe proposed Merger. The following table summarizes the other expenses recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n22\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nBusiness acquisition costs (1) $ — $ 1.4 $ 15.1 $ 3.5\nIntegration costs (2) 4.4 6.1 27.1 30.0\nTechnology transformation (3) 2.8 4.5 20.9 11.8\nStrategic initiatives (4) — 13.0 0.5 23.8\nFacility-related charges (5) 1.8 7.2 4.9 15.7\nOther (6) 24.2 (2.8) 32.9 3.1\nTotal other expenses $ 33.2 $ 29.4 $ 101.4 $ 87.9\n(1) Costs, including legal, consulting, insurance premiums, and bank fees, that directly relate to the due diligence and closing of business acquisitions and\ninclude changes to contingent consideration, if applicable. Costs also include compensation expenses associated with the close of the transactions.\n(2) Costs reflect efforts to integrate acquired businesses from a systems, processes, and people perspective and to achieve synergies expected from business\nacquisitions. Costs include consulting fees, IT vendor spend, severance, and certain payroll costs.\n(3) Costs relate to projects underway to create a new platform that consolidates the Cloudmed and R1 customer solutions and migrates them to a cloud\nenvironment to reduce onboarding costs and accelerate the delivery of value to the Company’s customers. These projects are expected to be completed in\n2025. Certain project costs incurred qualify for capitalization and have been recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, costs include a $6.3 million one-time vendor termination fee to migrate to the cloud.\n(4) Costs primarily relate to business restructuring activities as part of the Company’s growth strategy and include consulting costs, compensation costs of\nemployees dedicated to the Company’s strategic growth efforts, and severance. In 2023, these costs included changes in contingent consideration and\nretention costs related to acquisitions completed by Cloudmed prior to being acquired by R1.\n(5) As part of evaluating its real estate footprint in relation to acquisitions and remote work practices adopted following COVID, the Company has exited\ncertain facilities. Costs include asset impairment charges, early termination fees, and other costs related to exited facilities that will continue over the\nduration of the lease term.\n(6) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, costs primarily related to legal and other advisor fees associated with the strategic alternatives\nreview conducted by a special committee formed by the Board of Directors on March 11, 2024, which concluded with the Board of Directors’ approval of\nthe Merger Agreement on July 31, 2024. See Note 1, Business Description and Basis of Presentation, for further details regarding the Merger Agreement.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred professional service fees and other expenses related to the proposed Merger. For\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, costs include net insurance reimbursements and net expenses, respectively, related to the Company’s\nstockholder litigation. For further details regarding the Company’s stockholder litigation, see Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated\nfinancial statements included in the 2023 Form 10-K.\n23\n10. Income Taxes\nIncome tax provisions for interim periods are based on estimated annual income tax rates, adjusted to reflect the effects of any significant and infrequent or\nunusual items which are required to be discretely recognized within the current interim period. The effective tax rates in the periods presented are largely based\nupon the projected annual pre-tax earnings by jurisdiction and the allocation of certain expenses in various taxing jurisdictions where the Company conducts its\nbusiness. These taxing jurisdictions apply a broad range of statutory income tax rates. The global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) provisions impose taxes\non foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. The Company elected to account for GILTI tax in the period in which it\nis incurred.\nThe Company recognized income tax benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 on the year-to-date pre-tax loss. The deviation from the\nfederal statutory tax rate of 21% is primarily attributable to recognizing the provisions for foreign taxes, state taxes, non-deductible expenses, and discrete items.\nThe Company recognized income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 on the year-to-date pre-tax income. The deviation\nfrom the federal statutory tax rate of 21% is primarily attributable to recognizing the provisions for foreign taxes, state taxes, non-deductible expenses, and discrete\nitems.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. U.S. federal income\ntax returns since 2021 are currently open for examination. State jurisdictions vary for open tax years. The statute of limitations for most states ranges from three to\nsix years. Certain income tax returns since fiscal year 2009 for the Company’s India subsidiaries are currently open for final determination. The Company’s\nPhilippines subsidiary is currently under audit for the tax period ended on December 31, 2022.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $137.9 million, of which $23.7 million related to net operating loss (“NOL”)\ncarryforwards. The Company expects to have positive taxable income, allowing the Company to utilize its NOL carryforwards and other deferred tax assets.\n11. Earnings (Loss) Per Share\nBasic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the\nperiod.\nDiluted net income (loss) per share is calculated by adjusting the denominator used in the basic net income (loss) per share computation by potentially dilutive\nsecurities outstanding during the period plus, when their effect is dilutive, incremental shares consisting of shares subject to stock options and shares issuable upon\nvesting of RSUs and PBRSUs.\nBasic and diluted net income (loss) per common share are calculated as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income (loss) $ (19.9) $ 1.3 $ (62.6) $ 1.9\nBasic weighted-average common shares 422,101,172 419,008,998 421,289,787 418,299,910\nAdd: Effect of dilutive equity awards — 4,345,149 — 4,234,933\nAdd: Effect of dilutive warrants — 33,009,877 — 32,302,754\nDiluted weighted average common shares 422,101,172 456,364,024 421,289,787 454,837,597\nNet income (loss) per common share (basic) $ (0.05) $ — $ (0.15) $ —\nNet income (loss) per common share (diluted) $ (0.05) $ — $ (0.15) $ —\n24\nBecause of their anti-dilutive effect, 20,674,831 and 20,674,831 common share equivalents comprised of stock options, PBRSUs, and RSUs have been\nexcluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Additionally, for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, TCP-ASC’s, IHC Health Services, Inc.’s (“Intermountain”), and Providence’s exercisable warrants to acquire up to 40.5\nmillion, 1.5 million, and 12.2 million shares, respectively, of the Company’s common stock were excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation because\nthey were anti-dilutive.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, 705,982 and 589,077 common share equivalents, respectively, were excluded from the diluted\nearnings per share calculation because of their anti-dilutive effect.\n12. Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal Proceedings\nOther than as described below, the Company is not presently a party to any material litigation or regulatory proceeding and is not aware of any pending or\nthreatened litigation or regulatory proceeding against the Company which, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on its business,\noperating results, financial condition or cash flows.\n(cid:0)* (cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)] (cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)V (cid:0)L(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Y (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)5 (cid:0)(cid:20) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)5 (cid:0)& (cid:0)0 (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0),(cid:0)Q (cid:0)F (cid:0)(cid:17)\nIn May 2016, the Company was served with a False Claims Act (“FCA”) case brought by a former emergency department service associate who worked at a\nhospital of one of the Company’s customers, MedStar Inc.’s Washington Hospital Center (“WHC”), along with WHC and three other hospitals that were PAS\ncustomers and a place holder, John Doe hospital, representing all PAS customers (U.S. ex rel. Graziosi vs. Accretive Health, Inc. et. al.), and seeking money\ndamages, FCA penalties, and attorneys’ fees. The Third Amended Complaint alleges that the Company’s PAS business violates the federal FCA. The case was\noriginally filed under seal in 2013 in the federal district court in Chicago and was presented to the U.S. Attorney in Chicago, and the U.S. Attorney declined to\nintervene. Both the Company’s and plaintiff’s motions for summary judgment were denied in December 2020, and the parties have completed damage and expert\ndiscovery. Additional dispositive motions are expected to extend through the remainder of 2024, with trial, if necessary, likely to be scheduled in 2025. The\nCompany believes it has meritorious defenses to all claims in the case and is vigorously defending itself against these claims.\n(cid:0)0 (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)J (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:16)(cid:0)5 (cid:0)H (cid:0)O(cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)’ (cid:0)H (cid:0)P (cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)/ (cid:0)H (cid:0)W(cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)& (cid:0)R (cid:0)P (cid:0)S (cid:0)O(cid:0)D (cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)W\nThe Company has received demand letters from several purported stockholders relating to books and records requests pursuant to Section 220 of the\nDelaware General Corporation Law, alleged disclosure deficiencies in the proxy statement related to the Merger, or appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the\nDelaware General Corporation Law, and a complaint filed in New York state court alleging negligence against R1, R1’s directors, and other parties to the Merger.\nNo assurances can be made as to the outcome of such demands, complaint, or other future actions.\n25\n13. Related Party Transactions\nThis note includes, among others, transactions between Ascension Health (“Ascension”) and its affiliates and the Company pursuant to the Master\nProfessional Services Agreement, including all supplements, amendments, and other documents entered into in connection therewith (the “Amended and Restated\nMaster Professional Services Agreement”). For further details on the Company’s agreements with Ascension, see Note 1 and Note 19 of the 2023 Form 10-K. In\nconjunction with the Cloudmed acquisition, New Mountain Capital, L.L.C. (“New Mountain”) became a related party. There were no material transactions with\nNew Mountain and its affiliates subsequent to the Cloudmed acquisition.\nNet services revenue from services provided to Ascension, as well as corresponding accounts receivable and customer liabilities are presented in the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) and the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Since Ascension is the Company’s largest\ncustomer, a significant percentage of the Company’s cost of services is associated with providing services to Ascension. However, due to the nature of the\nCompany’s global business services and information technology operations, it is impracticable to assign the dollar amount associated with services provided to\nAscension.\nIn response to the 2024 cyberattacks that impacted the ability to obtain data needed for base fee and incentive fee calculations, the Company and Ascension\nagreed to an alternative measurement and calculation approach for these fees as permitted under the Amended and Restated Master Professional Services\nAgreement (the “MPSA”) in certain circumstances that impact the economics of one or more of the parties or frustrates the ability of a party to perform its\nobligations under the MPSA, through no fault of its own. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, performance scores achieved by the Company prior to the\ncyberattacks were used in the determination of incentive fee revenue. In September 2024, the parties agreed to a fixed fee arrangement for incentive fee revenue for\nAscension’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2025. The objective of these modifications is for incentive fee revenue to be more consistent with that of the periods before\nthe cyber events occurred. For base fee revenue recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2024, it was agreed that cash deposits would be\nsubstituted for cash postings for the period when the system was unavailable. There has been no delay in payment of fees and no extended payment terms granted.\nOn July 31, 2024, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger relating to a take-private transaction, with affiliates of Clayton, Dubilier &\nRice, LLC and TowerBrook Capital Partners L.P., which is an affiliate of TCP-ASC. See Note 1, Business Description and Basis of Presentation.\nAlso on July 31, 2024, TCP-ASC executed a voting agreement (the “Voting Agreement”) in favor of the Company, pursuant to which TCP-ASC agreed,\namong other things, to (i) vote all of its shares of Company common stock in favor of the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and (ii)\nvote all of its shares of the Company common stock against any proposal made in opposition to the Merger Agreement or the Merger.\n14. Segments and Customer Concentrations\nThe Company has determined that it has a single operating segment in accordance with the way that management operates and views the business. All of the\nCompany’s significant operations are organized around the single business of providing management services of revenue cycle operations for U.S.-based healthcare\nproviders. Accordingly, for purposes of segment disclosures, the Company has only one operating and reportable segment.\n26\nCustomers comprising greater than 10% of net services revenue are as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\nCustomer Name 2024 2023 2024 2023\nAscension and its affiliates 30 % 40 % 34 % 39 %\nIntermountain Health 10 % 11 % 10 % 11 %\nThe loss of facilities within the Ascension health system or Intermountain Health could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s operations.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had a concentration of credit risk with Ascension, representing 11% and 10% of accounts\nreceivable, respectively.\n15. Supplemental Financial Information\nThe following table summarizes the allocation of depreciation and amortization expense related to property, equipment and software between cost of services\nand selling, general and administrative expenses:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nCost of services $ 23.1 $ 20.0 $ 63.1 $ 52.9\nSelling, general and administrative 0.8 0.4 1.7 1.0\nTotal depreciation and amortization $ 23.9 $ 20.4 $ 64.8 $ 53.9\nFinance lease right-of-use assets are included in property, equipment and software, net, and the current and non-current portion of financing lease liabilities\nare included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases are as follows:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows for operating leases $ 22.0 $ 19.2\nOperating cash flows for finance leases 0.1 —\nFinancing cash flows for finance leases 0.3 0.2\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange lease obligations:\nOperating leases 20.2 3.8\nFinance leases 8.1 —\n27\nItem 2.

The purchase price was $786.0 million, subject to adjustments. Concurrently with the closing of the acquisition\nand as part of the consideration thereof, we issued a warrant to acquire up to 12,192,000 shares of common stock of the Company to Providence. We funded the\ncash consideration for the Acclara Acquisition and related fees and expenses with cash on hand, borrowings of $80.0 million under our Senior Revolver, and\nadditional borrowings of $575.0 million from our senior secured term loan B facility (such additional borrowings, the “Incremental Term B Loans”). During the\nthree months ended June 30, 2024, we finalized the closing net working capital, which resulted in additional consideration due to the seller of $0.1 million that was\npaid in the third quarter of 2024.\n(cid:0)7 (cid:0)D (cid:0)N (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:16)(cid:0)3 (cid:0)U (cid:0)L(cid:0)Y (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)0 (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)J (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)$ (cid:0)J (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)H (cid:0)P (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W\nOn July 31, 2024, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Raven Acquisition Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited\nliability company (“Parent”), and Project Raven Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”, and together with\nParent, the “Buyer Parties”), providing for, among other things and on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, the merger of Merger Sub with and\ninto the Company (the “Merger”). We will survive the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, our common stock will be de-listed from Nasdaq, and we\nwill cease to be a reporting company.\nAt the time of Merger, our common stock (except for shares owned by us, our subsidiaries, Parent, Merger Sub or TCP-ASC or by stockholders who have\nproperly and validly exercised their statutory rights of appraisal under Delaware law) will be cancelled, extinguished and automatically converted into the right to\nreceive cash in an amount of $14.30 per share of common stock. Certain of our stockholders may enter into rollover agreements with an affiliate of Parent on\nmutually agreeable terms pursuant to which such stockholders will, immediately prior to the closing, contribute shares of our common stock to such affiliate in\nexchange for equity interests of such affiliate or one of its subsidiaries. Parent and Merger Sub are affiliates of Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC and TowerBrook\nCapital Partners L.P., which is an affiliate of TCP-ASC.\n29\nThe consummation of the Merger is subject to customary conditions, including receipt of the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all of the\noutstanding shares of our common stock to adopt the Merger Agreement, the absence of any law or other order restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the\nMerger, and other customary closing conditions.\nWe agreed to pay Parent $250.0 million in cash upon the termination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances and Parent agreed to pay us\n$550.0 million in cash upon the termination of the Merger Agreement under certain other circumstances.\nSubject to the satisfaction (or, if applicable, waiver) of such conditions, the Merger is expected to close by the end of the year. There is no guarantee that the\nMerger will be consummated in the timing that we currently anticipate or at all. We cannot predict with certainty whether or when any of the required closing\nconditions will be satisfied or whether another uncertainty may arise. We are subject to customary restrictions on our ability to solicit alternative acquisition\nproposals from third parties and to provide non-public information to, and participate in discussions and engage in negotiations with, third parties regarding\nalternative acquisition proposals, with customary exceptions for superior proposals.\nPursuant to the rules adopted by the SEC, the Company prepared and filed with the SEC, a Definitive Proxy Statement and amended Transaction Statement\non Schedule 13E-3 (together with the Buyer Parties) on October 16, 2024, containing more information about the Merger Agreement and the Merger. The special\nmeeting of stockholders to adopt the Merger Agreement and related matters is scheduled to be held virtually on November 14, 2024.\n(cid:0)& (cid:0)K (cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)J (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)+ (cid:0)H (cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)W(cid:0)K (cid:0)F (cid:0)D (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)& (cid:0)\\ (cid:0)E (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)W(cid:0)D (cid:0)F (cid:0)N\nOn February 21, 2024, Change Healthcare, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, was the target of a cyberattack that required it to take offline its computer\nsystems that handle electronic payments and insurance claims. Change Healthcare is the largest clearinghouse for medical claims in the U.S. and this event has\ncaused significant delays and disruptions in payments to hospitals, physicians, pharmacists, and other health care providers across the country. In response to the\ncyberattack, we transitioned customers who were impacted to alternative clearinghouses to submit, edit, and release claims to payers to address the backlog. Once\nthe impacted Change Healthcare systems came back online, we engaged a third-party security assessor to conduct a cybersecurity risk assessment of Change\nHealthcare and a review of Change Healthcare’s security reports and corresponding controls, including as related to the continuous security of our systems. Based\non these reviews and assessments, we approved reestablished connections while continuing to monitor the cyber threat environment.\nAs of June 30, 2024, all customer claims with processing issues related to the Change Healthcare outage were remediated through the transition to alternative\nclearinghouses or restored connection to the vendor following the successful completion of security assessments. We also implemented technology and automation\nsolutions to help mitigate issues surrounding both near-term and longer-term issues for claims submissions, processing, and, ultimately, cash collections.\nIn anticipation of potential customer payment delays and to mitigate impacts to our working capital related to this cyberattack, we proactively borrowed\n$75.0 million under the Senior Revolver on April 3, 2024, which was repaid during the quarter ended June 30, 2024. There have been no additional borrowings\nunder our Senior Revolver related to this matter.\n30\n(cid:0)$ (cid:0)V (cid:0)F (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)V (cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)& (cid:0)\\ (cid:0)E (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)W(cid:0)D (cid:0)F (cid:0)N\nOn May 8, 2024, Ascension Health was the target of a cyberattack that disrupted their clinical operations and affected their electronic health records systems\nas well as processes used to order certain tests, procedures, and medications. In response, we immediately disconnected from Ascension systems and reviewed our\nsystems. Ascension medical staff and R1 team members implemented downtime procedures for operational delivery to Ascension, including manual and paper-\nbased processes. We have not found any evidence that our systems or data were compromised, and we continue to monitor.\nWe conducted a cybersecurity risk assessment of Ascension and engaged a third-party security assessor to review Ascension’s security reports and\ncorresponding controls. Based on these reviews and assessments, we reestablished connections while continuing to monitor the cyber threat environment. We\nworked with Ascension to reinstate impacted services based on the indication in third party security assessments that it was safe to do so. On June 14, 2024,\nAscension announced the restoration of their electronic health records systems and vendors were able to begin reconnecting services. We continue to support\nAscension in the recovery of its revenue cycle processes and working through the backlog of records incurred during the outage.\nThe impact to our revenue related to the cyberattacks continues to be evaluated under the Amended and Restated Master Professional Services Agreement (the\n“MPSA”). Given the cyberattacks impacted the ability to obtain data needed for our base fee and incentive fee calculations, we reached an agreement with\nAscension regarding the measurement and calculations as permitted under the MPSA in certain circumstances that impact the economics of one or more of the\nparties or frustrates the ability of a party to perform its obligations under the MPSA, through no fault of its own. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, the parties\nagreed to use performance scores achieved by the Company prior to the cyberattacks to calculate incentive fee revenue. In September 2024, the parties agreed to a\nfixed fee arrangement for incentive fee revenue for Ascension’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2025. The objective of these modifications is for incentive fee revenue\nto be more consistent with that of the periods before the cyber events occurred. For base fee revenue recognized during the three months ended September 30,\n2024, it was agreed that cash deposits would be substituted for cash postings for the period when the system was unavailable. There has been no delay in payment\nof fees and no extended payment terms granted.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the estimated impact from the two industry cyber events to our revenue was approximately\n$8.8 million and $22.6 million, respectively, which primarily reflects lower incentive fee revenue due to the effect on key performance metrics and lower modular\nand other fees revenue. Additional revenue impacts related to collection timing and claim inflow volumes for modular service customers are expected to affect our\noverall performance in 2024. We also expect a shift in timing of net operating fees recognized between the fourth quarter of 2024 and into 2025 in connection with\nthe Ascension cyberattack.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, costs of approximately $16.4 million and $20.5 million, respectively, were incurred related to\ncontract labor, interim hiring, other third party expenses, and additional compensation to employees dedicated to supporting ongoing operations during the outages\nand remediation efforts. We anticipate additional expenses in the remainder of 2024 to address the impacted claims volume resulting from the disruption. We have\nfiled notices with our insurance company and intend to pursue recovery of certain costs and lost revenue for both the Change Healthcare cyberattack and the\nAscension cyberattack.\n31\n(cid:0)7 (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)8 (cid:0)Q (cid:0)F (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)W(cid:0)D (cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)H (cid:0)V\nRevenue cycle is a critical function for healthcare providers as they seek to increase process efficiency and maximize cash collected from payers and patients.\nHealthcare providers operate their revenue cycle with a combination of labor, software, and services vendors. Third-party vendors offer various solutions including\nconsulting services, software, and other services, including point solutions that cover one or multiple components of the revenue cycle and full outsourcing\nservices, among others. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) projects hospital care and physician care expenditures in the U.S. to amount to\n$1.6 trillion and $1.0 trillion in 2024, respectively. We estimate the cost of hospital and physician revenue cycle operations to be approximately 4% to 5% of\nrevenue, resulting in a market size of approximately $115 billion. According to Research and Markets data from Grand View Research, as of June 2023, U.S.\nrevenue cycle management market spend is projected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 10.3% through 2030.\nHealth systems and physician practices continue to face challenges in their revenue cycle operations based on several factors including: (1) more complex and\nclinical outcomes-based reimbursement, (2) industry consolidation amongst hospitals and across the continuum of care, (3) increasing patient responsibility for\ntheir medical bills, (4) healthcare labor shortage, and (5) capital constraints to invest in the revenue cycle given financial difficulties and requirements to invest in\nimproving clinical care. We believe these trends provide opportunities for external RCM vendors that will result in growth for the industry and our Company.\nHowever, these factors could also result in lower healthcare volumes and extended timelines for customer collections.\nIn 2024, we have and will continue to work closely with our provider partners to address revenue optimization and workforce management needs more\neffectively. Such needs continue to impact our provider partners’ performance because of changes to payer timeframes, increased coding complexity, regulatory\nshifts, and macroeconomic pressures. We anticipate incremental improvement over the next several years as normal cycles return following COVID. Similarly,\npatient volumes have continued to stabilize, and as a result, there has been and we continue to believe there will be a constructive environment in the remainder of\n2024 for our ability to collect cash on behalf of our customers notwithstanding the delays related to the cyberattacks described above. On the modular side, we\ncontinue to see a demand for our services in the remainder of 2024 because of macroeconomic pressures and the same performance-related pressures noted above.\nOther adverse macroeconomic conditions, including but not limited to resilient inflation, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, uncertainty regarding further\ninterest rate decreases and currency fluctuations, could impact macro-level consumer spending trends, which could affect the volumes processed on our platform\nand result in fluctuations to our revenue streams. Certain of our customers may be negatively impacted by these events. In addition, our business and customers\ncontinue to face challenges relating to a tight labor market and increased turnover rates. We plan to continue to invest in technology and leverage our global\nfootprint to help us offset these costs and expect to continue hiring talented employees and providing competitive compensation. The extent to which these\nmacroeconomic conditions will affect our business is uncertain and will depend on political, social, economic, and regulatory forces that are outside of our control.\nWe continue to assess fluctuating macroeconomic events to manage our response.\n32\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table provides consolidated operating results and other operating data for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended 2024 vs. 2023 Nine Months Ended September 2024 vs. 2023\nSeptember 30, Change 30, Change\n2024 2023 Amount % 2024 2023 Amount %\n(In millions, except percentages)\nConsolidated Statements of Operations Data:\nNet operating fees $ 413.0 $ 368.0 $ 45.0 12 % $ 1,169.1 $ 1,086.8 $ 82.3 8 %\nIncentive fees 22.4 30.1 (7.7) (26)% 59.7 84.5 (24.8) (29)%\nModular and other fees 221.4 174.7 46.7 27 % 659.8 507.8 152.0 30 %\nTotal net services revenue 656.8 572.8 84.0 15 % 1,888.6 1,679.1 209.5 12 %\nOperating expenses:\nCost of services 545.5 447.5 98.0 22 % 1,549.4 1,328.1 221.3 17 %\nSelling, general and administrative 62.3 54.7 7.6 14 % 184.9 164.3 20.6 13 %\nOther expenses 33.2 29.4 3.8 13 % 101.4 87.9 13.5 15 %\nTotal operating expenses 641.0 531.6 109.4 21 % 1,835.7 1,580.3 255.4 16 %\nIncome from operations 15.8 41.2 (25.4) (62)% 52.9 98.8 (45.9) (46)%\nNet interest expense 43.2 32.1 11.1 35 % 128.1 95.3 32.8 34 %\nIncome (loss) before income tax provision (benefit) (27.4) 9.1 (36.5) (401)% (75.2) 3.5 (78.7) n.m.\nIncome tax provision (benefit) (7.5) 7.8 (15.3) (196)% (12.6) 1.6 (14.2) (888)%\nNet income (loss) $ (19.9) $ 1.3 $ (21.2) n.m. $ (62.6) $ 1.9 $ (64.5) n.m.\nAdjusted EBITDA (1) $ 148.2 $ 161.5 $ (13.3) (8)% $ 456.5 $ 446.6 $ 9.9 2 %\nn.m. - not meaningful\n(1) Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below for a reconciliation of our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP to non-GAAP\nfinancial results.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn order to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the information used by our management team in financial and operational decision-making, we\nsupplement our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with GAAP with the non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted EBITDA.\nAdjusted EBITDA is utilized by the Board and management team as (i) one of the primary methods for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for\nevaluating actual results against such expectations; and (ii) as a performance evaluation metric in determining achievement of certain executive incentive\ncompensation programs, as well as for incentive compensation plans for employees.\n(cid:0)$ (cid:0)G (cid:0)M(cid:0)X (cid:0)V (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)( (cid:0)% (cid:0),(cid:0)7 (cid:0)’ (cid:0)$\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before net interest income/expense, income tax provision/benefit, depreciation and amortization expense,\nincluding the amortization of cloud computing arrangement implementation fees, share-based compensation expense, CoyCo 2, L.P.

The increase was primarily driven by the addition of Acclara revenue of $71.5 million, of which $27.9 million was reflected in\nnet operating fees and $43.6 million was reflected in modular and other fees. Additionally, there was an increase in net operating fees of $22.8 million primarily due\nto new customer contract revenue, which was partially offset by customer attrition and client facility divestitures. The overall increase in net services revenue was\npartially offset by the impact of the Ascension and Change Healthcare cyberattacks of $8.8 million.\nCost of Services\nCost of services primarily consists of wages and benefits of personnel that perform services for our customers and any related supplies, equipment, or facility\ncosts utilized by these employees, which includes our global shared service centers in India and the Philippines. It also includes cost of services provided to our\ncustomers by vendors directly contracted by R1 or assigned to R1 at contract inception.

The increase was primarily driven by the\naddition of Acclara’s cost of services, which was approximately $54.2 million, and amortization of intangible assets acquired from Acclara of $7.8 million. There\nwere also increased costs of approximately $42.1 million primarily related to employee and vendor onboarding to support new customer revenue. The increase was\nfurther driven by costs incurred related to the Ascension and Change Healthcare cyberattacks of $16.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a reduction\nof $9.3 million due to customer attrition and a reduction in share-based compensation expense of $5.5 million.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $7.6 million, or 14%, from $54.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to\n$62.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily driven by the addition of Acclara’s selling, general, and administrative\nexpense of $3.8 million and increased share-based compensation expense of $1.4 million.\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses increased by $3.8 million, or 13%, from $29.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to $33.2 million for the three months\nended September 30, 2024.

Our effective tax rate was approximately 27% and 86% for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was higher than the statutory federal tax rate due\nto taxes on foreign source income for global intangible low-taxed income and withholding taxes and certain non-deductible expenses, such as officers’\ncompensation and transaction costs. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was higher than the federal statutory tax rate due to state\nincome taxes, certain non-deductible compensation, and taxes on foreign source income.\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nNet Services Revenue\nNet services revenue increased by $209.5 million, or 12%, from $1,679.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to $1,888.6 million for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily driven by the addition of Acclara revenue of $199.1 million, of which $70.2 million was\nreflected in net operating fees and $128.9 million was reflected in modular and other fees. Additionally, the increase in net operating fees reflects revenue from new\ncustomer contracts of approximately $51.3 million, which was partially offset by a $33.1 million decrease related to physician customer attrition. The overall\nincrease in net services revenue was partially offset by the impact of the Ascension and Change Healthcare cyberattacks of $22.6 million.\nCost of Services\nCost of services primarily consists of wages and benefits of personnel that perform services for our customers and any related supplies, equipment, or facility\ncosts utilized by these employees, which includes our global shared service centers in India and the Philippines.

The increase was primarily driven by\nthe addition of Acclara’s cost of services, which was approximately $157.0 million, and amortization of intangible assets acquired from Acclara of $22.0 million.\nThere were also increased costs of approximately $45.8 million primarily related to employee and vendor onboarding to support new customer revenue. The\nincrease was further driven by costs incurred related to the Ascension and Change Healthcare cyberattacks of $20.5 million. These increases were partially offset by\na reduction of $21.3 million due to customer attrition.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $20.6 million, or 13%, from $164.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to\n$184.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily driven by the addition of Acclara’s selling, general and administrative\nexpenses, which was approximately $18.2 million, and an increase in share-based compensation expense of $6.5 million.\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses increased by $13.5 million, or 15%, from $87.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to $101.4 million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024. See Note 9, Other Expenses, to the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the details of\nthe costs included in this total for the comparative periods.\n36\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax benefit increased by $14.2 million from an income tax provision of $1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to an income tax\nbenefit of $12.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the tax benefit for the pre-tax loss and tax credits. Our effective tax rate\n(including discrete items) was approximately 17% and 46% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 was lower than the federal statutory tax rate primarily due to tax benefit for the pre-tax loss, tax credits offset by certain\nnon-deductible expenses, and taxes on foreign source income. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was higher than the federal\nstatutory tax rate due to state income taxes, non-deductible compensation, and taxes on foreign source income.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nManagement considers an accounting estimate to be critical if the accounting estimate requires management to make particularly difficult, subjective, or\ncomplex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had total available liquidity of $705.9 million and $772.4 million,\nrespectively, reflecting our cash and cash equivalents as well as remaining availability under our senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Senior Revolver”).\nOur liquidity is influenced by many factors, including timing of revenue and corresponding cash collections, with such revenue correlated to the ability of our\ncustomers to pay and the level of their payment, customer onboarding costs, the amount and timing of investments in strategic initiatives, transaction costs related\nto business acquisitions, timing and closing of the Merger, including costs related to the Merger, our technology investments, and the use of cash to pay tax\nwithholding obligations upon surrender of shares upon vesting of equity awards. We continue to invest capital in order to achieve our strategic initiatives,\nsuccessfully integrate acquired companies, and continue to invest in technology to increase the capabilities, scalability, and resiliency of our systems. We plan to\ncontinue to deploy resources to strengthen our information technology infrastructure, including automation, in order to drive additional value for our customers.\nWe expect to continue to invest in our global business services infrastructure and capabilities, including further expansion in the Philippines and India, and\nselectively pursue acquisitions and/or strategic relationships that will enable us to broaden or further enhance our offerings. New business development remains a\npriority as we plan to continue to boost our sales and marketing efforts. Additionally, we expect to continue to incur costs associated with implementation and\ntransition costs to onboard new customers.\n37\nWe expect cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and our availability under the Senior Revolver or other debt financing to continue to be\nsufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, including debt maturities and material capital expenditures,\nfor the next 12 months and beyond. Similar to previous acquisitions and the Acclara Acquisition noted above, future potential acquisitions may be funded through\nthe incurrence of additional debt if our current credit facilities do not have the required capacity.\nOur material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations:\nDebt\nOur indebtedness increased as a result of the Acclara Acquisition. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding debt of $2.2 billion with contractual\npayments extending through 2029, with $72.8 million payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with our debt total $554.9 million, with\n$160.5 million payable within the next 12 months, based on the floating rates as of September 30, 2024.\nLeases\nOur significant leasing activity encompasses leases for real estate, including corporate offices, operational facilities, and global business services centers. As\nof September 30, 2024, we had fixed future lease payments of $144.1 million, with $30.8 million payable within 12 months.\nSoftware Purchase and Services Obligations\nOur primary purchase obligations relate to contracts entered into with vendors that supply various software services and products. As of September 30, 2024,\nwe had purchase obligations related to software and service contracts of $153.4 million, with $38.5 million payable within 12 months, most of which will be future\noperating expense.\nCash Flow Activity\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $167.3 million and $173.6 million, respectively. Cash flows from\noperating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, are summarized in the following table:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(In millions)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 172.6 $ 221.3\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (752.7) $ (75.6)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 574.3 $ (90.5)\n(cid:0)& (cid:0)D (cid:0)V (cid:0)K (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)) (cid:0)O(cid:0)R (cid:0)Z (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)I(cid:0)U (cid:0)R (cid:0)P (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)2 (cid:0)S (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)J (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)$ (cid:0)F (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)Y (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)H (cid:0)V\nCash provided by operating activities decreased by $48.7 million from $221.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to $172.6 million for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cash provided by operating activities primarily decreased due to a larger cash bonus payout and significantly higher\nestimated federal and state tax payments in 2024 compared to 2023. In addition, the 2024 operating cash flows include payments of Acclara Acquisition expenses\nand fees related to the strategic alternatives review that did not occur in 2023.\n38\n(cid:0)& (cid:0)D (cid:0)V (cid:0)K (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)8 (cid:0)V (cid:0)H (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0),(cid:0)Q (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)J (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)$ (cid:0)F (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)Y (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)H (cid:0)V\nCash used in investing activities primarily includes our investments in property, equipment and software and our inorganic growth initiatives. Outflows for\nsignificant acquisitions have typically been offset by cash inflows from financing activities related to obtaining new debt.\nCash used in investing activities increased by $677.1 million from $75.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to $752.7 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024. Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes approximately $662.0 million of cash\nused for the purchase of Acclara. This change also included a $2.5 million increase in property, equipment and software spend related to our strategic initiatives and\ncapitalization of software for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n(cid:0)& (cid:0)D (cid:0)V (cid:0)K (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)) (cid:0)O(cid:0)R (cid:0)Z (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)I(cid:0)U (cid:0)R (cid:0)P (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)) (cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)F (cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)J (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)$ (cid:0)F (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)Y (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)H (cid:0)V\nCash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments of debt. In conjunction with acquisitions, we typically borrow additional\ndebt to fund the consideration, either by increasing our existing facilities or refinancing with new facilities. We utilize our Senior Revolver to ensure we have\nsufficient cash on hand to support the needs of the business at any given point in time. Cash flows from financing activities also include cash received from\nexercises of stock options and the use of cash to pay tax withholding obligations on shares surrendered upon vesting of equity awards, as well as other financing\nactivities.\nCash provided by financing activities increased by $664.8 million from cash used of $90.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to cash\nprovided of $574.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash from financing activities included\n$575.0 million of Incremental Term B Loans (as defined herein), net of discount and issuance costs of $13.5 million, and additional net borrowings of $60.0 million\nunder the Senior Revolver incurred in connection with the Acclara Acquisition compared to $40.0 million of net repayments under the Senior Revolver in 2023.\nDebt and Financing Arrangements\nOn June 21, 2022, we entered into the Second A&R Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders named\ntherein, governing the Company’s second amended and restated senior secured credit facilities (the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities”), consisting of the\n$691.3 million existing senior secured term loan A facility (the “Existing Term A Loan”), a $540.0 million senior secured incremental term loan A facility (the\n“Incremental Term A Loan,” and together with the Existing Term A Loan, the “Term A Loans”), a $500.0 million senior secured term loan B facility (the\n“Existing Term B Loan,” and together with the Incremental Term B Loans, the “Term B Loans”), and the $600.0 million Senior Revolver.\nOn January 17, 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 2 (the “Second Amendment”) to the Second A&R Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the Second\nAmendment, among certain other amendments, the lenders named in the Second Amendment agreed, severally and not jointly, to extend the Incremental Term\nB Loans to the Company under the Second A&R Credit Agreement in an aggregate principal amount equal to $575.0 million. The Company used the\nproceeds of the Incremental Term B Loans, together with cash on hand and borrowings of $80.0 million under the Senior Revolver, to finance (i) the cash\nconsideration for the Acclara Acquisition and (ii) fees and costs incurred in connection with the acquisition and related transactions.\nWe are required to repay the Term A Loans and the Term B Loans in quarterly principal installments.\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities bear interest at a floating rate, which was 7.10% for the Term A Loans and Senior Revolver and 7.85% for the Term\nB Loans as of September 30, 2024. See Note 7, Derivative Financial Instruments, to our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q for discussion on our interest rate hedging transactions.\n39\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had drawn $60.0 million and had $538.6 million of remaining availability on our Senior Revolver.\nThe Second A&R Credit Agreement contains a number of financial and non-financial covenants. We are required to maintain minimum consolidated total net\nleverage and consolidated interest coverage ratios. The Company was in compliance with all of the covenants in the Second A&R Credit Agreement as of\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nSee Note 6, Debt, to our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.\nItem 3.

Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates due to our debt and banking\narrangements, which can result in fluctuations in our interest income and expense. As of September 30, 2024, we have hedged $500.0 million of our $2.2 billion\noutstanding floating rate debt to a fixed rate of 3.01% plus the applicable spread defined in the Second A&R Credit Agreement. The remaining $1.7 billion\noutstanding is subject to average variable rates of 7.10% for the Term A Loans and Senior Revolver and 7.85% for the Term B Loans as of September 30, 2024.\nAssuming the current level of borrowings, a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would have increased or decreased our annual interest\nexpense on the $1.7 billion subject to variable rates by approximately $17.4 million as of September 30, 2024.\nOur interest income is primarily generated from variable rate interest earned on operating cash accounts.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk. Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the Indian rupee and Philippine\npeso because a portion of our operating expenses are incurred by our subsidiaries in India and the Philippines and are denominated in Indian rupees and Philippine\npesos, respectively. We do not generate significant revenues outside of the United States. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 10% and 9% of\nour expenses were denominated in foreign currencies, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had net assets of $128.5 million and $101.3 million in\nforeign entities, respectively. Before the impact of our foreign currency hedging activities discussed below, the reduction in earnings from a 10% change in foreign\ncurrency spot rates would have been $19.8 million and $16.2 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nWe have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges which have maturities not extending beyond December 31,\n2024 and are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to our global business service centers. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, our foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges had a total notional value of $53.2 million and we had no outstanding\nfair value hedges. For additional information, see Note 7, Derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q. These instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk. Credit risk is managed through careful\nselection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties.\nFor designated cash flow hedges, gains and losses currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into earnings at the time\nwhen certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as cost of services. As of September 30, 2024, it was anticipated that approximately $0.1 million of\ngains, net of tax, currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into cost of services within the next 12 months. For designated\nfair value hedges, gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are recorded to earnings in the current period. For the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company had recognized $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively, of gains in earnings related to foreign currency forward contracts\ndesignated as fair value hedges.\n40\nWe use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio.\nThe sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates. This sensitivity analysis\nrepresents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure. A 10% change in the\nlevels of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (or other base currency of the hedge if not a U.S. dollar hedge) with all other variables held\nconstant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately $4.9 million as of September 30, 2024.\nWe continually monitor our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and may use additional derivative financial instruments and hedging transactions in the\nfuture if, in our judgment, circumstances warrant. There can be no guarantee that the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in the future will not be significant and\nwill not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nItem 4.

On\nSeptember 13, 2024, the waiting period applicable to the Merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, expired. The\nconsummation of the Merger remains subject to customary conditions as set forth in the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, the: (i) affirmative vote of\nthe holders of a majority of all of the outstanding shares of our common stock to adopt the Merger Agreement; and (ii) the absence of any law or order restraining,\nenjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger. In addition, the obligation of each party to consummate the Merger is conditioned upon the other party’s\nrepresentations and warranties being true and correct (subject to certain customary materiality exceptions) and the other party having performed in all material\nrespects its covenants, obligations and conditions under the Merger Agreement. The obligation of the buyer parties to consummate the Merger is also subject to the\nabsence of a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement). Many of the conditions to completion of the Merger are not within our\ncontrol, and we cannot predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied (or waived, if permitted by the Merger Agreement and applicable law). In addition, the\nMerger may fail to close for other reasons.\nThe pending Merger as well as any delays in the expected timeframe, could cause disruption in and create uncertainties, which could have an adverse effect\non our business, operating results, financial condition and trading price of our common stock, regardless of whether the Merger is completed, and could cause us\nnot to realize some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve if the Merger is successfully completed within its expected timeframe. These risks include, but\nare not limited to:\n• the completion of the Transaction on anticipated terms and timing or at all, including obtaining required stockholder approval, and the satisfaction of\nother conditions to the completion of the Transaction;\n• litigation relating to the Transaction instituted against parties involved in the Merger or their respective directors, managers or officers, including the\neffects of any outcomes related thereto;\n• disruptions from the Transaction, including the diversion of management’s attention from our ongoing business operations and the previously\ndisclosed expected Chief Executive Officer succession in connection with the closing of the Merger;\n• our ability to retain and hire key personnel in light of the Transaction;\n42\n• potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships with our vendors, customers and employees resulting from the announcement or\ncompletion of the Transaction, including if our customers, vendors, employees or others attempt to negotiate changes in existing business\nrelationships, consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us, delay or defer decisions concerning their business with us, or\nterminate their existing business relationships with us while the Merger is pending;\n• significant transaction costs, including the possibility that the Transaction may be more expensive to complete than anticipated, including as a result of\nunexpected factors or events, and the requirement that we pay a termination fee of $250.0 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain\ncircumstances;\n• the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the Transaction, including in circumstances\nrequiring us to pay a termination fee or other expenses;\n• competitive responses to the Transaction, including the possibility that competing offers or acquisition proposals for us will be made;\n• being subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business, resulting in possibly foregoing certain business opportunities that we might\notherwise pursue absent the Merger;\n• impacts on the price of our common stock; and\n• developments beyond our control, including, but not limited to, developments in macro-economic and industry conditions that may affect the timing\nor success of the Merger.\nEven if successfully completed, there are certain risks to our stockholders from the Merger, including:\n• the per share consideration is fixed and will not be adjusted for changes in our business, assets, liabilities, prospects, outlook, financial condition or\noperating results or in the event of any change in the market price of, analyst estimates of, or projections relating to, our common stock;\n• the fact that receipt of the all-cash per share consideration under the Merger Agreement is taxable to stockholders that are treated as U.S. holders for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes; and\n• the fact that, if the Merger is completed, our stockholders (other than those stockholders that will contribute their shares of common stock pursuant to\nRollover Agreements, if any (as defined in the Merger Agreement)) will not participate in any future growth potential or benefit from any future\nincrease in the value of our company.\n(cid:0)) (cid:0)D (cid:0)L(cid:0)O(cid:0)X (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)R (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)F (cid:0)R (cid:0)P (cid:0)S (cid:0)O(cid:0)H (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)K (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)0 (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)J (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)F (cid:0)R (cid:0)X (cid:0)O(cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)G (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)V (cid:0)H (cid:0)O(cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)I(cid:0)I(cid:0)H (cid:0)F (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R (cid:0)X (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)E (cid:0)X (cid:0)V (cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)K (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)G (cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)J (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)S (cid:0)U (cid:0)L(cid:0)F (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R (cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R (cid:0)X (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)F (cid:0)R (cid:0)P (cid:0)P (cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)V (cid:0)W(cid:0)R (cid:0)F (cid:0)N (cid:0)(cid:17)\nThe closing of the Merger may not occur on the expected timeline or at all.

If we are\nrequired to pay this termination fee, such fee, together with costs incurred to execute the Merger Agreement and pursue the Merger, would have a material adverse\neffect on our operating results and financial condition.\n43\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated and the Merger is not consummated, investor confidence could decline; stockholder litigation could be brought against\nus, our directors and officers; relationships with existing and prospective customers, vendors, investors, lenders and other business partners may be adversely\nimpacted; we may be unable to attract or retain key personnel; our employees could be distracted and their productivity could decline; and profitability may be\nadversely impacted due to costs incurred in connection with the Merger. We may also experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including a decline\nin the trading price of our common stock and you may not recover your investment or receive a price for your shares similar to what has been offered pursuant to\nthe Merger. In addition, the trading price of our common stock has in the past and may continue to fluctuate substantially in the event that the Merger is not\nconsummated. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock may include: fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results\nof companies perceived to be similar to us; changes in estimates of our financial results or recommendations by securities analysts, if any, who cover our common\nstock, or failure to meet expectations of such securities analysts; the loss of service agreements with customers; lawsuits filed against us by governmental\nauthorities or stockholders; unfavorable publicity concerning our operations or business practices; investors’ general perception of us; changes in local, regional or\nnational economic conditions; changes in demographic trends; increased labor costs, including healthcare, unemployment insurance, and minimum wage\nrequirements; the entry into, or termination of, material agreements; changes in general economic, industry, regulatory, and market conditions not related to us or\nour business; the availability of experienced management and hourly-paid employees; issues in operating the company; future sales of our securities, including\nsales by our significant stockholders; and other potentially negative financial announcements, including delisting of our common stock from The Nasdaq Global\nSelect Market, changes in accounting treatment or restatement of previously reported financial results, delays in our filings with the SEC or failure to maintain\neffective internal control over financial reporting.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected, and continue to affect, the market prices of equity\nsecurities of many companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation or launched activist campaigns following periods of market\nvolatility. If we were involved in securities litigation or an activist campaign, we could incur substantial costs, and our resources and the attention of management\ncould be diverted from our business.\n(cid:0)7 (cid:0)K (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)0 (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)J (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)$ (cid:0)J (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)H (cid:0)P (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)F (cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)D (cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)S (cid:0)U (cid:0)R (cid:0)Y (cid:0)L(cid:0)V (cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)K (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)O(cid:0)L(cid:0)P (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R (cid:0)X (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)E (cid:0)L(cid:0)O(cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)R (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)S (cid:0)X (cid:0)U (cid:0)V (cid:0)X (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)Q (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)R (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)K (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)0 (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)J (cid:0)H (cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:17)\nUnder the Merger Agreement, we are restricted from soliciting alternative acquisition proposals from third parties and providing information to, or\nparticipating in discussions or engaging in negotiations with, third parties regarding any alternative acquisition proposals, subject to a customary “fiduciary out”\nprovision.

Our operations depend on the availability of our global\nbusiness service centers and their operating effectiveness in maintaining and protecting our applications, which are located in data centers that are operated and\ncontrolled by third parties. In addition, our information technologies and systems, as well as our data centers and global business services centers, are vulnerable to\ndamage or interruption from various causes, including natural disasters, war, acts of terrorism, public health events (including pandemics), power losses, computer\nsystems failures, internet and telecommunications or data network failures, operator error, loss or corruption of data, and other events. We have a global business\nresiliency program and maintain insurance against fires, floods, other natural disasters, and general business interruptions to mitigate the adverse effects of a\ndisruption, relocation, or change in operating environment at one of our data centers or global business services centers, but the situations we plan for and the\namount of insurance coverage we maintain may not be adequate in every case. In addition, the occurrence of any of these events could result in interruptions,\ndelays, or cessations in service to our customers, or in the direct connections we establish between our customers and payers. Any of these events could impair or\ninhibit our ability to provide our services, reduce the attractiveness of our services to current or potential customers, and adversely affect our financial condition and\noperating results.\n45\nIn addition, despite the implementation of security measures, our infrastructure, data centers, global business services centers, or systems that we interface\nwith, including the internet and related systems, may be vulnerable to intrusion, improper employee or contractor access, programming errors, computer viruses,\nmalicious code, phishing attacks, denial-of-service attacks, or other cyber attacks and information security threats by third parties seeking to disrupt operations or\nmisappropriate information or similar physical or electronic breaches of security. Any such attack could cause system failure, including network, software, or\nhardware failure, and could result in service disruptions. Further, our network, information systems, and other services and systems are subject to various risks\nrelated to third parties and other parties we may not fully control. We use encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide secure\ntransmission of confidential information, including our business data and customer information. In addition, we rely on employees in our data centers and global\nbusiness services centers to follow our procedures when handling sensitive information. While we select our employees and third-party business partners carefully,\nwe do not control their actions, which could expose us and them to cybersecurity and other risks. As a result, we may be required to expend significant capital and\nother resources to protect against security breaches and hackers or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches.\nRecent cyberattacks affecting our third-party vendors have harmed our business. On February 21, 2024, Change Healthcare, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth\nGroup, was the target of a cyberattack that required it to take offline its computer systems that handle electronic payments and insurance claims. Change Healthcare\nis the largest clearinghouse for medical claims in the U.S. and this event has caused significant delays and disruptions in payments to hospitals, physicians,\npharmacists, and other health care providers across the country. In response to the cyberattack, we transitioned customers who were impacted to alternative\nclearinghouses to submit, edit, and release claims to payers to address the backlog. We approved reestablished connections while continuing to monitor the cyber\nthreat environment.\nOn May 8, 2024, Ascension Health was the target of a cyberattack that disrupted their clinical operations and affected their electronic health records systems\nas well as processes used to order certain tests, procedures, and medications. In response, we immediately disconnected from Ascension systems and reviewed our\nsystems. We have not found any evidence that our systems or data were compromised, and we will continue to monitor.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred costs and earned lower base fee and incentive fee revenue due to the effect on key\nperformance metrics and lower modular and other fees revenue from these cyberattacks. The expected cash flow impacts to our customers may affect their ability to\npay our invoices in a timely manner. Additional costs and revenue impacts are expected to affect our overall performance in 2024.\nSee Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\n46\nItem 2.
