Under the terms of the LOI, Richtech Robotics agreed to enter into a franchise agreement with Ghost Kitchens America, pursuant to which the Company will acquire exclusive rights to operate 20 Walmart-located restaurants in Arizona, Colorado, and Texas. These restaurants will be directly managed by Richtech Robotics’ subsidiary, AlphaMax Management LLC, with the aim of optimizing restaurant operations through robotics and AI cloud technology. Each location is expected to generate between $700 thousand and $2 million in annual revenue.\n\nRichtech Robotics is deploying its proprietary automation to enhance operational efficiency, augment and personalize customer experiences, and lower operational costs. The establishment and ongoing management of these restaurants is anticipated to provide a clear, repeatable operational blueprint that businesses can use to scale robotic deployment and optimize their business model.\n\nMatt Casella, President of Richtech Robotics, stated: \"Richtech Robotics is committed to the commercialization of robotics, through both robotic sales and the operation of our own robot-powered restaurants. This agreement will significantly add to our restaurant portfolio, and these high-traffic locations will bring greater visibility to our brand and our solutions. Our restaurant operations will showcase the very same robotic and AI platforms offered through our RaaS (Robotics-as-a-Service) business model. We expect these platforms to become a fast-growing and stable revenue stream for us as we leverage them to manage thousands, and eventually tens of thousands, of restaurant operations in the future.”\n\nGeorge Kottas, CEO of Ghost Kitchens America, commented: \"All Walmart locations where we’ve signed agreements with Richtech Robotics have strong sales numbers and steady customer traffic. Based on our previous collaborations, Ghost Kitchens is confident that Richtech Robotics’ robotic technology and operational management services will maximize the performance of these restaurants. We look forward to further expanding our partnership with Richtech Robotics as we rapidly grow our restaurant footprint.\"\n\nIn addition to today’s announcement, the Company has already secured exclusive operational rights for the Ghost Kitchen at a Walmart location in Rockford, Illinois. Additionally, Richtech Robotics has signed a franchise agreement for another Walmart restaurant in Peachtree, Georgia, which is expected to begin operations later this year.\n\nThrough AlphaMax Management LLC, Richtech Robotics is operating these restaurants and advancing the application of robotic technology in the food service industry, with the goal of helping businesses reduce costs and improve efficiency.\n\n**About Richtech Robotics**\n\nRichtech Robotics is a provider of collaborative robotic solutions specializing in the service industry, including the hospitality and healthcare sectors.
