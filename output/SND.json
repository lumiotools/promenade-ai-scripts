(NASDAQ: SND) (the \"Company\" or \"Smart Sand\"), a fully integrated frac and industrial sand supply and services company, a low-cost producer of high quality Northern White frac sand, a proppant logistics solutions provider through both its in-basin transloading terminals and SmartSystemsTM products and services and a provider of industrial product solutions, today announced results for the third quarter of 2024.\n\n[ ![Smart Sand, Inc. Logo \\(PRNewsfoto/Smart Sand, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2359636/Smart_Sand_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2359636/Smart_Sand_Logo.html)\n\n\"We are pleased to report that our continued focus on pro-actively managing our cost structure and capital expenditures led to positive free cash flow for the quarter,\" stated Chuck Young, CEO of Smart Sand. \"We remain cash flow positive for 2024, and in keeping with our stated goal of returning capital to our shareholders this year, we recently paid a special dividend of $0.10 per common share outstanding, and we additionally announced a share buyback plan of up to $10 million.\"\n\n\"Importantly, during the quarter, we put in place a new five-year $30 million ABL credit facility with our new lender First Citizens Bank. This facility provides us with an efficient and flexible source of funding that allows us manage our business going forward as well as the ability to act quickly on emerging opportunities.\n\nWe continue to believe in the long-term fundamentals of the oil and gas business, and although volumes decreased modestly quarter over quarter, demand remains strong through the fourth quarter. As for 2025, we are particularly excited about anticipated growing demand for natural gas in both the US and Canadian markets coupled with oil activity that is expected to increase in the Utica basin. As a result, we expect a pickup in activity and volumes through the end of the year and in the first half of 2025.\"\n\n**Third****Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\nTons sold were approximately 1,189,000 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to approximately 1,274,000 tons in the second quarter of 2024 and 1,219,000 tons in the third quarter of 2023, a 7% decrease sequentially and a 2% decrease over the comparable period in 2023.\n\nRevenues were $63.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $73.8 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $76.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. Revenues declined in the third quarter of 2024, compared to both the second quarter of 2024 and third quarter 2023, due primarily to lower sales volumes and lower average selling prices. The supply and demand for Northern White sand have become more in balance over the course of 2024 which has led to pricing pressure. \n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, we had net loss before income tax of $5.2 million, compared to a net income before income tax of $1.9 million, for the second quarter of 2024 and net income before income tax of $4.8 million, for the third quarter of 2023. Income tax expense and benefits distorts our results of operations. We do not expect to make payments for federal income tax in 2024. For the third quarter of 2024, we had lower net income before income tax expense as compared to the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter 2023 due primarily to lower revenues from lower sales volumes and lower average sand prices coupled with lower SmartSystem rental revenue due to reduced fleet utilization in the quarter. Additionally, we had a $1.1 million non-cash charge related to the closing and relocation of our fabrication operations in Canada and $1.3 million in bank fees and legal expenses related to refinancing our expiring ABL credit facility. \n\nWe reduced our SmartSytem fleet utilization in the quarter as we are currently in the process of revamping our SmartSystem fleet configuration to improve the efficiency of our fleet operations and to better meet the long term needs of the market. We are currently in testing mode for the revamped SmartSystems and expect to roll out the new fleet configuration early in 2025. \n\nThird quarter 2024 contribution margin of $13.2 million, or $11.09 per ton sold, was a decrease compared to $19.8 million or $15.53 per ton sold, for the second quarter of 2024, and $21.0 million or $17.20 per ton sold for the third quarter of 2023. The decline in contribution margin and contribution margin per ton for both comparable periods was due primarily to lower average selling prices of our frac sand, partially offset by reduced production costs on both lower volumes and due to cost cutting measures implemented by management.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $5.7 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $11.9 million for the second quarter of 2024 and $13.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2024 compared to both of the comparable periods was primarily due to lower contribution margin per ton sold in the current period, which was driven by lower average selling prices.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $5.8 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $14.9 million in the second quarter of 2024 and net cash provided by operating activities of $12.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decline in cash flow from operations in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024 was primarily due to reduced sales volumes and lower average selling prices in the current period.\n\nFree cash flow was $3.7 million for the third quarter of 2024. Net cash provided by operating activities was $5.8 million and capital expenditures were $2.1 million in the third quarter of 2024. We currently estimate that full year 2024 capital expenditures will be between $8.0 million and $10.0 million.\n\n**Liquidity**\n\nOn October 3, 2024, the Smart Sand Board of Directors declared a special dividend of $0.10 per share of common stock, which was paid on October 28, 2024 to stockholders of record at the close of business on October 15, 2024.\n\nOn October 3, 2024, the Smart Sand Board of Directors also approved an eighteen month share repurchase program under which we may purchase up to $10.0 million of our ordinary shares (the \"Repurchase Program\"). Pursuant to the Repurchase Program, we may repurchase our ordinary shares from time to time, in amounts, at prices and at such times as management deems appropriate, subject to market conditions and other considerations. Management may make repurchases in the open market, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated repurchase programs or structured share repurchase programs. The Repurchase Program will be conducted in compliance with applicable legal requirements and shall be subject to market conditions and other factors. The Repurchase Program does not obligate management to acquire any particular amount of ordinary shares and the Repurchase Program may be modified or suspended at any time.\n\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow generated from operations and available borrowings under the FCB ABL Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, cash on hand was $7.2 million and we had $30.0 million in undrawn availability on the FCB ABL Credit Facility.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nSmart Sand will host a conference call and live webcast for analysts and investors on November 13, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss its third quarter 2024 financial results. Investors are invited to join the conference by dialing (646) 357-8785 or 1-800-836-8184 and referencing \"Smart Sand\" when connected to the operator.

use contribution margin, which we define as total revenues less costs of goods sold excluding depreciation, depletion and accretion of asset retirement obligations, to measure its financial and operating performance. Contribution margin excludes other operating expenses and income, including costs not directly associated with the operations of the Company's business such as accounting, human resources, information technology, legal, sales and other administrative activities. \n\nWe believe that reporting contribution margin and contribution margin per ton sold provides useful performance metrics to management and external users of our financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, because these metrics provide an operating and financial measure of our ability, as a combined business, to generate margin in excess of our operating cost base.\n\nGross profit is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to contribution margin. Contribution margin should not be considered an alternative to gross profit presented in accordance with GAAP. Because contribution margin may be defined differently by other companies in the industry, our definition of contribution margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility. The following table presents a reconciliation of gross profit to contribution margin.\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024** | **June 30, 2024** | **September 30, 2023**  \n**(in thousands, except per ton amounts)**  \nRevenue | $ 63,158 | $ 73,800 | $ 76,900  \nCost of goods sold | 56,671 | 60,727 | 62,502  \nGross profit | 6,487 | 13,073 | 14,398  \nDepreciation, depletion, and accretion of asset retirement obligations included in cost of goods sold | 6,700 | 6,715 | 6,573  \nContribution margin | $ 13,187 | $ 19,788 | $ 20,971  \nContribution margin per ton | $ 11.09 | $ 15.53 | $ 17.20  \nTotal tons sold | 1,189 | 1,274 | 1,219  \n  \n**EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA**\n\nWe define EBITDA as net income, plus: (i) depreciation, depletion and amortization expense; (ii) income tax expense (benefit) and other results of operations based taxes; and (iii) interest expense. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, plus: (i) gain or loss on sale of fixed assets or discontinued operations; (ii) integration and transition costs associated with specified transactions; (iii) equity compensation; (iv) acquisition and development costs; (v) non-recurring cash charges related to restructuring, retention and other similar actions; (vi) earn-out, contingent consideration obligations; and (vii) non-cash charges and unusual or non-recurring charges. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, to assess:\n\n  * the financial performance of our assets without regard to the impact of financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis of our assets;\n  * the viability of capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities;\n  * our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures;\n  * our operating performance as compared to those of other companies in our industry without regard to the impact of financing methods or capital structure; and\n  * our debt covenant compliance, as Adjusted EBITDA is a key component of critical covenants to the ABL Credit Facility.\n\n\n\nWe believe that our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA will provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. Net income is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered alternatives to net income presented in accordance with GAAP. Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility. The following table presents a reconciliation of net (loss) income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated.\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024** | **June 30, 2024** | **September 30, 2023**  \n**(in thousands)**  \nNet (loss) income | $ (98) | $ (430) | $ 6,727  \nDepreciation, depletion and amortization | 7,161 | 7,214 | 6,985  \nIncome tax expense (benefit) and other taxes | (5,136) | 2,330 | (1,879)  \nInterest expense | 383 | 408 | 304  \nEBITDA | $ 2,310 | $ 9,522 | $ 12,137  \nNet loss (gain) on disposal of fixed assets | 1,063 | 3 | (92)  \nEquity compensation | 765 | 728 | 850  \nAcquisition and development costs | 8 | 1,310 | 70  \nLoss on extinguishment of debt | 31 | — | —  \nCash charges related to restructuring and retention | — | 41 | —  \nAccretion of asset retirement obligations | 249 | 249 | 235  \nBank and legal costs related to financing not closed | 1,294 | — | —  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ 5,720 | $ 11,853 | $ 13,200  \n  \n**Free Cash Flow**\n\nFree cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment, is used as a supplemental financial measure by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, to measure the liquidity of our business.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to free cash flow. Free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities presented in accordance with GAAP.
