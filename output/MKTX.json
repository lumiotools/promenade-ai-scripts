(Nasdaq: MKTX), the operator of a leading electronic trading platform for fixed-income securities, today announced trading volume and preliminary variable transaction fees per million (“FPM”) for October 2024. 1\n\n**Chris Concannon, CEO of MarketAxess, commented:**\n\n“We delivered the **second straight month of record total trading ADV in October** , driven by continued robust market volumes and strength in our international businesses. Our rates business also generated **record** ADV in October, surpassing the previous monthly record set during a period of extreme market volatility in March 2020. \n\nWhile we are disappointed with the absolute level of market share in U.S. high-grade in October, we were pleased to see **record** trading volumes, an increase in U.S. high-yield estimated market share compared to September and an increase in our preliminary total credit fee capture during the month. Most importantly, our preliminary total credit variable commission revenue in October was slightly above September levels. We believe the decline in our high-grade market share was driven by lower portfolio trading and a client shift to large block trading in the market. Large portfolio trades in the market and the mix of activity across U.S. high-grade TRACE can generate significant swings in market share without materially impacting revenue generation. \n\nWe are continuing the roll-out of X-Pro to our global client base and we now have our block solution in the market, which we believe will be integral to the success of our “high-touch” strategy.” \n\n**Select October 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * **Record** total average daily volume (“ADV”) of **$46.2 billion** increased **40%** compared to the prior year, and increased **2%** compared to September 2024.

The Company undertakes no obligation to update any fee information in future press releases.   \n2 The Company is highlighting the impact of single-dealer portfolio trading volume on U.S. high-grade and U.S. high-yield trading volume and estimated market share, where material, but will continue to exclude single-dealer portfolio trading activity from each product’s aggregated trading volume and estimated market share and the total credit FPM calculation.   \n3 See “General Notes Regarding the Data Presented” below.   \n4  Open Trading share of total credit trading volume is derived by taking total Open Trading volume across all credit products where Open Trading is offered and dividing by total credit trading volume across all credit products where Open Trading is offered.   \n5 The number of U.S. trading days is based on the SIFMA holiday recommendation calendar and the number of U.K. trading days is based primarily on the U.K. Bank holiday schedule.   \n  \n**General Notes Regarding the Data Presented**\n\nReported MarketAxess volume in all product categories includes only fully electronic trading volume. MarketAxess trading volumes and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (“TRACE”) reported volumes are available on the Company’s website at [investor.marketaxess.com/volume](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&esheet=54147142&newsitemid=20241104063311&lan=en-US&anchor=investor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&index=1&md5=9dbb977b0eb3a45433ef4b77767134f3). \n\nFor periods beginning with January 2024, the Company has made changes to the market volume data used to calculate estimated market share for Municipal and U.S. Government Bonds. For Municipal Bonds, the Company previously used estimates, derived from data issued by the Municipal Securities Rule Making Board (“MSRB”), including estimates for new issuance, commercial paper and variable-rate trading activity, and excluded these volumes from the estimated market volume data. While the Company still uses estimates, the new methodology for identifying and excluding these volumes from the market volume data is now based on MSRB “flags” to identify new issuance, commercial paper, and variable-rate volumes. For U.S. Government Bonds, the previous data source for estimated market volumes was the Federal Reserve Bank’s Reported Primary Dealer U.S. Treasury Bond Trading Volumes, which was reported on a one-week lag. The new source for U.S. Government Bond trading volumes is FINRA’s U.S. Treasury TRACE data. The Company believes that the refined methodology used for Municipal Bonds, and the new data source for U.S. Government Bonds, provides more accurate measures of estimated market volumes and estimated market share. Prior comparable periods have been recast retrospectively for both Municipal and U.S. Government Bonds to conform to the updated presentation of the data. The new estimated market volume data is also available on the Company’s website at [investor.marketaxess.com/volume](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&esheet=54147142&newsitemid=20241104063311&lan=en-US&anchor=investor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&index=2&md5=e63d8bac3be3d1d28657bda429079b88). \n\n**Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release may contain forward-looking statements, including statements about the outlook and prospects for the Company, market conditions and industry growth, as well as statements about the Company’s future financial and operating performance.

(Nasdaq: MKTX), the operator of a leading electronic trading platform for fixed-income securities, today announced that Founder and Executive Chairman Rick McVey will retire at the end of the year. Carlos Hernandez will succeed Mr. McVey as Chairman of the Board of Directors, effective January 1, 2025. Mr. McVey has agreed to remain as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of MarketAxess Limited, the Company’s international holding company. \n\nMr. McVey founded MarketAxess in 2000 and is a visionary in the evolution of fixed income market structure. Under his leadership, the company grew to become a global, S&P 500 company that has transformed the way the world’s largest capital market operates worldwide. Mr. McVey stepped down as CEO of MarketAxess in April 2023 after 23 years in that role, and has since been serving as Executive Chairman of the Board. \n\n“Rick’s bold vision for the company nearly 25 years ago not only revolutionized trading forever, but also created an outstanding organization in the process,” said Chris Concannon, CEO of MarketAxess. “I’d like to congratulate Rick on an incredible accomplishment and thank him for the opportunity to lead the company as we continue to transform global markets.” \n\n\"The last quarter century has been an incredible journey, and it was an honor to lead this organization from a startup to a position of global leadership. None of this could have been possible without the skill and dedication of our management team, employees, and board of directors,” said Mr. McVey. “Most importantly, I am grateful for the tremendous support we enjoy from our dealer and investor clients around the world. The future of MarketAxess is bright and I am confident under Chris' leadership we will continue our track record of innovation and growth to create lasting improvements for global fixed income markets. I look forward to my continued involvement on the Board of MarketAxess Limited as we continue to expand our reach in international financial markets.\" \n\nMr. Hernandez previously served as a Director from 2006 to 2019 and rejoined the MarketAxess Board in September 2023.

(Nasdaq: MKTX), the operator of a leading electronic trading platform for fixed-income securities, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n**3Q24 select financial and operational highlights***\n\n  * **20%** increase in total revenues to **$206.7 million** , including Pragma revenue of **$7.7 million** and an increase of approximately **$0.9 million** from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. \n    * **24%** growth in U.S. high-grade commission revenue on strong growth in market volumes. \n    * **20%** growth in emerging markets and Eurobonds commission revenue reflecting strong geographic diversification. \n    * **Record** portfolio trading ADV of **$1.1 billion** . \n    * **Record** rates commission revenue, up **35%** . \n    * **21%** increase in services revenue (combined information, post-trade and technology services revenue) to **$26.3 million** , including Pragma revenue of **$2.8 million** . \n  * Total expenses of **$119.7 million** , up **14%** , including Pragma operating expenses of **$8.2 million** and an increase of approximately **$0.7 million** from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. \n  * **30%** increase in diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) to **$1.90** on net income of **$71.5** **million** . \n  * **Record 2,125 (+2%)** active client firms and **1,079 (+2%)** international active client firms on the platform. \n  * **Record** automation suite trading volume **(+28%)** , trade count **(+37%)** and active client firms **(+49%)** ; dealer algorithmic responses up **24%** . \n\n\n\n_*All comparisons versus 3Q23._\n\nChris Concannon, CEO of MarketAxess, commented: \n\n“We delivered significantly improved financial results in the third quarter, as we continued to make progress in executing our strategy. \n\nThe initial roll-out of X-Pro to our international client base is underway. In the third quarter, we delivered several hundred basis points in market share gains in U.S. credit portfolio trading compared to second quarter 2024 levels. Additionally, a record 74% of our portfolio trading volume was executed on X-Pro in September. We are looking to build on these gains in the coming quarters with the initial launch of our targeted block trading solutions last month, designed to minimize market impact and optimize trading success. Additionally, we are enhancing our dealer liquidity solutions by extending our suite of automation services to our dealer clients. \n\nIn summary, we exited the quarter in September with a constructive market backdrop, characterized by strong market volumes, a robust new issue calendar and an increase in the velocity of trading in U.S. high-grade. We believe we are well positioned to deliver continued growth in the coming quarters.” \n\n**Table 1: 3Q24 select financial results**\n\n$ in millions, except per share data (unaudited)  |  **Revenues** |  **Operating Income** |  **Net Income** |  **Diluted EPS** |  **Net Income Margin (%)** |  **EBITDA 1 ** |  **EBITDA Margin (%) 1 **  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n**3Q24** |  $207  |  $87  |  $71  |  $1.90  |  34.6%  |  $105  |  50.8%   \n**2Q24** |  $198  |  $81  |  $65  |  $1.72  |  32.9%  |  $99  |  50.0%   \n**3Q23** |  $172  |  $67  |  $55  |  $1.46  |  31.9%  |  $83  |  48.1%   \n**YoY % Change** |  20%  |  30%  |  30%  |  30%  |  +270 bps  |  27%  |  +270 bps   \n**QoQ % Change** |  5%  |  7%  |  10%  |  10%  |  +170 bps  |  6%  |  +80 bps   \n**YTD 2024** |  $615  |  $261  |  $209  |  $5.55  |  34.0%  |  $313  |  51.0%   \n**YTD 2023** |  $555  |  $238  |  $188  |  $5.01  |  33.9%  |  $284  |  51.2%   \n**% Change** |  11%  |  10%  |  11%  |  11%  |  +10 bps  |  10%  |  (20) bps   \n  \n**Table 1A: 3Q24 trading volume (ADV)**\n\n**CREDIT** |  **RATES**  \n---|---  \n$ in millions (unaudited)  |  **US/UK Trading Days 2 ** |  **Total ADV** |  **Total Credit** |  **High-Grade** |  **High-Yield** |  **Emerging Markets** |  **Eurobonds** |  **Municipal Bonds** |  **Total Rates** |  **US Govt.

The increase in total credit commission revenue was driven principally by **24%** growth in U.S. high-grade commission revenue on a **39%** increase in U.S. high-grade TRACE market ADV. The decline in variable transaction fees per million (“FPM”) to **$148.97** from **$154.85** in the prior year was mainly due to product and protocol mix-shift, principally lower levels of U.S. high-yield activity and increased portfolio trading, partially offset by the higher duration of bonds traded in U.S. high-grade, principally driven by an increase in the weighted average years to maturity. The decrease in fixed-distribution fees was principally driven by the consolidation of two global dealers and migrations to variable fee plans, partially offset by the addition of new dealer fixed fee plans. \n\n\n\n**Credit Trading Volumes**\n\n  * Total credit ADV of **$14.1 billion** increased **27%** compared to the prior year, and increased **3%** compared to 2Q24 levels. \n  * **Record $1.1 billion** in total portfolio trading ADV, up **163%** compared to the prior year, and up **31%** compared to 2Q24. \n  * **35%** Open Trading share 4 of total credit trading volume, up from **34%** in each of the prior year and 2Q24. The Company delivered estimated **price improvement** 5 for clients via Open Trading of approximately **$119 million** in the quarter. \n\n\n\n**U.S. Credit 6 **\n\n  * U.S. high-grade ADV of **$7.0** **billion** increased **36%** compared to the prior year, and increased **9%** compared to 2Q24. Estimated market ADV increased **39%** compared to the prior year, and increased **5%** compared to 2Q24. Estimated market share was **19.5%** , down from **20.0%** in the prior year, but up from **18.7%** in 2Q24. **Including the impact of single-dealer portfolio trades** , estimated market share was **20.0%** , in line with **20.1%** in the prior year, but up from **19.2%** in 2Q24. \n  * U.S. high-yield ADV of **$1.3 billion** decreased **1%** compared to the prior year, and decreased **4%** compared to 2Q24. Estimated market ADV increased **23%** compared to the prior year, but was in line with 2Q24. Estimated market share was **13.0%** ( **13.4%** including single-dealer portfolio trades), down from **16.1%** in the prior year, and down from **13.5%** ( **13.8%** including single-dealer portfolio trades) in 2Q24. \n\n\n\n**Other Credit**\n\n  * Emerging markets ADV of **$3.3 billion** increased **19%** compared to the prior year, but was in line with 2Q24. The year-over-year increase was driven by a **20%** increase in hard currency ADV, and an **18%** increase in local currency ADV. \n  * Eurobonds ADV of **$1.9 bi** **llion** increased **27%** compared to the prior year, but decreased **10%** compared to 2Q24. \n  * **Record** Municipal bond ADV of **$577 million** increased **49%** compared to the prior year, and increased **11%** compared to 2Q24.

Portfolio trading represented an estimated **10.7%** of U.S. high-grade and U.S. high-yield TRACE in 3Q24. \n  * A **record 59%** of our portfolio trading volume was executed on X-Pro in 3Q24. \n  * Dealer RFQ ADV of **$1.2 billion** across all credit products increased **26%** compared to the prior year, and was in line with 2Q24 levels. \n  * **AxessIQ,** the order and execution workflow solution designed for wealth management and private banking clients, achieved ADV of **$131 million** , up **32%** compared to the prior year, but down **3%** compared to 2Q24. \n\n\n\n**_Rates_ **\n\n  * **Record** total rates commission revenue of **$7.1 million** increased **$1.8 million** , or **35%** . **Record** total rates ADV of **$26.4 billion** increased **46%** compared to the prior year, and increased **29%** compared to 2Q24. \n\n\n\n**_Other_ **\n\n  * Total other commission revenue was **$4.9** **million** , which consists of Pragma commission revenue. \n\n\n\n** Services revenue **\n\n**_Information services_ **\n\n  * Information services revenue of **$13.0** **million** increased **$1.2** **million** , or **10%** , compared to the prior year.

Refer to “Non-GAAP financial measures and other items” for a discussion of these non-GAAP financial measures.   \n---|---  \n2 |  The number of U.S. trading days is based on the SIFMA holiday recommendation calendar and the number of U.K. trading days is based primarily on the U.K. bank holiday schedule.   \n3 |  See “General Notes Regarding the Data Presented” below.   \n4 |  Open Trading share of total credit trading volume is derived by taking total Open Trading volume across all credit products where Open Trading is offered and dividing by total credit trading volume across all credit products where Open Trading is offered.   \n5 |  Estimated price improvement consists of estimated liquidity taker price improvement (defined as the difference between the winning price and the best disclosed dealer cover price) and estimated liquidity provider price improvement (defined as the difference between the winning price and then current Composite+ bid or offer level, offer if the provider is buying, bid if provider is selling) at the time of the inquiry.   \n6 |  The Company is highlighting the impact of single-dealer portfolio trading volume on U.S. high-grade and U.S. high-yield trading volume and estimated market share, where material, but will continue to exclude single-dealer portfolio trading activity from each product’s aggregated trading volume and estimated market share and the total credit FPM calculation.   \n  \n**Non-GAAP financial measures and other items**\n\nTo supplement the Company’s unaudited financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), the Company uses certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), EBITDA margin and free cash flow. We define EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by revenues. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities excluding the net change in trading investments and net change in securities failed-to-deliver and securities failed-to-receive from broker-dealers, clearing organizations and customers, less expenditures for furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements and capitalized software development costs. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken into consideration with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide additional information regarding the Company’s operating results because they assist both investors and management in analyzing and evaluating the performance of our business. See the attached schedule for a reconciliation of GAAP net income to EBITDA, GAAP net income margin to EBITDA margin and GAAP net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities to free cash flow. \n\nPlease refer to Tables 6 & 7 for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures. \n\n**Webcast and conference call information**\n\nChris Concannon, Chief Executive Officer, Richard Schiffman, Global Head of Trading Solutions, and Ilene Fiszel Bieler, Chief Financial Officer will host a conference call to discuss the Company’s financial results and outlook on Wednesday, November 6, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. ET.

MarketAxess trading volumes and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (“TRACE”) reported volumes are available on the Company’s website at [investor.marketaxess.com/volume](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&esheet=54147732&newsitemid=20241105557526&lan=en-US&anchor=investor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&index=3&md5=e006a0287401bab6bc7cee2d4acce72a). \n\nFor periods beginning with January 2024, the Company has made changes to the market volume data used to calculate estimated market share for Municipal and U.S. Government Bonds. For Municipal Bonds, the Company previously used estimates, derived from data issued by the Municipal Securities Rule Making Board (“MSRB”), including estimates for new issuance, commercial paper and variable-rate trading activity, and excluded these volumes from the estimated market volume data. While the Company still uses estimates, the new methodology for identifying and excluding these volumes from the market volume data is now based on MSRB “flags” to identify new issuance, commercial paper, and variable-rate volumes. For U.S. Government Bonds, the previous data source for estimated market volumes was the Federal Reserve Bank’s Reported Primary Dealer U.S. Treasury Bond Trading Volumes, which was reported on a one-week lag. The new source for U.S. Government Bond trading volumes is FINRA’s U.S. Treasury TRACE data. The Company believes that the refined methodology used for Municipal Bonds, and the new data source for U.S. Government Bonds, provides more accurate measures of estimated market volumes and estimated market share. Prior comparable periods have been recast retrospectively for both Municipal and U.S. Government Bonds to conform to the updated presentation of the data. The new estimated market volume data is also available on the Company’s website at [investor.marketaxess.com/volume](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&esheet=54147732&newsitemid=20241105557526&lan=en-US&anchor=investor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&index=4&md5=5eeaba7e20e139ca58bf07e58604ec7b). \n\n**Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release may contain forward-looking statements, including statements about the outlook and prospects for the Company, product/protocol availability and ability to increase estimated market share, market conditions and industry growth, as well as statements about the Company’s future financial and operating performance.

Refer to “Non-GAAP financial measures and other items” for a discussion of these non-\nGAAP financial measures.\n2 The number of U.S. trading days is based on the SIFMA holiday recommendation calendar and the number of U.K. trading days is based primarily on\nthe U.K. bank holiday schedule.\n3 See “General Notes Regarding the Data Presented” below.\n4 Open Trading share of total credit trading volume is derived by taking total Open Trading volume across all credit products where Open Trading is\noffered and dividing by total credit trading volume across all credit products where Open Trading is offered.\n5 Estimated price improvement consists of estimated liquidity taker price improvement (defined as the difference between the winning price and the\nbest disclosed dealer cover price) and estimated liquidity provider price improvement (defined as the difference between the winning price and then\ncurrent Composite+ bid or offer level, offer if the provider is buying, bid if provider is selling) at the time of the inquiry.\n6 The Company is highlighting the impact of single-dealer portfolio trading volume on U.S. high-grade and U.S. high-yield trading volume and\nestimated market share, where material, but will continue to exclude single-dealer portfolio trading activity from each product’s aggregated trading\nvolume and estimated market share and the total credit FPM calculation.\nNon-GAAP financial measures and other items\nTo supplement the Company’s unaudited financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles (“GAAP”), the Company uses certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance, including\nearnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), EBITDA margin and free cash flow. We define\nEBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by revenues. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by/(used in) operating\nactivities excluding the net change in trading investments and net change in securities failed-to-deliver and securities\nfailed-to-receive from broker-dealers, clearing organizations and customers, less expenditures for furniture, equipment\nand leasehold improvements and capitalized software development costs. The Company believes that these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures, when taken into consideration with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide additional\ninformation regarding the Company’s operating results because they assist both investors and management in analyzing\nand evaluating the performance of our business. See the attached schedule for a reconciliation of GAAP net income to\nEBITDA, GAAP net income margin to EBITDA margin and GAAP net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities to free\ncash flow.\nPlease refer to Tables 6 & 7 for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable\nGAAP measures.\nWebcast and conference call information\nChris Concannon, Chief Executive Officer, Richard Schiffman, Global Head of Trading Solutions, and Ilene Fiszel Bieler,\nChief Financial Officer will host a conference call to discuss the Company’s financial results and outlook on Wednesday,\nNovember 6, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. ET.

MarketAxess\ntrading volumes and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine\n(“TRACE”) reported volumes are available on the Company’s website at investor.marketaxess.com/volume.\nFor periods beginning with January 2024, the Company has made changes to the market volume data used to calculate\nestimated market share for Municipal and U.S. Government Bonds. For Municipal Bonds, the Company previously used\nestimates, derived from data issued by the Municipal Securities Rule Making Board (“MSRB”), including estimates for\nnew issuance, commercial paper and variable-rate trading activity, and excluded these volumes from the estimated\nmarket volume data. While the Company still uses estimates, the new methodology for identifying and excluding these\nvolumes from the market volume data is now based on MSRB “flags” to identify new issuance, commercial paper, and\nvariable-rate volumes. For U.S. Government Bonds, the previous data source for estimated market volumes was the\nFederal Reserve Bank’s Reported Primary Dealer U.S. Treasury Bond Trading Volumes, which was reported on a one-\nweek lag. The new source for U.S. Government Bond trading volumes is FINRA’s U.S. Treasury TRACE data. The Company\nbelieves that the refined methodology used for Municipal Bonds, and the new data source for U.S. Government Bonds,\nprovides more accurate measures of estimated market volumes and estimated market share. Prior comparable periods\nhave been recast retrospectively for both Municipal and U.S. Government Bonds to conform to the updated\npresentation of the data. The new estimated market volume data is also available on the Company’s website at\ninvestor.marketaxess.com/volume.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release may contain forward-looking statements, including statements about the outlook and prospects for\nthe Company, product/protocol availability and ability to increase estimated market share, market conditions and\nindustry growth, as well as statements about the Company’s future financial and operating performance.

All information presented herein is considered to be accurate at the time of writing, provided \"as is\" with no express or implied representations or\nwarranties—including without limitation in relation to fitness for purpose, accuracy, or completeness of contents—and is only intended to provide an overview of the subject matter and not an exhaustive treatment thereof.

Further information on MarketAxess can be found on our website at marketaxess.com.\nGeneral Notes Regarding the Data Presented\nReported MarketAxess volume in all product categories includes only fully electronic trading volume. MarketAxess trading volumes and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (“TRACE”) reported\nvolumes are available on the Company’s website at investor.marketaxess.com/volume.\nFor periods beginning with January 2024, the Company has made changes to the market volume data used to calculate estimated market share for Municipal and U.S. Government Bonds. For Municipal Bonds, the Company previously used estimates,\nderived from data issued by the Municipal Securities Rule Making Board (“MSRB”), including estimates for new issuance, commercial paper and variable-rate trading activity, and excluded these volumes from the estimated market volume data. While the\nCompany still uses estimates, the new methodology for identifying and excluding these volumes from the market volume data is now based on MSRB “flags” to identify new issuance, commercial paper, and variable-rate volumes. For U.S. Government\nBonds, the previous data source for estimated market volumes was the Federal Reserve Bank’s Reported Primary Dealer U.S. Treasury Bond Trading Volumes, which was reported on a one-week lag. The new source for U.S. Government Bond trading\nvolumes is FINRA’s U.S. Treasury TRACE data. The Company believes that the refined methodology used for Municipal Bonds, and the new data source for U.S. Government Bonds, provides more accurate measures of estimated market volumes and\nestimated market share. Prior comparable periods have been recast retrospectively for both Municipal and U.S. Government Bonds to conform to the updated presentation of the data. The new estimated market volume data is also available on the\nCompany’s website at investor.marketaxess.com/volume.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis presentation may contain forward-looking statements, including statements about the outlook and prospects for Company, market conditions and industry growth, as well as statements about the Company’s future financial and operating\nperformance. These and other statements that relate to future results and events are based on MarketAxess’ current expectations, product/protocol availability, and ability to increase estimated market share. The Company’s actual results in future periods\nmay differ materially from those currently expected or desired because of a number of risks and uncertainties, including: global economic, political and market factors; the level of trading volume transacted on the MarketAxess platform; the rapidly evolving\nnature of the electronic financial services industry; the level and intensity of competition in the fixed-income electronic trading industry and the pricing pressures that may result; the variability of our growth rate; our ability to introduce new fee plans and\nour clients’ response; our ability to attract clients or adapt our technology and marketing strategy to new markets; risks related to our growing international operations; our dependence on our broker-dealer clients; the loss of any of our significant\ninstitutional investor clients; our exposure to risks resulting from non-performance by counterparties to transactions executed between our clients in which we act as an intermediary in matched principal trades; risks related to self-clearing; risks related to\nsanctions levied against states or individuals that could expose us to operational or regulatory risks; the effect of rapid market or technological changes on us and the users of our technology; our dependence on third-party suppliers for key products and\nservices; our ability to successfully maintain the integrity of our trading platform and our response to system failures, capacity constraints and business interruptions; the occurrence of design defects, errors, failures or delays with our platforms, products or\nservices; our vulnerability to malicious cyber-attacks and attempted cybersecurity breaches; our actual or perceived failure to comply with privacy and data protection laws; our ability to protect our intellectual property rights or technology and defend\nagainst intellectual property infringement or other claims; our ability to enter into strategic alliances and to acquire other businesses and successfully integrate them with our business; our dependence on our management team and our ability to attract\nand retain talent; limitations on our flexibility because we operate in a highly regulated industry; the increasing government regulation of us and our clients; risks related to the divergence of U.K. and European Union legal and regulatory requirements\nfollowing the U.K.’s exit from the European Union; our exposure to costs and penalties related to our extensive regulation; our risks of litigation and securities laws liability; adverse effects as a result of climate change or other ESG risks that could affect our\nreputation; our future capital needs and our ability to obtain capital when needed; limitations on our operating flexibility contained in our credit agreement; our exposure to financial institutions by holding cash in excess of federally insured limits; and other\nfactors. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. More information about these and other factors affecting MarketAxess’ business and prospects\nis contained in MarketAxess’ periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and can be accessed at www.marketaxess.com.\nNon-GAAPFinancial Measures and Other Items\nTo supplement the Company’s unaudited financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), the Company uses certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance, including earnings before interest,\ntaxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), EBITDA margin and free cash flow. We define EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by revenues. We define free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities excluding the net change in trading investments\nand net change in securities failed-to-deliver and securities failed-to-receive from broker-dealers, clearing organizations and customers, less expenditures for furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements and capitalized software development costs.\nThe Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken into consideration with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide additional information regarding the Company’s operating results because they assist both investors\nand management in analyzing and evaluating the performance of our business. See the “Appendix” for a reconciliation of GAAP net income to EBITDA and GAAP net income margin to EBITDA margin and GAAP cash flow from operating activities to free cash\nflow.\n22"

The Company also provides a range of pre- and post-trade services, including post-trade matching, trade publication,\nregulatory transaction reporting and market and reference data across a range of fixed-income and other products.\n2. Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been\neliminated. These consolidated financial statements are unaudited and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements included\nin the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The consolidated financial information as of December 31, 2023 has been\nderived from audited financial statements not included herein. These unaudited consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) with respect to Form 10-Q and\nreflect all adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are normal and recurring, and that are necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim\nperiods presented. In accordance with such rules and regulations, certain disclosures that are normally included in annual financial statements have been omitted.\nInterim period operating results may not be indicative of the operating results for a full year.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company defines cash equivalents as short-term interest-bearing investments with maturities at the time of purchase of three months or less.\nInvestments\nThe Company determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase which are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of\nFinancial Condition on the trade date. Securities are classified as available-for-sale or trading. Available-for-sale investments are carried at fair value with\nunrealized gains or losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and realized gains or losses\nreported in other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Trading investments and securities sold, not yet purchased include U.S. Treasuries and are\ncarried at fair value, with realized and unrealized gains or losses included in other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Company assesses whether an impairment loss on its available-for-sale debt securities has occurred due to declines in fair value or other market\nconditions. When the amortized cost basis of an available-for-sale debt security exceeds its fair value, the security is deemed to be impaired. The portion of an\nimpairment related to credit losses is determined by comparing the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost\nbasis of the security and is recorded as a charge in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The remainder of an impairment is recognized in accumulated\nother comprehensive loss if the Company does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the\nsecurity prior to recovery.\n9\nMARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n(Unaudited)\nFair Value Financial Instruments\nFair value is defined as “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants\nat the measurement date.” A three-tiered hierarchy for determining fair value has been established that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used in fair value\ncalculations. The three levels of inputs are defined as Level 1 (unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets), Level 2 (inputs that\nare observable in the marketplace other than those inputs classified in Level 1) and Level 3 (inputs that are unobservable in the marketplace). The Company’s\nfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of its money market funds, trading securities, available-for-sale securities,\nforeign currency forward contracts and securities sold, not yet purchased. All other financial instruments are short-term in nature and the carrying amounts\nreported on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition approximate fair value.\nReceivables from and Payables to Broker-dealers, Clearing Organizations and Customers\nReceivables from broker-dealers, clearing organizations and customers include amounts receivable for securities not delivered by the Company to the\npurchaser by the settlement date (“securities failed-to-deliver”) and cash deposits held at clearing organizations and clearing brokers to facilitate the settlement\nand clearance of matched principal transactions. Payables to broker-dealers, clearing organizations and customers include amounts payable for securities not\nreceived by the Company from a seller by the settlement date (“securities failed-to-receive”). Securities failed-to-deliver and securities failed-to-receive for\ntransactions executed on a matched principal basis where the Company serves as a counterparty to both the buyer and the seller are recorded on a settlement date\nbasis. The Company presents its securities failed-to-deliver and securities failed-to-receive balances on a net-by-counterparty basis within receivables from and\npayables to broker-dealers, clearing organizations and customers. The difference between the Company’s trade-date receivables and payables for unsettled\nmatched principal transactions reflects commissions earned and is recorded within accounts receivable, net on a trade date basis.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nAll accounts receivable have contractual maturities of less than one year and are derived from trading-related fees and commissions and revenues from\nproducts and services. The Company continually monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts. The\nallowance for credit losses is based on the estimated expected credit losses in accounts receivable, as determined from a review of aging schedules, past due\nbalances, historical collection experience and other specific collection issues that have been identified. Account balances are grouped for evaluation based on\nvarious risk characteristics, including billing type, legal entity, and geographic region. Additions to the allowance for credit losses are charged to bad debt\nexpense, which is included in general and administrative expense in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. Balances that are determined to be\nuncollectable are written off against the allowance for credit losses.\nThe allowance for credit losses was $0.7 million and $0.6 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The provision for bad\ndebts was $0.2 million for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and $0.2 million and $0.3 million for the nine months ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Write-offs and other charges against the allowance for credit losses were immaterial for each of the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nFixed assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The Company uses the straight-line method of depreciation over three to seven years. The\nCompany amortizes leasehold improvements on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the life of the improvement or the remaining term of the lease.\nSoftware Development Costs\nThe Company capitalizes certain costs associated with the development of internal use software, including, among other items, employee compensation\nand related benefits and third-party consulting costs at the point at which the conceptual formulation, design and testing of possible software project alternatives\nhave been completed. Once the product is ready for its intended use, such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over three to five years. The Company\nreviews the amounts capitalized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be\nrecoverable.\n10\nMARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n(Unaudited)\nCloud Computing Costs\nThe Company capitalizes certain costs associated with cloud computing arrangements, including, among other items, vendor software development costs\nbilled to us that are part of the application development stage. These costs are recorded as a prepaid asset on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition\nand are amortized over the period of the hosting service contract, which ranges from one to five years. The Company reviews the amounts capitalized for\nimpairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable.\nForeign Currency Translation and Forward Contracts\nAssets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using exchange rates at the end of the period; revenues and expenses are translated\nat average monthly rates. Gains and losses on foreign currency translation are a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated\nStatements of Financial Condition. Transaction gains and losses are recorded in other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge its foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Realized and\nunrealized gains and losses on these forward contracts are included in other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company records the fair\nvalue of the forward contract asset in prepaid expenses and other assets or the fair value of the forward contract liability in accounts payable, accrued expenses\nand other liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company’s classification of revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations represents revenues from contracts with customers disaggregated\nby type of revenue. The Company has four revenue streams as described below.\nCommission Revenue – The Company charges its broker-dealer clients variable transaction fees for trades executed on its platforms and, under certain\nplans, distribution fees or monthly minimum fees to use the platforms for a particular product area. Variable transaction fees are recognized on a trade date basis,\nare generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on the platforms and vary based on the type, size, yield and maturity of the\nbond traded, as well as individual client incentives. Bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities generally generate lower commissions,\nwhile bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions. Under the Company’s disclosed trading\ntransaction fee plans, variable transaction fees, distribution fees and unused monthly fee commitments are invoiced and recorded on a monthly basis.\nFor Open Trading trades that the Company executes between and among institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a matched principal basis by\nserving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller, the Company earns its commission through the difference in price between the two trades. The\ncommission is collected upon settlement of the trade, which typically occurs within one to two trading days after the trade date. For the majority of the\nCompany’s U.S. Treasury matched principal trades, commissions are invoiced and recorded on a monthly basis.\nFollowing its acquisition of Pragma LLC and Pragma Financial Systems LLC (collectively, “Pragma”) in the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company also\nearns other commissions on equities and foreign exchange products for algorithmic trading services. These fees incorporate variable transaction fees, which are\ncalculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume traded and are billed on a monthly basis.\n11\nMARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n(Unaudited)\nThe following table presents commission revenue by fee type:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nCommission revenue by fee type\nVariable transaction fees\nDisclosed trading $ 91,273 $ 73,763 $ 272,828 $ 240,315\nOpen Trading – matched principal trading 45,137 36,682 135,756 132,524\nU.S. government bonds - matched principal trading 5,525 3,829 13,384 11,920\nOther 4,802 — 14,728 —\nTotal variable transaction fees 146,737 114,274 436,696 384,759\nDistribution fees and unused minimum fees 33,655 36,222 100,248 106,314\nTotal commissions $ 180,392 $ 150,496 $ 536,944 $ 491,073\nInformation services – Information services includes data licensed to the Company’s broker-dealer clients, institutional investor clients and data-only\nsubscribers; professional and consulting services; technology software licenses; and maintenance and support services. The nature and timing of each\nperformance obligation may vary as these contracts are either subscription-based services transferred over time, and may be net of volume-based discounts, or\none-time services that are transferred at a point in time. Revenues for services transferred over time are recognized ratably over the contract period as the\nCompany’s performance obligation is met, whereas revenues for services transferred at a point in time are recognized in the period the services are provided.\nCustomers are generally billed monthly, quarterly, or annually; revenues billed in advance are deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period.

For\ncontracts with original durations extending beyond one year, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was\n$54.6 million as of September 30, 2024. The Company expects to recognize revenue associated with the remaining performance obligations over the next 49\nmonths.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all share-based payment awards based on their estimated fair values measured as of the\ngrant date. These costs are recognized as an expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the requisite service period, which is typically the vesting\nperiod, with an offsetting increase to additional paid-in capital. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the\nfinancial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are\nexpected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nA valuation allowance is recognized against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized in future years. Tax benefits for\nuncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the positions will be sustained upon examination based on their technical merits. The\nCompany recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAll tax effects related to share-based payments are recorded in the provision for income taxes in the periods during which the awards are exercised or vest.\n13\nMARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n(Unaudited)\nBusiness Combinations, Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nBusiness combinations are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The total cost of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying net\nassets based on their respective estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as\ngoodwill. Determining the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and\nassumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash flows, discount rates, revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, obsolescence\nand asset lives. Intangible assets are valued using various methodologies, including the relief-from-royalty method and multi-period excess earnings method.\nThe Company operates as a single reporting unit. Following an acquisition, goodwill no longer retains its identification with a particular acquisition, but\ninstead becomes identifiable with the entire reporting unit. As a result, all of the fair value of the Company is available to support the value of goodwill. An\nimpairment review of goodwill is performed on an annual basis, at year-end, or more frequently if circumstances change. Intangible assets with definite lives,\nincluding purchased technologies, customer relationships and other intangible assets, are amortized over their estimated useful lives which range from one to 15\nyears using either a straight-line or accelerated amortization method based on the pattern of economic benefit the Company expects to realize from such assets.\nIntangible assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the existence of a possible impairment.\nEquity Investments and Consolidation\nThe Company evaluates equity investments for potential consolidation under the voting-interest or variable-interest models. The Company consolidates\ninvestees over which the Company determines it has control under the voting interest model, generally greater than 50% ownership, or for which the Company is\nthe primary beneficiary under the variable-interest model. The Company uses the equity method of accounting when it exercises significant influence over the\ninvestee, but does not have operating control, generally between 20% and 50% ownership. Under the equity method of accounting, original investments are\nrecorded at cost in prepaid expenses and other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and adjusted by the Company’s proportionate share\nof the investees’ undistributed earnings or losses. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the\ncarrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net income attributable to common stock by the weighted-average number of shares of common\nstock outstanding during the period. For purposes of computing diluted earnings per share, the weighted-average shares outstanding of common stock reflects the\ndilutive effect that could occur if convertible securities or other contracts to issue common stock were converted into or exercised for common stock.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and\nexpenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic\n740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The ASU requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation and\nincome taxes paid. The ASU is effective for the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2025. The guidance may be\napplied on a prospective or retrospective basis and early adoption is permitted. Adoption of this ASU will result in additional disclosures, but will not have an\nimpact on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial condition, operations and cash flows.\nIn November 2023, FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The ASU expands\npublic entities’ segment disclosures by requiring disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker\n(“CODM”) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, an amount and description of its composition for other segment items and\ninterim disclosures of a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets. The ASU also requires the disclosure of the title and position of the CODM and an\nexplanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources.\nAll disclosure requirements under ASU 2023-07 and existing segment disclosures in ASC 280, Segment Reporting are also required for public entities with a\nsingle reportable segment. The ASU is effective for the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, and subsequent\ninterim periods, with early adoption permitted. The ASU must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements. Adoption of this\nASU will result in additional disclosures, but will not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial condition, operations and cash\nflows.\n14\nMARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n(Unaudited)\n3. Regulatory Capital Requirements\nCertain of the Company’s U.S. subsidiaries are registered as broker-dealers and therefore are subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC\nand the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”). These rules contain minimum net capital requirements, as defined in the applicable regulations.\nCertain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) or other foreign\nregulators and must maintain financial resources, as defined in the applicable regulations, in excess of the applicable financial resources requirement. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, each of the Company’s subsidiaries that are subject to these regulations had net capital or financial resources in excess of their minimum\nrequirements. As of September 30, 2024, the Company’s subsidiaries maintained aggregate net capital and financial resources that were $607.1 million in excess\nof the required levels of $35.7 million.\nOne of the Company’s U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries is required to segregate funds in a special reserve bank account for the benefit of customers\npursuant to Rule 15c3-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had no borrowings outstanding and up to $500.0 million in available uncommitted borrowing\ncapacity under such agreements.\nShort-term Financing\nUnder arrangements with their settlement banks, certain of the Company’s U.S. and U.K. operating subsidiaries may receive overnight financing in the\nform of bank overdrafts. The Company incurred interest expense on such overnight financing of $0.3 million and $0.2 million during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $1.1 million and $0.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company had no overdrafts payable outstanding.\n24\nMARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n(Unaudited)\n12. Leases\nThe Company has operating leases for corporate offices with initial lease terms ranging from one year to 15 years. Certain leases contain options to\nextend the initial term at the Company’s discretion. The Company accounts for the option to extend when it is reasonably certain of being exercised. The\nCompany’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees, restrictions or covenants. The Company also has operating and finance leases\nfor equipment with initial lease terms ranging from one-year to 5 years.\nThe following table presents the components of operating lease expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended September Nine Months Ended September\n30, 30,\nLease cost: Classification 2024 2023 2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nOperating lease cost - office space Occupancy $ 2,774 $ 2,941 $ 8,278 $ 8,934\nOperating lease cost - equipment Technology and\ncommunications 98 — 293 —\nVariable lease costs Occupancy 975 341 2,444 739\nTotal operating lease cost $ 3,847 $ 3,282 $ 11,015 $ 9,673\nFinance lease expense was $0.1 million for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nThe Company determines whether an arrangement is, or includes, a lease at contract inception. Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are\nrecognized at commencement date and are initially measured based on the present value of lease payments over the defined lease term. As the Company's leases\ndo not provide an implicit rate, the Company used its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the adoption date in determining the\npresent value of lease payments.\nThe weighted average remaining lease term and weighted average discount rate are as follows:\nAs of\nLease Term and Discount Rate September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nWeighted average remaining lease term (in years) - operating leases 8.9 9.6\nWeighted average discount rate - operating leases 6.0% 6.0%\nWeighted average remaining lease term (in years) - finance leases 1.0 1.8\nWeighted average discount rate - finance leases 7.2% 7.2%\nThe following table presents the maturity of lease liabilities as of September 30, 2024:\nOperating Leases Finance Leases\n(In thousands)\nRemainder of 2024 $ 3,332 $ 29\n2025 12,812 88\n2026 12,226 —\n2027 9,229 —\n2028 8,623 —\n2029 and thereafter 51,238 —\nTotal lease payments 97,460 117\nLess: imputed interest 22,383 4\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 75,077 $ 113\n25\nMARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n(Unaudited)\n13. Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal\nIn the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements may be involved in various lawsuits,\nproceedings and regulatory examinations. The Company assesses its liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings, if any,\nutilizing the latest information available. For matters where it is probable that the Company will incur a material loss and the amount can be reasonably\nestimated, the Company will establish an accrual for the loss. Once established, the accrual will be adjusted to reflect any relevant developments. When a loss\ncontingency is not both probable and estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual.\nBased on currently available information, the outcome of the Company’s outstanding matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the\nCompany’s financial position. It is not presently possible to determine the ultimate exposure to these matters, and there is no assurance that the resolution of the\noutstanding matters will not significantly exceed any reserves accrued by the Company.\nOther\nThe Company, through certain of its subsidiaries, executes securities transactions between its institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a matched\nprincipal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades. The Company’s operating subsidiaries settle such transactions pursuant to\ntheir self-clearing operations or through the use of third-party clearing brokers or settlement agents. Settlement typically occurs within one to two trading days\nafter the trade date. Cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded. Under both the self-clearing\nand the third-party clearing models, the Company may be exposed to credit risk in the event a counterparty does not fulfill its obligation to complete a transaction\nor if there is an error in executing a matched principal transaction. Pursuant to the terms of the securities clearing agreements, each third-party clearing broker has\nthe right to charge the Company for any losses they suffer resulting from a counterparty’s failure on any of the Company’s trades. The Company did not record\nany liabilities or losses with regard to counterparty failures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts that contain a variety of representations, warranties and indemnification provisions.\nThe Company’s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Company that have\nnot yet occurred. However, based on experience, the Company expects the risk of loss to be remote.\n14. Share Repurchase Programs\nIn January 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $150.0 million that commenced in March 2022 (the “2022\nRepurchase Program”). In August 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for up to an additional $200.0 million (the “2024\nRepurchase Program and, together with the 2022 Repurchase Program, the “Repurchase Programs”). During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the\nCompany repurchased 277,604 shares of common stock under the Repurchase Programs at a cost of $58.6 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had\n$241.4 million of remaining capacity under the Repurchase Programs. Shares repurchased under the Repurchase Programs will be held in treasury for future use.\n15. Segment and Geographic Information\nThe Company operates electronic platforms for the trading of fixed-income securities and provides related data, analytics, compliance tools, post-trade\nservices and technology services. The Company considers its operations to constitute a single business segment because of the highly integrated nature of these\nproducts and services, the financial markets in which the Company competes and the Company’s worldwide business activities. The Company believes that\nresults by geographic region or client sector are not necessarily meaningful in understanding its business.\n26\nMARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n(Unaudited)\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the U.K. was the only individual foreign country in which the Company had operations that\naccounted for 10.0% or more of the Company’s total revenues or total long-lived assets. Revenues and long-lived assets are attributed to a geographic area based\non the location of the particular subsidiary. Long-lived assets are defined as furniture, equipment, leasehold improvements and capitalized software. Revenues for\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and long-lived assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nRevenues\nAmericas $ 165,009 $ 136,398 $ 488,380 $ 439,970\nEurope 35,889 31,401 109,480 101,655\nAsia 5,817 4,485 16,833 13,674\nTotal $ 206,715 $ 172,284 $ 614,693 $ 555,299\nAs of\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(In thousands)\nLong-lived assets, as defined\nAmericas $ 93,742 $ 87,513\nEurope 15,493 14,717\nAsia 247 441\nTotal $ 109,482 $ 102,671\n16.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis report contains certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking\nstatements may be identified by words such as “expects,” “intends,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “will,” or words of similar\nmeaning and include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the outlook for our future business and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are\nbased on management’s current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to\npredict. It is routine for our internal projections and expectations to change as the year or each quarter in the year progresses, and therefore it should be clearly\nunderstood that the internal projections and beliefs upon which we base our expectations may change prior to the end of each quarter or the year. Although these\nexpectations may change, we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements contained in this report, except to the extent required\nby applicable law. Our Company’s policy is generally to provide our expectations only once per quarter, and not to update that information until the next quarter.\nActual future events or results may differ, perhaps materially from those contained in the projections or forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or\ncontribute to such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in the section captioned Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,”\nand in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, including in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\nExecutive Overview\nMarketAxess operates leading electronic trading platforms delivering greater trading efficiency, a diversified pool of liquidity and significant cost\nsavings to our clients across the global fixed-income markets. Over 2,000 institutional investor and broker-dealer firms use our patented trading technology to\nefficiently trade U.S. high-grade bonds, U.S. high-yield bonds, emerging market debt, Eurobonds, municipal bonds, U.S. government bonds and other fixed-\nincome securities. Our award-winning Open Trading marketplace is widely regarded as the preferred all-to-all trading solution in the global credit markets,\ncreating a unique liquidity pool for a broad range of credit market participants. We leverage our diverse set of trading protocols, automated and algorithmic\ntrading solutions, intelligent data and index products and a range of post-trade services to provide an end-to-end trading solution to our robust network of\nplatform participants.\nWe provide automated and algorithmic trading solutions that we believe, when combined with our integrated and actionable data offerings, will help our\nclients make faster, better-informed decisions on when and how to trade on our platforms. In 2023, we introduced X-Pro, our newest trading platform, to more\nseamlessly combine our trading protocols with our proprietary data and pre-trade analytics. We expect that our recent acquisition of Pragma, a quantitative\ntrading technology provider specializing in algorithmic and analytical trading services, will accelerate our development of artificial intelligence driven execution\nalgorithms across many of our key product areas.\nWe operate in a large and growing market that provides us with a significant opportunity for future growth, due, in part, to the relatively low levels of\nelectronic trading in many of our largest current product areas. We offer Open Trading for most of our products in order to capitalize on this addressable market\nby increasing the number of potential trading counterparties and providing our clients with a menu of solutions at each step in the trading process. We believe that\nOpen Trading drives meaningful price improvement for our clients and reduces risk in fixed-income markets by creating a global, diversified pool of liquidity\nwhereby our institutional investor, dealer and alternative liquidity provider clients can all interact on an anonymous basis. Institutional investors can also send\ntrading inquiries directly to their traditional broker-dealer counterparties on a disclosed basis, while simultaneously accessing additional counterparties through\nour anonymous Open Trading solutions.\nWe also provide a number of integrated and actionable data offerings, including CP+™ and Axess All®, to assist clients with real-time pricing and\ntrading decisions and transaction cost analysis. We have a range of post-trade services, including straight-through processing, post-trade matching, trade\npublication, regulatory transaction reporting and market and reference data across fixed-income and other products.\nWe derive revenue from commissions for transactions executed on our platforms, information services, post-trade services and technology services. Our\nexpenses consist of employee compensation and benefits, depreciation and amortization, technology and communication expenses, professional and consulting\nfees, occupancy, marketing and advertising, clearing costs and general and administrative expenses.\nOur objective is to provide the leading global electronic trading platforms for fixed-income securities, connecting broker-dealers and institutional\ninvestors more easily and efficiently, while offering a broad array of trading information and technology services to market participants across the trading cycle.\nThe key elements of our strategy are discussed in Part I, Item 1. “Business – Our Strategy” of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n28\nCritical Factors Affecting Our Industry and Our Company\nEconomic, Political and Market Factors\nThe global fixed-income securities industry is risky and volatile and is directly affected by a number of economic, political and market factors that may\nimpact trading volume. These factors could have a material adverse or positive effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These factors\ninclude, among others, credit market conditions, the current interest rate environment, including the volatility of interest rates and investors’ forecasts of future\ninterest rates, the duration of bonds traded, economic and political conditions in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and the consolidation or contraction of\nour broker-dealer and institutional investor clients.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, the market backdrop for the Company continued to improve with strong increases in estimated U.S. credit market volumes, a\nmodest increase in credit spread volatility relative to second quarter 2024 levels, and an increase in the velocity of trading in U.S. high-grade. U.S. high-grade\nand U.S. high-yield market average daily trading volume increased 39.4% and 22.6%, respectively, and U.S. high-grade and U.S. high-yield new issuance\nincreased 41.2% and 89.7% to $403.9 billion and $74.3 billion, respectively. In addition, while credit spread volatility remained at historically low levels, it was\nhigher in the quarter than in the first half of 2024. Furthermore, in advance of the Federal Reserve cutting rates by 50 basis points in September 2024, clients\nincreased their activity in longer duration bonds traded in U.S. high-grade, which benefited our U.S. high-grade average variable fee per million.\nA strong new issue calendar, which we have seen in recent periods, and low levels of credit spread volatility can contribute to a decrease in exchange-\ntrade fund (“ETF”) market maker activity on our platforms, as the increased availability of new issues may lead to reduction in secondary market trading,\nespecially in U.S. high-yield. A strong new issue calendar can also negatively impact our market share in the short-term, but is expected to positively impact\nsecondary trading volumes over the long term. The decrease in U.S. high-yield activity during the quarter negatively impacted our total credit average variable\nfee per million, but the increase in higher duration bonds traded in U.S. high-grade positively impacted our total credit average variable fee per million.\nOn the international side of our business, Eurobonds and emerging markets estimated market volumes have increased significantly compared to the prior\nyear. Emerging markets estimated market volumes have been particularly strong relative to prior years, driven by a more favorable macroeconomic outlook in\ndeveloped markets, reflecting easing concerns over inflation and the lower probability of an economic recession.\nBecause the majority of our assets are short-term in nature, they are not significantly affected by inflation. However, the rate of inflation impacts our\nexpenses, such as employee compensation, technology and communications expenses, which may not be readily recoverable in the prices of our services. To the\nextent inflation continues to result in high interest rates or has other adverse effects on the securities markets or the economy, it may adversely affect our financial\nposition and results of operations.\nWe expect that current cash and investment balances, in combination with cash flows that are generated from operations and the ability to borrow under\nour 2023 Credit Agreement, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs and planned capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. We\nended the quarter with $749.9 million in available borrowing capacity under the 2023 Credit Agreement and capital significantly in excess of our regulatory\nrequirements.\nCompetitive Landscape\nThe global fixed-income securities industry generally, and the electronic financial services markets in which we engage, in particular, are highly\ncompetitive, and we expect competition to intensify in the future. Sources of competition for us will continue to include, among others, bond trading conducted\ndirectly between broker-dealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically and other multi-dealer or all-to-all trading platforms.\nCompetitors, including companies in which some of our broker-dealer clients have invested, have developed or acquired electronic trading platforms or have\nannounced their intention to explore the development of electronic platforms or information networks that may compete with us.\nWe primarily compete on the basis of our client network, the liquidity provided by our dealer, and, to a lesser extent, institutional investor clients, the total\ntransaction costs and fees associated with our services, the breadth of products, protocols and services offered, as well as the quality, reliability, security and ease\nof use of our platforms. We believe that our ability to grow volumes and revenues will largely depend on our performance with respect to these factors.\nThere has been increased demand for portfolio trading workflows over the last few years, which has resulted in heightened competition among trading\nplatforms to enhance their portfolio trading offerings and expand them across different geographies and products. During periods of relatively lower credit spread\nvolatility, clients have been using portfolio trading workflows in lieu of more established trading protocols designed to generate price competition on individual\nbonds. Our dealer clients have also increased their usage of matching sessions offered by competing platforms in recent periods. To the extent that our clients\nincrease their use of portfolio trading and matching session protocols offered by other platforms, our market share in those products could decrease. Due to the\nlarge size of the trades and the concentration of activity at the end of the month, portfolio trading can drive significant swings in trading volumes and estimated\nmarket share.\n29\nOur competitive position is enhanced by the unique liquidity provided by our Open Trading functionalities and the integration of our broker-dealer and\ninstitutional investor clients with our electronic trading platforms and other systems. We have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the\ndevelopment of our platforms, working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs.\nRegulatory Environment\nOur business is subject to extensive regulations in the United States and internationally, which may expose us to significant regulatory risk and cause\nadditional legal costs to ensure compliance. The existing legal framework that governs the financial markets is periodically reviewed and amended, resulting in\nthe enactment and enforcement of new laws and regulations that apply to our business. In January 2022, the SEC proposed rules that will expand Regulation ATS\nand Regulation SCI to alternative trading systems (ATS) that trade government securities and amend the SEC rule regarding the definition of an “exchange” to\ninclude Communication Protocol Systems, such as our request-for-quote protocols. Based on these proposed rules, we expect that we will have to operate all of\nour trading protocols in compliance with Regulation ATS and we could become subject to Regulation SCI for certain parts of our business in the future. The SEC\nalso recently adopted final rules regarding the central clearing of certain secondary market transactions involving U.S. Treasury securities, which will become\neffective for certain cash market transactions on December 31, 2025 and repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions on June 30, 2026. This central clearing\nmandate will impact certain of our participants who do not centrally clear such trades today and some of our investor clients have expressed concerns about using\nplatforms that will require the clearing of any resultant trades executed on such platforms. The impact of any of these reform efforts on us and our operations\nremains uncertain.\nAs a result of the U.K.’s departure from the E.U. in 2020 (commonly referred to as “Brexit”), we obtained authorizations from the AFM for our\nsubsidiaries in the Netherlands in 2019. We now provide regulated services to our clients within the E.U. in reliance on the cross-border services passport held by\nour Dutch subsidiaries. Brexit has led to an ongoing divergence between the U.K. and E.U. financial regulations, which has made it more difficult and costly to\ncomply with the extensive government regulation to which we are subject. The cost and complexity of operating across increasingly divergent regulatory regimes\nhas increased and is likely to continue to increase in the future.\nCompliance with regulations may require us to dedicate additional financial and operational resources, which may adversely affect our profitability. For\nexample, the E.U.’s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), which will become applicable to portions of our business in 2025, will require us to dedicate\nadditional financial and operational resources to meet the significant additional information communication technologies services-related governance, risk\nmanagement, resilience testing and sub-contracting requirements created by the legislation. However, we also believe new regulations may increase demand for\nour platforms and we believe we are well positioned to benefit from those regulatory changes that cause market participants to seek electronic trading platforms\nthat meet the various regulatory requirements.\nFor further description of the regulations which govern our business, see Part1, Item I. “Business – Government Regulation” of our Form 10-K for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023.\nTechnology Environment\nWe must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platforms. The markets in which we compete are characterized by increasingly complex\nprotocols, systems and technology infrastructure requirements. Our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing products and services,\ndevelop and/or license new products and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our existing and prospective broker-dealer\nand institutional investor clients and respond to technological advances and emerging industry and regulatory standards and practices on a cost-effective and\ntimely basis. For example, in 2023, we introduced MarketAxess X-Pro, our new trading platform, which provides traders with a flexible user experience, intuitive\nworkflows and access to our proprietary data and pre-trade analytics. We plan to continue to focus on technology infrastructure initiatives and improving our\nplatforms with the goal of further enhancing our leading market position.\nAs the overall share of electronic trading grows in global credit products, we are experiencing continued demand for, and growth in, our automated and\nalgorithmic trading solutions. We also support a large and growing base of dealer market making algorithms. In the third quarter of 2024, trading volumes in\nAuto-X, one of our automated trading protocols, rose to $96.1 billion, an increase of 27.6% from $75.3 billion in the third quarter of 2023. Trade count on Auto-\nX increased 36.6% to approximately 612,000 from approximately 448,000 in the third quarter of 2023. There were 249 active client firms using Auto-X in the\nthird quarter of 2024, an increase of 49.1% from the prior year. In addition, in the third quarter of 2024, dealer algorithmic responses on our platforms increased\n24.3% from the third quarter of 2023 to 10.2 million.\nWe experience cybersecurity threats and incidents from time to time. However, as of the date of this report, MarketAxess has not experienced a\ncybersecurity threat or incident that has materially affected the Company in at least the past three years. Cybersecurity incidents could impact revenue and\noperating income and increase costs. We therefore continue to make investments in our cybersecurity infrastructure and training of employees, which may result\nin increased costs, to strengthen our cybersecurity measures.\nSee also Part I, Item 1A. – “Risk Factors, Technology, IT Systems and Cybersecurity Risks” and Part I, Item 1C – “Cybersecurity.” of our Form 10-K for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023.\n30\nTrends in Our Business\nThe majority of our revenue is derived from commissions for transactions executed on our platforms between and among our institutional investor and\nbroker-dealer clients and monthly distribution fees. We believe that the following are the key variables that impact the notional value of such transactions on our\nplatforms and the amount of commissions and distribution fees earned by us:\n• the number of participants on our platforms and their willingness to use our platforms instead of competitors' platforms or other execution\nmethods;\n• the frequency and competitiveness of the price responses by participants on our platforms;\n• the number of markets that are available for our clients to trade on our platforms;\n• the overall level of activity in these markets;\n• the duration of the bonds trading on our platforms; and\n• the particular fee plan and protocol under which we earn commissions and distribution fees.\nWe believe that overall corporate bond market trading volume is affected by various factors including the absolute levels of interest rates, the direction of\ninterest rate movements, the level of new issues of corporate bonds and the volatility of corporate bond spreads versus U.S. Treasury securities. Because a\nsignificant percentage of our revenue is tied directly to the volume of securities traded on our platforms, it is likely that a general decline in trading volumes,\nregardless of the cause of such decline, would reduce our revenues and have a significant negative impact on profitability.\nAs further described under “— Critical Factors Affecting our Industry and our Company — Economic, Political and Market Factors,” “— Results of\nOperations — Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023” and “— Results of Operations — Nine Months\nEnded September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023,” our trading volumes increased and our average variable transaction fee per\nmillion decreased compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nCommission Revenue\nCommissions are recognized on a trade date basis, are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on our platforms\nand vary based on the type, size, yield and maturity of the bond traded, as well as individual client incentives. Bonds that are more actively traded or that have\nshorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions, while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher\ncommissions.\nFor Open Trading trades that we execute between and among institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as\ncounterparty to both the buyer and the seller, we earn our commission through the difference in price between the two trades. For the majority of U.S. Treasury\nmatched principal trades, commissions are invoiced and recorded on a monthly basis.\nCredit Commissions. Credit includes U.S. high-grade corporate bonds, high-yield bonds, emerging markets bonds, Eurobonds, municipal bonds and\nleveraged loans. Our U.S. high-grade corporate bond fee plans generally incorporate variable transaction fees and fixed distribution fees billed to our broker-\ndealer clients on a monthly basis. Certain broker-dealers participate in fee programs that do not contain monthly distribution fees and instead incorporate\nadditional per transaction execution fees and minimum monthly fee commitments. Under these fee plans, we electronically add the transaction fee to the spread\nquoted by the broker-dealer client. The U.S. high-grade transaction fee is generally designated in basis points in yield and, as a result, is subject to fluctuation\ndepending on the duration of the bond traded.\nCommissions for high-yield bonds, emerging markets bonds, Eurobonds, municipal bonds and leveraged loans generally vary based on the type of the\ninstrument traded using standard fee schedules. Our high-yield fee plan structure is similar to our U.S. high-grade fee plans. Certain dealers participate in a high-\nyield fee plan that incorporates a variable transaction fee and a fixed distribution fee, while other dealers participate in a plan that does not contain monthly\ndistribution fees and instead incorporates additional per transaction execution fees and minimum monthly fee commitments.\nThe average credit fees per million may vary in the future due to changes in yield, years-to-maturity and nominal size of high-grade bonds traded on our\nplatforms and changes in product mix or trading protocols.\nCredit distribution fees include any unused monthly fee commitments under our variable fee plans.\nRates Commissions. Rates includes U.S. Treasury, U.S. agency and European government bonds. Commissions for rates products generally vary based on\nthe type of the instrument traded. U.S. Treasury fee plans are typically volume tiered and can vary based on the trading protocol. The average rates fee per\nmillion may vary in the future due to changes in product mix or trading protocols.\n31\nWe anticipate that average fees per million may change in the future. Consequently, past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future\ncommissions.\nOther Commissions. Other commissions include equities and foreign exchange commissions for Pragma’s algorithmic trading services. Commissions for\nequities and foreign exchange are volume-tiered and consist of variable transaction fees that are billed monthly.\nInformation Services\nWe generate revenue from data licensed to our broker-dealer clients, institutional investor clients and data-only subscribers; professional and consulting\nservices; technology software licenses; and maintenance and support services. These revenues are either for subscription-based services transferred over time,\nand may be net of volume-based discounts, or one-time services. Revenues for services transferred over time are recognized ratably over the contract period\nwhile revenues for services transferred at a point in time are recognized in the period the services are provided. Customers are generally billed monthly, quarterly,\nor annually; revenues billed in advance are deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period.\nPost-trade Services\nWe generate revenue from regulatory transaction reporting, trade publication and post-trade matching services. Customers are generally billed in the\ncurrent month or monthly in arrears and revenue is recognized in the period that the transactions are processed. Revenues billed in advance are deferred and\nrecognized ratably over the contract period. We also generate one-time implementation fees for onboarding clients, which are invoiced and recognized in the\nperiod the implementation is complete.\nTechnology Services\nTechnology services includes technology services revenue generated by Pragma and revenue generated from telecommunications line charges to broker-\ndealer clients.\nExpenses\nIn the normal course of business, we incur the following expenses:\nEmployee Compensation and Benefits. Employee compensation and benefits is our most significant expense and includes employee salaries, stock-based\ncompensation costs, other incentive compensation, employee benefits and payroll taxes.\nDepreciation and Amortization. We depreciate our computer hardware and related software, office hardware and furniture and fixtures and amortize our\ncapitalized software development costs on a straight-line basis over three to five years. We amortize leasehold improvements on a straight-line basis over the\nlesser of the life of the improvement or the remaining term of the lease. Intangible assets with definite lives, including purchased technologies, customer\nrelationships and other intangible assets, are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from one to 15 years, using either a straight-line or\naccelerated amortization method based on the pattern of economic benefit that we expect to realize from such assets. Intangible assets are assessed for\nimpairment when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment.\nTechnology and Communications. Technology and communications expense consists primarily of costs relating to software and licenses, maintenance on\nsoftware and hardware, cloud hosting costs, data feeds provided by outside vendors, U.S. government bonds technology platform licensing fees, data center\nhosting costs and our internal network connections. The majority of our broker-dealer clients have dedicated high-speed communication lines to our network in\norder to provide fast data transfer. We charge our broker-dealer clients a monthly fee for these connections, which is recovered against the relevant expenses we\nincur.\nProfessional and Consulting Fees. Professional and consulting fees consist primarily of accounting fees, legal fees and fees paid to information\ntechnology and other consultants for services provided for the maintenance of our trading platforms, information and post-trade services products and other\nservices.\nOccupancy. Occupancy costs consist primarily of office and equipment rent, utilities and commercial rent tax.\nMarketing and Advertising. Marketing and advertising expense consists primarily of branding and other advertising expenses we incur to promote our\nproducts and services. This expense also includes costs associated with attending or exhibiting at industry-sponsored seminars, conferences and conventions, and\ntravel and entertainment expenses incurred by our sales force to promote our trading platforms, information services and post-trade services.\nClearing Costs. Clearing costs consist of fees that we are charged by third-party clearing brokers and depositories for the clearing and settlement of\nmatched principal trades, regulatory reporting fees and variable transaction fees assessed by the provider of our third-party middle office system.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expense consists primarily of general travel and entertainment, board of directors’ expenses,\nregulatory fees, subscription costs, charitable contributions, provision for doubtful accounts, various state franchise and U.K. value-added taxes and other\nmiscellaneous expenses.\n32\nExpenses may continue to grow in the future, notably in employee compensation and benefits as we increase headcount to support investment in new\nproducts, operational support and geographic expansion, depreciation and amortization due to increased investment in new products and enhancements to our\ntrading platforms, and technology and communication costs. Expenses may also grow due to increased regulatory complexity, acquisitions or the continued\neffects of inflation.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest Income. Interest income consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, deposits and investments.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense consists of financing charges incurred on short-term borrowings.\nEquity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliate. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate represents the proportionate share of our equity method\ninvestee's net income.\nOther, Net. Other, net consists of realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading security investments and foreign currency forward contracts, foreign\ncurrency transaction gains or losses, investment advisory fees, credit facility administrative fees, gains or losses on revaluations of contingent consideration\npayable and other miscellaneous revenues and expenses.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our Consolidated Financial Statements, which\nhave been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect\nthe reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates and\njudgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these\nestimates under varying assumptions or conditions. Critical accounting estimates for us include stock-based compensation.\nStock-based compensation\nWe maintain the 2020 Plan, which provides for the grant of full value awards, stock options and other stock-based awards to encourage employees,\nconsultants and non-employee directors to participate in our long-term success. We make critical accounting estimates related to performance stock units granted\nunder the 2020 Plan (the “PSUs”).\nIn 2022, 2023 and 2024, the PSUs were granted to the executive officers and certain senior managers. Each PSU is earned or forfeited based on our level\nof achievement of certain predetermined metrics, including pre-tax adjusted operating margin, U.S. credit market share and revenue growth excluding U.S.\ncredit. The vested share pay-out ranges from zero to 200% of the PSU target. The number of PSUs that vest, if any, is determined by the level of achievement of\nthe performance metrics during the three-year performance periods, as certified by the Compensation and Talent Committee following the conclusion of the\nperformance period. In addition, participants must provide continued service through the vesting date, subject to death, disability and qualified retirement\nexceptions, as applicable. Compensation expense for the PSUs is measured using the fair value of our stock at the grant date and estimates of future performance\nand actual share payouts. Each period, we make estimates of the current expected share payouts and adjust the life-to-date compensation expense recognized\nsince the grant date. As of September 30, 2024, a 10.0% change in the expected final share payouts would increase or decrease the life-to-date compensation\nexpense by $1.5 million. The estimated final share payouts for the 2022 and 2023 awards as of September 30, 2024 decreased 25.7% compared to December 31,\n2023.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 for a discussion of any recent accounting pronouncements relevant to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSegment Results\nWe operate electronic platforms for the trading of fixed-income securities and provide related data, analytics, compliance tools and post-trade services. We\nconsider our operations to constitute a single business segment because of the highly integrated nature of these products and services, the financial markets in\nwhich we compete and our worldwide business activities. We believe that results by geographic region or client sector are not necessarily meaningful in\nunderstanding our business. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for certain geographic information about our business required by GAAP.\n33\nResults of Operations\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nThe following table summarizes our financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\n($ in thousands, except per share amounts)\nRevenues $ 206,715 $ 172,284 $ 34,431 20.0 %\nExpenses 119,660 105,375 14,285 13.6\nOperating income 87,055 66,909 20,146 30.1\nOther income (expense) 5,842 4,834 1,008 20.9\nIncome before income taxes 92,897 71,743 21,154 29.5\nProvision for income taxes 21,408 16,802 4,606 27.4\nNet income $ 71,489 $ 54,941 $ 16,548 30.1 %\nNet income per common share – Diluted $ 1.90 $ 1.46 $ 0.44 30.1 %\nChanges in average foreign currency exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar had the effect of increasing revenues and expenses by $0.9 million and\n$0.7 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nRevenues\nOur revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the resulting dollar and percentage changes, were as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n($ in thousands)\n% of % of $ %\nRevenues Revenues Change Change\nCommissions $ 180,392 87.3 % $ 150,496 87.4 % $ 29,896 19.9 %\nInformation services 12,960 6.3 11,801 6.8 1,159 9.8\nPost-trade services 10,382 5.0 9,833 5.7 549 5.6\nTechnology services 2,981 1.4 154 0.1 2,827 NM\nTotal revenues $ 206,715 100.0 % $ 172,284 100.0 % $ 34,431 20.0\nNM - not meaningful\nTotal revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 include Pragma revenues of $7.7 million.\n34\nCommissions.

Technology services revenue increased by $8.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to technology services\nrevenue generated by Pragma.\nExpenses\nThe following table summarizes our expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\n($ in thousands)\nExpenses\nEmployee compensation and benefits $ 176,485 $ 149,570 $ 26,915 18.0 %\nDepreciation and amortization 55,284 51,027 4,257 8.3\nTechnology and communications 53,375 45,573 7,802 17.1\nProfessional and consulting fees 21,053 24,331 (3,278) (13.5)\nOccupancy 10,974 10,313 661 6.4\nMarketing and advertising 7,741 8,403 (662) (7.9)\nClearing costs 13,420 12,392 1,028 8.3\nGeneral and administrative 15,467 15,698 (231) (1.5)\nTotal expenses $ 353,799 $ 317,307 36,492 11.5 %\nTotal expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 include Pragma expenses of $23.8 million.\nEmployee compensation and benefits increased by $26.9 million, primarily due to an increase in salaries, taxes and benefits of $16.7 million on higher\nemployee headcount, largely driven by the Pragma Acquisition, higher employee incentive compensation of $8.5 million and higher stock compensation expense\nof $1.7 million.\nDepreciation and amortization increased by $4.3 million primarily due to higher amortization of software development costs of $2.5 million and higher\namortization of intangibles of $1.9 million.\nTechnology and communications expenses increased by $7.8 million primarily due to higher connectivity costs of $2.6 million, higher software\nsubscription costs of $2.0 million, higher market and production data costs of $1.6 million, higher data center and cloud hosting costs of $0.9 million, higher U.S.\nTreasury platform licensing fees of $0.5 million and higher IT support costs of $0.3 million.\nProfessional and consulting fees decreased by $3.3 million primarily due to lower IT consulting costs of $3.1 million and lower acquisition-related legal\nexpenses of $1.3 million, offset by higher audit and tax costs of $1.1 million.\n40\nOther Income (Expense)\nOur other income (expense) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the resulting dollar and percentage changes, were as follows:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\n($ in thousands)\nInterest income $ 19,327 $ 16,151 $ 3,176 19.7 %\nInterest expense (1,283) (347) (936) 269.7\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate 1,064 579 485 83.8\nOther, net (4,051) (5,487) 1,436 (26.2)\nTotal other income (expense) $ 15,057 $ 10,896 $ 4,161 38.2 %\nInterest income increased by $3.2 million driven by higher interest rates.\nInterest expense increased by $0.9 million due to higher financing charges incurred under our short-term borrowing arrangements.\nOther, net increased by $1.4 million primarily driven by unrealized gains of $0.9 million on our U.S. Treasury investments in the current period compared\nto unrealized losses of $0.5 million in the prior period.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes and effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\n($ in thousands)\nProvision for income taxes $ 66,909 $ 60,460 $ 6,449 10.7 %\nEffective tax rate 24.2% 24.3%\nOur consolidated effective tax rate can vary from period to period depending on the geographic mix of our earnings, changes in tax legislation and tax\nrates and the amount and timing of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments, among other factors.\n41\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have met our funding requirements through cash on hand, internally generated funds and short-\nterm borrowings. Cash and cash equivalents and corporate bond and U.S. Treasury investments totaled $602.5 million as of September 30, 2024. Our investments\ngenerally consist of investment-grade corporate bonds and U.S. Treasury securities. We limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest in\nshort- to intermediate-term instruments whose fair values are less sensitive to interest rate changes.\nIn August 2023, we entered into the 2023 Credit Agreement, which provides aggregate commitments totaling $750.0 million, including a revolving credit\nfacility, a $5.0 million letter of credit sub-limit for standby letters of credit and a $380.0 million sub-limit for swingline loans. The 2023 Credit Agreement will\nmature on August 9, 2026, with our option to request up to two additional 364-day extensions at the discretion of each lender and subject to customary\nconditions. As of September 30, 2024, we had $0.1 million in letters of credit outstanding and $749.9 million in available borrowing capacity under the 2023\nCredit Agreement. Borrowings under the 2023 Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the alternate base rate or the adjusted term SOFR\nrate, plus an applicable margin that varies with our consolidated total leverage ratio. The 2023 Credit Agreement requires that we satisfy certain covenants,\nincluding a requirement to not exceed a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants at September 30, 2024.\nSee Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the 2023 Credit Agreement.\nIn connection with their self-clearing operations, certain of our operating subsidiaries maintain agreements with a settlement bank to allow the\nsubsidiaries to borrow an aggregate of up to $500.0 million on an uncommitted basis, collateralized by eligible securities pledged by the subsidiaries to the\nsettlement bank, subject to certain haircuts. Borrowings under these agreements will bear interest at a base rate per annum equal to the higher of the upper range\nof the Federal Funds Rate, 0.25% or one-month SOFR, plus 1.00%. As of September 30, 2024, the subsidiaries had no borrowings outstanding and up to $500.0\nmillion in available uncommitted borrowing capacity under such agreements. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these\nagreements.\nUnder arrangements with their settlement banks, certain of our operating subsidiaries may receive overnight financing in the form of bank overdrafts. As\nof September 30, 2024, we had no overdrafts payable outstanding.\nAs a result of our self-clearing and settlement activities, we are required to finance certain transactions, maintain deposits with various clearing\norganizations and clearing broker-dealers and maintain a special reserve bank account for the benefit of customers pursuant to Rule 15c3-3 of the Exchange Act.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the aggregate amount of the positions financed, cash deposits and customer reserve balances associated with our self-clearing and\nsettlement activities was $240.2 million. These requirements can fluctuate based on trading activity, market volatility or other factors which may impact our\nliquidity or require us to use our capital resources.\nCash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nOur cash flows were as follows:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\n($ in thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 208,989 $ 192,082 $ 16,907 8.8 %\nNet cash (used in) investing activities (75,268) (63,617) (11,651) 18.3\nNet cash (used in) financing activities (156,470) (110,782) (45,688) 41.2\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and\ncash equivalents 11,082 (1,451) 12,533 NM\nNet increase for the period $ (11,667) $ 16,232 $ (27,899) (171.9) %\nNM - not meaningful\nThe $16.9 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher net income of $20.6 million, higher depreciation and\namortization of $4.3 million, lower prepaid expenses and other assets of $21.4 million, lower purchases of trading investments of $23.7 million and an increase in\naccrued compensation and accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities of $10.0 million, partially offset by higher net receivables from broker-\ndealers, clearing organizations and customers associated with our clearing activities of $65.8 million.\nThe $11.7 million increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to higher net purchases of available-for-sale investments of $5.2\nmillion and higher capital expenditures of $6.5 million.\n42\nThe $45.7 million increase in net cash used in financing activities was principally due to higher repurchases of common stock of $58.6 million, higher\ncash dividends of $2.9 million and lower net proceeds from short-term borrowings of $4.0 million, offset by lower withholding tax payments on full value\nawards vesting of $5.6 million, lower payments of contingent consideration of $12.5 million and higher exercises of stock options of $1.7 million.\nThe $12.5 million change in the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents was driven by changes in the cumulative translation\nadjustment.\nPast trends of cash flows are not necessarily indicative of future cash flow levels. A decrease in cash flows may have a material adverse effect on our\nliquidity, business and financial condition.\nOther Factors Influencing Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe believe that our current resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs and requirements, including commitments for capital expenditures, in the\nshort-term (during the next 12 months). However, our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on a number of factors, including liquidity\nrequirements associated with our self-clearing operations and expenses associated with product development and expansion and new business opportunities that\nare intended to further diversify our revenue streams. We may also acquire or invest in technologies, business ventures or products that are complementary to our\nbusiness. In the event we require any additional financing, it will take the form of equity or debt financing. Any additional equity offerings may result in dilution\nto our stockholders. Any debt financings, if available at all, may involve restrictive covenants with respect to dividends, issuances of additional capital and other\nfinancial and operational matters related to our business. In addition, in the long-term (beyond 12 months), we believe our liquidity needs and requirements will\nbe affected by the factors discussed above.\nCertain of our U.S. subsidiaries are registered as broker-dealers and therefore are subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and FINRA.\nThese rules contain minimum net capital requirements, as defined in the applicable regulations. Certain of our foreign subsidiaries are regulated by the FCA in\nthe U.K. or other foreign regulators and must maintain financial resources, as defined in the applicable regulations, in excess of the applicable financial resources\nrequirement. As of September 30, 2024, each of our subsidiaries that are subject to these regulations had net capital or financial resources in excess of their\nminimum requirements. As of September 30, 2024, our subsidiaries maintained aggregate net capital and financial resources that were $607.1 million in excess of\nthe required levels of $35.7 million.\nEach of our U.S. and foreign regulated subsidiaries are subject to local regulations which generally limit, or require the prior notification to or approval\nfrom such regulated entity’s principal regulator before, the repayment of borrowings from our affiliates, paying cash dividends, making loans to our affiliates or\notherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources.\nWe execute securities transactions between our institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to\nboth the buyer and the seller in trades. Our operating subsidiaries settle such transactions using their self-clearing operations or through the use of third-party\nclearing brokers or settlement agents. Settlement typically occurs within one to two trading days after the trade date. Cash settlement of the transaction occurs\nupon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded. Under both the self-clearing and the third-party clearing models, we may be exposed to\ncredit risk in the event a counterparty does not fulfill its obligation to complete a transaction or if there is an error in executing a matched principal transaction.\nPursuant to the terms of the securities clearing agreements, each third-party clearing broker has the right to charge us for any losses they suffer resulting from a\ncounterparty’s failure on any of our trades. We did not record any liabilities or losses with regard to counterparty failures for the nine months ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023. Substantially all of our open securities failed-to-deliver and securities failed-to-receive transactions as of September 30, 2024 have\nsubsequently settled at the contractual amounts.\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations, warranties and indemnification provisions. Our\nmaximum exposure from any claims under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve claims that have not yet occurred.\nWe have leases for corporate offices and equipment with initial lease terms ranging from one year to 15 years. We have total future contractual rent\npayments on these leases of $97.6 million, with $13.1 million due within the next 12 months and $84.5 million due beyond 12 months.\nWe enter into foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge our exposure to variability in certain foreign currency transaction gains and\nlosses. As of September 30, 2024, the notional value of our foreign currency forward contract outstanding was $64.1 million and the fair value of the asset was\n$2.8 million.\nIn January 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the 2022 Repurchase Program for up to $150.0 million. In August 2024, the Board of Directors\nauthorized the 2024 Repurchase Program for up to an additional $200.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had $241.4 million of remaining capacity under\nthe Repurchase Programs. Shares repurchased under the Repurchase Programs will be held in treasury for future use.\n43\nIn October 2024, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.74 per share payable on December 4, 2024 to stockholders of record as\nof the close of business on November 20, 2024. Any future declaration and payment of dividends will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors.\nOn April 19, 2024, we entered into an agreement to acquire an additional 49.0% interest in RFQ–hub Holdings LLC for approximately $37.9 million of\ncash consideration. The acquisition is subject to various closing conditions, including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals. Upon the closing of the\nacquisition, we will hold a 92.0% controlling stake in RFQ-hub Holdings LLC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures: earnings before interest, taxes,\ndepreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), EBITDA margin and free cash flow. We define EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by revenues. We define free\ncash flow as net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities excluding the net change in trading investments and net change in securities failed-to-deliver and\nsecurities failed-to-receive from broker-dealers, clearing organizations and customers, less expenditures for furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements and\ncapitalized software development costs. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken into consideration with the corresponding GAAP financial\nmeasures, are important in understanding our operating results. EBITDA, EBITDA margin and free cash flow are not measures of financial performance or\nliquidity under GAAP and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating\nperformance or liquidity. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken into consideration with the corresponding GAAP financial measures,\nprovide additional information regarding our operating results because they assist both investors and management in analyzing and evaluating the performance of\nour business.\nThe table set forth below presents a reconciliation of our net income to EBITDA and net income margin to EBITDA margin, as defined above, for the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n($ in thousands)\nNet income $ 71,489 $ 54,941 $ 209,042 $ 188,428\nInterest income (6,953) (6,590) (19,327) (16,151)\nInterest expense 346 164 1,283 347\nProvision for income taxes 21,408 16,802 66,909 60,460\nDepreciation and amortization 18,728 17,561 55,284 51,027\nEBITDA $ 105,018 $ 82,878 $ 313,191 $ 284,111\nNet income margin 34.6% 31.9% 34.0% 33.9%\nInterest income (3.4) (3.8) (3.1) (2.9)\nInterest expense 0.2 0.1 0.2 0.1\nProvision for income taxes 10.3 9.7 10.9 10.9\nDepreciation and amortization 9.1 10.2 9.0 9.2\nEBITDA margin 50.8% 48.1% 51.0% 51.2%\nThe table set forth below presents a reconciliation of our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow, as defined above, for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n($ in thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 95,089 $ 79,161 $ 208,989 $ 192,082\nExclude: Net change in trading investments 784 24,771 629 24,300\nExclude: Net change in fail-to-deliver/receive from\nbroker-dealers, clearing organizations and customers 2,578 (13,099) 50,715 (12,342)\nLess: Purchases of furniture, equipment and leasehold\nimprovements (835) (5,983) (9,727) (7,255)\nLess: Capitalization of software development costs (11,331) (10,087) (35,790) (31,802)\nFree Cash Flow $ 86,285 $ 74,763 $ 214,816 $ 164,983\n44\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nMarket risk is the risk of the loss resulting from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.\nMarket Risk\nThe global financial services business is, by its nature, risky and volatile and is directly affected by many national and international factors that are\nbeyond our control. Any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the U.S. and global financial services markets, resulting in reduced trading\nvolume and revenues. These events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $101.2 million of investments in U.S. Treasuries that were classified as trading securities and $55.0 million of\ninvestments in corporate bonds that were classified as available-for-sale. Adverse movements, such as a decrease in the value of these securities or a downturn or\ndisruption in the markets for these securities, could result in a substantial loss. A 10.0% decrease in the market value of our U.S Treasuries or available-for-sale\ninvestments would result in losses of approximately $10.1 million and $5.5 million, respectively. In addition, principal gains and losses resulting from these\nsecurities could on occasion have a disproportionate effect, positive or negative, on our financial condition and results of operations for any particular reporting\nperiod.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk represents our exposure to interest rate changes with respect to our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash deposits. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash deposits amounted to $600.0 million. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in\ninterest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest income by approximately $6.0 million, assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash\nand cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash deposits.\nAs of September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of the available-\nfor-sale investment portfolio by approximately $1.0 million, assuming no change in the amount or composition of the investments. The hypothetical unrealized\ngain or loss of $1.0 million would be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.\nA similar hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of the trading securities portfolio by\napproximately $2.6 million. The hypothetical unrealized gain or loss of $2.6 million would be recognized in other, net in the Consolidated Statements of\nOperations.\nWe do not maintain an inventory of bonds that are traded on our platform.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe conduct operations in several different countries outside of the U.S., most notably the U.K., and substantial portions of our revenues, expenses, assets\nand liabilities are generated and denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies. Since our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must\ntranslate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period.\nAccordingly, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against the other currencies will affect our net operating revenues, operating expenses,\noperating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies.\nDuring the twelve months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 15.7% of our revenues and 24.4% of our expenses were denominated in currencies\nother than the U.S. dollar, most notably the British Pound Sterling. Based on actual results over the past year, a hypothetical 10.0% increase or decrease in the\nU.S. dollar against all other currencies would have increased or decreased revenue by approximately $12.7 million and operating expenses by approximately\n$11.6 million.\n45\nCredit Risk\nThrough certain of our subsidiaries, we execute securities transactions between our institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a matched principal\nbasis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades. Our operating subsidiaries settle such transactions using their self-clearing operations\nor through the use of third-party clearing brokers or settlement agents. Settlement typically occurs within one to two trading days after the trade date. Cash\nsettlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded.\nWe are exposed to credit and performance risks in our role as matched principal trading counterparty to our clients executing bond trades on our platform,\nincluding the risk that counterparties that owe us money or securities will not perform their obligations. These parties may default on their obligations to us due\nto bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. Adverse movements in the prices of securities that are the subject of these transactions can\nincrease our risk. In connection with Open Trading or other anonymous protocols, we expect that the number of transactions in which we act as a matched\nprincipal will increase.\nWe have policies, procedures and automated controls in place to identify and manage our credit risk. There can be no assurance that these policies,\nprocedures and automated controls will effectively mitigate our credit risk exposure. Some of our risk management procedures are reliant upon the evaluation of\ninformation regarding the fixed-income markets, our clients or other relevant matters that are publicly available or otherwise acquired from third-party sources.\nSuch information may not be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly assessed and interpreted by us. If our risk management procedures fail, our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Furthermore, our insurance policies are unlikely to provide coverage for such risks.\nCash and cash equivalents include cash and money market instruments that are primarily maintained at three major global banks. Given this\nconcentration, we are exposed to certain credit risk in relation to our deposits at these banks.\nDerivative Risk\nOur limited derivative risk stems from our activities in the foreign currency forward contract market. We use this market to economically hedge our\nforeign exchange gains and losses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations that arise from our U.S. dollar versus British Pound Sterling exposure from the\nactivities of our U.K. subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2024, the notional amount of our foreign currency forward contract was $64.1 million. We do not hold\nderivative instruments for purposes other than economically hedging foreign currency risk.\n46\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated\nthe effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures,” as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act,\nas of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and\nprocedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by MarketAxess in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is\nrecorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and to ensure that information is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosure.\n(b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-\n15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 identified in connection with the evaluation thereof by our\nmanagement, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our\ninternal control over financial reporting.\n47\nPART II — Other Information\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nIn the normal course of business, we and our subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements may be involved in various lawsuits,\nproceedings and regulatory examinations. We assess liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings, if any, utilizing the latest\ninformation available. Based on currently available information, the outcome of our outstanding matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our\nfinancial position. It is not presently possible to determine our ultimate exposure to these matters and there is no assurance that the resolution of the outstanding\nmatters will not significantly exceed any reserves accrued by us. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our commitments and\ncontingencies.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nThere have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our most recent Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. For a\ndiscussion of the risk factors affecting the Company, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 Form 10-K.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nNone.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased the following shares of common stock:\nTotal Number of Approximate Dollar\nShares Purchased as Value of Shares That\nPart of Publicly May Yet Be\nTotal Number of Average Price Paid Announced Plans or Purchased Under the\nPeriod Shares Purchased per Share Programs Plans or Programs\n(In thousands)\nJuly 1, 2024 - July 31, 2024 32,448 $ 202.35 31,635 $ 50,016\nAugust 1, 2024 - August 31, 2024 10,662 236.10 10,662 247,498\nSeptember 1, 2024 - September 30, 2024 24,052 254.07 24,052 241,388\nTotal 67,162 $ 226.23 66,349\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 67,162 shares of common stock. The repurchases included 66,349 shares\nrepurchased in connection with our Repurchase Programs and 813 shares surrendered by employees to satisfy the withholding tax obligations upon the vesting of\nfull value awards and upon the exercise of stock options.\nIn January 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the 2022 Repurchase Program for up to $150.0 million. In August 2024, our Board of Directors\nauthorized the 2024 Repurchase Program for up to an additional $200.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had $241.4 million of remaining capacity under\nthe Repurchase Programs. Shares repurchased under the Repurchase Programs will be held in treasury for future use.\n48\nItem 3. Defaults upon Senior Securities\nNone.\nItem 4.
