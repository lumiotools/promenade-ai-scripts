(NASDAQ: TWKS) (\"Thoughtworks\" or the \"Company\"), a leading global technology consultancy, today reported results for the third quarter of 2024. \n\n**Acquisition Update**\n\nAs announced on August 5, 2024, Thoughtworks has entered into a definitive merger agreement to be acquired by affiliates of certain investment funds advised by Apax Partners LLP for $4.40 per share (the “Merger”). In connection with the Merger, Thoughtworks has filed a definitive Information Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 21, 2024. A copy of the Information Statement can be found by visiting the Investor Relations section of the Thoughtworks corporate website at [thoughtworks.com](http://thoughtworks.com). In light of the announced transaction, Thoughtworks will not be holding a conference call to discuss its September 30, 2024 financial results. \n\n**Update on Restructuring Activities**\n\nOn August 8, 2023, Thoughtworks initiated several measures to reduce operational costs and better align our business with our customers’ needs in a challenging macroeconomic environment. On May 7, 2024, we increased our restructuring program to capture additional cost savings. On August 2, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a second increase to its restructuring plan. The restructuring program was completed on October 31, 2024, as expected. The Company expects to record an immaterial amount of expense in the fourth quarter of 2024 due to closing out the program and the finalization of certain restructuring expenses, in addition to expense incurred in October related to restructuring actions taken. \n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, Thoughtworks incurred pre-tax cash charges of approximately $22.6 million, which include $21.1 million in wage-related costs and $1.5 million in non-wage related costs. Since the program’s inception in August 2023 through September 30, 2024, we have incurred pre-tax cash charges of approximately $50.9 million, which include $45.6 million in wage-related costs and $5.3 million in non-wage related costs, compared to total expected pre-tax charges of $56.5 million to $68.0 million, of which include $51.0 million to $59.0 million of wage-related expenses, such as employee severance and related benefits, and $5.5 million to $9.0 million of non-wage related expenses, including costs related to reducing leased office space, vendor contract cancellations and professional fees. As of September 30, 2024, we have achieved $180 million of annualized savings compared to expected total restructuring program savings of $185.0 million to $210.0 million. \n\n**QTD third quarter 2024 highlights**\n\nRevenues for the third quarter were $261.4 million, a year-over-year decline of (6.7)%, or a year-over-year decline of (6.9)% in constant currency. \n\nNet loss margin for the third quarter was (2.3)% compared to (9.2)% for the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the third quarter was 11.7% compared to 12.0% for the third quarter of 2023. \n\nDiluted loss per share for the third quarter was $(0.02) compared to $(0.08) for the third quarter of 2023.

QTD: net loss, diluted loss per share and free cash flow. YTD: net loss, diluted loss per share, cash flow from operations, adjusted net (loss) income, adjusted diluted (loss) earnings per share and free cash flow.   \n(2) Acquisitions completed in the last twelve months had an immaterial contribution to revenue growth for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024.   \n(3) The three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 include $0.2 million expense and a net reversal of $0.4 million, respectively, related to the CEO transition.   \n(4) See “Non-GAAP financial measures” for how we define these measures and the financial tables that accompany this release for reconciliation of these measures to the closest comparable GAAP measures.   \n(5) Revenue Growth Rate at Constant Currency is calculated by translating the current period revenues into U.S. dollars at the weighted average exchange rates of the prior period of comparison; therefore the weighted average rates used in each respective calculation are not consistent. The change in revenue growth rate at constant currency was excluded, as it was determined to be not meaningful.   \n  \n**Bookings**\n\nOur overall bookings for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2024 was $1.3 billion, a sequential increase from $1.2 billion and a year-over-year decrease from $1.4 billion. The sequential increase from the second quarter of 2024 to the third quarter of 2024 is a result of continued strong bookings as our industry-based go-to-market strategy is gaining momentum. The 7.1% year-over-year decrease in bookings is primarily a result of reduced client budgets reflecting caution around the macroeconomic environment and smaller contract sizes which reflect a shift to offshore services, where bill rates are lower compared to onshore work, and, in certain cases, discounts or pricing adjustments. \n\n**Trailing Twelve Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \n# of clients with bookings greater than $10 million |  37  |  37   \n# of clients with bookings between $5 million and $10 million |  30  |  27   \n  \n**Revenue by geography(6)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n_$ in thousands_ |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **% Change** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **% Change**  \nNorth America |  $  |  92,039  |  $  |  105,241  |  (12.5  |  )%  |  $  |  269,094  |  $  |  327,871  |  (17.9  |  )%   \nAPAC  |  91,185  |  97,247  |  (6.2  |  )%  |  266,993  |  293,411  |  (9.0  |  )%   \nEurope |  66,149  |  63,228  |  4.6  |  %  |  191,415  |  207,775  |  (7.9  |  )%   \nLATAM  |  12,020  |  14,443  |  (16.8  |  )%  |  34,155  |  45,373  |  (24.7  |  )%   \nTotal revenues  |  $  |  261,393  |  $  |  280,159  |  (6.7  |  )%  |  $  |  761,657  |  $  |  874,430  |  (12.9  |  )%   \n(6) Revenues are presented geographically, by customer location.

In some cases, you can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of terms such as \"expect,\" \"will,\" \"continue,\" or similar expressions, and variations or negatives of these words, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements represent our management's beliefs and assumptions only as of the date of this press release. You should read this press release with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. All statements other than statements of historical fact are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, which include but are not limited to: the statements under “Update on Acquisition” (including any other materials referenced therein), “Update on Restructuring Activities,” including expectations relating to the size of the restructuring actions, the amount and timing of related cost savings and charges and the potential long-term benefits of the restructuring actions; statements regarding relationships with existing and potential clients and their engagement decisions; and any other statements of expectation or belief. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from results expressed or implied in this press release. Such risk factors include, but are not limited to, those related to: current and future impact of macro-related factors on Thoughtworks' clients’ engagement decisions, Thoughtworks’ business and industry; the effects of competition on the future business of Thoughtworks; uncertainty regarding the demand for and market utilization of our services; the ability to implement our restructuring actions, including the costs of such actions and the uncertainty of the impact of such actions on financial performance; the ability to maintain or acquire new client relationships; other general business and economic conditions (including such conditions related to inflation and foreign currency exchange rates); the possibility that the Merger does not close when expected or at all because one or more conditions to the closing are not satisfied on a timely basis or at all; that the parties to the merger agreement may modify its terms and conditions; that the anticipated benefits of the Merger are not realized as a result of such things as the weakness of the economy and competitive factors in the technology consultancy industry; the Merger’s effect on the Company’s relationships with its customers and suppliers, whether or not the Merger is completed; the parties’ ability to successfully integrate operations in the Merger; significant or unanticipated transaction and merger-related integration costs; and our ability to successfully execute our strategy and strategic plans.

Definitions of and the related reconciliations for these non-GAAP financial measures can be found below. We use these non-GAAP measures in conjunction with traditional GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitate period-to-period comparisons of operations. However, non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. For example, many of the non-GAAP financial measures used herein exclude stock-based compensation expense, which has recently been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring non-cash expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy. \n\n**_Revenue Growth Rate and Revenue Growth Rate at constant currency_**\n\nCertain of our subsidiaries use functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar and the translation of these foreign currency amounts into U.S. dollars can impact the comparability of our revenues between periods. Accordingly, we use Revenue Growth Rate at constant currency as an important indicator of our underlying performance. Revenue Growth Rate at constant currency is calculated by applying the average exchange rates in effect during the earlier comparative fiscal period to the later fiscal period. \n\n**_Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin_**\n\nWe define gross profit as total revenues less cost of revenues. We define Adjusted Gross Profit as gross profit excluding stock-based compensation expense, employer payroll related expense on employee equity incentive plan and depreciation expense. We calculate Adjusted Gross Margin by dividing Adjusted Gross Profit by total revenues. Our management uses Adjusted Gross Profit to assess overall performance and profitability, without regard to the aforementioned adjustments, which are unrelated to our ongoing revenue-generating operations. We also believe this information will be useful for investors to facilitate comparisons of our operating performance and better identify trends in our business. \n\n**_Adjusted SG &A and Adjusted SG&A Margin_**\n\nWe define Adjusted SG&A as selling, general and administrative expense excluding stock-based compensation expense, acquisition costs, certain professional fees that are considered unrelated to our ongoing revenue-generating operations, employer payroll related expense on employee equity incentive plan and CEO transition costs. We calculate Adjusted SG&A Margin by dividing Adjusted SG&A by total revenues. \n\nOur management uses Adjusted SG&A and Adjusted SG&A Margin to assess our overall performance, without regard to items such as stock-based compensation expense and other items that are considered to be unique or non-recurring in nature or otherwise unrelated to our ongoing revenue-generating operations. We also believe this information will be useful for investors to facilitate comparisons of our operating performance and better identify trends in our business. \n\n**_Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share_**\n\nWe define Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as net loss adjusted for unrealized (gain) loss on foreign currency exchange, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition costs, certain professional fees that are considered unrelated to our ongoing revenue-generating operations, employer payroll related expense on employee equity incentive plan, the change in fair value of contingent consideration, restructuring costs, CEO transition costs and income tax effects of adjustments. \n\nWe define Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share as diluted loss per share, with the numerator adjusted for the aforementioned adjustments to Adjusted Net Income (Loss). In other words, the numerator for Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share utilizes Adjusted Net Income (Loss). We calculate Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share by dividing Adjusted Net Income (Loss) by diluted weighted average shares outstanding. \n\nOur management uses Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share to assess our overall performance, without regard to items that are considered to be unique or non-recurring in nature or otherwise unrelated to our ongoing revenue-generating operations, net of the income tax effects of adjustments. \n\nOur management uses Adjusted Net Income (Loss) for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of our core operating results and the effectiveness of our business strategy, and in evaluating our financial performance. We also believe this information will be useful for investors to facilitate comparisons of our operating performance and better identify trends in our business. \n\n**_Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin_**\n\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss adjusted to exclude income tax expense; interest expense; other (income) expense, net, excluding an unrealized gain/loss related to the mark to market adjustment on shares received in relation to the sale and settlement of trade receivables; unrealized (gain) loss on foreign currency exchange; stock-based compensation expense; depreciation and amortization expense; acquisition costs; certain professional fees that are considered unrelated to our ongoing revenue generating operations; employer payroll related expense on employee equity incentive plan; restructuring charges; and CEO transition costs. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA Margin by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total revenues. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company's operating performance without regard to the aforementioned adjustments that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital structures, and the method by which assets were acquired or costs that are unique or non-recurring in nature or otherwise unrelated to our ongoing revenue-generating operations. \n\nOur management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of our core operating results and the effectiveness of our business strategy, and in evaluating our financial performance. We also believe this information will be useful for investors to facilitate comparisons of our operating performance and better identify trends in our business. \n\n**_Free Cash Flow_**\n\nWe define Free Cash Flow as net cash (used in) provided by operating activities less cash used for purchases of property and equipment. We believe that Free Cash Flow is a useful indicator of liquidity for investors and is used by our management as it measures our ability to generate cash, or our need to access additional sources of cash, to fund operations and investments. There are a number of limitations related to the use of free cash flow as compared to net cash from operating activities, including that Free Cash Flow includes capital expenditures, the benefits of which are realized in periods subsequent to those when expenditures are made. \n\n**THOUGHTWORKS HOLDING, INC.**  \n---  \n**CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF LOSS AND COMPREHENSIVE LOSS**  \n**(In

View the full release here: <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241023294155/en/>\n\nThis volume spotlights the proliferation of generative AI tools, platforms and frameworks that are emerging to help developers build them not only more effectively but also more responsibly. Being able to control the ‘context window’, for instance, or get structured outputs can minimize the well-documented risks of using generative AI and, ultimately, help put organizations in a stronger position to leverage generative AI successfully. \n\nWhile this growing landscape of generative AI tools offers significant benefits to practitioners, navigating its depth and breadth poses a challenge. As a result, Thoughtworks advises organizations to reflect on the specifics of their own use cases — particularly the objectives and potential risks — when considering which to adopt. What’s more, leveraging these tools needs to be done alongside trusted and proven engineering practices that can help ensure high reliability and quality. \n\n\"While generative AI and LLMs dominated our Technology Radar discussions as anticipated, the rapid advancement of AI-adjacent tools, techniques and frameworks from trial to adoption was a notable development in productionizing AI solutions,\" said [Rachel Laycock](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thoughtworks.com%2Fen-us%2Fprofiles%2Fleaders%2Frachel-laycock&esheet=54137452&newsitemid=20241023294155&lan=en-US&anchor=Rachel+Laycock&index=3&md5=59da2e89b5d5898a99a21de1f4f1739f), Chief Technology Officer, Thoughtworks. \"While organizations are finding a staggering number of AI tools to use for real world problems, it’s important to assess them in the traditional model of good engineering practices in order to drive adoption of AI that is safe, transparent and reliable.” \n\nHighlighted themes in Technology Radar volume 31 include: \n\n  * **AI usage antipatterns:** While AI can be a powerful asset, it’s important to watch out for pitfalls such as overreliance, code quality issues and codebase bloat. It's essential to maintain human oversight and strong engineering practices to ensure that AI complements rather than complicates development efforts. By adopting a balanced approach, organizations can harness the full potential of generative AI while mitigating its risks. \n\n\n  * **Rust is anything but rusty:** This language’s popularity is evident in the growing number of Rust-based tools and libraries across various ecosystems. Rust's ability to deliver ‘blazingly fast’ execution and reduced pitfalls makes it a compelling choice. The strong ecosystem and developer community further solidify Rust's position as a leading systems programming language. \n\n\n  * **The gradual rise of WebAssembly (WASM):** WASM, a low-level binary format for a stack-based virtual machine, offers a powerful way to run complex applications within web browsers. By leveraging existing JavaScript virtual machines, WASM enables developers to create sophisticated, portable and cross-platform applications while reducing infrastructure costs. Given that this technology has been available for some time, we were surprised how often it came up in this edition’s discussions, possibly signaling that WASM is poised to break out and unlock new possibilities for developers and businesses. \n\n\n  * **Cambrian explosion of the AI-adjacent ecosystem:** While AI models continue to advance, the supporting ecosystem of tools, platforms and frameworks has experienced explosive growth. Developers, unable to directly modify core generative AI capabilities, have created a plethora of tools to customize and optimize AI solutions. This rapid innovation mirrors the JavaScript ecosystem's growth in 2015, suggesting the AI ecosystem's potential for even greater advancement. \n\n\n\nVisit [www.thoughtworks.com/radar](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thoughtworks.com%2Fradar&esheet=54137452&newsitemid=20241023294155&lan=en-US&anchor=www.thoughtworks.com%2Fradar&index=4&md5=9b6da6813a70984a0000f0a064dbfe14) to explore the interactive version of the Radar or download the PDF version. \n\n**Supporting resources:**\n\n  * Read more about the [macro trends in the tech industry](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thoughtworks.com%2Finsights%2Fblog%2Ftechnology-strategy%2Fmacro-trends-tech-industry-october-2024&esheet=54137452&newsitemid=20241023294155&lan=en-US&anchor=macro+trends+in+the+tech+industry&index=5&md5=54de16d3a90806c639dc0d66bedf0682) in this edition. \n  * Keep up with Thoughtworks news by visiting the company’s [website](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thoughtworks.com%2F&esheet=54137452&newsitemid=20241023294155&lan=en-US&anchor=website&index=6&md5=34c0273512f583ccbc602f25b68ff920). \n  * Follow us on [Twitter](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fthoughtworks&esheet=54137452&newsitemid=20241023294155&lan=en-US&anchor=Twitter&index=7&md5=fdf1c48e37e4c7ce257c918b94519972), [LinkedIn](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Fthoughtworks&esheet=54137452&newsitemid=20241023294155&lan=en-US&anchor=LinkedIn&index=8&md5=eba1d7e622408189eb4bf8730fcd9ce0) and [YouTube](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fuser%2FThoughtWorks&esheet=54137452&newsitemid=20241023294155&lan=en-US&anchor=YouTube&index=9&md5=eb29e417bd766139ef88a86b5b502017). \n\n\n\n- ### - <TWKS915>\n\n**About**[**Thoughtworks**](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thoughtworks.com%2F%3Futm_source%3Dpress-release%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dempc_forrester-study_2021-05&esheet=54137452&newsitemid=20241023294155&lan=en-US&anchor=Thoughtworks&index=10&md5=73fd49abffefd3b1c28c53de785597d1)\n\nThoughtworks is a global technology consultancy that integrates strategy, design and engineering to drive digital innovation.
