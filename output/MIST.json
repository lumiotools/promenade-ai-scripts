(Nasdaq: MIST) today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 and provided a corporate update.\n\n“Our primary focus at Milestone is preparing for potential FDA approval of CARDAMYST (etripamil) nasal spray for the management of PSVT,” said Joseph Oliveto, President and Chief Executive Officer of Milestone Pharmaceuticals. “We believe that CARDAMYST has the potential to improve how PSVT is managed and positions Milestone to deliver meaningful value to patients, providers, and payors. Complementing our efforts in PSVT, we are very encouraged by clinician interest in the etripamil Phase 3 study in AFib-RVR which we are working toward commencing in the first half of 2025.”\n\n**Third Quarter and Recent Program Updates**\n\n**_CARDAMYST for patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)_**\n\n  * **New Drug Application (NDA) for CARDAMYST for** **PSVT under review by U.S. FDA. **The FDA accepted the NDA for CARDAMYST in May 2024 and has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target date for March 27, 2025. Preparations for a commercial launch in 2025 are underway.\n  * **Milestone’s partner, Corxel (formerly Ji Xing Pharmaceuticals Ltd), announced positive top line results from a Phase 3 trial of etripamil conducted in China.** In September, Corxel announced positive results from the multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial which expands the etripamil global development program to more than 2,000 unique patients treated with etripamil. The trial (JX02002) successfully met its primary endpoint, with a Kaplan Meier analysis showing a statistically significantly greater proportion of patients who self-administered etripamil converted from PSVT to sinus rhythm within 30 minutes compared to placebo (40.5% vs. 15.9%, respectively; hazard ratio [HR] = 3.00; p<0.001). Statistically significant (p<0.05) results were also achieved for the secondary efficacy endpoints for percent of patients’ PSVT converting to sinus rhythm by 10, 15, 45, and 60 minutes after self-administration of study drug. The safety and tolerability data from the trial were consistent with previous clinical studies. Milestone entered into an agreement with Ji Xing in 2021, granting it an exclusive license to develop and, if approved, commercialize etripamil in PSVT in Greater China. \n  * **Milestone hosted a KOL webinar entitled “Learnings from the Field: Managing PSVT and Studying AFib-RVR in the Community Setting.”** The event, which is the second of a series of planned webinars learning from community-based health care providers, featured Aamer H. Jamali, MD, FACC and Farhad Rafii, MD, FACC, both from Interventional Cardiology Medical Group in West Hills, CA. The physicians discussed how they manage patients with PSVT and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate (AFib-RVR) and highlighted clinical trial experience in PSVT as well as upcoming trials in AFib-RVR with the potential to impact the current standard of care. A replay of the webinar is available on the Milestone corporate website [here. ](https://investors.milestonepharma.com/events-and-presentations)\n  * **Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) data from PSVT patients receiving etripamil were presented at the annual meeting of the European Society of Cardiology ( ESC Congress) in London.** On August 30, 2024 Professor John Camm of St. George’s University of London, UK, presented PRO data from the NODE-303 Phase 3 trial of etripamil in PSVT in a moderated poster presentation. The poster presentation is available [here](https://milestonepharma.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ip-et-al_ESC-2024_NODE-303-PROs_Poster_Final_30July2024.pdf).\n\n\n\n**_Etripamil for patients with AFib-RVR_**\n\n  * **Milestone is on track to initiate a Phase 3 trial evaluating etripamil in AFib-RVR in H1 2025.** The Company has been in communication with the FDA regarding Phase 3 study design and is planning a trial that will be conducted in the at-home setting, comprising approximately 150 events from patients with a history of symptomatic episodes and using a repeat-dose regimen of 70 mg per dose (the same as the self-administration dosing regimen approach that was studied in the RAPID trial in PSVT).\n\n\n\n**Corporate Updates**\n\n  * **In September, Joseph Papa was appointed to the board of directors. **Mr. Papa brings more than 35 years of experience, having previously served as Chairman and CEO of Bausch + Lomb, Bausch Health and Perrigo and as a director of SparingVision and Candel Therapeutics. He has broad commercial experience and proven capabilities of advancing innovative products aimed at significantly enhancing patients’ lives.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * As of September 30, 2024, Milestone had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $76.4 million, compared to $66.0 million as of December 31, 2023.\n  * Research and development expense, net of tax credits for the third quarter of 2024 was $4.0 million, compared with $6.7 million for the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expense, net of tax credits was $10.4 million compared with $25.6 million for the same period in 2023. This decrease in research and development expenses was driven by lower clinical development costs and clinical personnel-related costs driven by completion of phase 3 studies, as well as a decrease in drug manufacturing and regulatory costs.\n  * General and administrative expense for the third quarter of 2024 was $3.7 million, compared with the $4.2 million reported for the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expense was $12.7 million, compared with the with $12.6 million for the prior year period. The decrease between the third quarter periods is primarily due to a decrease in personnel costs, partially offset by an increase in outside service costs.\n  * Commercial expense for the third quarter of 2024 was $1.9 million, compared with $4.4 million for the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, commercial expense was $6.6 million compared with $10.1 million for the prior year period. The decreases are a result of decreases in personnel costs, professional costs and other operational expenses related to commercialization.\n  * For the third quarter of 2024, net loss was $9.4 million, compared to $15.1 million for the prior year period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Milestone's net loss was $29.2 million, compared to $46.1 million in the prior year period.\n\n\n\nFor further details on the Company’s financials, refer to the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, filed with the SEC on November 12, 2024.\n\n**About Etripamil**\n\nEtripamil is Milestone's lead investigational product. It is a novel calcium channel blocker nasal spray under clinical development for frequent and often highly symptomatic episodes of PSVT and AFib-RVR. It is designed as a self-administered rapid response therapy for patients thereby bypassing the need for immediate medical oversight. If approved, etripamil is intended to provide health care providers with a new treatment option to enable on-demand care and patient self-management. This portable, self-administered treatment may provide patients with active management and a greater sense of control over their condition. CARDAMYST™ (etripamil) nasal spray, the conditionally approved brand name for etripamil nasal spray, is well studied with a robust clinical trial program that includes a completed Phase 3 clinical-stage program for the treatment of PSVT and Phase 2 trial for the treatment of patients with AFib-RVR.\n\n**About Milestone Pharmaceuticals**\n\nMilestone Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq: MIST) is a biopharmaceutical company developing and commercializing innovative cardiovascular solutions to improve the lives of people living with complex and life-altering heart conditions. The Company’s focus on understanding unmet patient needs and improving the patient experience has led us to develop new treatment approaches that provide patients with an active role in self-managing their care.

Jamali MD, FACC and Farhad Rafii, MD, FACC from Interventional Cardiology Medical Group in West Hills, CA, who will discuss the burden of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) and atrial fibrillation (AFib) on patients and how these conditions are managed in their practice. It will also highlight clinical trial experience in PSVT and upcoming trials in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate (AFib-RVR) with the potential to impact the current standard of care.\n\nA live question and answer session will follow the formal presentation.\n\n**About Aamer H. Jamali, MD, FACC**\n\nAamer H. Jamali, MD, FACC, a cardiologist at Interventional Cardiology Medical Group, holds an appointment as an Assistant Clinical Professor of Medicine at UCLA School of Medicine, and is affiliated with the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai. Dr. Jamali has been practicing medicine in the San Fernando Valley for over 16 years. He launched the first structural heart program in the valley, offering cutting edge procedures such as PFO/ASD closure, watchman, and minimally invasive aortic valve surgery to the local community. He has also served as Chief of Medicine and as Chief of Staff at West Hills Hospital. Additionally, Dr. Jamali serves as the Secretary of SBMAA, an international non-profit organization devoted to healthcare equality. Dr. Jamali graduated with highest honors from the University of California, Berkeley, attended the UCLA School of Medicine and chose Stanford University for his post-graduate training in Internal Medicine. He completed fellowships in General and Interventional Cardiology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where he also served as Chief Fellow. Dr. Jamali has published in multiple scientific journals, written textbook chapters, and presented at international cardiology conferences.\n\n**About Farhad Rafii, MD, FACC**\n\nFarhad Rafii, MD, FACC, a cardiologist at Interventional Cardiology Medical Group, is Clinical Assistant Professor of Medicine, Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California, Volunteer Faculty, and Clinical Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine, Western University of Health Sciences/College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific. Dr. Rafii joined Interventional Cardiology Medical Group in August 2013. He holds five board certifications and is a Diplomate of the American Board of Internal Medicine, Board of Cardiovascular Diseases, the National Board of Echocardiography, International Board of Heart Rhythm Examiners, and the Certification Board of Nuclear Cardiology. He graduated Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California class of 2007, completed his internal medicine residency at UCLA – Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles Medical Center, and subspecialty training at UCSF – Fresno Cardiology Fellowship program. He has been elected a Fellow of the American College of Cardiology. Dr. Rafii has co-authored and published multiple manuscripts and original research articles in major cardiovascular journals. His clinical interests include prevention and treatment of coronary artery disease and heart attacks, heart failure, disorders of heart valves and heart rhythm, cholesterol abnormalities, hypertension, and heart disease in women.\n\n**About Interventional Cardiology Medical Group (ICMG)**\n\nFounded nearly 40 years ago, ICMG’s community-based cardiology team of physicians, nurse practitioners, sonographers, radiation technologists, research staff and patient care coordinators have distinguished itself as the preeminent cardiology practice in the West Valley area (suburban Los Angeles, CA).\n\n**About Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia**\n\nAn estimated two million people in the United States are currently diagnosed with PSVT which is a type of arrhythmia or abnormal heart rhythm. PSVT is characterized by episodes of sudden onset rapid heartbeats often exceeding 150 to 200 beats per minute. The heart rate spike is unpredictable and may last several hours. The rapid heart rate often causes disabling severe palpitations, shortness of breath, chest discomfort, dizziness or lightheadedness, and distress, forcing patients to limit their daily activities. The uncertainty of when an episode of PSVT will strike or how long it will persist can provoke anxiety in patients and negatively impact their day-to-day life between episodes. The impact and morbidity from an attack can be especially detrimental in patients with underlying cardiovascular or medical conditions, such as heart failure, obstructive coronary disease, or dehydration. Many health care providers are dissatisfied with the lack of effective treatment options with patients often requiring prolonged, burdensome, and costly trips to the emergency department or even invasive cardiac ablation procedures.\n\n**About Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Rate**\n\nAn estimated five million Americans suffer from atrial fibrillation (AFib), a common arrhythmia marked by an irregular, disruptive and often rapid heartbeat. The incidence of AFib is expected to grow to approximately 10 million by 2025 and up to about 12 million by 2030. A subset of patients with AFib experience episodes of abnormally high heart rate most often accompanied by palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, and weakness. While these episodes, known as AFib-RVR, may be treated by oral calcium channel blockers and/or beta blockers, patients frequently seek acute care in the emergency department to address symptoms. In 2016, nearly 800,000 patients were admitted to the emergency department due to AFib symptoms where treatment includes medically supervised intravenous administration of calcium channel blockers or beta blockers, or electrical cardioversion. With little available data for AFib-RVR, Milestone's initial market research indicates that 30 to 40% of patients with AFib experience one or more symptomatic episodes of RVR per year that require treatment, suggesting a target addressable market of approximately three to four million patients in 2030 for etripamil in patients with AFib-RVR.\n\n**About Etripamil**\n\nEtripamil is Milestone's lead investigational product. It is a novel calcium channel blocker nasal spray under clinical development for frequent and often highly symptomatic episodes of PSVT and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate (AFib-RVR). It is designed as a self-administered rapid response therapy for patients thereby bypassing the need for immediate medical oversight. If approved, etripamil is intended to provide health care providers with a new treatment option to enable on-demand care and patient self-management. This portable, self-administered treatment may provide patients with active management and a greater sense of control over their condition. CARDAMYST™ (etripamil) nasal spray, the conditionally approved brand name for etripamil nasal spray, is well studied with a robust clinical trial program that includes a completed Phase 3 clinical-stage program for the treatment of PSVT and Phase 2 trial for the treatment of patients with AFib-RVR.\n\n**About Milestone Pharmaceuticals**\n\nMilestone Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq: MIST) is a biopharmaceutical company developing and commercializing innovative cardiovascular solutions to improve the lives of people living with complex and life-altering heart conditions. The Company’s focus on understanding unmet patient needs and improving the patient experience has led us to develop new treatment approaches that provide patients with an active role in self-managing their care. Milestone’s lead investigational product is etripamil, a novel calcium channel blocker nasal spray that is being studied for patients to self-administer without medical supervision to treat symptomatic episodic attacks associated with PSVT and AFib-RVR.\n\n**Contact:** Kim Fox, Vice President, Communications,[kfox@milestonepharma.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=GnrEFFTB6vsdH6TnbmPSwZk_H3mrDelrPdlBVHV2UXkv60Q8LYdMRSv6Mo9CMSoXB0wBMCAHebjRg_41H3mkmrXlGDesRseG8yBlpEO_U9I=)\n\nInvestor RelationsChris Calabrese,[ccalabrese@lifesciadvisors.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=h939YTPJB1WTus94hOKNiBFBrmcuOc8KbeRtE-QIvXrx4p-IYyPLhNr3ysawKRP47sRUGQ9HAIU4tY2MQ-Q8T3Uksak8d7PATTW6iDAfsjfhowDeVp_HV6G_r8A9oa8J)\n\nKevin Gardner,[kgardner@lifesciadvisors.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=aCzoHL-2WJ7SYqRyUj1kpHcHS4NZxNNTByQ20tk-qBvMeHB1yISkJtKSNkTwwCfnT5Ac1pSUCFIgbbuEXwc5jlKJExDSjJJ8Qrw-gCFK6BNcb09V5mz-jQz5eK24B1SE)\n\nSource: Milestone Pharmaceuticals Inc.\n\n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTIzNTM2NCM2NDkyMTQzIzUwMDEyMTAzNg==)![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/NTIxMzBkNWItNTlmNy00ZGY2LWE5YmMtYjAwY2NlNTk4NTE5LTUwMDEyMTAzNg==/tiny/Milestone-Pharmaceuticals-Inc-.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/49b2e16b-2deb-4c9e-9c20-6cc4fd6c15ab/small/milestone-pharmaceuticals-logo-png.png)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/49b2e16b-2deb-4c9e-9c20-6cc4fd6c15ab)\n\nSource: Milestone Pharmaceuticals Inc.\n\n[ Print Page ]()\n\n**Print Page**\n\n[ RSS Feeds ](/shareholder-services/rss-feeds)\n\n**RSS Feeds**\n\n[ Email Alerts ](/investor-resources/email-alerts)\n\n**Email Alerts**\n\n[ Investor Contact ](/investor-resources/investor-contact)\n\n**Investor Contact**\n\n[ Search ](/search)\n\n**Search**\n"
