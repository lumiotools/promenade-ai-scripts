Based on these results, we plan to submit a BLA and MAA in the first quarter of 2025 and are working diligently to prepare for the commercial launch of apitegromab, and if approved, to deliver the potentially transformative benefits of apitegromab to children and adults living with SMA.” \n\nDr. Backstrom continued, “The robust results from SAPPHIRE also reinforce the broader potential of our selective myostatin inhibition strategy across our pipeline, with potential readthrough to our cardiometabolic program as we evaluate apitegromab in obesity in our Phase 2 EMBRAZE proof-of-concept trial. We were pleased to announce in September that the EMBRAZE trial is fully enrolled, and we expect to report initial data in the second quarter of next year.” \n\n**Company Highlights and Upcoming Milestones**\n\n**SMA Program**\n\n**Apitegromab** is an investigational, fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits myostatin activation by selectively binding the pro- and latent forms of myostatin in skeletal muscle and is being developed as a potential first muscle-targeted therapy for the treatment of SMA. Apitegromab is the first muscle-targeted therapy to show clinical proof-of-concept in SMA. \n\n  * **Reported positive topline data from Phase 3 SAPPHIRE clinical trial**. The study achieved its primary endpoint demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement for apitegromab versus placebo in motor function as measured by the gold standard HFMSE in SMA patients on chronic dosing of standard of care therapies (either nusinersen or risdiplam). \n    * In the main efficacy population (ages 2-12), the mean difference in change from baseline in HFMSE was 1.8 points (p=0.0192) for all patients receiving apitegromab 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg (n=106) compared to placebo (n=50). Patients receiving 20 mg/kg of apitegromab (n=53) showed a 1.4 point mean difference compared to placebo (p=0.1149). \n    * The prespecified analysis of the 10 mg/kg dose showed that patients receiving 10 mg/kg of apitegromab (n=53) showed a mean difference in change from baseline in HFMSE of 2.2 points compared to placebo (nominal p=0.0121). \n    * Based upon PK/PD data from the SAPPHIRE trial, similar levels of target engagement were observed for the 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg dose groups. \n    * Scholar Rock plans to submit a U.S. BLA and a European Union MAA in 1Q 2025. \n  * **Presented preliminary baseline characteristics from SAPPHIRE during a poster presentation at the 29 th Annual Congress of the World Muscle Society in October in Prague, Czech Republic. **Analyses of the full Phase 3 SAPPHIRE data are ongoing, and Scholar Rock plans to present detailed results at an upcoming medical conference in early 2025. \n  * **The ONYX open-label, multi-center extension study remains ongoing.** The study is evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of apitegromab in patients who completed the TOPAZ or SAPPHIRE trials.More than 90 percent of patients on combination therapy in the TOPAZ trial have completed 4 years of apitegromab treatment and enrolled into ONYX. Following trial completion, 98 percent of SAPPHIRE patients (185/188) enrolled in the ongoing ONYX open-label expansion study. \n  * **On track to initiate OPAL clinical trial in SMA patients under two years old in mid-2025.**\n\n\n\n**Cardiometabolic Program**\n\n**SRK-439 **is a novel, preclinical, investigational myostatin inhibitor that binds to pro- and latent myostatin with high affinity and is selective for myostatin (i.e., no GDF11 or Activin A binding), and is initially being developed for the treatment of obesity. Based on preclinical data, SRK-439 has the potential to support healthier weight management by preserving lean mass during weight loss. \n\n  * **Completed enrollment of Phase 2 EMBRAZE proof-of-concept trial with apitegromab in combination with a GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) in obesity in September.** The Phase 2 trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study evaluating the safety and efficacy of apitegromab, a highly selective investigational myostatin inhibitor, to preserve muscle mass as an adjunctive therapy in overweight and obese adults who are taking a GLP-1 RA. Data are expected in the second quarter of 2025 and will be used to guide clinical development of SRK-439. The Company plans to file an IND for SRK-439 for the treatment of obesity in 2025. \n\n\n\n**Immuno-Oncology Program**\n\n**SRK-181** is an investigational selective inhibitor of latent TGFβ1 activation and is being developed with the aim of overcoming resistance to checkpoint therapy, such as anti-PD-(L)1 antibodies, in patients with advanced cancer. \n\n  * **New SRK-181 data from the Phase 1 DRAGON proof-of-concept trial presented at the SITC 39 th Annual Meeting in November. **The presentation, “DRAGON Trial: Durable remission rate with the latent TGFβ1 inhibitor linavonkibart (SRK-181) and pembrolizumab in patients with immune checkpoint inhibitor resistant advanced cancers,” highlighted new clinical and biomarker results. Highlights since the Company’s last update on the DRAGON trial include one additional complete response, seen in the clear cell renal cell (ccRCC) cohort (ORR=23.3%) and durable responses in multiple cohorts. Additionally, biomarker results continue to support proof of mechanism; new data shows suppressed granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (gMDSC) levels in the tumor microenvironment of responders. Notably new biomarker data in the ccRCC cohort supports a potential patient selection strategy with positive correlations between clinical response and baseline CD8+ infiltration status, elevated baseline Treg levels, and elevated baseline TGFβ1 levels in the tumor compartment. Enrollment of the DRAGON trial was completed in December 2023, and patients who remain on the study continue to be treated. \n\n\n\n**Other Corporate Updates**\n\n  * **Appointed Beth Shafer, Ph.D., to the newly created role of Chief Business Officer. **Ms. Shafer brings over 20 years of biopharmaceutical industry leadership and expertise to Scholar Rock, where she will drive the Company’s long-term corporate and business development strategy. \n  * **Raised $345 million in upsized follow-on offering.** In October, the Company completed an upsized follow-on offering raising aggregate gross proceeds of $345 million. \n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, net loss was $64.5 million or $0.66 per share compared to a net loss of $42.4 million or $0.53 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. \n\n  * The Company did not record any revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, or for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. \n  * Research and development expense was $48.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $30.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to costs associated with the ONYX and EMBRAZE trials, and the development of SRK-439. \n  * General and administrative expenses were $16.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $13.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to employee-related costs. \n  * As of September 30, 2024, Scholar Rock had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $139.1 million ($463.5 million, on a pro forma basis, including the approximately $324.4 million raised in the October 2024 equity offering). Along with cash available to the Company, runway is extended into 4Q 2026. \n\n\n\n“Supported by our recent upsized public offering on the heels of successful SAPPHIRE data, Scholar Rock is advancing our mission from a position of strength as we move forward with preparations for our first commercial launch in the fourth quarter of 2025,” said Ted Myles, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Scholar Rock. “We are working tirelessly to obtain approval for apitegromab and deliver it to patients with SMA as soon as possible, as well as continuing to advance our portfolio of highly selective myostatin inhibition programs.” \n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nManagement will provide an update on the Company and discuss third quarter 2024 results via conference call on Tuesday, November 12 at 8:15 am ET.
