          "content": "October 16, 2024 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\nGreat Southern Bancorp, Inc. Reports Preliminary Third Quarter Earnings of\n$1.41 Per Diluted Common Share\nPreliminary Financial Results and Business Update for the Quarter and Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024:\nSpringfield, Mo. – Great Southern Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:GSBC), the holding company for Great Southern\nBank, today reported that preliminary earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were $1.41\nper diluted common share ($16.5 million net income) compared to $1.33 per diluted common share ($15.9\nmillion net income) for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nPreliminary earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were $3.99 per diluted common share\n($46.9 million net income) compared to $4.52 per diluted common share ($54.7 million net income) for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023.\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, annualized return on average common equity was 11.10%,\nannualized return on average assets was 1.11%, and annualized net interest margin was 3.42%, compared to\n11.47%, 1.11% and 3.43%, respectively, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, annualized return on average common equity was 10.83%, annualized return on\naverage assets was 1.07%, and annualized net interest margin was 3.39%, compared to 13.15%, 1.28% and\n3.66%, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThird Quarter 2024 Key Results:\n• Significant or Non-Recurring Items:\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reduced its non-performing assets\nby $12.7 million, primarily through the resolution by sale of three unrelated non-performing assets. The\nCompany recorded a gain on the sale of these foreclosed assets of $459,000 in the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024.\n• Capital: The Company’s capital position remained strong as of September 30, 2024, significantly\nexceeding the thresholds established by regulators. On a preliminary basis, as of September 30, 2024,\nthe Company’s Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 11.0%, Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 12.3%, Tier\n1 Capital Ratio was 12.8%, and Total Capital Ratio was 15.5%. Total stockholders’ equity increased\n$40.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and the Company’s tangible common\nequity to tangible assets ratio was 10.0% at September 30, 2024. Retained earnings increased $23.6\nmillion during this same nine-month period. See “Capital” section for additional information regarding\nthe changes to total stockholders’ equity.\n• Liquidity: The Company had secured borrowing line availability at the FHLBank and Federal Reserve\nBank of $1.12 billion and $305.0 million, respectively, at September 30, 2024. In addition, at September\n30, 2024, the Company had unpledged securities with a market value totaling $370.0 million, which\ncould be pledged as collateral for additional borrowing capacity at either the FHLBank or Federal\nReserve Bank. Based partially on the foregoing, the Company believes it has ample sources of liquidity\nas of September 30, 2024.\n• Net Interest Income: Net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 increased $1.2 million (or\napproximately 2.6%) to $48.0 million compared to $46.7 million for the third quarter of 2023. Net\ninterest margin was 3.42% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.43% for the\n1\nquarter ended September 30, 2023. Net interest income and net interest margin in the second quarter\nof 2024 were $46.8 million and 3.43%, respectively.\n• Total Loans: Total outstanding loans, excluding mortgage loans held for sale, increased $121.7\nmillion, or 2.7%, from $4.59 billion at December 31, 2023, to $4.71 billion at September 30, 2024. This\nincrease was primarily in other residential (multi-family) loans with decreases in commercial\nconstruction loans, commercial business loans and one- to four-family residential loans. As construction\nprojects are completed, the loans either pay off or move to their respective loan categories, primarily\nmulti-family or commercial real estate.\n• Asset Quality: Non-performing assets and potential problem loans totaled $13.7 million at September\n30, 2024, a decrease of $5.4 million from $19.1 million at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024,\nnon-performing assets were $7.7 million (0.13% of total assets), a decrease of $4.1 million from $11.8\nmillion (0.20% of total assets) at December 31, 2023. Non-performing assets decreased $12.7 million\ncompared to June 30, 2024. The decrease in non-performing assets in the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, was mainly due to the sale of two foreclosed assets and the payoff of a $2.4\nmillion non-performing commercial real estate loan. The Company experienced net charge-offs of $1.5\nmillion in each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. See “Asset Quality” section for\nadditional information regarding the changes to non-performing assets.\nGreat Southern President and CEO Joseph W. Turner commented, “Our third-quarter results reflect solid\nearnings and a strong balance sheet, despite ongoing challenges in the broader economic and banking\nenvironment. We reported earnings of $1.41 per diluted common share, or $16.5 million in net income, for the\nthird quarter of 2024. This compares to $1.33 per diluted common share, or $15.9 million in net income, for the\nthird quarter of 2023 and $1.45 per diluted common share, or $17.0 million in net income, for the second\nquarter of 2024. These results highlight our ability to maintain stability and deliver consistent performance over\nthe long term, even as we face ongoing macro pressures. I'm proud of our team for their focus on operational\nexcellence and disciplined approach to managing our business.\"\nHe continued, “Net interest income increased $1.2 million, or approximately 2.6%, to $48.0 million, compared\nto $46.7 million for the third quarter of 2023. Our net interest margin was 3.42%, down slightly from 3.43% for\nboth the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023. While market conditions have increased deposit\ncosts, we've countered these headwinds with higher yields on loans and securities. Recent interest rate cuts\nby the Federal Reserve may help moderate some of the upward pressure on deposit costs, though we expect\nthe full effects of these rate changes to become more apparent in the coming months.”\nTurner remarked, “One of our important achievements this quarter was the significant reduction in non-\nperforming assets, which decreased by $12.7 million, bringing the total to $7.7 million, or 0.13% of total assets,\nat September 30, 2024. This reduction underscores our proactive management of credit risk and reflects the\nsuccessful resolution of two key non-performing assets. We did, however, record a $1.2 million provision for\ncredit losses in the quarter, as a result of charge-offs and growth in the loan portfolio. We do not believe this\ncharge is indicative of broader portfolio concerns, however, and we continue to view the commercial real estate\nloan market as a suitable option for potential growth.\"\nHe then noted, \"Our total loan portfolio, excluding mortgage loans held for sale, has increased by $121.7\nmillion, or 2.7%, since the end of 2023. This increase was driven primarily by growth in other residential (multi-\nfamily) loans, partially offset by declines in construction loans, commercial business loans, and one- to-four-\nfamily residential loans, as some construction projects were completed and transferred to other loan\ncategories. At the end of the third quarter of 2024, our pipeline of loan commitments and unfunded lines\nremained solid at more than $1.04 billion, despite a slight decrease from the previous quarter.\"\nRegarding expenses, Turner noted, \"Non-interest expenses decreased by $1.8 million, to $33.7 million,\ncompared to the third quarter of 2023. This reduction was primarily due to lower professional fees and gains\nfrom foreclosed asset sales.\"\nIn closing, Turner noted, \"We view our capital position as very important and a strength of our Company.\nStockholders' equity increased by $40.3 million year to date, to $612.1 million, representing a tangible common\nequity ratio of 10.0%. We continue to prioritize returning capital to our stockholders through dividends and\n2\nstrategic share repurchases. These actions reflect our ongoing commitment to delivering long-term value to\nstockholders. Our performance in the third quarter underscores our ability to navigate the challenges of the\ncurrent interest rate environment while maintaining strong liquidity and capital positions. We remain focused on\nprudent loan portfolio management, controlling deposit costs, and leveraging our strengths to deliver\nsustainable growth.\"\nSelected Financial Data:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\n(In thousands, except per share data) September 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet interest income $ 47,975 $ 46,738 $ 139,609 $ 148,068\nProvision (credit) for credit losses on loans and\nunfunded commitments 1,137 (1,195) 1,160 (2,140)\nNon-interest income 6,992 7,852 23,631 23,510\nNon-interest expense 33,717 35,557 104,548 104,738\nProvision for income taxes 3,623 4,349 10,647 14,325\nNet income $ 16,490 $ 15,879 $ 46,885 $ 54,655\nEarnings per diluted common share $ 1.41 $ 1.33 $ 3.99 $ 4.52\nNET INTEREST INCOME\nNet interest income for the third quarter of 2024 increased $1.2 million to $48.0 million, compared to $46.7\nmillion for the third quarter of 2023. Net interest margin was 3.42% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to\n3.43% in the same period of 2023 and the second quarter of 2024, a decrease of one basis point. In comparing\nthe 2024 and 2023 third quarter periods, the average yield on loans increased 52 basis points, the average\nyield on investment securities increased 26 basis points and the average yield on other interest earning assets\nincreased five basis points. The average rate on interest-bearing demand and savings deposits, time deposits\nand brokered deposits increased 34 basis points, 65 basis points and seven basis points, respectively, in the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The\naverage interest rate spread was 2.74% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.79%\nfor the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2.77% for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The\nratio of average interest-earning assets to average interest-bearing liabilities was 126.8% in the three months\nended September 30, 2024, compared to 131.0% in the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 126.7%\nin the three months ended June 30, 2024.\nNet interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased $8.5 million to $139.6 million,\ncompared to $148.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest margin was 3.39% in\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.66% in the same period of 2023, a decrease of 27\nbasis points. The margin contraction primarily resulted from increasing interest rates on all deposit types due to\nhigher market interest rates and increased competition for deposits. In comparing the 2024 and 2023 nine-\nmonth periods, the average yield on loans increased 47 basis points, the average yield on investment\nsecurities increased 21 basis points and the average yield on other interest earning assets increased 35 basis\npoints. The average rate on interest-bearing demand and savings deposits, time deposits and brokered\ndeposits increased 58 basis points, 125 basis points and 31 basis points, respectively, in the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average interest\nrate spread was 2.72% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.09% for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023.\nIn October 2018, the Company entered into an interest rate swap transaction as part of its ongoing interest rate\nmanagement strategies to hedge the risk of its floating rate loans. The notional amount of the swap was $400\nmillion with a contractual termination date in October 2025. As previously disclosed by the Company, on March\n2, 2020, the Company and its swap counterparty mutually agreed to terminate this swap, effective immediately.\nThe Company was paid $45.9 million, including accrued but unpaid interest, from its swap counterparty as a\nresult of this termination. This $45.9 million, less the accrued to date interest portion and net of deferred\nincome taxes, is reflected in the Company’s stockholders’ equity as part of Accumulated Other Comprehensive\n3\nIncome (AOCI) and is being accreted to interest income on loans monthly through the original contractual\ntermination date of October 6, 2025. The Company recorded $2.0 million of interest income related to the swap\nin both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended September 30, 2023. The\nCompany recorded $6.1 million of interest income related to the swap in both the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company currently expects to have\na sufficient amount of eligible variable rate loans to continue to accrete this interest income ratably in future\nperiods. If this expectation changes and the amount of eligible variable rate loans decreases significantly, the\nCompany may be required to recognize this interest income more rapidly.\nIn March 2022, the Company entered into another interest rate swap transaction as part of its ongoing interest\nrate management strategies to hedge the risk of its floating rate loans. The notional amount of the swap was\n$300 million, with a contractual termination date of March 1, 2024. Under the terms of the swap, the Company\nreceived a fixed rate of interest of 1.6725% and paid a floating rate of interest equal to one-month USD-LIBOR\n(or the equivalent replacement USD-SOFR rate once the USD-LIBOR rate ceased to be available). To the\nextent that the fixed rate exceeded one-month USD-LIBOR/SOFR, the Company received net interest\nsettlements, which were recorded as loan interest income. If one-month USD-LIBOR/SOFR exceeded the fixed\nrate of interest, the Company paid net settlements to the counterparty and recorded those net payments as a\nreduction of interest income on loans. As this interest rate swap has reached its contractual termination date of\nMarch 1, 2024, there have been no further interest income impacts related to this swap after that date. The\nCompany recorded a reduction of loan interest income related to this swap transaction of $1.9 million in the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company recorded a reduction of loan interest income related to\nthis swap transaction of $2.8 million and $7.5 million, respectively, in the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023.\nIn July 2022, the Company entered into two additional interest rate swap transactions as part of its ongoing\ninterest rate management strategies to hedge the risk of its floating rate loans. The notional amount of each\nswap is $200 million with an effective date of May 1, 2023 and a termination date of May 1, 2028. Under the\nterms of one swap, the Company receives a fixed rate of interest of 2.628% and pays a floating rate of interest\nequal to one-month USD-SOFR OIS. Under the terms of the other swap, the Company receives a fixed rate of\ninterest of 5.725% and pays a floating rate of interest equal to one-month USD-Prime. In each case, the\nfloating rate resets monthly and net settlements of interest due to/from the counterparty also occur monthly. To\nthe extent the fixed rate of interest exceeds the floating rate of interest, the Company receives net interest\nsettlements, which are recorded as loan interest income. If the floating rate of interest exceeds the fixed rate of\ninterest, the Company pays net settlements to the counterparty and records those net payments as a reduction\nof interest income on loans. The Company recorded a reduction of loan interest income related to these swap\ntransactions of $2.7 million in both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The Company recorded a reduction of loan interest income related to these swap\ntransactions of $8.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $4.4 million reduction\nof interest income in the 2023 nine-month period. At September 30, 2024, the USD-Prime rate was 8.00% and\nthe one-month USD-SOFR OIS rate was 5.16334%.\nThe Company’s net interest income in the third quarter of 2024 increased 2-3% compared to net interest\nincome in both the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023. Net interest margin was consistent in\neach of the three periods. The cost of deposits has been negatively impacted over several quarters by the high\nlevel of competition for deposits across the industry and the lingering effects of liquidity events at several banks\nin March and April 2023. The Company also had a substantial amount of time deposits maturing at relatively\nlow rates after the second quarter of 2023, and these time deposits either renewed at higher rates or left the\nCompany, in the latter case requiring their replacement with other funding sources at then-current higher\nmarket rates. Market rates for time deposits have recently declined as the FOMC has cut the federal funds rate\nby 50 basis points and signaled further rate cuts may occur. As of September 30, 2024, time deposit maturities\nover the next 12 months were as follows: within three months -- $537 million, with a weighted-average rate of\n4.53%; within three to six months -- $507 million, with a weighted-average rate of 4.07%; and within six to\ntwelve months -- $145 million, with a weighted-average rate of 3.20%. Based on time deposit market rates in\nSeptember 2024, replacement rates for these maturing time deposits are likely to be approximately 3.50-\n4.20%.\n4\nFor additional information on net interest income components, see the “Average Balances, Interest Rates and\nYields” tables in this release.\nNON-INTEREST INCOME\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, non-interest income decreased $860,000 to $7.0 million when\ncompared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of the following items:\n• Overdraft and insufficient funds fees: Overdraft and insufficient funds fees decreased $710,000\ncompared to the prior-year quarter. This decrease was primarily due to the continuation of a multi-year\ntrend whereby our customers are choosing to forego authorizing payments of certain items which\nexceed their account balances, resulting in fewer overdrafts in checking accounts and related fees.\n• Point-of-sale and ATM fees: Point-of-sale and ATM fees decreased $257,000 compared to the prior-\nyear quarter primarily due to a portion of these transactions now being routed through channels with\nlower fees to us, which we expect will continue in future periods.\n• Net gains on loan sales: Net gains on loan sales increased $292,000 compared to the prior-year\nquarter. The increase was partially due to an increase in balance of fixed-rate single-family mortgage\nloans sold during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. Fixed-rate single-\nfamily mortgage loans originated are generally subsequently sold in the secondary market. The\nCompany realized higher premiums on the sale of loans in the 2024 third quarter compared to the 2023\nthird quarter, as market interest rates were more stable in the quarter ended September 30, 2024\ncompared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, non-interest income increased $121,000 to $23.6 million\nwhen compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of the following items:\n• Overdraft and insufficient funds fees: Overdraft and insufficient funds fees decreased $2.1 million\ncompared to the prior-year period, for the same reason noted in the quarterly comparison above.\n• Point-of-sale and ATM fees: Point-of-sale and ATM fees decreased $966,000 compared to the prior-\nyear period, for the same reason noted in the quarterly comparison above.\n• Net gains on loan sales: Net gains on loan sales increased $998,000 compared to the prior-year\nperiod, for the same reason noted in the quarterly comparison above.\n• Other income: Other income increased $1.9 million compared to the prior-year period. In the second\nquarter of 2024, the Company recorded $2.7 million of other income, net of expenses and write-offs,\nrelated to the termination of the Master Agreement between the Company and a third-party software\nvendor for the conversion of the Company’s core banking platform. This termination was previously\ndisclosed in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. This\namount represented the elimination of certain deferred credits and other liabilities, along with the write-\noff of certain capitalized hardware, software and other assets, that previously had been recorded as\npart of the preparation to convert to the new core-banking platform.\nNON-INTEREST EXPENSE\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, non-interest expense decreased $1.8 million to $33.7 million when\ncompared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of the following items:\n• Legal, Audit and Other Professional Fees: Legal, audit and other professional fees decreased $1.0\nmillion from the prior-year quarter, to $809,000. In the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the\nCompany expensed a total of $39,000, compared to $903,000 expensed in the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, related to training and implementation costs for the intended core systems\n5\nconversion and professional fees to consultants engaged to support the Company’s proposed transition\nof core and ancillary software and information technology systems.\n• Expense on Other Real Estate Owned: Expense on other real estate owned decreased $598,000 from\nthe prior-year quarter, to a gain of $536,000 in the quarter ended September 30, 2024. In the third\nquarter of 2024, the Company recorded a gain on foreclosed asset sales of $459,000 compared to\n$22,000 in the third quarter of 2023.\n• Net occupancy expenses: Net occupancy expenses increased $409,000 from the prior-year quarter.\nVarious components of computer license and support expenses collectively increased by $369,000 in\nthe third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, non-interest expense decreased $190,000 to $104.5 million\nwhen compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of the following items:\n• Legal, Audit and Other Professional Fees: Legal, audit and other professional fees decreased $1.1\nmillion from the prior-year period, to $4.4 million. In the 2024 period, the Company expensed a total of\n$1.9 million, compared to $2.7 million expensed in the 2023 period, related to training and\nimplementation costs for the intended core systems conversion and professional fees to consultants\nengaged to support the Company’s proposed transition of core and ancillary software and information\ntechnology systems.\n• Expense on Other Real Estate Owned: Expense on other real estate owned decreased $453,000 from\nthe prior-year period, to a gain of $190,000. In the 2024 period, the Company recorded a gain on\nforeclosed loan sales of $491,000 compared to $41,000 in the 2023 period.\n• Net occupancy expenses: Net occupancy expenses increased $960,000 from the prior-year period, for\nthe same reason noted in the quarterly comparison above.\n• Salaries and employee benefits: Salaries and employee benefits increased $536,000, or 0.9%, from\nthe prior-year period. Much of this increase related to normal annual merit increases in various lending\nand operations areas.\nThe Company’s efficiency ratio for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was 61.34% compared to 65.13%\nfor the same quarter in 2023. The Company’s efficiency ratio for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nwas 64.05% compared to 61.04% for the same period in 2023. The Company’s ratio of non-interest expense to\naverage assets was 2.27% and 2.38% for the three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, compared to 2.49% and 2.45% for the three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2023,\nrespectively. Average assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased $249.6 million, or\n4.4%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, and average assets for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, increased $139.6 million, or 2.4%, compared to the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. Both increases were primarily due to growth in net loans receivable and available-for-\nsale securities.\nINCOME TAXES\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company's effective tax rate was 18.0% and\n21.5%, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company's effective tax\nrate was 18.5% and 20.8%, respectively. These effective rates were at or below the statutory federal tax rate of\n21%, due primarily to the utilization of certain investment tax credits and the Company’s tax-exempt\ninvestments and tax-exempt loans, which reduced the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company’s effective\ntax rate may fluctuate in future periods as it is impacted by the level and timing of the Company’s utilization of\ntax credits, the level of tax-exempt investments and loans, the amount of taxable income in various state\njurisdictions and the overall level of pre-tax income. State tax expense estimates continually evolve as taxable\nincome and apportionment between states are analyzed. The Company's effective income tax rate is currently\ngenerally expected to remain below the statutory federal tax rate due primarily to the factors noted above. The\n6\nCompany currently expects its effective tax rate (combined federal and state) will be approximately 18.0% to\n20.0% in future periods, primarily due to additional investment tax credits being utilized beginning in 2024.\nCAPITAL\nAs of September 30, 2024, total stockholders’ equity was $612.1 million (10.1% of total assets), equivalent to a\nbook value of $52.40 per common share. Total stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2023, was $571.8 million\n(9.8% of total assets), equivalent to a book value of $48.44 per common share. At September 30, 2024, the\nCompany’s tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 10.0%, compared to 9.7% at December 31,\n2023. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nIncluded in stockholders’ equity at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, were unrealized losses (net\nof taxes) on the Company’s available-for-sale investment securities totaling $29.1 million and $40.5 million,\nrespectively. This change in net unrealized losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nprimarily resulted from decreasing intermediate-term market interest rates which generally increased the fair\nvalue of investment securities.\nIn addition, included in stockholders’ equity at September 30, 2024, were realized gains (net of taxes) on the\nCompany’s terminated cash flow hedge (interest rate swap), totaling $6.4 million. This amount, plus associated\ndeferred taxes, is expected to be accreted to interest income over the remaining term of the original interest\nrate swap contract, which was to end in October 2025. At September 30, 2024, the remaining pre-tax amount\nto be recorded in interest income was $8.3 million. The net effect on total stockholders’ equity over time will be\nno impact, as the reduction of this realized gain will be offset by an increase in retained earnings (as the\ninterest income flows through pre-tax income).\nAlso included in stockholders’ equity at September 30, 2024, was an unrealized loss (net of taxes) on the\nCompany’s two outstanding cash flow hedges (interest rate swaps) totaling $6.4 million. Increases in market\ninterest rates since the inception of these hedges have caused their fair values to decrease. The unrealized\nloss position on these swaps improved substantially in the third quarter of 2024 due to a decline in market\ninterest rates in the quarter.\nAs noted above, total stockholders' equity increased $40.3 million, from $571.8 million at December 31, 2023\nto $612.1 million at September 30, 2024. Stockholders’ equity increased due to net income of $46.9 million in\nthe nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 and a $6.9 million increase in stockholders’ equity during\nthat period due to stock option exercises. Accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased $13.1 million\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to increases in the fair value of cash flow\nhedges and available-for-sale investment securities resulting from decreases in market interest rates. Partially\noffsetting these increases were repurchases of the Company’s common stock during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 totaling $12.5 million and dividends declared on common stock during that period of $14.0\nmillion.\nThe Company had unrealized losses on its portfolio of held-to-maturity investment securities, which totaled\n$19.2 million at September 30, 2024, that were not included in its total capital balance. If these held-to-maturity\nunrealized losses were included in capital (net of taxes), they would have decreased total stockholder’s equity\nby $14.6 million at September 30, 2024. This amount was equal to 2.4% of total stockholders’ equity of $612.1\nmillion at September 30, 2024.\nOn a preliminary basis, as of September 30, 2024, the Company’s Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 11.0%, Common\nEquity Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 12.3%, Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 12.8%, and Total Capital Ratio was 15.5%.\nOn September 30, 2024, and on a preliminary basis, the Bank’s Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 11.2%, Common\nEquity Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 12.9%, Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 12.9%, and Total Capital Ratio was 14.2%.\nIn December 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the purchase of an additional one million\nshares of the Company’s common stock. As of September 30, 2024, a total of approximately 488,000 shares\nwere available in our stock repurchase authorization.\n7\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 2,971 shares of its common\nstock at an average price of $53.04, and the Company’s Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash\ndividend of $0.40 per common share, which, combined, reduced stockholders’ equity by $4.8 million. During\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 239,933 shares of its common stock\nat an average price of $51.69, and the Company’s Board of Directors declared regular quarterly cash dividends\ntotaling $1.20 per common share, which, combined, reduced stockholders’ equity by $26.5 million.\nLIQUIDITY AND DEPOSITS\nLiquidity is a measure of the Company’s ability to generate sufficient cash to meet present and future financial\nobligations in a timely manner. Liquid assets include cash, interest-bearing deposits with financial institutions\nand certain investment securities and loans. As a result of the Company’s ability to generate liquidity primarily\nthrough liability funding, management believes that the Company maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy\nits depositors’ requirements and meet its borrowers’ credit needs.\nThe Company’s primary sources of funds are customer deposits, FHLBank advances, other borrowings, loan\nrepayments, unpledged securities, proceeds from sales of loans and available-for-sale securities and funds\nprovided from operations. The Company utilizes some or all of these sources of funds depending on the\ncomparative costs and availability at the time. The Company has from time to time chosen not to pay rates on\ndeposits as high as the rates paid by certain of its competitors and, when believed to be appropriate,\nsupplements deposits with less expensive alternative sources of funds.\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company had the following available secured lines and on-balance sheet liquidity:\nSe ptember 30, 2024\nFederal Home Loan Bank line $ 1,116.7 million\nFederal Reserve Bank line $ 305.0 million\nCash and cash equivalents $ 208.4 million\nUnpledged securities – Available-for-sale $ 344.3 million\nUnpledged securities – Held-to-maturity $ 25.5 million\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company’s total deposits increased $82.2 million.\nInterest-bearing checking balances increased $45.1 million (about 2.1%), primarily in certain money market\naccounts, partially offset by decreases in NOW accounts, while non-interest-bearing checking balances\ndecreased $13.5 million (about 1.6%). Time deposits generated through the Company’s banking center and\ncorporate services networks decreased $87.7 million (about 10.1%). Brokered deposits increased $140.4\nmillion (about 21.0%) through a variety of sources. The brokered deposits received during the three months\nended September 30, 2024 generally have a term of less than three months, so these funds may be able to be\nreplaced at a lower interest rate upon maturity, depending on market interest rates at the time.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company’s total deposits decreased $24.2 million.\nInterest-bearing checking balances increased $19.7 million (about 0.9%) and non-interest-bearing checking\nbalances decreased $38.8 million (about 4.3%). Time deposits generated through the Company’s banking\ncenter and corporate services networks decreased $141.6 million (about 15.3%). Brokered deposits increased\n$148.9 million (about 22.5%) through a variety of sources.\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company had the following deposit balances:\nSe ptember 30, 2024\nInterest-bearing checking $ 2,236.1 million\nNon-interest-bearing checking 856.7 million\nTime deposits 794.2 million\nBrokered deposits 810.4 million\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company estimated that its uninsured deposits, excluding deposit accounts of the\nCompany’s consolidated subsidiaries, were approximately $668 million (14% of total deposits).\n8\nLOANS\nTotal net loans, excluding mortgage loans held for sale, increased $121.7 million, or 2.7%, from $4.59 billion at\nDecember 31, 2023 to $4.71 billion at September 30, 2024. This increase was primarily in other residential\n(multi-family) loans ($628 million increase), partially offset by decreases in construction loans ($383 million\ndecrease), commercial business loans ($91 million decrease) and one- to four-family residential loans ($52\nmillion decrease). The pipeline of loan commitments increased in the third quarter of 2024. The unfunded\nportion of construction loans remained significant, but continued to decline, in the third quarter of 2024. As\nconstruction projects were completed, the related loans were either moved from the construction category to\nthe appropriate permanent loan categories or paid off.\nFor further information about the Company’s loan portfolio, please see the quarterly loan portfolio presentation\navailable on the Company’s Investor Relations website under “Presentations.”\nLoan commitments and the unfunded portion of loans at the dates indicated were as follows (in thousands):\nSeptember June 30, March 31, December December December\n30, 2024 2024 2024 31, 2023 31, 2022 31, 2021\nClosed non-construction loans with unused\navailable lines\nSecured by real estate (one- to four-family) $ 205,677 $ 200,630 $ 206,992 $ 203,964 $ 199,182 $ 175,682\nSecured by real estate (not one- to four-family) — — — — — 23,752\nNot secured by real estate – commercial business 120,847 122,685 120,387 82,435 104,452 91,786\nClosed construction loans with unused available\nlines\nSecured by real estate (one-to four-family) 79,554 109,153 103,839 101,545 100,669 74,501\nSecured by real estate (not one-to four-family) 477,741 570,621 680,149 719,039 1,444,450 1,092,029\nLoan commitments not closed\nSecured by real estate (one-to four-family) 20,622 21,698 20,410 12,347 16,819 53,529\nSecured by real estate (not one-to four-family) 118,046 33,273 50,858 48,153 157,645 146,826\nNot secured by real estate – commercial business 17,821 14,949 9,022 11,763 50,145 12,920\n$ 1,040,308 $ 1,073,009 $ 1,191,657 $ 1,179,246 $ 2,073,362 $ 1,671,025\nPROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nManagement estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external\nsources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit\nloss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss\ninformation are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as changes in\nunderwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level or term, as well as for changes in economic conditions,\nincluding but not limited to changes in the national unemployment rate, commercial real estate price index,\nconsumer sentiment, gross domestic product (GDP) and construction spending.\nChallenging or worsening economic conditions from higher inflation or interest rates, COVID-19 and\nsubsequent variant outbreaks or similar events, global unrest or other factors may lead to increased losses in\nthe portfolio and/or requirements for an increase in provision expense. Management maintains various controls\nin an attempt to identify and limit future losses, such as a watch list of problem loans and potential problem\nloans, documented loan administration policies and loan review staff to review the quality and anticipated\ncollectability of the portfolio. Additional procedures provide for frequent management review of the loan\nportfolio based on loan size, loan type, delinquencies, financial analysis, ongoing correspondence with\nborrowers and problem loan workouts. Management determines which loans are collateral-dependent,\nevaluates risk of loss and makes additional provisions to expense, if necessary, to maintain the allowance at a\nsatisfactory level.\n9\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded provision expense of $1.2 million on its\nportfolio of outstanding loans. During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Company did not record a\nprovision expense on its portfolio of outstanding loans. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the\nCompany recorded provision expense of $1.7 million on its portfolio of outstanding loans, compared to $1.5\nmillion in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Total net charge-offs were $1.5 million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, compared to net charge-offs of $99,000 in the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. Total net charge-offs were $1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,\ncompared to net charge-offs of $227,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months\nended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a negative provision for losses on unfunded commitments\nof $63,000, compared to a negative provision of $1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a negative provision for losses on\nunfunded commitments of $540,000, compared to a negative provision of $3.6 million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2023. General market conditions and unique circumstances related to specific industries\nand individual projects contribute to the determination of the level of provisions and charge-offs in each period.\nThe Bank’s allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.36%, 1.39% and 1.39% at\nSeptember 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2024, respectively. Management considers the\nallowance for credit losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the Bank’s loan portfolio at September 30,\n2024, based on recent reviews of the Bank’s loan portfolio and current economic conditions. If challenging\neconomic conditions were to last longer than anticipated or deteriorate further or management’s assessment of\nthe loan portfolio were to change, additional credit loss provisions could be required, thereby adversely\naffecting the Company’s future results of operations and financial condition.\nASSET QUALITY\nAt September 30, 2024, non-performing assets were $7.7 million, a decrease of $4.1 million from $11.8 million\nat December 31, 2023, and a decrease of $12.7 million from $20.4 million at June 30, 2024. Non-performing\nassets as a percentage of total assets were 0.13% at September 30, 2024, compared to 0.20% at December\n31, 2023. One loan relationship, totaling $9.3 million, was transferred from non-performing loans to foreclosed\nassets held for sale in the three months ended June 30, 2024 and was sold during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024. Another non-performing loan totaling $2.4 million was also resolved in the three months\nended September 30, 2024. As a result of changes in loan portfolio composition, changes in economic and\nmarket conditions and other factors specific to a borrower’s circumstances, the level of non-performing assets\nwill fluctuate.\nCompared to December 31, 2023, non-performing loans decreased $4.3 million to $7.5 million at September\n30, 2024. The majority of this decrease was in the non-performing commercial real estate loans category,\nwhich decreased $4.4 million from December 31, 2023. Compared to June 30, 2024, non-performing loans\ndecreased $3.5 million.\nCompared to December 31, 2023, foreclosed assets increased $240,000 to $263,000 at September 30, 2024.\nThe majority of this increase was in the commercial real estate loans category, which increased $230,000 from\nDecember 31, 2023. Compared to June 30, 2024, foreclosed assets decreased $9.2 million, primarily due to\nthe sale of one asset noted previously.\n10\nActivity in the non-performing loans categories during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was as follows:\nTransfers Transfers to\nBeginning Additions Removed to Potential Foreclosed Ending\nBalance, to Non- from Non- Problem Assets and Charge- Balance,\nJuly 1 Performing Performing Loans Repossessions Offs Payments September 30\n(In thousands)\nOne- to four-family construction $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nSubdivision construction — — — — — — — —\nLand development — 553 — — — — — 553\nCommercial construction — — — — — — — —\nOne- to four-family residential 1,147 41 (524) — — — (71) 593\nOther residential (multi-family) — — — — — — — —\nCommercial real estate 9,764 287 — — (230) (1,368) (2,351) 6,102\nCommercial business — 139 — — — — — 139\nConsumer 73 73 — — — (15) (35) 96\nTotal non-performing loans $ 10,984 $ 1,093 $ (524) $ — $ (230) $ (1,383) $ (2,457) $ 7,483\nAt September 30, 2024, the non-performing commercial real estate category included three loans, none of\nwhich was added during the current quarter. The largest relationship in the category, which totaled $6.0 million,\nor 98.6% of the total category, was added to non-performing loans during the second quarter of 2023 and is\ncollateralized by an office building in Missouri. The balance of this relationship was reduced by a charge-off of\n$1.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Another loan, totaling $2.4 million, which was\na purchased participation loan originally obtained through an FDIC-assisted acquisition, was collateralized by a\nlow-income assisted living facility in Wisconsin. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company initiated\nforeclosure on this collateral through a sheriff’s sale. The Company was outbid at the sale by another party.\nUnder the sale process in the State of Wisconsin, the buyer has a short period of time to provide the balance of\nthe sales proceeds to the court (10% of the sales price was placed with the court as non-refundable funds and\nwould be remitted to the Company should the buyer fail to complete the purchase). The judge has signed the\norder confirming the sheriff’s sale, and we expect this transaction will be completed in October 2024. The non-\nperforming one- to four-family residential category included four loans. The largest relationship in the category\ntotaled $525,000, or 88.6% of the category, and was added in the second quarter of 2024. The land\ndevelopment category consisted of one loan added during the current quarter. This loan is collateralized by\nimproved commercial land in the Omaha, Neb. area. The non-performing consumer category included six\nloans, three of which were added during the current quarter.\nPotential problem loans decreased $1.4 million, to $6.0 million at September 30, 2024 from $7.4 million at\nDecember 31, 2023. Compared to June 30, 2024, potential problem loans increased $385,000. The increase\nduring the quarter was primarily due to multiple loans totaling $502,000 being added to potential problem\nloans, partially offset by $51,000 in loan payments, $32,000 in loans moved to non-performing, $28,000 in\ncharge-offs and $6,000 in loans removed from the potential problem category.\nActivity in the potential problem loans category during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was as follows:\nAdditions Removed Transfers to\nBeginning to from Transfers Foreclosed Loan Ending\nBalance, Potential Potential to Non- Assets and Charge- Advances Balance,\nJuly 1 Problem Problem Performing Repossessions Offs (Payments) September 30\n(In thousands)\nOne- to four-family construction $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nSubdivision construction — — — — — — — —\nLand development — — — — — — — —\nCommercial construction — — — — — — — —\nOne- to four-family residential 326 378 — (32) — — (4) 668\nOther residential (multi-family) — — — — — — — —\nCommercial real estate 4,358 — — — — — (19) 4,339\nCommercial business 208 — — — — — (15) 193\nConsumer 713 124 (6) — — (28) (13) 790\nTotal potential problem loans $ 5,605 $ 502 $ (6) $ (32) $ — $ (28) $ (51) $ 5,990\n11\nAt September 30, 2024, the commercial real estate category of potential problem loans included three loans,\nall of which are part of one relationship and were added during the second quarter of 2024. This relationship is\ncollateralized by three nursing care facilities located in southwest Missouri. The borrower’s business cash flow\nwas negatively impacted by a labor shortage and a decrease in Medicaid reimbursement during 2022-2023.\nMonthly payments were timely made prior to the transfer to this category and have continued to be paid. The\none- to four-family residential category of potential problem loans included seven loans, three of which were\nadded during the current quarter. The largest relationship in this category totaled $154,000, or 23.0% of the\ntotal category. The commercial business category of potential problem loans included two loans. The largest\nrelationship in this category totaled $191,000, or 99.0% of the total category, and was added during the second\nquarter of 2024. The consumer category of potential problem loans included 13 loans, five of which were\nadded during the current quarter, including one home equity loan totaling $598,000 that is related to the\nnursing care facility relationship noted above.\nActivity in foreclosed assets and repossessions during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was as follows:\nBeginning ORE and ORE and Ending\nBalance, Repossession Capitalized Repossession Balance,\nJuly 1 Additions Sales Costs Write-Downs September 30\n(In thousands)\nOne-to four-family construction $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nSubdivision construction — — — — — —\nLand development 133 — (133) — — —\nCommercial construction — — — — — —\nOne- to four-family residential — — — — — —\nOther residential (multi-family) 9,279 — (9,279) — — —\nCommercial real estate — 230 — — — 230\nCommercial business — — — — — —\nConsumer 17 35 (19) — — 33\nTotal foreclosed assets and repossessions $ 9,429 $ 265 $ (9,431) $ — $ — $ 263\nAt September 30, 2024, the commercial real estate category of foreclosed assets consisted of one property\nwhich was transferred from non-performing loans during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as\nindicated above, and was subsequently sold in October 2024. The additions and sales in the consumer\ncategory were due to the volume of repossessions of automobiles, which generally are subject to a shorter\nrepossession process. The other residential (multi-family) category of foreclosed assets previously included\none property consisting of student housing in Texas, which was added during the three months ended June 30,\n2024, as indicated above. This property was sold in the three months ended September 30, 2024, with the\nCompany realizing a gain of $300,000.\nBUSINESS INITIATIVES\nSince early 2022, Great Southern had been preparing to convert to a new core banking platform (New System)\nto be delivered by a third-party vendor. As previously disclosed, the migration to the New System, originally\nscheduled for the third quarter of 2023, was delayed to mid-2024. In addition, as also previously disclosed,\ncertain contractual disputes arose between Great Southern and the third-party vendor. While discussions were\nongoing between the parties for an extended period of time, no meaningful progress was made in resolving the\ncontractual disputes.\nThe system migration efforts were beset by a variety of significant issues, including having missed a second\nconversion date because of continued operational and system problems. Therefore, Great Southern took the\nfollowing actions to protect its interests. On April 24, 2024, Great Southern informed the third-party vendor that\nit was terminating the Master Agreement between Great Southern and the third-party vendor in accordance\nwith Great Southern’s rights under the Master Agreement. In addition, on April 24, 2024, Great Southern\ninitiated legal action against the third-party vendor by filing a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the\nWestern District of Missouri, Southern Division. The complaint seeks to recover damages caused by the third-\nparty vendor’s material breach of the Master Agreement, inability and/or inaction on the part of the third-party\nvendor to effectively and timely manage the system migration, as well as the third-party vendor’s\nmisrepresentations and omissions. The third-party vendor filed a counterclaim alleging that Great Southern\n12\nterminated the Master Agreement without cause and that Great Southern must pay an early termination fee in\nan amount to be proven at trial. Great Southern denies the allegations in the third-party vendor's counterclaim\nand will vigorously defend itself. The parties continue informal settlement discussions, but there is no\nguarantee that the parties will reach a mutually agreed upon settlement to terminate the litigation.\nGreat Southern now expects to continue operations with its current core banking provider, which will allow\nGreat Southern to offer its full array of products and services.\nIn 2025, the banking center at Benton and Chestnut in Springfield, Mo. will be replaced with a newly-\nconstructed building on the same property at 723 N. Benton. Construction on the new building is anticipated to\nbegin in the first quarter of 2025, with completion in the fourth quarter of 2025. During construction, customers\nwill be served in a temporary facility on the property. The Company also has 11 other banking centers and an\nExpress Center in Springfield.\nKris Conley, Chief Retail Banking Officer, will retire in December 2024 after a notable career at Great Southern\nBank. He joined the company in 1998 and has led the retail banking division since 2010. During his tenure,\nGreat Southern expanded from 30 banking centers, mainly in southwest Missouri, to 89 banking centers\nacross six states. In early 2023, Conley announced his retirement plans to facilitate a smooth transition, with\nLaura Smith named as his successor. Smith, who has been with Great Southern since 2003, previously\nmanaged the Company’s investment services division.\nKelly Polonus, Chief Communications & Marketing Officer, will also retire in December 2024, concluding a\ndistinguished 41-year career in banking, including the last 22 years at Great Southern Bank. She announced\nher retirement in mid-2023 to ensure a seamless management transition. Succeeding Polonus will be Stacy\nFender, who joined Great Southern in June 2024 after serving 18 years in communications and marketing\nroles at a regional healthcare system.\nThe Company will host a conference call on Thursday, October 17, 2024, at 2:00 p.m. Central Time to discuss\nthird quarter 2024 preliminary earnings.

Thanks, Zack, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for our third-quarter earnings call. Our\nfinancial results reflect solid performance and the continued resilience of our operations despite the challenges in today's economic\nenvironment, particularly with fluctuating interest rates and broader macroeconomic pressures.\nWe earned $1.41 per diluted common share of $16.5 million in net income for the third quarter of 2024. This compares to $1.33 per\ndiluted common share last year in the same quarter and $1.45 in the second quarter of 2024. We also surpassed the $6 billion in\nasset mark during this quarter. These results, I think, demonstrate our ability to maintain solid earnings and a strong balance sheet.\nRegarding earnings performance, our annualized return on average assets was 1.11% during the quarter, and our annualized return\non average equity was 11.1% during the quarter.\nNet interest income increased by $1.2 million or 2.6% to $48 million compared to $46.7 million in the year-ago quarter. Our net\ninterest margin remained steady at 3.42% compared to 3.43% in the third quarter last year.\nThe continued pressure on our margin is primarily due to elevated deposit costs reflecting the competitive landscape for deposits\nand higher interest rate environment we've been operating in. We have seen some relief from the fed's recent rate cut but I think it's\nimportant to note that changes to our deposit costs will likely take time or this rate cut will likely take time to fully impact our funding\ncosts.\nAs we move forward, we will closely monitor how these rate adjustments influence deposit pricing and loan demand in the broader\neconomy. Though we expect these macroeconomic factors to present challenges, we are well prepared to navigate the current\nenvironment by focusing on disciplined asset and liability management.\nWe maintained moderate loan growth during the quarter, up $121.7 million for the year, I think we're up over $70 million in the\nquarter. This increase was primarily driven by expansion in our other residential loan segment, which was driven by completion of\nconstruction projects that transitioned into the permanent financing category.\nWhile we've seen some declines in construction and commercial business loans, which is reflective of ongoing economic\nuncertainties, our pipeline of loan commitments and unfunded lines remains solid at $1.04 billion at the end of September 2024. I\nthink this positions us well to continue supporting our customers and pursuing selective lending opportunities. For more information\nabout our loan portfolio, you can find our quarterly loan portfolio presentation on our Investor Relations site under the presentations\nlink and is also on file with the SEC.\nFrom a credit quality perspective, nothing really different than what we've said in the past about as good credit quality as we've ever\nhad. We actually did make significant strides to even improve it this quarter. Nonperforming assets decreased by $12.7 million,\nbringing our total nonperforming assets down to $7.7 million or 0.13% of total assets. That's down from 0.34% at June 30 and 0.20%\nat December 31, '23. The decline was largely due to the resolution of two significant nonperforming assets. Net charge-offs for the\nquarter were $1.5 million compared to $99,000 in the same period a year ago. The provision for credit losses of $1.2 million was\nrecorded in the quarter as a result of the charge-offs and growth in the loan portfolio. One of our charge-offs related to a loan\ncollateralized by an office building in the St. Louis, Missouri, suburb of Clayton, Missouri, which we discussed in previous filings.\nOur outlook on the broader portfolio, including the office portfolio remains positive and we continue to view the commercial real\nestate market as a key area for potential growth, especially as economic conditions stabilize.\nOur capital position continues to be strong. Stockholders' equity has increased by $40.3 million since December 31, 2023, bringing\nour TCE ratio to 10% from 9.7%. This increase reflects both strong earnings and our disciplined approach to capital management.\nWe remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends while growing book value per\nshare.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased 2,971 shares at an average price of $53.04, and we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per\nshare. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we've repurchased nearly 240,000 shares at an average price of $51.69\nand we declared quarterly dividends totaling over the three quarters, $1.20 per common share. These actions align with our long-\nterm strategy of delivering value to our shareholders while maintaining a strong capital base to support future growth.\nAs far as the economic environment, the economic environment remains complex with inflationary pressures easing but still above\ntarget, impacting consumer behavior and deposit growth. Recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve are expected to provide\nsome relief on deposit costs the full benefits may take time to materialize.\nCompetition for deposits, I think, has softened slightly. And while loan demand remained stable, we are closely monitoring credit\nquality as economic uncertainty continues. We remain focused on prudent risk management and disciplined capital allocation as we\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Rex Copeland, at this time.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nRex Copeland Great Southern Bancorp Inc - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer of Great\nSouthern and Treasurer of Bancorp\nAll right. Thank you, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll reiterate some of our financial results for the third quarter of 2024 and\nalso provide more detail on performance and operational metrics.\nAs mentioned before, net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $48 million, up $1.2 million or 2.6% from the same period\nlast year. This increase was driven primarily by higher loan yields, which rose by 52 basis points year over year and increased\naverage interest-earning assets.\nThe total interest earned on loans and investment securities improved during the quarter offsetting the continued upward pressure\non our deposit costs due to higher rates and changes in deposit mix compared to the prior-year period.\nOur net interest margin, as mentioned, remained stable at 3.42%. That was compared to 3.43% in both the second quarter of 2024\nand the third quarter of 2023. The stability of our margin despite the challenging deposit rate environment reflects our disciplined\napproach to balance sheet management, and proactive steps to manage the cost of funds.\nHowever, we continue to feel the impact of higher rates on interest-bearing liabilities with a 34-basis-point increase in interest-\nbearing demand deposit costs compared to the third quarter of 2023. The time deposit costs also increased by 65 basis points\ncompared to the prior-year quarter.\nYear to date, net interest income totaled $139.6 million down from $148.1 million in the same period in 2023. This reflects the\ngradual compression in margins across the year as deposit and other funding costs rose faster than asset yields in the second half\nof 2023 in the first half of 2024. We anticipate this trend to moderate slightly as the Federal Reserve's recent rate cuts take effect,\nalthough the full impact will be felt over time. We have noted that since the fed funds rate cut last month, our daily net interest\nincome and margins so far have not been negatively affected.\nTurning now to deposits. Our total deposits at the end of September 2024 were $4.7 billion, up from the previous quarter. The\ngrowth was primarily in brokered deposits and interest-bearing demand deposits which helped offset some of the decrease in retail\ntime deposit accounts.\nDuring the quarter, we renewed several large time deposits at rates that remain high, although we are seeing signs of stabilization in\nrecent months. and $300 million of our brokered deposits are floating rate tied to the effective fed funds, so those funding rates\nincrease or decrease in line with changes to the fed's funds rate.\nLooking forward, we have $537 million in time deposits maturing within the next three months with an average rate of 4.53%. As\nmarket rates have decreased after the fed reserve rate cut, we expect to replace those deposits at lower rates, possibly between\n3.50% and 4.20%.\nOur liquidity position remains robust with cash and equivalents of $208.4 million and access to additional funding lines through the\nFederal Home Loan Bank and the Federal Reserve totaling $1.42 billion we are well prepared to meet both current and future\nfunding needs.\nFrom a liquidity perspective, we are in a strong position with available secured funding lines through the Home Loan Bank and fed,\nas mentioned. In total, our on-balance sheet liquidity would equal about $2 billion as of September 30 2024.\nOur deposit base remains diverse by customer type and geography, and uninsured deposits account for roughly 14% of total\ndeposits, excluding internal subsidiary accounts. While deposit costs remain elevated, the pace of these increases has moderated\ncompared to earlier in the year. We expect this trend to continue as market conditions evolve, particularly with the recent shift in the\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

The decline was largely\ndue to reduced overdraft and insufficient fund fees which reflect the broader industry trend of customers choosing to forego\nauthorizing payments of certain items, which exceed their account balances, resulting in fewer overdrafts and checking accounts\nand related fees. We also saw a drop in debit card fee income. On the positive side, gains on loan sales were up by about $292,000\nand compared to last year's quarter, reflecting higher premiums on single-family mortgage loans, which we've originated for sale.\nOn noninterest expense, that total was $33.7 million down $1.8 million compared to the prior-year quarter. The decrease was mainly\ndue to lower professional fees and gains from selling foreclosed assets.\nLegal audit and other professional fees decreased $1.0 million from the prior year quarter as costs related to the proposed core\nsystems conversion are no longer being incurred. We realized $459,000 in gains from selling foreclosed assets during the quarter\ncompared to just $22,000 in gains in the same quarter last year. We also did experience, though, on the other side, an increase in\noccupancy expense of about $409,000, primarily due to technology-related costs as we continue to invest in our digital infrastructure\nand online security.\nOur efficiency ratio improved during the quarter, coming in at 61.34% and down from 65.3% in Q3 2023. This improvement reflects\nour continued efforts to manage expenses while investing in key business areas. For the three months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, the company's effective tax rate was 18.0% and 21.5%, respectively. These effective rates were near or below the\nstatutory federal rate of 21%, primarily due to the utilization of certain investment tax credits and the company's tax-exempt\ninvestments and tax-exempt loans, which reduced the company's effective tax rate. The company's current effective tax rate, both\ncombined federal and state, is expected to be approximately 18.0% to 20.0% in future periods, primarily due to the additional\ninvestment in tax credits being utilized beginning in 2024.\nFinally, talk a little bit about capital again. We ended the quarter with stockholders' equity of $612.1 million, an increase of $40.3\nmillion since the end of 2023. This brings our tangible common equity ratio to 10.0%, up from 9.7% at the end of 2023. We're also\npleased to report a strong increase in our book value per share which rose to over $52 up from about $49 in the previous quarter\nand $44.81 in the third quarter of last year.\nThis increase in book value resulted from both increased retained earnings and improvement in unrealized losses on our available-\nfor-sale investment portfolio and interest rate swaps. This growth underscores our commitment to enhancing shareholder value\nthrough both earnings performance and disciplined capital management.\nDespite the challenges posed by the competitive deposit environment and higher funding costs, we have continued to deliver solid\nfinancial results. Our focus on managing credit risk, controlling costs, and maintaining strong capital levels has positioned us well as\nwe navigate the remainder of this year. As we move forward, we remain committed to generating sustainable long-term value for our\nshareholders through prudent financial management and strategic capital deployment.\nThat concludes my remarks for today, and we're now ready to take any questions we may have.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions)\nAndrew Liesch, Piper Sandler.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nAndrew Liesch Piper Sandler Companies - Analyst\nI just wanted to touch on the margin here. So it sounds like you're getting some stabilization on the funding side. I know in the past,\nmaybe it's taken [a quarter or two] for rate changes that flow through to your margin but the tone sounds like NII and the margin are\npretty stable since the rate cuts. Or do you think there's an opportunity for expansion here in the fourth quarter? Or do you think\nwe've got to wait until 2025 for that?\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

We looked at what we knew we had as far as variable rate loans that would reprice with cuts. And we have on the\nother side of the balance sheet, we've got quite a bit of some interest rate swaps. We've got some, as I mentioned, some floating\nrate broker deposits, and we've got some short-term home loan bank advances, overnight advances, and that kind of thing.\nIn addition to that, we've got some shorter maturing brokered deposits. And as I mentioned, a little over $500 million of combined\nretail and brokered CDs that will mature in the next three months. And so we feel like we've gotten things sort of matched off there,\nAndrew, more than we had before. I don't know that we're going to say we're going to get to a point where we can reprice the\nliabilities faster than the assets by much so I think fairly neutral is how we see it in the near term at least.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nAndrew Liesch Piper Sandler Companies - Analyst\nGot it. That's very helpful.\nOn the expense front, it's kind of add back the gains that you had on the foreclosed assets and then take up some of the other one-\ntimers in the prior quarter. It looks like expenses were down by about $1 million to $34.25 million. Is that a good run rate going\nforward? Or do you think maybe they rise a little bit from there. This seems a little bit low to me.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nRex Copeland Great Southern Bancorp Inc - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer of Great\nSouthern and Treasurer of Bancorp\nYeah, I mean it was lower probably than what the expectations were. For sure, the cost that we have been incurring in previous\nquarters related to the proposed system conversion. That was about $900,000 or so a quarter, and those are not in there and\nshouldn't be going forward.\nWe probably had -- I mean, we, in other categories, we might have had $200,000 or $300,000 of other good news things that\nhappened in the quarter. They were all pretty small individually. I mean, not to give total guidance, but I think that we were pretty\nmuch on the low side on expenses in Q3 probably.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nAndrew Liesch Piper Sandler Companies - Analyst\nGot it. Very helpful. Thanks for taking the questions.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions)\nDamon DelMonte, KBW.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDamon DelMonte Keefe, Bruyette & Woods North America - Analyst\nSo first question just regarding credit. Nice to see the cleanup of a couple of credits and you're down to NPAs of, call it, 16 basis\npoints of loans in OREO. How do we think about the reserve at this point? There was some release this quarter, but that was\nprobably tied directly to those couple of loans that you moved off the books. Do you feel like a reserve in the [mid-130s] is good? Or\ndo you feel like you still have adequate excess reserves there that could bleed out over the coming quarters?\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

I wouldn't expect to see a lot of bleed out over the coming\nquarters.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nRex Copeland Great Southern Bancorp Inc - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer of Great\nSouthern and Treasurer of Bancorp\nAnd some of it will also depend on the level of loan growth that we have as well because we've got to reserve -- if we grow, we've\ngot to reserve for that upfront as it happens. So, like Joe, I think our reserve ratio has been fairly consistent and probably going to\nremain somewhat in that area.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDamon DelMonte Keefe, Bruyette & Woods North America - Analyst\nOkay. Great. And that kind of ties into the next question there about loan growth that you just mentioned there. The last couple of\nquarters where I think this quarter was 6.5%, maybe 4% linked quarter annualized in the second quarter. The year started off kind of\nslow.\nDo you think that you finished the year in the range of what we saw the last couple of quarters based on your pipelines? Or do you\nthink you just had some pent-up demand that hit the books in the middle part of the year, and it's going to kind of be a minimal\ngrowth here to end the year?\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nJoseph Turner Great Southern Bancorp Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer of Bancorp and\nGreat Southern Bank, Director\nAgain, we don't give guidance as to what loan growth is going to be just because a lot of it is beyond our control. We don't\ncompletely, we have a projection of what payoffs are going to be, but they can always surprise you a little bit, Damon. I mean, I think\nprobably something that if you just look at the nine months and look at how we've grown thus far, that would probably be the best\nprojection of what we might do to end up the year.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nOperator\nJohn Rodis, Janney.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nJohn Rodis Janney Montgomery Scott LLC - Analyst\nJoe, a question, I guess, on the buyback. You only bought back roughly 3,000 shares this quarter. Was that more a function of\nprice? Or I mean, capital continues to (multiple speakers) --\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nJoseph Turner Great Southern Bancorp Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer of Bancorp and\nGreat Southern Bank, Director\nThe price for the most part this quarter was a little higher. So I think that's probably it although our book value now has moved up\nand so there may be opportunity to buy back more here as we go forward.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nJohn Rodis Janney Montgomery Scott LLC - Analyst\nGood problem to have there.\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

We also thought it made some sense to take the opportunity to build up our capital a little bit to just have a little stronger\ncapital position, right?\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nJohn Rodis Janney Montgomery Scott LLC - Analyst\nOkay. that makes sense Rex\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nJoseph Turner Great Southern Bancorp Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer of Bancorp and\nGreat Southern Bank, Director\nWe have the sub-debt that's repricing in June, and we're going to be in a cash position to just pay that off if we want to. So like we\nsaid last quarter, John, we've got good uses for capital in lots of ways.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nJohn Rodis Janney Montgomery Scott LLC - Analyst\nJoe, maybe just big picture, your thoughts, any new markets that could be on the horizon for loan offices or your thoughts on M&A in\nthe current environment? You guys obviously haven't done anything in a while.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nJoseph Turner Great Southern Bancorp Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer of Bancorp and\nGreat Southern Bank, Director\nYeah, I mean, as far as loan production offices, we don't have anything necessarily on the drawing board. But our guys are in\ncontact with banks and good lenders across the country. And so if we saw a situation that made sense in a market that we were\ninterested in, we could do that very fairly easily. M&A, we're just not big, open bank M&A people.\nI mean we see the struggles in when banks buy other banks maintaining the revenue producers, and it seems like you wind up\ncompeting to keep the business that you pay for. And so never say never. If the right situation came up, we would be interested, but\nwe're going to be pretty selective about it, I would say.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nJohn Rodis Janney Montgomery Scott LLC - Analyst\nOkay, that, that makes sense. Joe, I hear you. So, thanks guys.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nOperator\nThank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Joe Turner, Chief Executive Officer, for\nclosing remarks.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nJoseph Turner Great Southern Bancorp Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer of Bancorp and\nGreat Southern Bank, Director\nAll right. Well, thanks everybody for joining our call today and we'll look forward to talking to you after the end of the year.
