(Nasdaq: ME), a leading human genetics and preventive health company, and Mirador Therapeutics, a next-generation precision medicine company focused on developing first-in-class or best-in-class therapeutics for immunology and inflammation (I&I)-related diseases, today announced a strategic research collaboration. Under the agreement, Mirador will leverage a targeted set of aggregated, de-identified genetic and phenotypic data from the 23andMe research database and its proprietary Mirador360™ development engine to enable target validation and precision medicine.\n\nThe 23andMe genetic and phenotypic health information database is the world’s largest crowdsourced platform for genetic research. Insights gleaned from the 23andMe database have resulted in previous pharma [_collaborations_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=7myEs3eg7Kfk6BYc8Sz8G3ZhTlD6Lpx955v0WJD9GBXA0pCFOy946Pp_-ORPgbGjBSRZBUfDz7wNOW6aU69-JzpI27GBQVGM-SA6m29fc4RGysW6SDrC4A9BDx8giYokOzlzW8ClpM1LLtwu_zV0TJ54ELWxruuCATDdjcdV6-8LwShZwgVHHX4NCcMrug9OFAExV7H33LDzBTYtpU3pZBPqkNQpcFY_kiFNqwfm_Q0=) that have generated multiple drug discovery programs, as well as two clinical stage assets in immuno-oncology, and more than 300 scientific publications. Mirador will use the 23andMe database to augment its proprietary Mirador360™ development engine, which already houses one of the most extensive repositories of immune-mediated disease data, including over two million human molecular profiles.\n\n“Our new partnership with 23andMe supercharges the Mirador mission to rapidly advance transformational precision therapies for patients living with chronic immune-mediated inflammatory and fibrotic diseases,” said Mark C. McKenna, Chairman and CEO of Mirador. “Combining Mirador360’s cutting-edge biology, multi-modal data and AI capabilities with the unparalleled genetic and phenotypic insights from the 23andMe database will enable us to accelerate our progress toward solving major unmet needs in I&I.”\n\n“Mirador is a pioneer in I&I precision medicine, and our collaboration harnesses the power of 23andMe’s data and research platform to identify new targets and develop promising new drugs,” said Anne Wojcicki, CEO and Co-Founder of 23andMe. “We hope this can ultimately help the millions of patients living with a range of I&I diseases who urgently need treatment options.”\n\n**Protecting participant privacy** 23andMe has strong privacy protections in place, and customers are in control of their data. Customers have the option to consent to participate in the 23andMe Research program, which is overseen by a third party Institutional Review Board (IRB) to ensure research being conducted meets the highest ethical standards. Only data from consented research participants is used for 23andMe research, and for those that choose to opt-in, their information is de-identified for research activities, meaning participants’ personally identifiable information such as name, age, sex and contact information is stripped from their genetic information, with the two sets of data stored separately. If a customer originally opted-in to participate in 23andMe’s Research program, they can easily withdraw at any time.\n\n**About 23andMe** 23andMe is a genetics-led consumer healthcare and therapeutics company empowering a healthier future.

(Nasdaq: ME), a leading human genetics and preventive health company, reported its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 (FY25), which ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Key Results:**\n\n  * Improved GAAP Net Loss by 21% and Adjusted EBITDA by 26% for the same period in the prior year (see important additional information below).\n  * The 23andMe comprehensive Total Health longevity service is now available to all customers, combining whole exome genetic sequencing with bi-annual lab tests for 55+ key blood biomarkers, and expert clinicians trained in genetics-informed preventive care and health action plans.\n  * Launched a GLP-1 weight loss telehealth membership on the Lemonaid Health platform that enables members to be prescribed and receive brand name or compounded semaglutide medications. Also launched and enrolled thousands of participants in a new study to understand how genetics can impact GLP-1 efficacy, side effects, and length of treatment.\n  * Launched a new genetic report on Emotional Eating, utilizing 23andMe’s polygenic risk score technology, for 23andMe+ Premium subscribers.\n  * Launched the first AI chatbot available to 23andMe customers, “DaNA,” to highlight key health and other important results for customers, making actionable insights easier to identify.\n  * Presented a new study demonstrating that using 23andMe Research data not only supports previous research that shows that targets supported by human genetics are 2 to 3 times more likely to succeed, but also uncovers many novel insights and can increase the relative rate of success even further.\n  * Published one of the largest and most diverse genetic studies of sickle cell trait, in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n  * Together with more than 20 lung cancer advocacy groups, launched a large-scale lung cancer study to investigate the genetics of the disease, aiming to enroll 10,000 patients; the effort has already enrolled more than 1,000 patients making it the largest study of its kind.\n\n\n\n**Recent Developments:**\n\n  * Reconstituted Board of Directors with the appointments of Andre Fernandez, Jim Frankola, and Mark Jensen.\n  * Regained compliance with Nasdaq listing requirements following Board appointments and completion of 1-for-20 reverse stock split.\n  * Commenced business restructuring to streamline operations, reduce costs and position the business for the future.\n\n\n\n“We are making significant progress to ensure the long-term success of the business as we continue on our mission,” said Anne Wojcicki, CEO and Co-Founder of 23andMe. “We have been focused on growing our subscription business by adding more value and driving greater engagement, and as a result we’ve more than doubled our membership services revenue from the prior year quarter. We will continue to prioritize driving recurring revenue through our subscription business, in addition to growing our research partnership business as we look to the future.”\n\n**Q2 Fiscal 2025 Financial Results** Total revenue for FY25 Q2 was $44 million, compared to $50 million for the same period in the prior year, representing a decrease of 12%. The decrease was primarily driven by lower consumer services revenue driven mainly by lower PGS kit sales volume and telehealth orders, as well as lower research services revenue as the GSK collaboration exclusive discovery term concluded in July 2023. These decreases were partially offset by growth in membership services revenue, which represented 21% of total revenue versus 9% in the prior year quarter, as the Company continues focusing on higher margin recurring revenue streams.\n\nOperating expenses for FY25 Q2 were $84 million, compared to $101 million for the same period in the prior year, a 17% decrease. The decrease in operating expenses for the quarter was driven by lower personnel-related expenses, including non-cash stock-based compensation expenses, following workforce reductions in the current and prior quarters, and the disposition of Lemonaid Health Limited in the UK in August 2023. The improvement also reflects lower Therapeutics-related R&D spend as we opted for a royalty on several GSK partnered programs, resulting in a significant reduction of GSK collaboration expenses compared to the prior year quarter.\n\nGAAP Net loss for FY25 Q2 was $59 million, a 21% improvement compared to a net loss of $75 million for the same period in the prior year.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA (as defined below) for FY25 Q2 was a loss of $33 million, a 26% improvement compared to a loss of $45 million for the same period in the prior year. The improvement in adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to lower R&D and personnel-related expenses, and improvements in consumer services gross profit, partially offset by lower research services gross profit. Please refer to the tables below for a reconciliation of U.S. GAAP to Non-U.S. GAAP financial measures.\n\n**Balance Sheet** 23andMe ended September 30, 2024 with cash and cash equivalents of $127 million, compared to $216 million as of March 31, 2024. 23andMe has no debt on its balance sheet.\n\nAs announced yesterday, the Company is restructuring the business by streamlining operations, reducing costs and positioning the Company for long-term success in the future. In addition, the Company is exploring raising additional capital and continuing to grow the research partnership business. These efforts will improve its financial condition and liquidity position to extend our cash runway.\n\n**Conference Call Webcast Information** 23andMe will host a conference call at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time today, November 12, 2024, to discuss the financial results for Q2 FY2025 and report on business progress. The webcast can be accessed at https://investors.23andme.com/news-events/events-presentations. A webcast replay will be available at the same address.\n\n**About 23andMe** 23andMe is a genetics-led consumer healthcare company empowering a healthier future.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, included or incorporated in this press release, including statements regarding 23andMe’s strategy, financial position, financial projections, funding for continued operations, cash reserves, projected costs, database growth, plans, and objectives of management, are forward-looking statements. The words \"believes,\" \"anticipates,\" \"estimates,\" \"plans,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" \"may,\" \"could,\" \"should,\" \"potential,\" \"likely,\" \"projects,\" “predicts,” \"continue,\" \"will,\" “schedule,” and \"would\" or, in each case, their negative or other variations or comparable terminology, are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words.

These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (many of which are beyond the control of 23andMe), or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained herein are also subject generally to other risks and uncertainties that are described from time to time in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including under Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and as revised and updated by our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. The statements made herein are made as of the date of this press release and, except as may be required by law, 23andMe undertakes no obligation to update them, whether as a result of new information, developments, or otherwise.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures** To supplement the 23andMe’s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets, which are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP), this press release also includes references to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as net income (loss) before net interest income (expense), net other income (expense), income tax expenses (benefit), depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, stock-based compensation expense, and other items that are considered unusual or not representative of underlying trends of our business, including but not limited to: litigation settlements, gains or losses on dispositions of subsidiaries, transaction-related costs, and cyber security incident expenses, net of probable insurance recoveries, if applicable for the periods presented. 23andMe has provided a reconciliation of net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to Adjusted EBITDA at the end of this press release.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by 23andMe’s management and the board of directors to understand and evaluate operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve 23andMe’s annual budget and to develop short- and long-term operating plans. 23andMe provides Adjusted EBITDA because 23andMe believes it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in its industry and it facilitates comparisons on a consistent basis across reporting periods. Further, 23andMe believes it is helpful in highlighting trends in its operating results because it excludes items that are not indicative of 23andMe’s core operating performance. In particular, 23andMe believes that the exclusion of the items eliminated in calculating Adjusted EBITDA provides useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of 23andMe’s business. Accordingly, 23andMe believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information in understanding and evaluating operating results in the same manner as 23andMe’s management and board of directors.\n\nIn evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future 23andMe will incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation. 23andMe’s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by these expenses or any unusual or non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies, including companies in the same industry, may calculate similarly-titled non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA as a tool for comparison. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-GAAP financial measures rather than net loss, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Some of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA include (i) Adjusted EBITDA does not properly reflect capital commitments to be paid in the future, and (ii) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the underlying assets may need to be replaced and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect these capital expenditures. When evaluating 23andMe’s performance, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including net loss and other GAAP results. Adjusted EBITDA is our best proxy for cash burn.\n\n**Contacts** Investors: investors@23andMe.comMedia: press@23andMe.com\n\n**23andMe Holding Co.****Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations
