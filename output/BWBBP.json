          "content": "Disclaimer\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis presentation contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements\nconcerning plans, estimates, calculations, forecasts and projections with respect to the anticipated future performance of the Company. These statements are often, but not always, identified by words such as “may”, “might”, “should”,\n“could”, “predict”, “potential”, “believe”, “expect”, “continue”, “will”, “anticipate”, “seek”, “estimate”, “intend”, “plan”, “projection”, “would”, “annualized”, “target” and “outlook”, or the negative version of those words or other comparable\nwords of a future or forward-looking nature.\nForward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding our business, future plans and strategies,\nprojections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are\ndifficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these\nforward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: interest rate\nrisk, including the effects of changes in interest rates; fluctuations in the values of the securities held in our securities portfolio, including as the result of changes in interest rates; business and economic conditions generally and in the\nfinancial services industry, nationally and within our market area, including the level and impact of inflation and possible recession; the effects of recent developments and events in the financial services industry, including the large-\nscale deposit withdrawals over a short period of time that resulted in recent bank failures; loan concentrations in our portfolio; the overall health of the local and national real estate market; our ability to successfully manage credit risk;\nour ability to maintain an adequate level of allowance for credit losses; new or revised accounting standards; the concentration of large loans to certain borrowers; the concentration of large deposits from certain clients, including those\nwho have balances above current Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance limits; our ability to successfully manage liquidity risk, which may increase our dependence on non-core funding sources such as brokered\ndeposits, and negatively impact our cost of funds; our ability to raise additional capital to implement our business plan; our ability to implement our growth strategy and manage costs effectively; the composition of our senior\nleadership team and our ability to attract and retain key personnel; talent and labor shortages and employee turnover; the occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches or failures of our or our third-party vendors’ information security\ncontrols or cybersecurity-related incidents, including as a result of sophisticated attacks using artificial intelligence and similar tools; interruptions involving our information technology and telecommunications systems or third-party\nservicers; competition in the financial services industry, including from nonbank competitors such as credit unions and “fintech” companies; the effectiveness of our risk management framework; the commencement and outcome of\nlitigation and other legal proceedings and regulatory actions against us; the impact of recent and future legislative and regulatory changes, including in response to recent bank failures; risks related to climate change and the negative\nimpact it may have on our customers and their businesses; the imposition of other governmental policies impacting the value of products produced by our commercial borrowers; severe weather, natural disasters, wide spread disease or\npandemics, acts of war or terrorism or other adverse external events, including the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and the Russian invasion of Ukraine; potential impairment to the goodwill the Company recorded in connection with\nrisks associated with our ongoing acquisition of First Minnetonka City Bank, including the possibility that the merger may be more difficult or expensive to accomplish than anticipated, diversion of management’s attention from daily\noperations and the effect of the proposed merger on the Company’s customer and employee relationships and operating results; changes to U.S. or state tax laws, regulations and guidance; potential changes in federal policy and at\nregular agencies as a result of the upcoming 2024 presidential election; and any other risks described in the “Risk Factors” sections of reports filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAny forward-looking statement made by us in this presentation is based only on information currently available to us and speaks only as of the date on which it is made. The Company undertake no obligation to publicly update any\nforward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. Certain of the information contained in this presentation is derived\nfrom information provided by industry sources. Although the Company believe that such information is accurate and that the sources from which it has been obtained are reliable, the Company cannot guarantee the accuracy of, and\nhave not independently verified, such information.\nUse of Non-GAAP financial measures\nIn addition to the results presented in accordance with U.S. General Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), the Company routinely supplements its evaluation with an analysis of certain non-GAAP financial measures. The Company\nbelieves these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the related GAAP measures, provide meaningful information to investors to help them understand the Company’s operating performance and trends, and to facilitate\ncomparisons with the performance of peers. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures\nthat may be presented by other companies. Reconciliations of non-GAAP disclosures to the comparable GAAP measures are provided in this presentation.\n2\n3Q24 Earnings Highlights\nDiluted Return on Return on Avg.

Earnings per diluted common share were $0.27 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to\n$0.26 for the second quarter of 2024, and $0.30 for the third quarter of 2023.\n“Bridgewater’s third quarter results were highlighted by robust core deposit growth and a stable net interest margin amid an improving\ninterest rate backdrop following the Fed’s rate cut in September,” said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jerry Baack. “As a result,\nwe generated improved net interest income and pre-provision net revenue growth. Asset quality also remained a strength as we continued\nto see improving multifamily trends in the Twin Cities, such as declining vacancy rates.\n“In August, we were excited to announce the signing of a definitive agreement for the acquisition of First Minnetonka City Bank, which\nwe expect to close during the fourth quarter of 2024. This deal brings several strategic benefits including a low-cost, core deposit base and\nbalance sheet optionality.

Core net interest margin (on a fully tax-equivalent basis), a non-\nGAAP financial measure which excludes the impact of loan fees, was 2.16% for the third quarter of 2024, a one basis point decline from\n2.17% in the second quarter of 2024, and an eight basis point decline from 2.24% in the third quarter of 2023.\n Net interest margin has remained stable at 2.24% each quarter in 2024.\n The year-over-year decline in the margin was primarily due to higher funding costs, offset partially by higher earning asset\nyields.\nNet interest income was $25.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $603,000 from $25.0 million in the second quarter of\n2024, and an increase of $178,000 from $25.4 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n The linked-quarter increase in net interest income was primarily due to increased cash balances, higher yields in the securities\nand loan portfolios and increased loan fees due to elevated loan payoffs, offset partially by decreased loan balances and higher\nrates paid on deposits.\n The year-over year increase in net interest income was primarily due to increased cash balances, growth and higher yields in the\nsecurities portfolio, and higher yields on loans, offset partially by growth and higher rates on deposits.\nInterest income was $63.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $2.1 million from $60.9 million in the second quarter of\n2024, and an increase of $6.2 million from $56.8 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n The yield on interest earning assets (on a fully tax-equivalent basis) was 5.48% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 5.41%\nin the second quarter of 2024 and 5.14% in the third quarter of 2023.\n The linked-quarter increase in the yield on interest earning assets was primarily due to continued repricing of assets at accretive\nyields.\n The year-over-year increase in the yield on interest earning assets was primarily due to the purchase of higher yielding securities\nand the repricing of the loan and securities portfolios in the higher interest rate environment.\n Loan interest income and loan fees remained one of the primary contributing factors to the changes in the yield on interest\nearning assets. The aggregate loan yield increased to 5.57% in the third quarter of 2024, seven basis points higher than 5.50% in\nthe second quarter of 2024, and 31 basis points higher than 5.26% in the third quarter of 2023.\n The core loan yield continued to rise as new loan originations and the existing portfolio reprice in the higher rate environment.\nA summary of interest and fees recognized on loans for the periods indicated is as follows:\nThree Months E nde d\nSeptember 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023\nInterest 5.47 % 5.42 % 5.31 % 5.25 % 5.16 %\nFees 0.10 0.08 0.07 0.08 0.10\nYield on Loans 5.57 % 5.50 % 5.38 % 5.33 % 5.26 %\nInterest expense was $37.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $1.5 million from $35.9 million in the second quarter of\n2024, and an increase of $6.0 million from $31.4 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n The cost of interest bearing liabilities was 4.27% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 4.19% in the second quarter of 2024\nand 3.81% in the third quarter of 2023.\n The linked-quarter increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to higher rates paid on deposits, offset\npartially by a decrease in the utilization of overnight borrowings.\n The year-over-year increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to continued deposit repricing in the\nhigher rate environment.\nPage 3 of 17\nInterest expense on deposits was $34.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $2.6 million from $31.6 million in the second\nquarter of 2024, and an increase of $7.0 million from $27.2 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n The cost of total deposits was 3.58% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 3.46% in the second quarter of 2024 and 2.99% in\nthe third quarter of 2023.\n The linked-quarter increase in the cost of total deposits was primarily due to continued client demand for higher interest rates and\nincreased competition.\n The year-over-year increase in the cost of total deposits was primarily due to upward repricing of the deposit portfolio in the\nhigher interest rate environment.\nProvision for Credit Losses\nThe provision for credit losses on loans was $-0- for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $600,000 for the second quarter of 2024 and\n$-0- for the third quarter of 2023.\n No provision for credit losses on loans was recorded in the third quarter of 2024. Although loans decreased during the quarter,\nincreased loss rates and other qualitative factor adjustments resulted in no provision for the quarter.\n The allowance for credit losses on loans to total loans was 1.38% at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.37% at June 30, 2024\nand 1.36% at September 30, 2023.\nThe provision for credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures was $-0- for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $-0- for the\nsecond quarter of 2024, and a negative provision of $600,000 for the third quarter of 2023.\n No provision was recorded during the third quarter of 2024 due to unfunded commitments remaining stable as the migration to\nfunded loans was offset by the volume of newly originated loans with unfunded commitments.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income was $1.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of $241,000 from $1.8 million for the second quarter of\n2024, and a decrease of $204,000 from $1.7 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n The linked-quarter decrease was primarily due to a net loss on sale of securities in the third quarter and a net gain on sale of\nsecurities in the second quarter.\n The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to $493,000 of FHLB prepayment income recognized in the previous year which\ndid not reoccur, offset partially by higher letter of credit fees, an increase in the cash surrender value of bank-owned life\ninsurance and an increase in other income.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense was $15.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $221,000 from $15.5 million for the second quarter of\n2024 and an increase of $523,000 from $15.2 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n The linked-quarter increase was primarily due to increases in professional and consulting fees related to the acquisition of First\nMinnetonka City Bank and salaries and employee benefits, offset partially by a decrease in data processing and derivative\ncollateral fees.\n The year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and employee benefits, higher professional and\nconsulting fees relating to the acquisition of First Minnetonka City Bank and increases in information technology and\ntelecommunications and marketing and advertising expenses, offset partially by a decrease in the FDIC insurance assessment and\nlower derivative collateral fees.\n The efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure, was 58.0% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 58.7% for the second\nquarter of 2024, and 56.1% for the third quarter of 2023.\n The Company had 265 full-time equivalent employees at September 30, 2024, compared to 258 at June 30, 2024, and 255 at\nSeptember 30, 2023.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective combined federal and state income tax rate was 23.6% for both the second and third quarter of 2024, compared to 23.0% for\nthe third quarter of 2023.\nPage 4 of 17\nBalance Sheet\nLoans\n(dollars in thousands) Se ptember 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 March 31, 2024 D ecember 31, 2023 Se ptember 30, 2023\nCommercial $ 493,403 $ 518,762 $ 483,069 $ 464,061 $ 459,854\nConstruction and Land Development 118,596 134,096 200,970 232,804 294,818\n1 -

Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nNote 1: Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nOrganization\nBridgewater Bancshares, Inc. (the “Company”) is a financial holding company whose operations consist of the\nownership of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Bridgewater Bank (the “Bank”). The Bank commenced operations in 2005\nand provides retail and commercial loan and deposit services, principally to customers within the Minneapolis-St. Paul-\nBloomington, MN-WI Metropolitan Statistical Area. In 2008, the Bank formed BWB Holdings, LLC, a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of the Bank, for the purpose of holding repossessed property. In 2018, the Bank formed Bridgewater\nInvestment Management, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank, for the purpose of holding certain municipal\nsecurities and to engage in municipal lending activities.\nRecent Developments\nOn August 28, 2024, the Company and First Minnetonka Bancorporation, Inc. (“FMB”) jointly announced the\nsigning of a definitive merger agreement under which Bridgewater Bank will, subject to the completion of remaining\nclosing conditions, acquire First Minnetonka City Bank, the wholly-owned banking subsidiary of FMB, in an all-cash\ntransaction. First Minnetonka City Bank operates two full-service branches and had approximately $241 million in\nassets, $129 million in loans, and $215 million in deposits as of September 30, 2024.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with instructions\nfor Form 10-Q and, therefore, do not include all disclosures necessary for a complete presentation of the consolidated\nbalance sheets, consolidated statements of income, consolidated statements of comprehensive income, consolidated\nstatements of shareholders’ equity and consolidated statements of cash flows in conformity with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (“GAAP”). However, all normal recurring adjustments which are, in the opinion of management,\nnecessary for the fair presentation of the interim financial statements have been included. The results of operations for\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results which may be expected\nfor the entire year. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes included in the\nCompany’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 7,\n2024.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThese consolidated financial statements include the amounts of the Company, the Bank, with locations in\nBloomington, Greenwood, Minneapolis (2), St. Louis Park, Orono, and St. Paul, Minnesota, BWB Holdings, LLC, and\nBridgewater Investment Management, Inc. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated\nin consolidation.\nUse of Estimates in Preparation of Financial Statements\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets\nand liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses\nduring the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Information available which could affect\njudgements includes, but is not limited to, changes in interest rates, changes in the performance of the economy,\nincluding elevated levels of inflation and possible recession, and changes in the financial condition of borrowers.\n9\nMaterial estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term include the\ndetermination of the allowance for credit losses, or ACL, calculation of deferred tax assets, fair value of financial\ninstruments, and investment securities impairment.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company enters into fair value hedge relationships to mitigate the effect of changing interest rates on the\nfair value of fixed rate available for sale securities. The gain or loss on a given derivative instrument, as well as the\noffsetting loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in current\nearnings. The gain or loss on the derivative instrument is presented on the same income statement line item as the\nearnings effect of the corresponding hedged item. The Company prepares written hedge documentation for all\nderivatives which are designed as hedges. The written hedge documentation includes identification of, among other\nitems, the risk management objective, hedging instrument, hedged item and methodologies for assessing and measuring\nhedge effectiveness and ineffectiveness, along with support for management's assertion that the hedge will be highly\neffective. For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, the Company assesses hedge effectiveness on qualifying\ninstruments using the shortcut method, whereby the hedges are considered perfectly effective at the onset of the hedge\nand over the life of the hedging relationship.\nImpact of Recently Issued Accounting Guidance\nIn March 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or\nASU, No. 2024-02, Codification Improvements: Amendments to Remove References to the Concepts Statements. The\nASU amends the Codification to remove references to various concepts and impacts a variety of topics in the\nCodification. The amendments apply to all reporting entities within the scope of the affected accounting guidance, but in\nmost instances the references removed are extraneous and not required to understand or apply the guidance. Generally,\nthe amendments in ASU 2024-02 are not intended to result in significant accounting changes for most entities. ASU\n2024-02 is effective January 1, 2025 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nSubsequent Events\nSubsequent events have been evaluated through October 31, 2024, which is the date the consolidated financial\nstatements were available to be issued.\n10\nNote 2: Earnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per common share are computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by\nthe weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per common share are\ncomputed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares,\nadjusted for the dilutive effect of stock compensation. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, stock\noptions and restricted stock units totaling 774,770 and 1,137,208 shares, respectively, were excluded from the\ncalculation because they were deemed to be anti-dilutive. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023,\nstock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units totaling 1,152,060 and 1,042,502 shares, respectively,\nwere excluded from the calculation because they were deemed to be antidilutive.\nThe following table presents the numerators and denominators for basic and diluted earnings per share\ncomputations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Mo nt h s Ended Nine Mon th s Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet Income Available to Common Shareholders $ 7,662 $ 8,616 $ 21,581 $ 28,047\nWeighted Average Common Stock Outstanding:\nWeighted Average Common Stock Outstanding (Basic) 27,382,798 27,943,409 27,486,590 27,853,036\nDilutive Effect of Stock Compensation 522,112 368,369 433,194 486,816\nWeighted Average Common Stock Outstanding (Dilutive) 27,904,910 28,311,778 27,919,784 28,339,852\nBasic Earnings per Common Share $ 0.28 $ 0.31 $ 0.79 $ 1.01\nDiluted Earnings per Common Share 0.27 0.30 0.77 0.99\nN ote 3: S ecurities\nThe following tables present the amortized cost and estimated fair value of securities with gross unrealized\ngains and losses at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nSeptemb er 3 0, 2024\nGross Gross\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized\n(dollars in thousands) Cost Gains Losses Fair Value\nSecurities Available for Sale:\nU.S. Treasury Securities $ 105,998 $ — $ (123) $ 105,875\nMunicipal Bonds 125,423 74 (13,610) 111,887\nMortgage-Backed Securities 218,550 4,287 (12,366) 210,471\nCorporate Securities 144,539 822 (7,254) 138,107\nSBA Securities 14,105 217 (56) 14,266\nAsset-Backed Securities 83,964 193 (48) 84,109\nTotal Securities Available for Sale $ 692,579 $ 5,593 $ (33,457) $ 664,715\nDecemb er 3 1, 2023\nGross Gross\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized\n(dollars in thousands) Cost Gains Losses Fair Value\nSecurities Available for Sale:\nMunicipal Bonds $ 151,512 $ 47 $ (19,035) $ 132,524\nMortgage-Backed Securities 249,455 2,261 (16,401) 235,315\nCorporate Securities 142,098 386 (11,879) 130,605\nSBA Securities 18,497 279 (102) 18,674\nAsset-Backed Securities 87,054 357 (425) 86,986\nTotal Securities Available for Sale $ 648,616 $ 3,330 $ (47,842) $ 604,104\n11\nSecurities with a carrying value of $150.4 million and $170.7 million were pledged to secure borrowing\ncapacity at the Federal Reserve Discount Window as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses of securities with unrealized losses,\naggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss\nposition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nLess Than 12 M onths 12 Months or Greater To ta l\nNumber of Unrealized Unrealized Unrealized\n(dollars in thousands, except number of holdings) Holdings Fair Value Losses Fair Value Losses Fair Value Losses\nSeptember 30, 2024\nU.S. Treasury Securities 1 $ 105,875 $ (123) $ — $ — $ 105,875 $ (123)\nMunicipal Bonds 169 — — 101,085 (13,610) 101,085 (13,610)\nMortgage-Backed Securities 113 12,988 (37) 120,465 (12,329) 133,453 (12,366)\nCorporate Securities 103 8,018 (114) 101,053 (7,140) 109,071 (7,254)\nSBA Securities 32 458 (1) 4,428 (55) 4,886 (56)\nAsset-Backed Securities 9 12,807 (26) 9,419 (22) 22,226 (48)\nTotal Securities Available for Sale 427 $ 140,146 $ (301) $ 336,450 $ (33,156) $ 476,596 $ (33,457)\nL ess Than 1 2 Months 12 Months or Greater To ta l\nNumber of Unrealized Unrealized Unrealized\n(dollars in thousands, except number of holdings) Holdings Fair Value Losses Fair Value Losses Fair Value Losses\nDecember 31, 2023\nMunicipal Bonds 212 $ 4,052 $ (17) $ 120,527 $ (19,018) $ 124,579 $ (19,035)\nMortgage-Backed Securities 128 35,719 (310) 135,829 (16,091) 171,548 (16,401)\nCorporate Securities 110 14,528 (756) 101,311 (11,123) 115,839 (11,879)\nSBA Securities 47 1,731 (3) 7,072 (99) 8,803 (102)\nAsset-Backed Securities 24 39,011 (234) 13,805 (191) 52,816 (425)\nTotal Securities Available for Sale 521 $ 95,041 $ (1,320) $ 378,544 $ (46,522) $ 473,585 $ (47,842)\nAt September 30, 2024, 427 debt securities had unrealized losses with aggregate depreciation of approximately\n6.6% from the Company’s amortized cost basis. At December 31, 2023, 521 debt securities had unrealized losses with\naggregate depreciation of approximately 9.2% from the Company’s amortized cost basis. These unrealized losses have\nnot been recognized into income because management does not intend to sell these securities, and it is not more likely\nthan not it will be required to sell the securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Furthermore, the unrealized\nlosses are due to changes in interest rates and other market conditions and were not reflective of credit events. To make\nthis determination, consideration is given to such factors as the credit rating of the issuer, level of credit enhancement,\nchanges in credit ratings, market conditions such as current interest rates, any adverse conditions specific to the security,\nand delinquency status on contractual payments.

The Company analyzes all loans individually to assign a risk rating, grouped into five major\ncategories defined as follows:\nPass: A pass loan is a credit with no known or existing potential weaknesses deserving of management’s close\nattention.\nWatch: Loans classified as watch have a potential weakness that deserves management’s close attention. If left\nuncorrected, this potential weakness may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the\nCompany’s credit position at some future date. Watch loans are not adversely classified and do not expose the Company\nto sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification.\nSubstandard: Loans classified as substandard are not adequately protected by the current net worth and paying\ncapacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified as substandard have a well-defined\nweakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the repayment of the debt. Well defined weaknesses include a borrower’s lack\nof marketability, inadequate cash flow or collateral support, failure to complete construction on time, or the failure to\nfulfill economic expectations. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain loss if the\ndeficiencies are not corrected.\n14\nDoubtful: Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with\nthe added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or repayment in full, on the basis of currently existing facts,\nconditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.\nLoss: Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and charged-off immediately.\n15\nThe following tables present loan balances classified by credit

The notional amount does not represent amounts exchanged by the parties.\nThe amount exchanged is determined by reference to the notional amount and the other terms of the individual\nagreements. Derivative financial instruments are reported at fair value in other assets or other liabilities. The accounting\nfor changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging\nrelationship and classification as either a cash flow hedge or fair value hedge for those derivatives which are designated\nas part of a hedging relationship. For derivatives not designated as hedges, the gain or loss is recognized in current\nearnings.\nNon-hedge Derivatives\nThe Company enters into interest rate swaps to facilitate client transactions and meet their financing needs.\nUpon entering into these instruments to meet client needs, the Company enters into offsetting positions with large U.S.\nfinancial institutions in order to minimize the risk to the Company. These swaps are derivatives, but are not designated\nas hedging instruments.\nInterest rate swap contracts involve the risk of dealing with counterparties and their ability to meet contractual\nterms. When the fair value of a derivative instrument contract is positive, this generally indicates that the counterparty or\nclient owes the Company, and results in credit risk to the Company. When the fair value of a derivative instrument\ncontract is negative, the Company owes the client or counterparty and therefore, the Company has no credit risk.\n20\nThe following table presents a summary of the Company’s interest rate swaps to facilitate customer transactions\nas of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nSeptembe r 30 , 20 24 Decembe r 31, 20 23\nNotional Estimated Notional Estimated\n(dollars in thousands) Amount Fair Value Amount Fair Value\nInterest rate swap agreements:\nAssets $ 66,189 $ 5,791 $ 63,814 $ 6,981\nLiabilities 66,189 (5,791) 63,814 (6,981)\nTotal $ 132,378 $ — $ 127,628 $ —\nCash Flow Hedging Derivatives\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the aggregate fair value of the\nderivative instrument is recorded in other assets or other liabilities with any gain or loss related to changes in fair value\nrecorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. The gain or loss is reclassified into earnings in the\nsame period during which the hedged asset or liability affects earnings and is presented in the same income statement\nline item as the earnings effect of the hedged asset or liability. The Company utilizes cash flow hedges to manage\ninterest rate exposure for the brokered deposit and wholesale borrowing portfolios. During the next 12 months, the\nCompany estimates that $5.1 million will be reclassified to interest expense, as a reduction of the expense.\nThe following table presents a summary of the Company’s interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges\nas of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\n(dollars in thousands) Se ptember 30, 2024 D e cember 31, 2023\nNotional Amount $ 183,000 $ 183,000\nWeighted Average Pay Rate 2.18 % 2.00 %\nWeighted Average Receive Rate 5.31 % 5.48 %\nWeighted Average Maturity (Years) 4.15 4.04\nNet Unrealized Gain $ 1,342 $ 5,271\nThe Company purchases interest rate caps, designated as cash flow hedges, of certain deposit liabilities.

The gain or loss on the derivative instrument is presented on the same income\nstatement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item. The Company utilizes fair value hedges to mitigate the\neffect of changing interest rates on the fair values of fixed rate available for sale securities.

Expected volatilities are based on an industry\nindex as described below. The expected term of options granted is based on historical data and represents the period of\ntime that options granted are expected to be outstanding, which takes into account the fact that the options are not\ntransferable. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in\neffect at the time of grant.

Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional\ndiscretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s financial\nstatements. Under capital adequacy guidelines, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that\ninvolve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory\naccounting practices. The Bank must also meet certain specific capital guidelines under the regulatory framework for\nprompt corrective action. The capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the\nregulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and Bank to\nmaintain minimum amounts and ratios of common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted\nassets and of Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets (referred to as the “leverage ratio”), as defined under the\napplicable regulatory capital rules.\n30\nThe following tables present the capital amounts and ratios for the Company, on a consolidated basis, and the\nBank as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nM inimum Re quired F or Capital A dequacy T o be Well Ca pitalized\nFor Capital Adequacy Purposes Plus Capital Under Prompt Corrective\nActual Purposes Conservation Buffer Action Regulations\n(dollars in thousands) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nSeptember 30, 2024\nCompany (Consolidated):\nTotal Risk-based Capital $ 589,088 14.62 % $ 322,278 8.00 % $ 422,990 10.50 % N/A N/A\nTier 1 Risk-based Capital 460,827 11.44 241,709 6.00 342,420 8.50 N/A N/A\nCommon Equity Tier 1\nCapital 394,313 9.79 181,281 4.50 281,993 7.00 N/A N/A\nTier 1 Leverage Ratio 460,827 9.75 189,109 4.00 189,109 4.00 N/A N/A\nBank:\nTotal Risk-based Capital $ 573,720 14.27 % $ 321,749 8.00 % $ 422,296 10.50 % $ 402,187 10.00 %\nTier 1 Risk-based Capital 525,114 13.06 241,312 6.00 341,859 8.50 321,749 8.00\nCommon Equity Tier 1\nCapital 525,114 13.06 180,984 4.50 281,531 7.00 261,421 6.50\nTier 1 Leverage Ratio 525,114 11.12 188,832 4.00 188,832 4.00 236,040 5.00\nM inimum Re quired F or Capital A dequacy T o be Well Ca pitalized\nFor Capital Adequacy Purposes Plus Capital Under Prompt Corrective\nActual Purposes Conservation Buffer Action Regulations\n(dollars in thousands) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nDecember 31, 2023\nCompany (Consolidated):\nTotal Risk-based Capital $ 570,770 13.97 % $ 326,872 8.00 % $ 429,019 10.50 % N/A N/A\nTier 1 Risk-based Capital 440,947 10.79 245,154 6.00 347,301 8.50 N/A N/A\nCommon Equity Tier 1\nCapital 374,433 9.16 183,865 4.50 286,013 7.00 N/A N/A\nTier 1 Leverage Ratio 440,947 9.57 184,383 4.00 184,383 4.00 N/A N/A\nBank:\nTotal Risk-based Capital $ 554,269 13.58 % $ 326,528 8.00 % $ 428,568 10.50 % $ 408,160 10.00 %\nTier 1 Risk-based Capital 503,787 12.34 244,896 6.00 346,936 8.50 326,528 8.00\nCommon Equity Tier 1\nCapital 503,787 12.34 183,672 4.50 285,712 7.00 265,304 6.50\nTier 1 Leverage Ratio 503,787 10.95 184,037 4.00 184,037 4.00 230,047 5.00\nThe Company and the Bank must maintain a capital conservation buffer, as defined by regulatory guidelines, in\norder to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments, stock repurchases and certain\ndiscretionary bonus payments to executive officers.\nNote 13: Fair Value Measurement\nThe Company categorizes its assets and liabilities measured at fair value into a three-level hierarchy based on\nthe priority of the inputs to the valuation technique used to determine fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the\nhighest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to\nunobservable inputs (Level 3). If the inputs used in the determination of the fair value measurement fall within different\nlevels of the hierarchy, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement. Assets and liabilities valued at fair value are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as\nfollows:\nLevel 1 – Inputs that utilized quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that\nthe Company has the ability to access.\nLevel 2 – Inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are\nobservable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial\n31\ninstruments. Fair values for these instruments are estimated using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar\ncharacteristics, or discounted cash flows.\nLevel 3 – Inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability, which are typically based on an entity’s own\nassumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity.\nSubsequent to initial recognition, the Company may re-measure the carrying value of assets and liabilities\nmeasured on a nonrecurring basis to fair value. Adjustments to fair value usually result when certain assets are impaired.\nSuch assets are written down from their carrying amounts to their fair value.\nProfessional standards allow entities the irrevocable option to elect to measure certain financial instruments and\nother items at fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The Company\nadopted the policy to value certain financial instruments at fair value. The Company has not elected to measure any\nexisting financial instruments at fair value; however, it may elect to measure newly acquired financial instruments at fair\nvalue in the future.\nRecurring Basis\nThe Company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and\nto determine fair value disclosures. There have been no changes in methodologies used as of September 30, 2024. The\nfollowing tables present the balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nS eptember 30 , 2 024\n(dollars in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nFair Value of Financial Assets:\nSecurities Available for Sale:\nU.S. Treasury Securities $ 105,875 $ — $ — $ 105,875\nMunicipal Bonds — 111,887 — 111,887\nMortgage-Backed Securities — 210,471 — 210,471\nCorporate Securities — 138,107 — 138,107\nSBA Securities — 14,266 — 14,266\nAsset-Backed Securities — 84,109 — 84,109\nInterest Rate Caps — 15,875 — 15,875\nInterest Rate Swaps — 9,594 — 9,594\nTotal Fair Value of Financial Assets $ 105,875 $ 584,309 $ — $ 690,184\nFair Value of Financial Liabilities:\nInterest Rate Swaps $ — $ 9,145 $ — $ 9,145\nTotal Fair Value of Financial Liabilities $ — $ 9,145 $ — $ 9,145\n32\nDecembe r 3 1 , 2023\n(dollars in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nFair Value of Financial Assets:\nSecurities Available for Sale:\nMunicipal Bonds $ — $ 132,524 $ — $ 132,524\nMortgage-Backed Securities — 235,315 — 235,315\nCorporate Securities — 130,605 — 130,605\nSBA Securities — 18,674 — 18,674\nAsset-Backed Securities — 86,986 — 86,986\nInterest Rate Caps — 18,717 — 18,717\nInterest Rate Swaps — 13,872 — 13,872\nTotal Fair Value of Financial Assets $ — $ 636,693 $ — $ 636,693\nFair Value of Financial Liabilities:\nInterest Rate Swaps $ — $ 8,601 $ — $ 8,601\nTotal Fair Value of Financial Liabilities $ — $ 8,601 $ — $ 8,601\nInvestment Securities\nWhen available, the Company uses quoted market prices to determine the fair value of investment securities;\nsuch items are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.\nFor the Company’s investments, when quoted prices are not available for identical securities in an active\nmarket, the Company determines fair value utilizing vendors who apply matrix pricing for similar bonds where no price\nis observable or may compile prices from various sources. These models are primarily industry-standard models that\nconsider various assumptions, including time value, yield curve, volatility factors, prepayment speeds, default rates, loss\nseverity, current market, and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments, as well as other relevant\neconomic measures. Substantially, all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace and can be derived from\nobservable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. Fair values\nfrom these models are verified, where possible, against quoted market prices for recent trading activity of assets with\nsimilar characteristics to the security being valued. Such methods are generally classified as Level 2. However, when\nprices from independent sources vary, or cannot be obtained or corroborated, a security is generally classified as Level 3.\nInterest Rate Caps\nThe fair value of the caps is calculated by determining the total expected asset or liability exposure of the\nderivatives. Total expected exposure incorporates both the current and potential future exposure of the derivative,\nderived from using observable inputs, such as yield curves and volatilities, and accordingly are valued using Level 2\ninputs.\nInterest Rate Swaps\nInterest rate swaps are traded in over-the-counter markets where quoted market prices are not readily available.\nFor those interest rate swaps, fair value is determined using internally developed models of a third party that uses\nprimarily market observable inputs, such as yield curves and option volatilities, and accordingly are valued using Level 2\ninputs.\nNonrecurring Basis\nCertain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets are not measured at fair value on\nan ongoing basis; however, they are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is\nevidence of impairment or a change in the amount of previously recognized impairment.\n33\nThe following tables present net credit losses related to nonrecurring fair value measurements of certain assets\nat September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nS eptemb er 3 0, 2024\n(dollars in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Loss\nIndividually Evaluated Loans $ — $ — $ 8,374 $ 946\nTotals $ — $ — $ 8,374 $ 946\nD ecemb er 3 1, 2023\n(dollars in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Loss\nIndividually Evaluated Loans $ — $ — $ 9,602 $ 199\nTotals $ — $ — $ 9,602 $ 199\nIndividually Evaluated Loans\nThe Company records certain loans at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Individually evaluated loans for\nwhich an allowance is established, or a write-down has occurred during the period, based on the fair value of collateral\nrequire classification in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the loan’s collateral is determined by appraisals,\nindependent valuation and other techniques. When the fair value of the loan’s collateral is based on an observable market\nprice the Company classifies the fair value of the individually evaluated loans within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.\nFor loans in which the valuation has unobservable inputs, the Company classifies these within the Level 3 of the\nvaluation hierarchy. As of September 30, 2024, collateral values were estimated using a combination of observable\ninputs, including recent appraisals, and unobservable inputs, including internally determined values based on cost\nadjusted for depreciation and customized discounting criteria on appraisals which ranged from 4-10%. Due to the\nsignificance of unobservable inputs, fair values of individually evaluated loans have been classified as Level 3.\nFair Value\nDisclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, for which it is practicable to estimate that\nvalue, is required whether or not recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. In cases where quoted market prices are\nnot available, fair values are based on estimates using present value of cash flow or other valuation techniques. Those\ntechniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimate of future cash\nflows. In that regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and,\nin many cases could not be realized in immediate settlement of the instruments. Certain financial instruments with a fair\nvalue that is not practicable to estimate and all non-financial instruments are excluded from the disclosure requirements.\nAccordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not necessarily represent the underlying value of the\nCompany.\nFair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information and information\nabout the financial instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for\nsale at one time the Company’s entire holdings of a particular instrument. Because no market exists for a significant\nportion of the Company’s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected\nloss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors.\nThese estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters that could affect the estimates. Fair value\nestimates are based on existing on and off-balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of\nanticipated future business. Deposits with no stated maturities are defined as having a fair value equivalent to the amount\npayable on demand. This prohibits adjusting fair value derived from retaining those deposits for an expected future\nperiod of time. This component, commonly referred to as a deposit base intangible, is neither considered in the above\namounts nor is it recorded as an intangible asset on the balance sheet. In addition, the tax ramifications related to the\nrealization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been\nconsidered in the estimates.\n34\nThe following tables present the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nSe pt e mber 30, 2024\nFair Value Hierarchy\nCarrying Estimated\n(dollars in thousands) Amount Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fair Value\nFinancial Assets:\nCash and Due From Banks $ 191,859 $ 191,859 $ — $ — $ 191,859\nSecurities Available for Sale 664,715 105,875 558,840 — 664,715\nFHLB Stock, at Cost 18,626 — 18,626 — 18,626\nLoans, Net 3,628,867 — 3,564,137 8,374 3,572,511\nAccrued Interest Receivable 16,750 — 16,750 — 16,750\nInterest Rate Caps 15,875 — 15,875 — 15,875\nInterest Rate Swaps 9,594 — 9,594 — 9,594\nFinancial Liabilities:\nDeposits $ 3,747,442 $ — $ 3,755,621 $ — $ 3,755,621\nNotes Payable 13,750 — 14,035 — 14,035\nFHLB Advances 349,500 — 349,690 — 349,690\nSubordinated Debentures 79,574 — 78,698 — 78,698\nAccrued Interest Payable 3,458 — 3,458 — 3,458\nInterest Rate Swaps 9,145 — 9,145 — 9,145\nD ec em ber 31, 2023\nFair Value Hierarchy\nCarrying Estimated\n(dollars in thousands) Amount Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fair Value\nFinancial Assets:\nCash and Due From Banks $ 128,562 $ 128,562 $ — $ — $ 128,562\nSecurities Available for Sale 604,104 — 604,104 — 604,104\nFHLB Stock, at Cost 17,097 — 17,097 — 17,097\nLoans, Net 3,667,215 — 3,579,583 9,602 3,589,185\nAccrued Interest Receivable 16,697 — 16,697 — 16,697\nInterest Rate Caps 18,717 — 18,717 — 18,717\nInterest Rate Swaps 13,872 — 13,872 — 13,872\nFinancial Liabilities:\nDeposits $ 3,709,948 $ — $ 3,709,086 $ — $ 3,709,086\nNotes Payable 13,750 — 13,805 — 13,805\nFHLB Advances 319,500 — 319,305 — 319,305\nSubordinated Debentures 79,288 — 77,557 — 77,557\nAccrued Interest Payable 5,282 — 5,282 — 5,282\nInterest Rate Swaps 8,601 — 8,601 — 8,601\nThe following methods and assumptions were used by the Company to estimate fair value of financial\ninstruments not previously discussed.\nCash and due from banks – The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates their fair value.\nFHLB stock – The carrying amount of FHLB stock approximates its fair value.\nLoans, net – Fair values for loans are estimated based on discounted cash flows, using interest rates currently\nbeing offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers with similar credit quality.\n35\nAccrued interest receivable – The carrying amount of accrued interest receivable approximates its fair value\nsince it is short term in nature and does not present anticipated credit concerns.\nDeposits – The fair values disclosed for demand deposits without stated maturities (interest and noninterest\ntransaction, savings, and money market accounts) are equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (their\ncarrying amounts). Fair values for the fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow\ncalculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly\nmaturities on time deposits.\nNotes payable and subordinated debentures – The fair values of the Company’s notes payable and subordinated\ndebentures are estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, based on the Company’s current incremental borrowing\nrate for similar types of borrowing arrangements.\nFHLB advances – The fair values of the Company’s FHLB advances are estimated using discounted cash flow\nanalysis based on the Company’s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing agreements.\nAccrued interest payable – The carrying amount of accrued interest payable approximates its fair value since it\nis short term in nature.\nOff-balance sheet instruments – Fair values of the Company’s off-balance sheet instruments (lending\ncommitments and unused lines of credit) are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into\naccount the remaining terms of the agreements, the counterparties’ credit standing and discounted cash flow analysis.\nThe fair value of these off-balance sheet items approximates the recorded amounts of the related fees and was not\nmaterial at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nLimitations – The fair value of a financial instrument is the current amount that would be exchanged between\nmarket participants, other than in a forced liquidation. Fair value is best determined based upon quoted market prices.\nHowever, in many instances, there are no quoted market prices for the Company’s various financial instruments. In cases\nwhere quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation\ntechniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and\nestimates of future cash flows. Accordingly, the fair value estimates may not be realized in an immediate settlement of\nthe instrument. Consequently, the aggregate fair value amounts presented may not necessarily represent the underlying\nfair value of the Company.\n36\nNote 14: Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\nThe following tables present the components of other comprehensive income for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n(dollars in thousands) B efore Tax T ax Effect N et of Tax\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\nNet Unrealized Gain on Available for Sale Securities $ 14,738 $ (4,236) $ 10,502\nLess: Reclassification Adjustment for Net Losses Included in Net Income 28 (8) 20\nTotal Unrealized Gain 14,766 (4,244) 10,522\nNet Unrealized Loss on Cash Flow Hedge (6,761) 1,943 (4,818)\nLess: Reclassification Adjustment for Gains Included in Net Income (2,526) 726 (1,800)\nTotal Unrealized Loss (9,287) 2,669 (6,618)\nOther Comprehensive Income $ 5,479 $ (1,575) $ 3,904\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2023\nNet Unrealized Loss on Available for Sale Securities $ (10,151) $ 2,917 $ (7,234)\nLess: Reclassification Adjustment for Net Gains Included in Net Income — — —\nTotal Unrealized Loss (10,151) 2,917 (7,234)\nNet Unrealized Gain on Cash Flow Hedge 7,763 (2,231) 5,532\nLess: Reclassification Adjustment for Gains Included in Net Income (1,623) 467 (1,156)\nTotal Unrealized Gain 6,140 (1,764) 4,376\nOther Comprehensive Loss $ (4,011) $ 1,153 $ (2,858)\n(dollars in thousands) B efore Tax T ax Effect N et of Tax\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nNet Unrealized Gain on Available for Sale Securities $ 16,141 $ (4,639) $ 11,502\nLess: Reclassification Adjustment for Net Gains Included in Net Income (385) 111 (274)\nTotal Unrealized Gain 15,756 (4,528) 11,228\nNet Unrealized Gain on Cash Flow Hedge 987 (284) 703\nLess: Reclassification Adjustment for Gains Included in Net Income (7,158) 2,057 (5,101)\nTotal Unrealized Loss (6,171) 1,773 (4,398)\nOther Comprehensive Income $ 9,585 $ (2,755) $ 6,830\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nNet Unrealized Loss on Available for Sale Securities $ (14,338) $ 4,121 $ (10,217)\nLess: Reclassification Adjustment for Net Losses Included in Net Income 6 (2) 4\nTotal Unrealized Loss (14,332) 4,119 (10,213)\nNet Unrealized Gain on Cash Flow Hedge 10,167 (2,921) 7,246\nLess: Reclassification Adjustment for Gains Included in Net Income (4,010) 1,153 (2,857)\nTotal Unrealized Gain 6,157 (1,768) 4,389\nOther Comprehensive Loss $ (8,175) $ 2,351 $ (5,824)\n37\nThe following tables present the changes in each component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net\nof tax, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nAccumulated\nAvailable For Other Comprehensive\n(dollars in thousands) Sale Securities Cash Flow Hedge Income (Loss)\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\nBalance at Beginning of Period $ (31,014) $ 15,694 $ (15,320)\nOther Comprehensive Income Before Reclassifications 10,502 (4,818) 5,684\nAmounts Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive\nIncome 20 (1,800) (1,780)\nNet Other Comprehensive Income During Period 10,522 (6,618) 3,904\nBalance at End of Period $ (20,492) $ 9,076 $ (11,416)\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2023\nBalance at Beginning of Period $ (37,103) $ 16,195 $ (20,908)\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss) Before Reclassifications (7,234) 5,532 (1,702)\nAmounts Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive\nIncome — (1,156) (1,156)\nNet Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) During Period (7,234) 4,376 (2,858)\nBalance at End of Period $ (44,337) $ 20,571 $ (23,766)\nAccumulated\nAvailable For Other Comprehensive\n(dollars in thousands) Sale Securities Cash Flow Hedge Income (Loss)\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nBalance at Beginning of Period $ (31,720) $ 13,474 $ (18,246)\nOther Comprehensive Income Before Reclassifications 11,502 703 12,205\nAmounts Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive\nIncome (274) (5,101) (5,375)\nNet Other Comprehensive Income During Period 11,228 (4,398) 6,830\nBalance at End of Period $ (20,492) $ 9,076 $ (11,416)\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nBalance at Beginning of Period $ (34,124) $ 16,182 $ (17,942)\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss) Before Reclassifications (10,217) 7,246 (2,971)\nAmounts Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive\nIncome 4 (2,857) (2,853)\nNet Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) During Period (10,213) 4,389 (5,824)\nBalance at End of Period $ (44,337) $ 20,571 $ (23,766)\nNote 15: Subsequent Events\nOn October 23, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors announced a quarterly cash dividend of $36.72 per\nshare ($0.3672 per depositary share) on its 5.875% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (“Series A\nPreferred Stock”), payable on December 2, 2024, to shareholders of record on the Series A Preferred Stock at the close\nof business on November 15, 2024.\n38\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nThe following discussion explains the Company’s financial condition and results of operations as of and for the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Annualized results for these interim periods may not be indicative of\nresults for the full year or future periods. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the\nconsolidated financial statements and related notes presented elsewhere in this report and the Company’s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the\nSEC, on March 7, 2024.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe\nharbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include,\nwithout limitation, statements concerning plans, estimates, calculations, forecasts and projections with respect to the\nanticipated future performance of the Company. These statements are often, but not always, identified by words such as\n“may”, “might”, “should”, “could”, “predict”, “potential”, “believe”, “expect”, “continue”, “will”, “anticipate”, “seek”,\n“estimate”, “intend”, “plan”, “projection”, “would”, “annualized”, “target” and “outlook”, or the negative version of\nthose words or other comparable words of a future or forward-looking nature. Forward-looking statements are neither\nhistorical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations\nand assumptions regarding our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the\neconomy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to\ninherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of\nour control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking\nstatements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could\ncause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking\nstatements include, among others, the following:\n interest rate risk, including the effects of changes in the interest rate environment;\n fluctuations in the values of the securities held in our securities portfolio, including as the result of\nchanges in interest rates;\n business and economic conditions generally and in the financial services industry, nationally and\nwithin our market area, including the level and impact of inflation and possible recession;\n the effects of developments and events in the financial services industry, including the large-scale\ndeposit withdrawals over a short period of time that resulted in recent bank failures;\n loan concentrations in our loan portfolio;\n the overall health of the local and national real estate market;\n the ability to successfully manage credit risk;\n the ability to maintain an adequate level of allowance for credit losses on loans;\n new or revised accounting standards;\n the concentration of large loans to certain borrowers;\n the concentration of large deposits from certain clients, including those who have balances above\ncurrent Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance limits;\n the ability to successfully manage liquidity risk, which may increase the dependence on non-core\nfunding sources such as brokered deposits, and negatively impact our cost of funds;\n the ability to raise additional capital to implement our business plan;\n the ability to implement our growth strategy and manage costs effectively;\n the composition of the Company’s senior leadership team and the ability to attract and retain key\npersonnel;\n39\n talent and labor shortages and employee turnover;\n the occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches or failures of our third party vendors’ information\nsecurity controls or cybersecurity-related incidents, including as a result of sophisticated attacks using\nartificial intelligence and similar tools;\n interruptions involving our information technology and telecommunications systems or third-party\nservicers;\n competition in the financial services industry, including from nonbank competitors such as credit\nunions and “fintech” companies;\n the effectiveness of the risk management framework;\n the commencement and outcome of litigation and other legal proceedings and regulatory actions\nagainst us;\n the impact of recent and future legislative and regulatory changes, including in response to recent bank\nfailures;\n risks related to climate change and the negative impact it may have on our clients and their businesses;\n the imposition of other governmental policies impacting the value of products produced by our\ncommercial borrowers;\n severe weather, natural disasters, wide spread disease or pandemics, acts of war or terrorism, or other\nadverse external events, including the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and the Russian invasion of\nUkraine;\n potential impairment to the goodwill the Company recorded in connection with acquisitions;\n the risks associated with our ongoing acquisition of First Minnetonka City Bank, including the\npossibility that the merger may be more difficult or expensive to accomplish than anticipated,\ndiversion of management's attention from daily operations and the effect of the proposed merger on the\nCompany’s customer and employee relationships and operating results;\n changes to U.S. or state tax laws, regulations and guidance;\n potential changes in federal policy and at regulatory agencies as a result of the upcoming 2024\npresidential election; and\n any other risks described in the “Risk Factors” section of this report and in other reports filed by\nBridgewater Bancshares, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read together with the other\ncautionary statements included in this report. In addition, past results of operations are not necessarily indicative of\nfuture results. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this report is based only on information currently available\nto us and speaks only as of the date on which it is made. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any\nforward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new\ninformation, future developments or otherwise.\nOverview\nThe Company is a financial holding company headquartered in St. Louis Park, Minnesota. The principal\nsources of funds for loans and investments are transaction, savings, time, and other deposits, and short-term and long-\nterm borrowings. The Company’s principal sources of income are interest and fees collected on loans, interest and\ndividends earned on investment securities and service charges. The Company’s principal expenses are interest paid on\ndeposit accounts and borrowings, employee compensation and other overhead expenses. The Company’s simple,\nefficient business model of providing responsive support and unconventional experiences to clients continues to be the\nunderlying principle that drives the Company’s profitable growth.\n40\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared based on the application of certain\naccounting policies, the most significant of which are described in “Note 1 – Description of the Business and Summary\nof Significant Accounting Policies” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included as a part of the\nCompany’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 7, 2024. There have been no\nsignificant changes in the critical accounting policies or the assumptions and judgments utilized in applying these\npolicies since December 31, 2023. Certain policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions\nthat may prove inaccurate or subject to variation and may significantly affect the reported results and financial position\nfor the current period or in future periods. The use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments are necessary when\nfinancial assets and liabilities are required to be recorded or adjusted to reflect fair value. Assets carried at fair value\ninherently result in more financial statement volatility. Fair values and information used to record valuation adjustments\nfor certain assets and liabilities are based on either quoted market prices or are provided by other independent third-party\nsources, when available. When such information is not available, management estimates valuation adjustments. Changes\nin underlying factors, assumptions or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on the future financial\ncondition and results of operations. Management has discussed each critical accounting policy and the methodology for\nthe identification and determination of critical accounting policies with the Company’s Audit Committee.\nRecent Developments\nOn August 28, 2024, the Company and FMB jointly announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement\nunder which Bridgewater Bank will acquire First Minnetonka City Bank, the wholly-owned banking subsidiary of FMB,\nin an all-cash transaction.\nOn October 23, 2024, the Company announced the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals for the\ntransaction. The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to the satisfaction of remaining\nclosing conditions. At the closing of the transaction, First Minnetonka City Bank will merge with and into Bridgewater\nBank, with Bridgewater Bank as the surviving entity. The combined organization is expected to have approximately $4.9\nbillion in total assets, $4.0 billion in deposits, $3.9 billion in loans and leases, and nine full-service branches across the\nTwin Cities.\n41\nOperating Results Overview\nThe following table summarizes certain key financial results as of and for the periods indicated:\nAs of and for t he Three M ont h s Ended\nSeptember 30, June 30 March 31, December 31, September 30,\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data) 2024 2024 2024 2023 2023\nIncome Statement\nNet Interest Income $ 25,599 $ 24,996 $ 24,631 $ 25,314 $ 25,421\nProvision for (Recovery of) Credit Losses — 600 750 (250) (600)\nNoninterest Income 1,522 1,763 1,550 1,409 1,726\nNoninterest Expense 15,760 15,539 15,189 15,740 15,237\nNet Income 8,675 8,115 7,831 8,873 9,629\nNet Income Available to Common Shareholders 7,662 7,101 6,818 7,859 8,616\nPer Common Share Data\nBasic Earnings Per Share $ 0.28 $ 0.26 $ 0.25 $ 0.28 $ 0.31\nDiluted Earnings Per Share 0.27 0.26 0.24 0.28 0.30\nBook Value Per Share 14.06 13.63 13.30 12.94 12.47\nTangible Book Value Per Share (1) 13.96 13.53 13.20 12.84 12.37\nBasic Weighted Average Shares Outstanding 27,382,798 27,386,713 27,691,401 27,870,430 27,943,409\nDiluted Weighted Average Shares Outstanding 27,904,910 27,748,184 28,089,805 28,238,056 28,311,778\nShares Outstanding at Period End 27,425,690 27,348,049 27,589,827 27,748,965 28,015,505\nSelected Performance Ratios\nReturn on Average Assets (2) 0.73 % 0.70 % 0.69 % 0.77 % 0.85 %\nPre-Provision Net Revenue Return on Average Assets (1)(2) 0.96 0.94 0.95 0.96 1.01\nReturn on Average Shareholders' Equity (2) 7.79 7.49 7.35 8.43 9.23\nReturn on Average Tangible Common Equity (1)(2) 8.16 7.80 7.64 8.95 9.92\nAverage Shareholders' Equity to Average Assets 9.42 9.37 9.32 9.15 9.19\nNet Interest Margin (3) 2.24 2.24 2.24 2.27 2.32\nCore Net Interest Margin (1)(3) 2.16 2.17 2.18 2.21 2.24\nYield on Interest Earning Assets(3) 5.48 5.41 5.28 5.22 5.14\nYield on Total Loans, Gross(3) 5.57 5.50 5.38 5.33 5.26\nCost of Interest Bearing Liabilities 4.27 4.19 4.03 3.97 3.81\nCost of Total Deposits 3.58 3.46 3.32 3.19 2.99\nCost of Funds 3.54 3.49 3.34 3.23 3.10\nEfficiency Ratio (1) 58.0 58.7 58.2 58.8 56.1\nNoninterest Expense to Average Assets (2) 1.33 1.35 1.33 1.37 1.34\nBalance Sheet\nTotal Assets $ 4,691,517 $ 4,687,035 $ 4,723,109 $ 4,611,990 $ 4,557,070\nTotal Loans, Gross 3,685,590 3,800,385 3,784,205 3,724,282 3,722,271\nDeposits 3,747,442 3,807,712 3,807,225 3,709,948 3,675,509\nTotal Shareholders' Equity 452,200 439,241 433,611 425,515 415,960\nLoan to Deposit Ratio 98.3 % 99.8 % 99.4 % 100.4 % 101.3 %\nCore Deposits to Total Deposits (4) 71.5 67.9 69.3 68.7 70.3\nUninsured Deposits to Total Deposits 25.0 22.5 26.0 24.3 22.2\nCapital Ratios (Consolidated) (6)\nTier 1 Leverage Ratio 9.75 % 9.66 % 9.66 % 9.57 % 9.62 %\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Risk-based Capital Ratio 9.79 9.41 9.21 9.16 9.07\nTier 1 Risk-based Capital Ratio 11.44 11.03 10.83 10.79 10.69\nTotal Risk-based Capital Ratio 14.62 14.16 14.00 13.97 13.88\nTangible Common Equity to Tangible Assets (1) 8.17 7.90 7.72 7.73 7.61\n42\nAs of and for the Three Months Ended\nSeptember 30, June 30 March 31, December 31, September 30,\n(dollars in thousands) 2024 2024 2024 2023 2023\nSelected Asset Quality Data\nLoans 30-89 Days Past Due $ 65 $ 502 $ — $ 15,110 $ 11\nLoans 30-89 Days Past Due to Total Loans 0.00 % 0.01 % 0.00 % 0.41 % 0.00 %\nNonperforming Loans $ 8,378 $ 678 $ 249 $ 919 $ 749\nNonperforming Loans to Total Loans 0.23 % 0.02 % 0.01 % 0.02 % 0.02 %\nNonaccrual Loans to Total Loans 0.23 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.02\nNonaccrual Loans and Loans Past Due 90 Days and Still\nAccruing to Total Loans 0.23 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.02\nForeclosed Assets $ 434 $ — $ 20 $ — $ —\nNonperforming Assets (5) 8,812 678 269 919 749\nNonperforming Assets to Total Assets (5) 0.19 % 0.01 % 0.01 % 0.02 % 0.02 %\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Loans to Total Loans 1.38 1.37 1.36 1.36 1.36\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Loans to Nonaccrual Loans 608.95 7,662.09 20,621.29 5,494.45 6,753.67\nNet Loan Charge-Offs to Average Loans (2) 0.10 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.01\nWatchlist Risk Rating Loans $ 31,991 $ 30,436 $ 21,624 $ 26,485 $ 26,877\nSubstandard Risk Rating Loans 31,637 33,908 33,829 33,858 35,621\n(1) Represents a non-GAAP financial measure.

Earnings per diluted common share for the third quarter of 2024 were $0.27, compared to $0.30 per\ndiluted common share for the third quarter of 2023. Net income was $24.6 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to net income of $31.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Earnings\nper diluted common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $0.77, compared to $0.99 per diluted\ncommon share for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nNet Interest Income\nThe Company’s primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is impacted by the level of interest\nearning assets and related funding sources, as well as changes in interest rates. The difference between the average yield\non earning assets and the average rate paid for interest bearing liabilities is the net interest spread. Noninterest bearing\nsources of funds, such as demand deposits and shareholders’ equity, also support earning assets. The impact of the\nnoninterest bearing sources of funds is captured in the net interest margin, which is calculated as net interest income\ndivided by average earning assets. Both the net interest margin and net interest spread are presented on a tax-equivalent\nbasis, which means that tax-free interest income has been adjusted to pretax-equivalent income, assuming a 21% federal\ntax rate.

The\nfollowing table presents the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on interest earning assets and the interest\nincurred on interest bearing liabilities. The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in\nvolume by the previous period’s average rate.

The increase in net interest income was primarily due to increased cash balances,\ngrowth and higher yields in the securities portfolio, and higher yields on loans, offset partially by growth and higher\nrates on deposits.\nNet interest margin (on a fully tax-equivalent basis) for the third quarter of 2024 was 2.24%, an eight basis\npoint decline from 2.32% in the third quarter of 2023. Core net interest margin (on a fully tax-equivalent basis), a non-\nGAAP financial measure which excludes the impact of loan fees, was 2.16% for the third quarter of 2024, an eight basis\npoint decline from 2.24% in the third quarter of 2023. The decline in the margin was primarily due to higher funding\ncosts, offset partially by higher earning asset yields.\nAverage interest earning assets were $4.60 billion for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $179.1 million,\nor 4.1%, compared to $4.42 billion for the third quarter of 2023. This increase in average interest earning assets was\nprimarily due to increased cash balances and purchases of investment securities. Average interest bearing liabilities were\n$3.49 billion for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $226.6 million, or 6.9%, compared to $3.26 billion for the third\nquarter of 2023. The increase in average interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to an increase in all deposit types\nand FHLB advances, offset partially by a decrease in federal funds purchased.\nAverage interest earning assets produced a tax-equivalent yield of 5.48% for the third quarter of 2024,\ncompared to 5.14% for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in the yield on interest earning assets was primarily due to\nthe purchase of higher yielding securities and the repricing of the loan and securities portfolios in the higher interest rate\nenvironment. The average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was 4.27% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to\n47\n3.81% for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to continued deposit repricing in the higher rate\nenvironment.\nInterest Income. Total interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, was $63.3 million for the third quarter of\n2024, compared to $57.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. The $6.1 million, or 10.7%, increase in total interest\nincome on a tax-equivalent basis was primarily due to purchases of investment securities and higher earning asset yields\nin the higher interest rate environment.\nInterest income on the investment securities portfolio, on a tax-equivalent basis, increased $2.2 million for the\nthird quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to a $105.0 million, or 17.6%, increase in\naverage balances between the two periods and higher rates earned on securities.\nInterest income on loans, on a tax-equivalent basis, was $52.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to\n$49.3 million for the third quarter of 2023. The $2.8 million increase was primarily due to the repricing of the loan\nportfolio in the higher interest rate environment.\nLoan interest income and loan fees remained one of the primary contributing factors to the changes in the yield\non interest earning assets. The aggregate loan yield increased to 5.57% in the third quarter of 2024, which was 31 basis\npoints higher than 5.26% in the third quarter of 2023. The core loan yield continued to rise as new loans originated at\nhigher yields and the existing portfolio reprice in the higher rate environment.\nThe following table presents a summary of interest and fees recognized on loans for the periods indicated:\nThree Months End ed\nSeptember 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023\nInterest 5.47 % 5.42 % 5.31 % 5.25 % 5.16 %\nFees 0.10 0.08 0.07 0.08 0.10\nYield on Loans 5.57 % 5.50 % 5.38 % 5.33 % 5.26 %\nInterest Expense. Interest expense on interest bearing liabilities was $37.4 million for the third quarter of 2024,\nan increase of $6.0 million, from $31.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to growth\nand upward repricing of the deposit portfolio in the higher interest rate environment.\nInterest expense on deposits was $34.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $7.0 million, from\n$27.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in interest expense on deposits was primarily due to upward\nrepricing of the deposit portfolio in the higher interest rate environment and the average balance of interest bearing\ndeposits increasing by $231.8 million, or 8.1%. The cost of total deposits was 3.58% in the third quarter of 2024, a 59\nbasis point increase, compared to 2.99% in the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to the upward\nrepricing of the deposit portfolio in the higher interest rate environment.\nInterest expense on borrowings was $3.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of $921,000,\ncompared to $4.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decreased utilization of\nfederal funds purchased and a decrease in the rate on FHLB advances.\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nNet interest income was $75.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of $4.6\nmillion, or 5.8%, compared to $79.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest\nincome was primarily due to growth and higher rates paid on deposits, offset partially by growth and higher earning\nasset yields in the higher interest rate environment.\nNet interest margin (on a fully tax-equivalent basis) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.24%,\na 23 basis point decline from 2.47% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Core net interest margin (on a fully\n48\ntax-equivalent basis), a non-GAAP financial measure which excludes the impact of loan fees, was 2.17% for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, a 22 basis point decline from 2.39% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nAverage interest earning assets were $4.54 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase\nof $166.2 million, or 3.8%, compared to $4.38 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in\naverage interest earning assets was primarily due to organic growth in the loan portfolio, continued purchases of\ninvestment securities, and an increase in cash balances. Average interest bearing liabilities were $3.44 billion for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $225.8 million, or 7.0%, compared to $3.22 billion for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. The increase in average interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to an increase in\ninterest bearing transaction deposits, time deposits, brokered deposits, and FHLB advances, offset partially by a decrease\nin federal funds purchased.\nAverage interest earning assets produced a tax-equivalent yield of 5.39% for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to 5.04% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average rate paid on\ninterest bearing liabilities was 4.16% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.49% for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023.\nInterest Income. Total interest income on a tax-equivalent basis was $183.5 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to $165.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The $18.5 million\nincrease in total interest income on a tax-equivalent basis was primarily due to an increase in cash balances, organic\ngrowth in the loan portfolio, purchases of investment securities and higher earning asset yields in the higher interest rate\nenvironment.\nInterest income on the investment securities portfolio, on a tax-equivalent basis, increased $5.9 million during\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a\n$83.1 million, or 13.9%, increase in average balances and a 63 basis point increase in yield between the periods.\nInterest income on loans, on a tax-equivalent basis, was $153.6 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to $142.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The $10.9 million\nincrease was primarily due to a 1.4% increase in the average balances of loans outstanding and a 31 basis point increase\nin yield.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense on interest bearing liabilities was $107.3 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, an increase of $23.4 million, compared to $83.9 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to growth and continued deposit repricing in the higher interest rate\nenvironment, offset partially by decreased utilization of federal funds purchased.\nInterest expense on deposits increased to $96.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,\ncompared to $66.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The $29.4 million increase in interest expense\non deposits was primarily due to upward repricing of the deposit portfolio in the higher interest rate environment.\nInterest expense on borrowings was $11.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to\n$17.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to lower average balances\nof federal funds purchased.\nProvision for Credit Losses\nThe provision for credit losses on loans was $-0- for both the third quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of\n2023. The provision for credit losses on loans was $1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,\ncompared to $2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Although loans decreased during the quarter,\nincreased loss rates and other qualitative factor adjustments resulted in no provision for the quarter. The allowance for\ncredit losses on loans to total loans was 1.38% at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.36% at December 31, 2023.\n49\nThe following table presents a summary of the activity in the allowance for credit losses on loans for the\nperiods indicated:\nThree Mo nt hs Ended Nine Mon th s Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nBalance at Beginning of Period $ 51,949 $ 50,701 $ 50,494 $ 47,996\nImpact of Adopting CECL — — — 650\nProvision for Credit Losses — — 1,450 2,050\nCharge-offs (937) (122) (949) (129)\nRecoveries 6 6 23 18\nBalance at End of Period $ 51,018 $ 50,585 $ 51,018 $ 50,585\nThe provision for credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures was $-0- for the third quarter of 2024,\ncompared to a negative provision of $600,000 for the third quarter of 2023. No provision was recorded during the third\nquarter of 2024 due to unfunded commitments remaining stable as the migration to funded loans was offset by the\nvolume of newly originated loans with unfunded commitments. The provision for credit losses for off-balance sheet\nexposures was a negative provision of $100,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a negative\nprovision of $2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The negative provision for both periods was\ndue to a reduction in outstanding unfunded commitments.

The decrease was primarily due to $493,000 of FHLB prepayment income recognized in the\nprevious year which did not reoccur, offset partially by higher letter of credit fees, an increase in the cash surrender\nvalue of bank-owned life insurance and an increase in other income. Noninterest income was $4.8 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of $249,000 from $5.1 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower letter of credit fees and $792,000 of FHLB prepayment\nincome recognized in the previous year which did not reoccur, offset partially by an increase in net gain on sale of\nsecurities and an increase in the cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance.\n50\nThe following table presents the major components of noninterest income for the periods indicated:\nT hree Mo nt h s Ended N ine Mon th s Ended\nSeptember 30, Increase/ September 30, Increase/\n(dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 (Decrease) 2024 2023 (Decrease)\nNoninterest Income:\nCustomer Service Fees $ 373 $ 379 $ (6) $ 1,081 $ 1,096 $ (15)\nNet Gain (Loss) on Sales of Securities (28) — (28) 385 (6) 391\nLetter of Credit Fees 424 315 109 1,127 1,328 (201)\nDebit Card Interchange Fees 152 150 2 448 443 5\nBank-Owned Life Insurance 352 252 100 965 724 241\nFHLB Prepayment Income — 493 (493) — 792 (792)\nOther Income 249 137 112 829 707 122\nTotals $ 1,522 $ 1,726 $ (204) $ 4,835 $ 5,084 $ (249)\nNoninterest Expense\nThird Quarter of 2024 Compared to Third Quarter of 2023\nNoninterest expense was $15.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $523,000 from $15.2 million\nfor the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and employee benefits,\nhigher professional and consulting fees relating to the acquisition of First Minnetonka City Bank, increases in\ninformation technology and telecommunications, and marketing and advertising expense, offset partially by a decrease\nin the FDIC insurance assessment and lower derivative collateral fees.\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nNoninterest expense was $46.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $2.9\nmillion, from $43.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to\nincreases in salaries and employee benefits and higher professional and consulting fees driven by the acquisition of First\nMinnetonka City Bank.\nThe Company had 265 full-time equivalent employees at the end of the third quarter of 2024, compared to 255\nat the end of the third quarter of 2023.\nEfficiency Ratio. The efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure, reports total noninterest expense, less\namortization of intangible assets, as a percentage of net interest income plus total noninterest income, less gains (losses)\non sales of securities. Management believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides a meaningful comparison of\noperational performance and facilitates investors’ assessments of business performance and trends in comparison to\npeers in the banking industry.\nThe efficiency ratio was 58.0% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 56.1% for the third quarter of 2023.\nThe efficiency ratio for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 58.3% and 51.2%, respectively. The\nefficiencies of the Company’s “branch-light” model have positioned the Company well to continue navigating a\nchallenging environment for a more spread-based revenue model.\n51\nThe following table presents the major components of noninterest expense for the periods indicated:\nT hree Mo nt h s Ended N ine Mon th s Ended\nSeptember 30, Increase/ September 30, Increase/\n(dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 (Decrease) 2024 2023 (Decrease)\nNoninterest Expense:\nSalaries and Employee Benefits $ 9,851 $ 9,519 $ 332 $ 28,959 $ 26,923 $ 2,036\nOccupancy and Equipment 1,069 1,101 (32) 3,218 3,385 (167)\nFDIC Insurance Assessment 750 1,075 (325) 2,350 2,640 (290)\nData Processing 368 392 (24) 1,252 1,150 102\nProfessional and Consulting Fees 1,149 715 434 2,890 2,299 591\nDerivative Collateral Fees 381 543 (162) 1,395 1,327 68\nInformation Technology and Telecommunications 840 683 157 2,448 2,077 371\nMarketing and Advertising 367 222 145 1,006 805 201\nIntangible Asset Amortization 9 9 — 26 91 (65)\nOther Expense 976 978 (2) 2,944 2,883 61\nTotals $ 15,760 $ 15,237 $ 523 $ 46,488 $ 43,580 $ 2,908\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe provision for income taxes includes both federal and state taxes. Fluctuations in effective tax rates reflect\nthe differences in the inclusion or deductibility of certain income and expenses for income tax purposes and the\nrecognition of tax credits. The Company’s future effective income tax rate will fluctuate based on the mix of taxable and\ntax-free investments and loans, the recognition and availability of tax credit investments, and overall taxable income.\nIncome tax expense was $2.7 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $2.9 million for the third\nquarter of 2023. The effective combined federal and state income tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 23.6%,\ncompared to 23.0% for the third quarter of 2023. Income tax expense was $7.6 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to $10.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective combined\nfederal and state income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 23.6% and 24.7%,\nrespectively. The fluctuations in the effective tax rate across both periods was primarily due to the timing and delivery of\ntax credits.\nFinancial Condition\nAssets\nTotal assets at September 30, 2024 were $4.69 billion, an increase of $79.5 million, or 1.7%, over total assets of\n$4.61 billion at December 31, 2023, and an increase of $134.4 million, or 3.0%, over total assets of $4.56 billion at\nSeptember 30, 2023. The year-to-date and year-over-year growth were primarily due to an increase in cash and cash\nequivalents and purchases of investment securities.\nInvestment Securities Portfolio\nThe investment securities portfolio is used to make various term investments and is intended to provide the\nCompany with adequate liquidity, a source of stable income, and at times, serve as collateral for certain types of deposits\nor borrowings. Investment balances in the investment securities portfolio are subject to change over time based on\nfunding needs and interest rate risk management objectives. The liquidity levels take into account anticipated future cash\nflows and are maintained at levels management believes are appropriate to ensure future flexibility in meeting\nanticipated funding needs.\nThe investment securities portfolio consists primarily of U.S. government agency mortgage backed securities,\nmunicipal securities, and corporate securities comprised primarily of subordinated debentures of banks and financial\nholding companies. In addition, the Company also holds U.S. treasury securities, other mortgage backed and other debt\n52\nsecurities. The investment securities portfolio has varying contractual maturities, some of these maturities do not\nnecessarily represent the expected life of the securities as the securities may be called or paid down without penalty prior\nto their stated maturities. All investment securities are held as available for sale.\nSecurities available for sale were $664.7 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $604.1 million at\nDecember 31, 2023, an increase of $60.6 million, or 10.0%. At September 30, 2024, U.S. government agency mortgage-\nbacked securities represented 15.5% of the portfolio, municipal securities represented 16.8% of the portfolio, corporate\nsecurities represented 20.8% of the portfolio, U.S. treasury securities represented 15.9% of the portfolio, SBA securities\nrepresented 2.2% of the portfolio, other mortgage-backed securities represented 16.1% of the portfolio, and asset-backed\nsecurities represented 12.7% of the portfolio.\nThe following table presents the amortized cost and fair value of securities available for sale, by type, at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nSeptemb er 3 0, 2024 Decembe r 31 , 2023\nAmortized Fair Amortized Fair\n(dollars in thousands) Cost Value Cost Value\nU.S. Treasury Securities $ 105,998 $ 105,875 $ — $ —\nSBA Securities 14,105 14,266 18,497 18,674\nMortgage-Backed Securities Issued or Guaranteed by U.S.\nAgencies (MBS):\nResidential Pass-Through:\nGuaranteed by GNMA 6,947 6,484 45,256 44,188\nIssued by FNMA and FHLMC 23,117 20,970 24,319 21,687\nOther Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities 73,153 65,738 74,832 65,617\nCommercial Mortgage-Backed Securities 10,316 9,975 10,811 10,292\nAll Other Commercial MBS 105,017 107,304 94,237 93,531\nTotal MBS 218,550 210,471 249,455 235,315\nMunicipal Securities 125,423 111,887 151,512 132,524\nCorporate Securities 144,539 138,107 142,098 130,605\nAsset-Backed Securities 83,964 84,109 87,054 86,986\nTotal $ 692,579 $ 664,715 $ 648,616 $ 604,104\nLoan Portfolio\nThe Company focuses on lending to borrowers located or investing in the Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington,\nMN-WI Metropolitan Statistical Area across a diverse range of industries and property types. The Company lends\nprimarily to commercial customers, consisting of loans secured by nonfarm, nonresidential properties, multifamily\nresidential properties, land, and non-real estate business assets. Responsive service, local decision making, and an\nefficient turnaround time from application to closing have been significant factors in growing the loan portfolio.\nThe Company manages concentrations of credit exposure through a risk management program which\nimplements formalized processes and procedures specifically for managing and mitigating risk within the loan portfolio.\nThe processes and procedures include board and management oversight, commercial real estate exposure limits,\nportfolio monitoring tools, management information systems, market reports, underwriting standards, internal and\nexternal loan review, and stress testing.\nTotal gross loans at September 30, 2024 were $3.69 billion, a decrease of $38.7 million, or 1.0%, over total\ngross loans of $3.72 billion at December 31, 2023, and a decrease of $36.7 million, or 1.0%, over total gross loans of\n$3.72 billion at September 30, 2023. The decrease in the loan portfolio during both periods was primarily due to elevated\nloan payoffs, offset partially by loan originations. The pace of loan growth has moderated in recent quarters, when\ncompared to historical levels, due to active balance sheet management to continue to align loan growth with the funding\noutlook and ultimately the impact of the higher interest rate environment on the number of prospective deals that meet\nunderwriting standards.\n53\nThe following table presents the dollar and percentage composition of the loan portfolio by category, at the\ndates indicated:\nSeptember 3 0, 2024 June 30, 2 02 4 March 31, 20 24 December 3 1, 2023 September 3 0, 2023\n(dollars in thousands) Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent\nCommercial $ 493,403 13.4 % $ 518,762 13.6 % $ 483,069 12.8 % $ 464,061 12.4 % $ 459,854 12.3 %\nConstruction and\nLand Development 118,596 3.2 134,096 3.5 200,970 5.3 232,804 6.3 294,818 7.9\n1-4 Family\nConstruction 45,822 1.3 60,551 1.6 65,606 1.7 65,087 1.8 64,463 1.7\nReal Estate\nMortgage:\n1-4 Family\nMortgage 421,179 11.4 416,944 11.0 417,773 11.0 402,396 10.8 404,716 10.9\nMultifamily 1,379,814 37.4 1,404,835 37.0 1,389,345 36.7 1,388,541 37.3 1,378,669 37.0\nCRE Owner\nOccupied 182,239 5.0 185,988 4.9 182,589 4.8 175,783 4.7 159,485 4.3\nCRE Nonowner\nOccupied 1,032,142 28.0 1,070,050 28.2 1,035,702 27.4 987,306 26.5 951,263 25.6\nTotal Real Estate\nMortgage Loans 3,015,374 81.8 3,077,817 81.1 3,025,409 79.9 2,954,026 79.3 2,894,133 77.8\nConsumer and Other 12,395 0.3 9,159 0.2 9,151 0.3 8,304 0.2 9,003 0.3\nTotal Loans,\nGross 3,685,590 100.0 % 3,800,385 100.0 % 3,784,205 100.0 % 3,724,282 100.0 % 3,722,271 100.0 %\nAllowance for Credit\nLosses (51,018) (51,949) (51,347) (50,494) (50,585)\nNet Deferred Loan\nFees (5,705) (6,214) (6,356) (6,573) (7,222)\nTotal Loans, Net $ 3,628,867 $ 3,742,222 $ 3,726,502 $ 3,667,215 $ 3,664,464\nThe Company primarily focuses on real estate mortgage lending, which constituted 81.8% of the portfolio at\nSeptember 30, 2024.

Federal regulations\nand internal policies require the use of an asset classification system as a means of managing and reporting problem and\npotential problem assets. The Company has incorporated an internal asset classification system, substantially consistent\nwith federal banking regulations, as a part of the credit monitoring system. Federal banking regulations set forth a\nclassification scheme for problem and potential problem assets as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss” assets. An asset is\nconsidered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of\nthe collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the\nfinancial institution will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all\nof the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present\nmake “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, “highly\n55\nquestionable and improbable.” Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value\nthat their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. Assets which do not\ncurrently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories\nbut possess weaknesses are required to be designated “watch.”\nThe following table presents information on loan classifications at September 30, 2024. The Company had no\nassets classified as doubtful or loss at September 30, 2024.\nRisk C at eg ory\n(dollars in thousands) Watch Substandard Total\nCommercial $ 495 $ 14,199 $ 14,694\nConstruction and Land Development — 64 64\nReal Estate Mortgage:\n1-4 Family Mortgage 826 648 1,474\nMultifamily 12,878 — 12,878\nCRE Owner Occupied 1,725 977 2,702\nCRE Nonowner Occupied 16,067 15,749 31,816\nTotal Real Estate Mortgage Loans 31,496 17,374 48,870\nTotals $ 31,991 $ 31,637 $ 63,628\nLoans that have potential weaknesses that warranted a watchlist risk rating at September 30, 2024 totaled $32.0\nmillion, compared to $26.5 million at December 31, 2023. Loans that warranted a substandard risk rating at\nSeptember 30, 2024 totaled $31.6 million, compared to $35.9 million at December 31, 2023. Management continues to\nactively work with these borrowers and closely monitor substandard credits.\nNonperforming Assets\nNonperforming loans include loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis and loans 90 days past due and still\naccruing. Nonaccrual loans totaled $8.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and $919,000 as of December 31, 2023. There\nwere no loans 90 days past due and still accruing as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. As of September 30,\n2024, there were $434,000 of foreclosed assets. There were no foreclosed assets as of December 31, 2023. The overall\nincrease in nonperforming assets was primarily due to one central business district office loan, which previously had a\nsubstandard risk rating.\nThe following table presents a summary of nonperforming assets, by category, at the dates indicated:\nSe ptember 30, De cember 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2024 2023\nTotal Nonaccrual Loans $ 8,378 $ 919\nTotal Nonperforming Loans $ 8,378 $ 919\nPlus: Foreclosed Assets 434 —\nTotal Nonperforming Assets (1) $ 8,812 $ 919\nNonaccrual Loans to Total Loans 0.23 % 0.02 %\nNonperforming Loans to Total Loans 0.23 0.02\nNonperforming Assets to Total Loans Plus Foreclosed Assets (1) 0.24 0.02\n(1) Nonperforming assets are defined as nonaccrual loans and loans greater than 90 days past due still accruing plus foreclosed assets. There were no\nloans greater than 90 days past due still accruing for any period shown.\nThe balance of nonperforming assets can fluctuate due to changes in economic conditions. The Company has\nestablished a policy to discontinue accruing interest on a loan (that is, to place the loan on nonaccrual status) after it has\nbecome 90 days delinquent as to payment of principal or interest, unless the loan is considered to be well-collateralized\nand is actively in the process of collection. In addition, a loan will be placed on nonaccrual status before it becomes 90\ndays delinquent unless management believes that the collection of interest is expected. Interest previously accrued but\n56\nuncollected on such loans is reversed and charged against current income when the receivable is determined to be\nuncollectible. If management believes that a loan will not be collected in full, an increase to the allowance for credit\nlosses on loans is recorded to reflect management’s estimate of any potential exposure or loss. Generally, payments\nreceived on nonaccrual loans are applied directly to principal. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nthe gross income that would have been recorded on nonaccrual loans was $116,000 and $152,000, respectively. For the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2023, gross income that would have been recorded on nonacrrual loans was\n$20,000 and $51,000, respectively.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses on loans is a reserve established through charges to earnings in the form of a\nprovision for credit losses. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses at a level management considers\nadequate to provide for expected lifetime losses in the portfolio. Although management strives to maintain an\nallowance it deems adequate, future economic changes, deterioration of borrowers’ creditworthiness, and the impact\nof examinations by regulatory agencies, among other factors, all could cause changes to the allowance for credit\nlosses on loans.\nAt September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses on loans was $51.0 million, an increase of\n$524,000 from $50.5 million at December 31, 2023.

Core deposits, defined as total deposits excluding brokered deposits and time\ndeposits greater than $250,000, increased $131.2 million, or 6.9% annualized, from December 31, 2023. Growth in core\ndeposits was primarily due to increased balances of existing clients and new client acquisitions. Based on the nature of\nthe Company’s client base, management believes core deposits could fluctuate in future periods as deposit growth is not\nalways linear.\nThe Company relies on increasing the deposit base to fund loans and other asset growth. The Company is in a\nhighly competitive market and competes for local deposits by offering attractive products with competitive rates. The\nCompany expects to have a higher average cost of funds for local deposits compared to competitor banks due to the lack\nof an extensive branch network. The Company’s strategy is to offset the higher cost of funding with a lower level of\noperating expense. When appropriate, the Company utilizes alternative funding sources such as brokered deposits. The\nbrokered deposit market provides flexibility in structure, optionality and efficiency not afforded in traditional retail\ndeposit channels. As of September 30, 2024, total brokered deposits were $901.0 million, a decrease of $123.5 million,\ncompared to total brokered deposits of $1.02 billion at December 31, 2023. Brokered deposits continue to be used as a\nsupplemental funding source, as needed, to support loan portfolio growth.\n58\nThe following table presents the average balance and average rate paid on each of the following deposit\ncategories as of and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nAs of and f or the As of and f or the\nThree Months Ended Three Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nAverage Average Average Average\n(dollars in thousands) Balance Rate Balance Rate\nNoninterest Bearing Transaction Deposits $ 710,192 — % $ 754,567 — %\nInterest Bearing Transaction Deposits 804,161 4.63 730,244 3.88\nSavings and Money Market Deposits 939,665 4.34 874,612 3.67\nTime Deposits < $250,000 184,397 4.01 181,689 2.56\nTime Deposits > $250,000 170,653 4.80 84,946 3.70\nBrokered Deposits 989,712 4.28 985,276 4.04\nTotal Deposits $ 3,798,780 3.58 % $ 3,611,334 2.99 %\nThe Company’s total uninsured deposits, which are the amounts of deposit accounts that exceed the FDIC\ninsurance limit, currently $250,000, were approximately $944.0 million, or 25.0% of total deposits, at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and $900.0 million, or 24.3% of total deposits, at December 31, 2023. These amounts were\nestimated based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for regulatory reporting purposes.\nBorrowed Funds\nOther Borrowings\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding FHLB advances of $349.5 million, compared to $319.5\nmillion at December 31, 2023. The Company’s borrowing capacity at the FHLB is determined based on collateral\npledged, generally consisting of loans. The Company had additional borrowing capacity under this credit facility of\n$509.2 million and $498.7 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe Company has an outstanding Loan and Security Agreement and revolving note with a third party\ncorrespondent lender, which is secured by 100% of the issued and outstanding stock of the Bank. On September 1, 2024,\nthe Company entered into a third amendment to the agreement which extended the maturity date of the Company’s\nexisting revolving line of credit with a maximum principal amount of $40.0 million from September 1, 2024 to\nSeptember 1, 2026. The amendment also increased the floor rate from 3.85% to 4.50%. As of both September 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023, the Company had $13.8 million of outstanding balances under the revolving line of credit.\nAdditionally, the Company has borrowing capacity from other sources. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank\nwas eligible to use the Federal Reserve discount window for borrowings. Based on assets pledged as collateral as of the\napplicable date, the Bank’s borrowing availability was approximately $868.0 million and $979.4 million at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the\nCompany had no outstanding advances from the discount window.\nSubordinated Debentures\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had subordinated debentures, net of issuance\ncosts, of $79.6 million and $79.3 million, respectively.\nFor additional information, see “Note 8 – Subordinated Debentures” of the Company’s Consolidated Financial\nStatements included as part of this report.\n59\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents supplemental information regarding total contractual obligations at\nSeptember 30, 2024:\nWithin One to Three to After\n(dollars in thousands) One Year Three Years Five Years Five Years Total\nDeposits Without a Stated Maturity $ 2,638,892 $ — $ — $ — $ 2,638,892\nTime Deposits 335,002 586,182 174,611 12,755 1,108,550\nNotes Payable — 13,750 — — 13,750\nFHLB Advances 278,000 49,000 22,500 — 349,500\nSubordinated Debentures — — — 80,000 80,000\nCommitment to Fund Tax Credit Investments 2,881 — — — 2,881\nOperating Lease Obligations 596 811 370 — 1,777\nTotals $ 3,255,371 $ 649,743 $ 197,481 $ 92,755 $ 4,195,350\nThe Company believes that it will be able to meet all contractual obligations as they come due through the\nmaintenance of adequate cash levels. The Company expects to maintain adequate cash levels through earnings, loan and\nsecurities repayments and maturity activity and continued deposit gathering activities. As described above, the Company\nhas in place various borrowing mechanisms for both short-term and long-term liquidity needs.\nCapital\nTotal shareholders’ equity at September 30, 2024 was $452.2 million, an increase of $26.7 million, or 6.3%,\ncompared to total shareholders’ equity of $425.5 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to net\nincome retained and a decrease in unrealized losses in the securities portfolio, offset partially by a decrease in unrealized\ngains in the derivatives portfolio, preferred stock dividends, and stock repurchases.\nTangible book value per share, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $13.96 as of September 30, 2024, an\nincrease of 8.8% from $12.84 as of December 31, 2023. Tangible common equity as a percentage of tangible assets, a\nnon-GAAP financial measure, was 8.17% at September 30, 2024, compared to 7.73% at December 31, 2023.\nStock Repurchase Program. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased no\nshares of its common stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 446,509\nshares of its common stock, representing 1.6% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares at that time. Shares were\nrepurchased during this period at a weighted average price of $11.60 per share, for a total of $5.2 million. All shares\nrepurchased under the stock repurchase program were converted to authorized but unissued shares.\nOn July 23, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors extended the expiration date of the Company’s previously\nannounced stock repurchase program (the “2022 Stock Repurchase Program”) from August 16, 2024 to August 20,\n2025. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining amount that could be used to repurchase shares under the stock\nrepurchase program was $15.3 million. The Company remains committed to maintaining strong capital levels while\nenhancing shareholder value as it strategically executes its stock repurchase program based on various factors including\nvaluation, capital levels and other uses of capital.\nRegulatory Capital. The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements\nadministered by federal banking regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory\nand possibly additional discretionary actions by federal banking regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct\nmaterial effect on the Company’s and Bank’s business.\n60\nManagement believes the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they were\nsubject as of September 30, 2024. The regulatory capital ratios for the Company and the Bank to meet the minimum\ncapital adequacy standards and for the Bank to be considered well capitalized under the prompt corrective action\nframework are set forth in the following tables.

A banking organization with a conservation buffer of less than the required amount is subject\nto limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments, stock repurchases and certain discretionary bonus\npayments to executive officers. At September 30, 2024, the ratios for the Company and the Bank were sufficient to meet\nthe conservation buffer.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business, the Company enters into various transactions to meet the financing needs of\nclients, which, in accordance with GAAP, are not included in the consolidated balance sheets. These transactions include\ncommitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and commercial letters of credit, which involve, to varying\ndegrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance\nsheets. Most of these commitments mature within two years and the standby letters of credit are expected to expire\nwithout being drawn upon. All off-balance sheet commitments are included in the determination of the amount of risk-\nbased capital that the Company and the Bank are required to hold.\n61\nThe Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the other party to the financial\ninstrument for commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and commercial letters of credit is represented by\nthe contractual or notional amount of those instruments. The Company decreases its exposure to losses under these\ncommitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures. The Company assesses the credit risk\nassociated with certain commitments to extend credit and establishes a liability for probable credit losses.\nThe following table presents credit arrangements and financial instruments whose contract amounts represented\ncredit risk as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nSeptemb er 3 0, 2024 Decembe r 31 , 2023\nFixed Variable Fixed Variable\n(dollars in thousands)\nUnfunded Commitments Under Lines of Credit $ 162,664 $ 361,034 $ 164,880 $ 381,752\nLetters of Credit 5,745 106,324 6,780 96,509\nTotals $ 168,409 $ 467,358 $ 171,660 $ 478,261\nThe Company had outstanding letters of credit with the FHLB of $133.9 million and $114.4 million at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, on behalf of customers and to secure public deposits.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity is the Company’s capacity to meet cash and collateral obligations at a reasonable cost. Maintaining an\nadequate level of liquidity depends on the Company’s ability to efficiently meet both expected and unexpected cash flow\nand collateral needs without adversely affecting either daily operations or financial condition. The Bank’s Asset Liability\nManagement, or ALM, Committee, which is comprised of members of senior management, is responsible for managing\ncommitments to meet the needs of customers while achieving the Company’s financial objectives. The ALM Committee\nmeets regularly to review balance sheet composition, funding capacities, and current and forecasted loan demand.\nThe Company manages liquidity by maintaining adequate levels of cash and other assets from on- and off-\nbalance sheet arrangements. Specifically, on-balance sheet liquidity consists of cash and due from banks and unpledged\ninvestment securities available for sale, which are referred to as primary liquidity. In regards to off-balance sheet\ncapacity, the Company maintains available borrowing capacity under secured borrowing lines with the FHLB, the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, and a correspondent lender, as well as unsecured lines of credit for the purpose of\novernight funds with various correspondent banks, which the Company refers to as secondary liquidity. During the\nsecond quarter of 2024, the Company elected not to renew its membership and discontinued its use of the American\nFinancial Exchange, or AFX. This had no impact on liquidity ratios as the availability of funds changed daily and\ntherefore was not previously included in secondary liquidity. The Company had no borrowings outstanding through the\nAFX as of December 31, 2023.\nTotal on- and off-balance sheet liquidity was $2.29 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to $2.23 billion\nat December 31, 2023. The Company did not utilize the Federal Reserve Discount Window during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024.\n62\nThe following tables present a summary of primary and secondary liquidity levels as of the dates indicated:\nPrimary Liquidity—On-Balance Sheet September 30, 2024 D ecember 31, 2023\n(dollars in thousands)\nCash and Cash Equivalents $ 167,869 $ 96,594\nSecurities Available for Sale 664,715 604,104\nLess: Pledged Securities (146,144) (170,727)\nTotal Primary Liquidity $ 686,440 $ 529,971\nRatio of Primary Liquidity to Total Deposits 18.3 % 14.3 %\nSecondary Liquidity—Off-Balance Sheet\nNet Secured Borrowing Capacity with the FHLB $ 509,223 $ 498,736\nNet Secured Borrowing Capacity with the Federal Reserve Bank 867,955 979,448\nUnsecured Borrowing Capacity with Correspondent Lenders 200,000 200,000\nSecured Borrowing Capacity with Correspondent Lender 26,250 26,250\nTotal Secondary Liquidity 1,603,428 1,704,434\nTotal Primary and Secondary Liquidity $ 2,289,868 $ 2,234,405\nRatio of Primary and Secondary Liquidity to Total Deposits 61.1 % 60.2 %\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primary liquidity increased by $156.5 million due to a\n$71.3 million increase in cash and cash equivalents, a $60.6 million increase in securities available for sale and a $24.6\nmillion decrease in pledged securities, when compared to December 31, 2023. Secondary liquidity decreased by $101.0\nmillion as of September 30, 2024, when compared to December 31, 2023, due to a $111.5 million decrease in the\nborrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve Bank, offset partially by a $10.5 million increase in the borrowing capacity\nwith the FHLB.\nIn addition to primary liquidity, the Company generates liquidity from cash flows from the loan and securities\nportfolios and from the large base of core deposits, defined as noninterest bearing transaction, interest bearing\ntransaction, savings, non-brokered money market accounts and non-brokered time deposits less than $250,000. At\nSeptember 30, 2024, core deposits totaled approximately $2.68 billion and represented 71.5% of total deposits. These\ncore deposits are normally less volatile, often with customer relationships tied to other products offered by the Company,\nwhich promote long-standing relationships and stable funding sources.\nThe Company uses brokered deposits, the availability of which is uncertain and subject to competitive market\nforces and regulation, for liquidity and interest rate risk management purposes. At September 30, 2024, brokered\ndeposits totaled $901.0 million, consisting of $761.5 million of brokered time deposits and $139.5 million of non-\nmaturity brokered money market and transaction accounts. At December 31, 2023, brokered deposits totaled\n$1.02 billion, consisting of $850.5 million of brokered time deposits and $174.0 million of non-maturity brokered money\nmarket and transaction accounts.\nThe Company’s liquidity policy includes guidelines for On-Balance Sheet Liquidity (a measurement of primary\nliquidity to total deposits plus borrowings), Total On-Balance Sheet Liquidity with Borrowing Capacity (a measurement\nof primary and secondary liquidity to total deposits plus borrowings), Wholesale Funding Ratio (a measurement of total\nwholesale funding to total deposits plus borrowings), and other guidelines developed for measuring and maintaining\nliquidity.\n63\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company routinely supplements its\nevaluation with an analysis of certain non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures, in addition to the related GAAP measures, provide meaningful information to investors to help them\nunderstand the Company’s operating performance and trends, and to facilitate comparisons with the performance of\npeers. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP,\nnor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nAs a financial institution, the Company’s primary market risk is interest rate risk, which is defined as the risk of\nloss of net interest income or net interest margin because of changes in interest rates. The Company continually seeks to\nmeasure and manage the potential impact of interest rate risk. Interest rate risk occurs when interest earning assets and\ninterest bearing liabilities mature or re-price at different times, on a different basis or in unequal amounts. Interest rate\nrisk also arises when assets and liabilities each respond differently to changes in interest rates.\nThe Company’s management of interest rate risk is overseen by its ALM Committee, based on a risk\nmanagement infrastructure approved by the board of directors that outlines reporting and measurement requirements. In\nparticular, this infrastructure sets limits and management targets for various metrics, including net interest income\nsimulation involving parallel shifts in interest rate curves, steepening and flattening yield curves, and various\nprepayment and deposit duration assumptions. The Company’s risk management infrastructure also requires a periodic\nreview of all key assumptions used, such as identifying appropriate interest rate scenarios, setting loan prepayment rates\n65\nbased on historical analysis and noninterest bearing and interest bearing transaction deposit durations based on historical\nanalysis. The Company does not engage in speculative trading activities relating to interest rates, foreign exchange rates,\ncommodity prices, equities or credit.\nThe Company manages the interest rate risk associated with interest earning assets by managing the interest\nrates and terms associated with the investment securities portfolio by purchasing and selling investment securities from\ntime to time. The Company manages the interest rate risk associated with interest bearing liabilities by managing the\ninterest rates and terms associated with wholesale borrowings and deposits from customers which the Company relies on\nfor funding. For example, the Company occasionally uses special offers on deposits to alter the interest rates and terms\nassociated with interest bearing liabilities.\nThe Company has entered into certain hedging transactions including interest rate swaps and caps, which are\ndesigned to lessen elements of the Company’s interest rate exposure. Cash flow hedge relationships mitigate exposure to\nthe variability of future cash flows or other forecasted transactions. The Company utilizes cash flow hedges to manage\ninterest rate exposure for the brokered deposit and wholesale borrowing portfolios. At both September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, these cash flow hedges had a total notional amount of $308.0 million. Fair value hedge relationships\nmitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or value. The Company utilizes fair value hedges to\nmanage fair value exposure for the U.S. treasury security portfolio. At September 30, 2024, these fair value hedges had a\ntotal notional amount of $97.7 million. There were no fair value hedges at December 31, 2023. In the event that interest\nrates do not change in the manner anticipated, such transactions may adversely affect the Company’s results of\noperations.\nNet Interest Income Simulation\nThe Company uses a net interest income simulation model to measure and evaluate potential changes in net\ninterest income that would result over the next 12 months from immediate and sustained changes in interest rates as of\nthe measurement date. This model has inherent limitations and the results are based on a given set of rate changes and\nassumptions as of a certain point in time. For purposes of the simulation, the Company assumes no growth in either\ninterest-sensitive assets or liabilities over the next 12 months; therefore, the model’s results reflect an interest rate shock\nto a static balance sheet. The simulation model also incorporates various other assumptions, which the Company\nbelieves are reasonable but which may have a significant impact on results, such as: (1) the timing of changes in interest\nrates, (2) shifts or rotations in the yield curve, (3) re-pricing characteristics for market-rate-sensitive instruments,\n(4) differing sensitivities of financial instruments due to differing underlying rate indices, (5) varying loan prepayment\nspeeds for different interest rate scenarios, (6) the effect of interest rate limitations in assets, such as floors and caps, and\n(7) overall growth and repayment rates and product mix of assets and liabilities. Because of the limitations inherent in\nany approach used to measure interest rate risk, simulation results are not intended as a forecast of the actual effect of a\nchange in market interest rates on the results, but rather as a means to better plan and execute appropriate asset-liability\nmanagement strategies and to manage interest rate risk.\nPotential changes to the Company’s net interest income in hypothetical rising and declining rate scenarios\ncalculated as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are presented in the table below. The projections assume an\nimmediate, parallel shift downward of the yield curve of 100, 200, and 300 basis points and immediate, parallel shifts\n66\nupward of the yield curve of 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis points. In the current interest rate environment, a downward\nshift of the yield curve of 400 basis points does not provide us with meaningful results and thus is not presented.\n(dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nChange (basis points) Forecasted Percentage Forecasted Percentage\nin Interest Rates Net Interest Change Net Interest Change\n(12-Month Projection) Income from Base Income from Base\n+400 $ 109,509 (6.58)% $ 118,597 (2.39)%\n+300 110,994 (5.31) 118,983 (2.08)\n+200 112,118 (4.35) 119,395 (1.74)\n+100 114,416 (2.39) 119,916 (1.31)\n0 117,218 — 121,504 —\n−100 120,865 3.11 125,138 2.99\n−200 124,853 6.51 128,643 5.87\n−300 130,226 11.10 132,269 8.86\nThe table above indicates that as of September 30, 2024, in the event of an immediate and sustained 400 basis\npoint increase in interest rates, the Company would experience a 6.58% decrease in net interest income. In the event of\nan immediate 300 basis point decrease in interest rates, the Company would experience an 11.10% increase in net\ninterest income.\nThe results of this simulation analysis are hypothetical, and a variety of factors might cause actual results to\ndiffer substantially from what is depicted. For example, if the timing and magnitude of interest rate changes differ from\nthose projected, net interest income might vary significantly. Non-parallel yield curve shifts such as a flattening or\nsteepening of the yield curve or changes in interest rate spreads would also cause net interest income to be different from\nthat depicted. An increasing interest rate environment could reduce projected net interest income if deposits and other\nshort-term liabilities re-price faster than expected or re-price faster than the Company’s assets. Actual results could differ\nfrom those projected if the Company grows assets and liabilities faster or slower than estimated, if the Company\nexperienced a net outflow of deposit liabilities, or if the mix of assets and liabilities otherwise changes. Actual results\ncould also differ from those projected if the Company experienced substantially different repayment speeds in the loan\nportfolio than those assumed in the simulation model. Finally, these simulation results do not contemplate all the actions\nthat the Company may undertake in response to potential or actual changes in interest rates, such as changes to the\nCompany’s loan, investment, deposit, or funding strategies.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the\ndesign and operation of the Company’s “disclosure controls and procedures” (as that term is defined in\nRule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024, the end of\nthe fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer\nand Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company’s disclosure controls and\nprocedures were effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or\nsubmits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in\nthe SEC’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Chief\nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the\nperiod covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially\naffect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n67\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nNeither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is a party, and no property of these entities is subject, to any\nmaterial pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the Bank’s business. The\nCompany does not know of any proceeding contemplated by a governmental authority against the Company or any of its\nsubsidiaries.\nItem 1.A. Risk Factors\nOther than disclosed below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in the Company’s\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 7, 2024.\nTransaction-Related Risks\nThe Company May Fail to Realize the Anticipated Benefits of the Proposed Merger with First Minnetonka City Bank.\nBridgewater Bank and First Minnetonka City Bank have operated and, until the consummation of the proposed\nmerger, will continue to operate, independently. The success of the merger, including anticipated benefits and cost\nsavings, will depend on, among other things, the Company’s ability to combine the businesses of Bridgewater Bank and\nFirst Minnetonka City Bank in a manner that permits growth opportunities, including, among other things, enhanced\nrevenues and revenue synergies, an expanded market reach and operating efficiencies, and does not materially disrupt\nthe existing customer relationships of Bridgewater Bank and First Minnetonka City Bank nor result in decreased\nrevenues due to any loss of customers. If the Company is not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the\nanticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. Failure\nto achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and\ndiversion of management’s time and energy and could have an adverse effect on the surviving corporation’s business,\nfinancial condition, operating results, prospects and stock price.\nWhile individuals employed by First Minnetonka City Bank immediately prior to the effective time will\nautomatically become employees of Bridgewater Bank following the merger, certain employees may not be retained by\nBridgewater Bank after the merger. In addition, certain employees that the Company wishes to retain may elect to\nterminate their employment as a result of the merger, which could delay or disrupt the integration process. It is possible\nthat the integration process could result in the disruption of the Company’s or FMB’s ongoing businesses or cause\ninconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the ability of Bridgewater Bank and\nFirst Minnetonka City Bank to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated\nbenefits and cost savings of the merger.\nAmong the factors considered by the boards of directors of both the Company and FMB in connection with\ntheir respective approvals of the merger agreement were the anticipated benefits that could result from the merger. There\ncan be no assurance that these benefits will be realized within the time periods contemplated or at all.\n68\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nIssuer Repurchases of Equity Securities\nThe following table presents stock purchases made during the third quarter of 2024:\nTotal Number of Ma ximum Approximate\nShares Purchased as Dollar Value of Shares\nAverage Part of Publicly that May Yet Be\nTotal Number of Price Paid Announced Plans or Purchased Under the\nPeriod Shares Purchased (1) Per Share Programs (2) Plans or Programs\nJuly 1 - 31, 2024 1,078 $ 11.52 — $ 15,281,253\nAugust 1 - 31, 2024 — — — 15,281,253\nSeptember 1 - 30, 2024 2,633 13.60 — 15,281,253\nTotal 3,711 $ 13.00 — $ 15,281,253\n(1) The total number of shares repurchased during the periods indicated includes shares repurchased as part of the Company’s stock repurchase\nprogram and shares withheld for income tax purposes in connection with vesting of restricted stock and stock options. The shares were purchased\nor otherwise valued at the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of purchase and/or withholding.\n(2) On August 17, 2022, the Company’s board of directors approved a stock repurchase program which authorizes the Company to repurchase up to\n$25.0 million of its common stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions. On July 23, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors extended\nthe expiration date of the stock repurchase program from August 16, 2024 to August 20, 2025. The stock repurchase program does not obligate\nthe Company to repurchase any shares of its common stock, and other than repurchases that have been completed to date, there is no assurance\nthat the Company will do so. Under the stock repurchase program, the Company may repurchase shares of common stock from time to time in\nopen market or privately negotiated transactions. The extent to which the Company repurchases its shares, and the timing of such repurchases,\nwill depend upon a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, regulatory requirements, availability of funds, and other\nrelevant considerations, as determined by the Company. The Company may, in its discretion, begin, suspend or terminate repurchases at any time\nprior to the Program’s expiration, without any prior notice.\nUnregistered Sales of Equity Securities\nNone.\nUse of Proceeds from Registered Securities\nNone.\nItem 3.

Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: interest rate\nrisk, including the effects of changes in interest rates; fluctuations in the values of the securities held in our securities portfolio, including as the result of changes in interest rates; business and economic conditions generally and in the\nfinancial services industry, nationally and within our market area, including the level and impact of inflation and possible recession; the effects of recent developments and events in the financial services industry, including the large-\nscale deposit withdrawals over a short period of time that resulted in recent bank failures; loan concentrations in our portfolio; the overall health of the local and national real estate market; our ability to successfully manage credit risk;\nour ability to maintain an adequate level of allowance for credit losses; new or revised accounting standards; the concentration of large loans to certain borrowers; the concentration of large deposits from certain clients, including those\nwho have balances above current Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance limits; our ability to successfully manage liquidity risk, which may increase our dependence on non-core funding sources such as brokered\ndeposits, and negatively impact our cost of funds; our ability to raise additional capital to implement our business plan; our ability to implement our growth strategy and manage costs effectively; the composition of our senior\nleadership team and our ability to attract and retain key personnel; talent and labor shortages and employee turnover; the occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches or failures of our or our third-party vendors’ information security\ncontrols or cybersecurity-related incidents, including as a result of sophisticated attacks using artificial intelligence and similar tools; interruptions involving our information technology and telecommunications systems or third-party\nservicers; competition in the financial services industry, including from nonbank competitors such as credit unions and “fintech” companies; the effectiveness of our risk management framework; the commencement and outcome of\nlitigation and other legal proceedings and regulatory actions against us; the impact of recent and future legislative and regulatory changes, including in response to recent bank failures; risks related to climate change and the negative\nimpact it may have on our customers and their businesses; the imposition of other governmental policies impacting the value of products produced by our commercial borrowers; severe weather, natural disasters, wide spread disease or\npandemics, acts of war or terrorism or other adverse external events, including the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and the Russian invasion of Ukraine; potential impairment to the goodwill the Company recorded in connection with\nour acquisitions; risks associated with our ongoing acquisition of First Minnetonka City Bank, including the possibility that the merger may be more difficult or expensive to accomplish than anticipated, diversion of management’s\nattention from daily operations and the effect of the proposed merger on the Company’s customer and employee relationships and operating results; changes to U.S. or state tax laws, regulations and guidance; potential changes in\nfederal policy and at regular agencies as a result of the upcoming 2024 presidential election; and any other risks described in the “Risk Factors” sections of reports filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAny forward-looking statement made by us in this presentation is based only on information currently available to us and speaks only as of the date on which it is made.

Core net interest margin (on a fully tax-equivalent basis), a non-\nGAAP financial measure which excludes the impact of loan fees, was 2.16% for the third quarter of 2024, a one basis point decline from\n2.17% in the second quarter of 2024, and an eight basis point decline from 2.24% in the third quarter of 2023.\n Net interest margin has remained stable at 2.24% each quarter in 2024.\n The year-over-year decline in the margin was primarily due to higher funding costs, offset partially by higher earning asset\nyields.\nNet interest income was $25.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $603,000 from $25.0 million in the second quarter of\n2024, and an increase of $178,000 from $25.4 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n The linked-quarter increase in net interest income was primarily due to increased cash balances, higher yields in the securities\nand loan portfolios and increased loan fees due to elevated loan payoffs, offset partially by decreased loan balances and higher\nrates paid on deposits.\n The year-over year increase in net interest income was primarily due to increased cash balances, growth and higher yields in the\nsecurities portfolio, and higher yields on loans, offset partially by growth and higher rates on deposits.\nInterest income was $63.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $2.1 million from $60.9 million in the second quarter of\n2024, and an increase of $6.2 million from $56.8 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n The yield on interest earning assets (on a fully tax-equivalent basis) was 5.48% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 5.41%\nin the second quarter of 2024 and 5.14% in the third quarter of 2023.\n The linked-quarter increase in the yield on interest earning assets was primarily due to continued repricing of assets at accretive\nyields.\n The year-over-year increase in the yield on interest earning assets was primarily due to the purchase of higher yielding securities\nand the repricing of the loan and securities portfolios in the higher interest rate environment.\n Loan interest income and loan fees remained one of the primary contributing factors to the changes in the yield on interest\nearning assets. The aggregate loan yield increased to 5.57% in the third quarter of 2024, seven basis points higher than 5.50% in\nthe second quarter of 2024, and 31 basis points higher than 5.26% in the third quarter of 2023.\n The core loan yield continued to rise as new loan originations and the existing portfolio reprice in the higher rate environment.\nA summary of interest and fees recognized on loans for the periods indicated is as follows:\nThree Months E nde d\nSeptember 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023\nInterest 5.47 % 5.42 % 5.31 % 5.25 % 5.16 %\nFees 0.10 0.08 0.07 0.08 0.10\nYield on Loans 5.57 % 5.50 % 5.38 % 5.33 % 5.26 %\nInterest expense was $37.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $1.5 million from $35.9 million in the second quarter of\n2024, and an increase of $6.0 million from $31.4 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n The cost of interest bearing liabilities was 4.27% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 4.19% in the second quarter of 2024\nand 3.81% in the third quarter of 2023.\n The linked-quarter increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to higher rates paid on deposits, offset\npartially by a decrease in the utilization of overnight borrowings.\n The year-over-year increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to continued deposit repricing in the\nhigher rate environment.\nPage 3 of 17\nInterest expense on deposits was $34.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $2.6 million from $31.6 million in the second\nquarter of 2024, and an increase of $7.0 million from $27.2 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n The cost of total deposits was 3.58% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 3.46% in the second quarter of 2024 and 2.99% in\nthe third quarter of 2023.\n The linked-quarter increase in the cost of total deposits was primarily due to continued client demand for higher interest rates and\nincreased competition.\n The year-over-year increase in the cost of total deposits was primarily due to upward repricing of the deposit portfolio in the\nhigher interest rate environment.\nProvision for Credit Losses\nThe provision for credit losses on loans was $-0- for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $600,000 for the second quarter of 2024 and\n$-0- for the third quarter of 2023.\n No provision for credit losses on loans was recorded in the third quarter of 2024. Although loans decreased during the quarter,\nincreased loss rates and other qualitative factor adjustments resulted in no provision for the quarter.\n The allowance for credit losses on loans to total loans was 1.38% at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.37% at June 30, 2024\nand 1.36% at September 30, 2023.\nThe provision for credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures was $-0- for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $-0- for the\nsecond quarter of 2024, and a negative provision of $600,000 for the third quarter of 2023.\n No provision was recorded during the third quarter of 2024 due to unfunded commitments remaining stable as the migration to\nfunded loans was offset by the volume of newly originated loans with unfunded commitments.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income was $1.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of $241,000 from $1.8 million for the second quarter of\n2024, and a decrease of $204,000 from $1.7 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n The linked-quarter decrease was primarily due to a net loss on sale of securities in the third quarter and a net gain on sale of\nsecurities in the second quarter.\n The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to $493,000 of FHLB prepayment income recognized in the previous year which\ndid not reoccur, offset partially by higher letter of credit fees, an increase in the cash surrender value of bank-owned life\ninsurance and an increase in other income.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense was $15.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $221,000 from $15.5 million for the second quarter of\n2024 and an increase of $523,000 from $15.2 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n The linked-quarter increase was primarily due to increases in professional and consulting fees related to the acquisition of First\nMinnetonka City Bank and salaries and employee benefits, offset partially by a decrease in data processing and derivative\ncollateral fees.\n The year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and employee benefits, higher professional and\nconsulting fees relating to the acquisition of First Minnetonka City Bank and increases in information technology and\ntelecommunications and marketing and advertising expenses, offset partially by a decrease in the FDIC insurance assessment and\nlower derivative collateral fees.\n The efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure, was 58.0% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 58.7% for the second\nquarter of 2024, and 56.1% for the third quarter of 2023.\n The Company had 265 full-time equivalent employees at September 30, 2024, compared to 258 at June 30, 2024, and 255 at\nSeptember 30, 2023.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective combined federal and state income tax rate was 23.6% for both the second and third quarter of 2024, compared to 23.0% for\nthe third quarter of 2023.\nPage 4 of 17\nBalance Sheet\nLoans\n(dollars in thousands) Se ptember 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 March 31, 2024 D ecember 31, 2023 Se ptember 30, 2023\nCommercial $ 493,403 $ 518,762 $ 483,069 $ 464,061 $ 459,854\nConstruction and Land Development 118,596 134,096 200,970 232,804 294,818\n1 -

The Company believes these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures, in addition to the related GAAP measures, provide meaningful information to investors to help them understand the Company’s\noperating performance and trends, and to facilitate comparisons with the performance of peers. These disclosures should not be viewed as\na substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance\nmeasures that may be presented by other companies. Reconciliations of non-GAAP disclosures used in this earnings release to the\ncomparable GAAP measures are provided in the accompanying tables.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis earnings release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements concerning plans,\nestimates, calculations, forecasts and projections with respect to the anticipated future performance of the Company. These statements are\noften, but not always, identified by words such as “may”, “might”, “should”, “could”, “predict”, “potential”, “believe”, “expect”,\n“continue”, “will”, “anticipate”, “seek”, “estimate”, “intend”, “plan”, “projection”, “would”, “annualized”, “target” and “outlook”, or the\nnegative version of those words or other comparable words of a future or forward-looking nature.\nForward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current\nbeliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the\neconomy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties,\nrisks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results and\nfinancial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of\nthese forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from\nthose indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: interest rate risk, including the effects of changes\nin interest rates; fluctuations in the values of the securities held in our securities portfolio, including as the result of changes in interest\nrates; business and economic conditions generally and in the financial services industry, nationally and within our market area, including\nthe level and impact of inflation and possible recession; the effects of developments and events in the financial services industry,\nincluding the large-scale deposit withdrawals over a short period of time that resulted in recent bank failures; loan concentrations in our\nportfolio; the overall health of the local and national real estate market; our ability to successfully manage credit risk; our ability to\nmaintain an adequate level of allowance for credit losses on loans; new or revised accounting standards; the concentration of large loans\nto certain borrowers; the concentration of large deposits from certain clients, including those who have balances above current FDIC\ninsurance limits; our ability to successfully manage liquidity risk, which may increase our dependence on non-core funding sources such\nas brokered deposits, and negatively impact our cost of funds; our ability to raise additional capital to implement our business plan; our\nability to implement our growth strategy and manage costs effectively; the composition of our senior leadership team and our ability to\nattract and retain key personnel; talent and labor shortages and employee turnover; the occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches or\nPage 7 of 17\nfailures of our or our third-party vendors’ information security controls or cybersecurity-related incidents, including as a result of\nsophisticated attacks using artificial intelligence and similar tools; interruptions involving our information technology and\ntelecommunications systems or third-party servicers; competition in the financial services industry, including from nonbank competitors\nsuch as credit unions and “fintech” companies; the effectiveness of our risk management framework; the commencement and outcome of\nlitigation and other legal proceedings and regulatory actions against us; the impact of recent and future legislative and regulatory changes,\nincluding in response to recent bank failures; risks related to climate change and the negative impact it may have on our customers and\ntheir businesses; the imposition of other governmental policies impacting the value of products produced by our commercial borrowers;\nsevere weather, natural disasters, wide spread disease or pandemics, acts of war or terrorism or other adverse external events, including\nthe ongoing conflict in the Middle East and the Russian invasion of Ukraine; potential impairment to the goodwill the Company recorded\nin connection with acquisitions; risks associated with our ongoing acquisition of First Minnetonka City Bank, including the possibility\nthat the merger may be more difficult or expensive to accomplish than anticipated, diversion of management's attention from daily\noperations and the effect of the proposed merger on the Company’s customer and employee relationships and operating results; changes\nto U.S. or state tax laws, regulations and guidance; potential changes in federal policy and at regulatory agencies as a result of the\nupcoming 2024 presidential election; and any other risks described in the “Risk Factors” sections of reports filed by the Company with\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAny forward-looking statement made by us in this press release is based only on information currently available to us and speaks only as\nof the date on which it is made.

LOUIS PARK, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  Bridgewater Bancshares, Inc. (Nasdaq: BWB) (“Bridgewater”), the parent company of Bridgewater Bank, and First Minnetonka City Bank announced today the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals, including approval from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Minnesota Department of Commerce, to complete Bridgewater Bank’s previously announced acquisition of First Minnetonka City Bank. The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. \n\n**About Bridgewater**\n\nBridgewater Bancshares, Inc. is a St. Louis Park, Minnesota-based financial holding company.

Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements concerning plans, estimates, calculations, forecasts and projections with respect to the anticipated future performance of Bridgewater. These statements are often, but not always, identified by words such as “may”, “might”, “should”, “could”, “predict”, “potential”, “believe”, “expect”, “continue”, “will”, “anticipate”, “seek”, “estimate”, “intend”, “plan”, “projection”, “would”, “annualized”, “target” and “outlook”, or the negative version of those words or other comparable words of a future or forward-looking nature. \n\nForward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: the possibility that any of the anticipated benefits of the proposed merger will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; the parties’ inability to meet expectations regarding the timing of the proposed merger; the challenges of integrating and retaining key employees; the risk that integration of First Minnetonka City Bank’s operations with those of Bridgewater Bank will be materially delayed or will be more costly or difficult than expected; changes to tax legislation and their potential effects on the accounting for the proposed merger; the failure of the proposed merger to close for any reason, including the failure to satisfy the closing conditions in the merger agreement prior to the completion of the proposed merger; diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business operations and opportunities due to the proposed merger; the effect of the proposed merger on Bridgewater Bank’s, First Minnetonka City Bank’s or the combined bank’s respective customer and employee relationships and operating results; the possibility that the proposed merger may be more expensive to complete than anticipated, including as a result of unexpected factors or events; the amount of First Minnetonka City Bank’s Tier 1 capital as of the closing date of the proposed merger and any potential adjustments to the merger consideration; changes in the global economy and financial market conditions and the business, results of operations and financial condition of Bridgewater Bank, First Minnetonka City Bank and the combined company; and any other risks described in the “Risk Factors” sections of reports filed by Bridgewater with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \n\nAny forward-looking statement made by us in this presentation is based only on information currently available to us and speaks only as of the date on which it is made.

Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements concerning plans, estimates, calculations, forecasts and projections with respect to the anticipated future performance of Bridgewater.

Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control.

Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: the possibility that any of the anticipated benefits of the proposed merger will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; the parties’ inability to meet expectations regarding the timing of the proposed merger; the challenges of integrating and retaining key employees; the risk that integration of First Minnetonka City Bank’s operations with those of Bridgewater Bank will be materially delayed or will be more costly or difficult than expected; changes to tax legislation and their potential effects on the accounting for the proposed merger; the failure of the proposed Merger to close for any reason, including the failure to satisfy other conditions to completion of the proposed Merger, including receipt of required regulatory and other approvals; diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business operations and opportunities due to the proposed merger; the effect of the announcement of the proposed merger on Bridgewater Bancshares, Inc.’s, First Minnetonka Bancorporation, Inc.’s or the combined company’s respective customer and employee relationships and operating results; the possibility that the proposed merger may be more expensive to complete than anticipated, including as a result of unexpected factors or events; the amount of First Minnetonka Bancorporation’s Tier 1 capital as of the closing date of the proposed merger and any potential downward adjustment in the merger consideration; changes in the global economy and financial market conditions and the business, results of operations and financial condition of Bridgewater Bancshares, Inc., First Minnetonka Bancorporation, Inc. and the combined company; and any other risks described in the “Risk Factors” sections of reports filed by Bridgewater Bancshares, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \n\nAny forward-looking statement made by us in this presentation is based only on information currently available to us and speaks only as of the date on which it is made.
