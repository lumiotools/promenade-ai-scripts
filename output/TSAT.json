With this milestone completed, Telesat now has all financing sources in place to fund the global Telesat Lightspeed network, including the satellites, launch vehicles to deploy them, an integrated terrestrial network of landing stations and points of presence throughout the world, and the business and operational support systems for the network. All amounts are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted.\n\nAs previously disclosed, the Government of Canada loan is for $2.14 billion and will carry a floating interest rate that is 4.75% above the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (CORRA) with a 15-year maturity. Interest is payable in-kind during the Telesat Lightspeed construction period, followed by a 10-year sculpted amortization. Furthermore, the Government of Canada is receiving warrants for 10% of the common shares of Telesat LEO based upon an equity valuation for Telesat LEO of US$3 billion. The Government of Quebec loan is for $400 million and has terms that largely mirror the Government of Canada loan but with warrants for 1.87%, in proportion to the smaller loan amount. The borrower under each loan, Telesat LEO Inc. (Telesat LEO), is a subsidiary of Telesat.\n\n“We are pleased to conclude these funding arrangements with the governments of Canada and Quebec as we make strong progress on the build-out of the revolutionary Telesat Lightspeed constellation, the largest space program in Canada’s history,” said Dan Goldberg, President and CEO of Telesat. “Telesat Lightspeed will help bridge the digital divide in Canada and throughout the world, create and sustain thousands of high-quality jobs in Canada, deliver billions of dollars of investment in the Canadian economy, spur domestic innovation and exports, and ensure that Canada and Quebec are at the forefront of the rapidly growing New Space Economy.”\n\nThe Telesat Lightspeed network is expected to play a critical role in bridging the digital divide by expanding the reach of internet and 5G networks in unserved and underserved communities in Canada and throughout the world, with affordable, high-speed broadband connectivity. In addition, the Telesat Lightspeed network is expected to help governments – including the Government of Canada – modernize their satellite communications technology and make meaningful contributions to North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) modernization to bolster defence for Canada and its allies.\n\nTelesat has increased its Canadian workforce by approximately 33% in the last 12 months and expects 2024 capital expenditures for the program to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.4 billion. Telesat plans to launch the first Telesat Lightspeed satellites in mid-2026. Since Telesat’s announcement of MDA Space as its prime satellite manufacturer in August 2023, MDA has selected and onboarded over 90 percent of the suppliers for the Telesat Lightspeed program.\n\n“Our government is focused on Canadians and today’s announcement with Telesat and MDA is our commitment in action. Designed, manufactured, and operated in Canada – the Telesat Lightspeed satellite network will be the largest in Canadian history – creating thousands of jobs, growing our economy, and getting high-speed internet to Canadians. We’re putting Canada at the forefront of opportunity, with a fair chance for everyone to succeed.” — The Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada\n\n“This is good news for our economy, not only are we consolidating 650 existing jobs, but we are creating nearly 1000 paying jobs in a cutting-edge sector. It is also a strategic project for Quebec. With the Telesat and MDA project, the message we are sending today is that Quebec continues to stand out. The future of aerospace is happening in Quebec!” — François Legault, Premier of Quebec\n\n“Today, we are cementing Canada’s position as a global leader in the new space economy. This investment will create high-skilled jobs, support innovation, and secure Canada’s telecommunications systems. This agreement with Telesat Lightspeed, the largest space program ever conceived and built in Canada, will have a significant impact on the growing network of Canadian suppliers and talent, offering critical support to the sector as it continues to flourish.” — The Honourable François-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry\n\n“This satellite network is an effective way to provide high-speed telecommunications across all regions of Quebec. We are proud to support these two companies as they drive technological innovation, helping to position Quebec as a true space industry leader. And we are even prouder to see that companies are locating here to take advantage of all that Québec has to offer!” — Christine Fréchette, Minister of Economy, Innovation and Energy, Minister responsible for Regional Economic Development and Minister responsible for the Metropolis and the Montréal region\n\n“High-speed Internet is no longer a luxury—it is a necessity. Today’s investment in Telesat’s _Lightspeed_ project will help the federal government achieve its goal of connecting all Canadians to high-speed Internet by 2030 so that they get better access to the services they need, no matter where they live.” — The Honourable Gudie Hutchings, Minister of Rural Economic Development and Minister responsible for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements Safe Harbor** This news release contains statements that are not based on historical fact and are “forward-looking statements’’ within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Canadian securities laws.

Statements � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � F-10\nF-1\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Telesat Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Telesat Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”)\nas of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income (loss), comprehensive income (loss),\nchanges in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023,\nand the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”)� In our opinion, the financial statements\npresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and\nits financial performance and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in\naccordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards\nBoard�\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based\non criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 27, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion\non the Company’s internal control over financial reporting�\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management� Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits� We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U�S� federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB�\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB� Those standards require that we plan\nand perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud� Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to\nthose risks� Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in\nthe financial statements� Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates\nmade by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements� We believe that our\naudits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion�\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments� The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion\non the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,\nproviding a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates�\nGoodwill and orbital slots (indefinite life intangible assets) impairment — Refer to Notes 4, 5, 17 and 18 of the\nfinancial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company’s evaluation of goodwill and orbital slots for impairment involves the comparison of the recoverable\namount of the Company for goodwill, and of the cash generating units for orbital slots, (the “recoverable amounts”)\nto their respective carrying values annually, or more frequently if indicators of impairment are identified� Recoverable\namounts are defined as the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use, which are determined using an\nincome approach based on a discounted cash flow and a market approach based on market multiples� In determining\nthe recoverable amounts, management made significant estimates and assumptions related to future revenue forecasts,\nF-2\nfuture expenses and capital expenditures, costs of disposal, discount rates and market multiples� In addition, the\nCompany plans to introduce new satellites under a Low Earth Orbit constellation (known as “Telesat Lightspeed”)\nwhich significantly impacts the estimated cash flows used in determining the recoverable amount of the Company�\nThe Company performed its annual impairment tests for goodwill and orbital slots in the fourth quarter of 2023�\nBased on the results of the annual impairment tests, the recoverable amounts exceeded their carrying values and no\nimpairment to goodwill or orbital slots was recorded� Subsequent to the annual impairment tests, the Company identified\nindicators of impairment related to orbital slots and performed additional impairment tests as of December 31, 2023�\nThe carrying value of orbital slots exceeded its recoverable amount and the Company recorded an impairment loss�\nWhile there are several estimates and assumptions that are required to determine the recoverable amounts, the\nestimates with the highest degree of subjectivity are future cash flows (future revenue forecasts and future capital\nexpenditures), discount rates and market multiples (“key assumptions”)� This required significant auditor attention as\nthe key assumptions are subject to a high degree of judgment and there is limited historical data available for Telesat\nLightspeed which resulted in an increased extent of audit effort, including the involvement of fair value specialists�\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amounts for each impairment\ntest included the following, among others:\n• Evaluated the effectiveness of the internal controls over the assessments of goodwill and orbital slots for\nimpairment, including those over the key assumptions;\n• Evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast future cash flows by comparing actual results to\nhistorical forecasts;\n• Evaluated the reasonableness of the future cash flows for:\n• Revenue forecast by comparing it to historical revenue, contracted revenue including backlogs of\nexisting service contracts, results of the ongoing discussions with customers, due diligence reports,\nindustry reports in respect of demand for satellite capacity and pricing, and communications to the\nboard of directors and external stakeholders;\n• Future capital expenditures by comparing it to signed contracts, an independently developed\nestimate for future costs based on signed contracts, due diligence reports, industry reports, and\ncommunications to the board of directors and external stakeholders;\n• With the assistance of fair value specialists:\n• Evaluated the reasonableness of the discount rates by testing the source information underlying the\ndetermination of the discount rates and developing a range of independent estimates and comparing\nto those selected by management;\n• Evaluated the market multiples by analyzing precedent market transactions and comparable public\ncompany multiples and developing a range of independent market multiples and comparing to those\nselected by management�\n/s/ Deloitte LLP\nChartered Professional Accountants\nLicensed Public Accountants\nToronto, Canada\nMarch 27, 2024\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1993�\nF-3\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Telesat Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Telesat Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”)\nas of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued\nby the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)� In our opinion, the Company\nmaintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based\non criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO�\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, of\nthe Company and our report dated March 27, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements�\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and\nfor its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting� Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit� We are a public accounting firm registered\nwith the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company’s in accordance with the U�S� federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB�\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB� Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects� Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating\neffectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered\nnecessary in the circumstances� We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion�\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding\nthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles� A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies\nand procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect\nthe transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations\nof management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on\nthe financial statements�\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements�\nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate�\n/s/ Deloitte LLP\nChartered Professional

Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)\n1. BACKGROUND OF THE COMPANY\nTelesat Corporation (the “Corporation” or “Company”) was incorporated under the Business Corporations Act\n(British Columbia) in October 2020 and is headquartered in Ottawa, Canada.\nThe Corporation is a global satellite operator, providing mission-critical communications solutions to support\nthe requirements of sophisticated satellite users throughout the world. The Company’s state-of-the-art fleet consists of\n15 geostationary satellites and the Canadian payload on Viasat-1.\nThe Corporation is developing a constellation of low earth orbit (“LEO”) satellites and integrated terrestrial\ninfrastructure, called “Telesat Lightspeed”. In January 2018, the first LEO satellite, LEO 1, was successfully launched\ninto orbit. The LEO 1 satellite has demonstrated certain key features of the Telesat Lightspeed system design,\nspecifically the capability of the satellite and customer terminals to deliver a low latency broadband experience.\nIn July 2023, the Corporation successfully launched its LEO 3 satellite into orbit.\nThe Corporation began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and the Toronto Stock Exchange on\nNovember 19, 2021 under the ticker symbol “TSAT”. This followed the closing of Telesat Canada’s transaction with\nLoral Space & Communications Inc. (“Loral”) and Public Sector Pension Investment Board (“PSP Investments”) (the\n“Transaction”), in which Loral’s stockholders and Telesat Canada’s other equity holders exchanged their interests for\nequity in the new public holding company.\nThe Transaction resulted in the Loral stockholders, PSP Investments and certain individual shareholders (other\nthan the Voting Directors) of Telesat Canada owning indirectly through the Corporation and Telesat Partnership LP\n(the “Partnership”) approximately the same percentage of equity as they held in Telesat Canada; the Corporation\nbecoming the publicly traded general partner of the Partnership; and the Partnership indirectly owning all of the\neconomic interests in Telesat Canada and Loral becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership.\nFor further details on the Transaction, refer to the Corporation’s Registration Statement on Form F-4 filed with\nthe U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on June 24, 2021, which can be obtained on the SEC’s website\nat https://www.sec.gov and the Non-Offering Prospectus filed with the Ontario Securities Commission (“OSC”) on\nNovember 16, 2021, which can be obtained on the website https://www.sedarplus.ca.\nReferences herein to “Telesat” or “Company” refer to Telesat Corporation and its subsidiaries.\nUnless the context states or requires otherwise, references herein to the “financial statements” or similar terms\nrefer to the audited consolidated financial statements of Telesat.\nOn March 27, 2024, these financial statements were approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors\nand authorized for issue.\n2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nStatement of Compliance\nThe consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting\nStandards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”). The accounting policies in\nNote 4 were consistently applied to all years presented.\nBasis of Consolidation\nSubsidiaries\nThese consolidated financial statements include the results of the Telesat and subsidiaries controlled by the\nCompany. Control is achieved when the Company has power over an entity, has exposure, or rights to variable returns\nfrom its involvement with an entity, and has the ability to use the power over an entity to affect the amount of its return.\nThe most significant subsidiaries are listed in Note 35.\nF-10\nTelesat Corporation\nNotes to the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n(all amounts in thousands of Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)\n2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION (cont.)\nThe portion of equity ownership in a subsidiary that is not directly or indirectly attributable to the Company is\naccounted for as non-controlling interest. Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the\nCompany’s equity therein. Those interests of non-controlling shareholders that are present ownership interests entitling\ntheir holders to a proportionate share of net assets upon liquidation may initially be measured at fair value or at the\nnon-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of\nmeasurement is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Other non-controlling interests are initially measured at\nfair value. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests\nat initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity.\nProfit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income (loss) are attributed to the owners of the\nCompany and to the non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive income (loss) of the subsidiaries is attributed to the\nowners of the Company and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having\na deficit balance.\nJoint arrangements\nA joint operation is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement\nhave rights to their share of the assets and revenue, and obligations for the liabilities and expenses, relating to the\narrangement.\nThe Company’s consolidated financial statements include the Company’s share of the assets, liabilities, revenue\nand expenses of its interest in joint operations.\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost basis except for certain financial\ninstruments which were measured at their fair values, as explained in the accounting policies below. Historical cost is\nbased on the fair value of the consideration given or received in exchange for assets or liabilities.\n3. CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICY\nAmendments to IAS 12, Income Taxes (“IAS 12”)\nIn May 2021, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 12.\nIn specified circumstances, companies are exempt from recognizing deferred tax when they recognize assets or\nliabilities for the first time. The amendments clarify that such initial recognition exemption does not apply to transactions\nin which equal amounts of deductible and taxable temporary differences arise on initial recognition. Accordingly,\nentities are required to recognize deferred tax associated with transactions, such as leases and decommissioning\nobligations, which give rise to equal and offsetting temporary differences.\nThe Company adopted the amendments effective for annual period beginning January 1, 2023. As a result of\nthe amendment, the Company was required to recognize deferred tax on the prepayment options associated with the\nSenior Unsecured Notes, Senior Secured Notes and 2026 Senior Secured Notes.\nAn adjustment was recorded as a decrease to the opening balance of accumulated earnings as at January 1, 2021\nin the amount of $1,412.\nThe cumulative impact on the balance sheet and statement of changes in shareholders’ equity was as follows:\nAs at December 31, 2022 2021\nDeferred tax liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ (4,450)\nAccumulated earnings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 1,071 $ 1,439\nNon-controlling interest . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 3,379 $ 4,491\nF-11\nTelesat Corporation\nNotes to the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n(all amounts in thousands of Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)\n3. CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICY (cont.)\nAs a result of the amendment, there was also a change in the reallocation related to Transaction in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 in the statement of changes in shareholders’ equity.\nThe impact on the statements of income (loss) and the statements of comprehensive income (loss) was as follows:\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 2021\nTax (expense) recovery . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ (1,480) $ 7,342\nNet income (loss) per common share attributable to Telesat Corporation\nshareholders – Basic . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ (0.03) $ 0.16\nNet income (loss) per common share attributable to Telesat Corporation\nshareholders – Diluted . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ (0.03) $ 0.16\n4. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company operates in a single operating segment, in which it provides satellite-based services to its broadcast,\nenterprise and consulting customers around the world. Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the\ninternal reporting provided to the Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is the Company’s Chief Executive\nOfficer. To be reported, a segment is usually based on quantitative thresholds but can also encompass qualitative\nfactors management deems significant.\nForeign Currency Translation\nUnless otherwise specified, all figures reported in the consolidated financial statements and associated note\ndisclosures are presented in Canadian dollars, which is the functional and presentation currency of the Company. Each\nof the subsidiaries of the Company determines its own functional currency and uses that currency to measure items\non their separate financial statements.\nFor the Company’s non-foreign operations, foreign currency non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at\ntheir historical exchange rates, foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the year-end exchange\nrates, and foreign denominated revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates of the month in\nwhich the transactions occurred. Gains or losses on translation of these items are recognized as a component of net\nincome (loss).\nUpon consolidation of the Company’s foreign operations that have a functional currency other than the Canadian\ndollar, assets and liabilities are translated at the year-end exchange rate, and revenue and expenses are translated at the\naverage exchange rates of the month in which the transactions occurred. Gains or losses on the translation of foreign\nsubsidiaries are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAll highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less, or which are available upon\ndemand with no penalty for early redemption, are classified as cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents\nare comprised of cash on hand, demand deposits, short-term investments and restricted cash expected to be used within\nthe next twelve months.\nRevenue Recognition\nTelesat recognizes revenue from satellite services on a monthly basis as services are performed in an amount\nthat reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those services. Telesat accounts for a\ncontract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms\nare identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability is considered probable.\nF-12\nTelesat Corporation\nNotes to the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n(all amounts in thousands of Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)\n4. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont.)\nRevenue from a contract to sell consulting services is recognized as follows:\n• Consulting revenue for cost plus contracts is recognized as the approved time and labor is completed by\nTelesat.\n• Fixed price consulting revenue contracts use an input method to determine the progress towards complete\nsatisfaction of the performance obligation. The input method is measured by comparing actual costs\nincurred to total cost expected.\nEquipment sale revenue is recognized when the customer obtains control of the equipment, being at the\ntime the equipment is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Only equipment sales are subject to warranty or\nreturn and there is no general right of return. Historically, the Company has not incurred significant expenses for\nwarranties.\nWhen a transaction involves more than one product or service, revenue is allocated to each performance obligation\nbased on its relative stand-alone selling price. Transactions are evaluated to determine whether the Company is the\nprincipal and if the transactions should be recorded on a gross or net basis.\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue represents the Company’s liability for the provision of future services and is classified on\nthe balance sheet in other current and long-term liabilities. Deferred revenue consists of remuneration received\nin advance of the provision of service and in the majority of cases is recognized in income on a straight-line basis\nover the term of the related customer contracts. In the case of certain deferred revenue for short-term services,\nbalances are recognized into income upon the completion or using an input method to determine the progress\ntowards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation of the related contract. Prepayments are evaluated\nto determine whether or not they constitute a significant financing component. The Company has elected a\npractical expedient whereby if the timing difference between the customer prepayment and the transfer of control\nof the promised goods and services is less than a year then it would not be considered as a significant financing\ncomponent.\nA significant financing component will only occur in the following circumstances:\n• There is a timing difference between when the control of goods or services is transferred to the customer\nand when the customer pays for the goods;\n• The timing difference between the customer prepayment and transfer of control of the promised goods and\nservices is in excess of one year; and\n• The primary reason for the prepayment is for financing purposes.\nIn the case of the existence of a significant financing component, the amount of the consideration is adjusted to\nreflect what the cash selling price of the promised service would have been if payments had occurred as control of the\nservice was transferred to the customer. The discount rate used in determining the significant financing component is\nthe rate that would be reflected in a separate financing transaction between the Company and the customer at contract\ninception.\nInventories\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value and consist of finished goods and work in\nprocess. Cost for substantially all network equipment inventories are determined on a weighted average cost basis.\nCost for work in process and certain one-of-a-kind finished goods are determined using the specific identification\nmethod.\nF-13\nTelesat Corporation\nNotes to the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n(all amounts in thousands of Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)\n4. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont.)\nBorrowing Costs\nBorrowing costs are incurred on the Company’s debt financing. Borrowing costs attributable to the acquisition,\nproduction or construction of a qualifying asset are added to the cost of that asset. The Company has defined a\nqualifying asset as an asset that takes longer than twelve months to be ready for its intended use or sale. Capitalization\nof borrowing costs continues until such time that the asset is substantially ready for its intended use or sale. Borrowing\ncosts are determined based on specific financing related to the asset, or in the absence of specific financing, the\nborrowing costs are calculated on the basis of a capitalization rate which is equal to the Company’s weighted average\ncost of debt. All other borrowing costs are expensed when incurred.\nLeases\nAt the inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease based on whether\nor not the contract conveys the right to control the use of the asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\nThe Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use\nasset is initially measured based on the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or\nbefore the commencement date, less any lease incentives received. Each individual lease liability is initially measured\nat the present value of the lease payments over the respective lease term, discounted using the Company’s incremental\nborrowing rate for that lease.\nThe lease term is the non-cancellable period determined for each of the leases considering the option to extend\nwhen it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option or the option to terminate if it is reasonably\ncertain that the Company will exercise the option.\nAfter the commencement date, the right-of-use assets are measured applying the cost model and depreciated to\nthe earlier of the end of the useful life of the asset or the end of the lease term on a straight-line basis. The lease liability\nis subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect the interest on the lease, using the effective\ninterest method, and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made.\nThe lease liability is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments, arising from a change in\nindex or rate, or if there is a change in the assessment of whether the Company will exercise a purchase, extension or\ntermination option. The amount of the remeasurement of the lease liability is also recognized as an adjustment to the\nright-of-use asset, or is recorded in the statement of income (loss) if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has\nbeen reduced to zero.\nThe Company has elected to not recognize a right-of-use asset or lease liability for any lease that has a lease term\nof 12 months or less. The payments associated with these agreements would be recognized as an operating expense on\na straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company has also elected the practical expedient, for property leases, not to separate the non-lease\ncomponents from the lease components, and instead account for each lease and any associated non-lease components\nwithin the contract as a single lease component.\nGovernment Grants\nGovernment grants are recognized where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and the\nattached conditions will be complied with.\nWhen the grant relates to an expense, the grant is recorded as a deduction to the related expense incurred over\nthe same period.\nWhen the grant relates to an asset, the grant is deducted from the carrying amount of the related asset as the\ngrant is receivable.\nF-14\nTelesat Corporation\nNotes to the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n(all amounts in thousands of Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)\n4. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont.)\nSoftware as a Service arrangements\nA Software as a Service (“SaaS”) cloud computing arrangement is evaluated as to whether it met the criteria\nunder IAS 38, Intangible Assets (“IAS 38”) or IFRS 16, Leases. If an arrangement did not meet either of those criteria,\nthe arrangement is accounted for as a service contract.\nTelesat may enter into a SaaS cloud computing arrangement with a supplier where the contract conveys to\nTelesat a right to receive future access over the contract term to the supplier’s application software running on the\nsupplier’s cloud infrastructure. The right to receive access does not provide Telesat with a software asset and, therefore,\nthe access to the software is a service which is received over the contract term.\nThe assessment of whether configuration or customization of a software results in an intangible asset for Telesat\ndepends on the nature and output of the configuration and customization performed. In some circumstances, the arrangement\nmay result in additional code from which Telesat has the power to obtain the future economic benefits and to restrict others’\naccess to those benefits. In that case, in determining whether to recognize the additional code as an intangible asset, Telesat\nassesses whether the additional code is identifiable and meets the recognition criteria under IAS 38.\nSeparately acquired intangible rights (i.e. software licenses in cloud computing arrangements) are normally\nrecognized as assets.\nSatellites, Property and Other Equipment\nSatellites, property and other equipment, which are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any\naccumulated impairment losses, include the contractual cost of equipment, capitalized engineering costs, capitalized\nborrowing costs during the construction or production of qualifying assets, and with respect to satellites, the cost of\nlaunch services, and launch insurance.\nDepreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the respective estimated useful lives of the assets.\nBelow are the estimated useful lives in years of satellites, property & other equipment as at December 31, 2023.\nYears\nSatellites 3 to 15\nRight-of-use assets 2 to 27\nAntennas, satellite control & communication equipment 5 to 20\nBuilding, equipment & other 3 to 25\nConstruction in progress is not depreciated as depreciation only commences when the asset is ready for its\nintended use. For satellites, depreciation commences on the day the satellite becomes available for service.\nThe investment in each satellite is derecognized when the satellite is retired. When other property is retired\nfrom operations at the end of its useful life, the cost of the asset and accumulated depreciation are removed from the\naccounts. Earnings are credited with the amount of any net salvage value and charged with any net cost of removal.\nWhen an asset is sold prior to the end of its useful life, the gain or loss is recognized immediately in other operating\ngains (losses), net.\nIn the event of an unsuccessful launch or total in-orbit satellite failure, all unamortized costs that are not\nrecoverable under launch or in-orbit insurance are recorded in other operating gains (losses), net.\nLiabilities related to decommissioning and restoration of retiring property and other equipment are measured at\nfair value with a corresponding increase to the carrying amount of the related asset. The liability is accreted over the\nperiod of expected cash flows with a corresponding charge to interest expense. The liabilities recorded to date have not\nbeen significant and are reassessed at the end of each reporting period. There are no decommissioning or restoration\nobligations for satellites.\nF-15\nTelesat Corporation\nNotes to the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n(all amounts in thousands of Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)\n4. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont.)\nSatellite Performance Incentive Payments\nSatellite performance incentive payments are obligations payable to satellite manufacturers over the lives of\ncertain satellites. The present value of the payments is capitalized as part of the cost of the satellite and recognized as\npart of the depreciation of the satellite.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nTangible fixed assets and finite life intangible assets are assessed for impairment on an annual basis or more\nfrequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset exceeds the recoverable\namount. Tangible fixed assets and finite life intangible assets are also assessed for indicators of impairment or\nimpairment reversals at each reporting period.\nIn cases where there are indicators of impairment, the recoverable amount of the asset, which is the higher of\nits fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use, is determined. If it is not possible to measure the recoverable\namount for a particular asset, the Company determines the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit (“CGU”)\nwith which it is associated. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows which are\nlargely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.\nThe Company measures value in use on the basis of the estimated future cash flows to be generated by an asset\nor CGU. These future cash flows are based on the Company’s latest business plan information and are discounted using\nrates that best reflect the time value of money and the specific risks associated with the underlying asset or assets in\nthe CGU.\nThe fair value less costs of disposal is the price that would be received to sell an asset or CGU in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date. For the impairment assessment, the fair value is\ncalculated on a recurring basis and is calculated using Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nAn impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable\namount. When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or a CGU) is increased\nto the revised measure of its recoverable amount, so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying\namount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset (or CGU) in prior years.\nImpairment losses and reversals of impairment losses are recognized in other operating gains (losses), net.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which establishes\nspecific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess\nbetween the total of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets acquired. After initial recognition at\ncost, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.\nThe Company distinguishes intangible assets between assets with finite and indefinite useful lives. Intangible\nassets with indefinite useful lives are comprised of the Company’s trade name, intellectual property, and orbital slots.\nThese assets are carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Finite life intangible assets, which are carried\nat cost less accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment losses, consist of revenue backlog, customer\nrelationships, customer contracts, concession rights, transponder rights, software and patents. Intangible assets with\nfinite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method of amortization, except for\nrevenue backlog which is based on the expected period of recognition of the related revenue.\nF-16\nTelesat Corporation\nNotes to the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n(all amounts in thousands of Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)\n4. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont.)\nBelow are the estimated useful lives in years of the finite life intangible assets as at December 31, 2023.\nYears\nRevenue backlog 17\nCustomer relationships 20 to 21\nCustomer contracts 15\nConcession rights 3 to 15\nTransponder rights 16\nSoftware 5\nPatents 18\nImpairment of Goodwill and Indefinite Life Intangible Assets\nAn assessment for impairment of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets is performed annually, or more\nfrequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets are likely\nto exceed their recoverable amount. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the entity level as this represents the lowest\nlevel within the Company at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, and is not larger than\nan operating segment. With the exception of trade name, which has not been allocated to any CGU and is tested for\nimpairment at the asset level, indefinite life intangible assets are tested for impairment at the CGU level. In the case\nof orbital slots, the CGU is based on geography.\nA quantitative impairment test consists of assessing the recoverable amount of an asset, which is the higher of its\nfair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. For the quantitative impairment assessment, fair value is calculated\non a recurring basis and is calculated using Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy depending on the valuation\napproach being utilized.\nImpairment losses are recognized in other operating gains (losses), net. For indefinite life intangible assets,\nreversals of impairment losses are also recognized in other operating gains (losses), net.\nOrbital Slots\nIn performing the orbital slot impairment analysis, the Company determines, for each CGU, the recoverable\namount. The recoverable amount is defined as the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal, and its value in use on\nan annual basis. To the extent that the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment\nexists and the asset is written down to its recoverable amount.\nFair value less costs of disposal is the price that would be received to sell the CGU in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement date. In order to determine the fair value less costs of disposal,\nthe Company uses either a market or income approach. Under a market approach, the Company measures what an\nindependent third party would pay to purchase the orbital slots by looking to actual market transactions for similar\nassets. Under an income approach, the fair value is determined to be the sum of the projected discounted cash flows\nover a discrete period of time.\nThe value in use amount is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the CGU.\nThe determination of this amount includes projections of cash inflows from the continuing use of the asset and cash\noutflows that are required to generate the associated cash inflows. These cash flows are discounted at an appropriate\ndiscount rate.\nGoodwill\nIn performing the goodwill impairment analysis, the Company assesses the recoverable amount of goodwill. The\nrecoverable amount is the higher of the income approach and the market approach.\nF-17\nTelesat Corporation\nNotes to the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n(all amounts in thousands of Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)\n4. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont.)\nUnder the income approach, the sum of the projected discounted cash flows for the next five years, or a longer\nperiod if justified by the most recent financial plan approved by management, in addition to a terminal value are used\nto determine the fair value at the entity level.\nUnder the market approach, the fair value at the entity level is determined based on market multiples derived\nfrom comparable public companies.\nUnder both approaches, all assumptions used are based on management’s best estimates. The discount rates are\nconsistent with external sources of information.\nTrade Name\nFor the purposes of impairment testing, the fair value of the trade name is determined using an income approach,\nspecifically the relief from royalties method.\nThe relief from royalties method is comprised of two major steps:\ni) a determination of the hypothetical royalty rate; and\nii) the subsequent application of the royalty rate to projected revenue.\nIn determining the hypothetical royalty rate in the relief from royalties method, the Company considered\ncomparable license agreements, operating earnings benchmarks, an excess earnings analysis to determine aggregate\nintangible asset earnings, and other qualitative factors.\nIntellectual Property\nIn performing the intellectual property impairment analysis, the Company determines its recoverable amount.\nThe recoverable amount is the fair value less costs of disposal. To the extent that the recoverable amount is less than\nthe carrying value of the asset, an impairment exists and the asset is written down to its recoverable amount.\nThe Company measures value in use on the basis of the estimated future cash flows to be generated by an asset.\nThese future cash flows are based on the Company’s latest business plan information approved by senior management\nand are discounted using rates that best reflect the time value of money and the specific risks associated with the\nunderlying asset.\nFinancial Instruments\nFinancial assets are initially recognized at fair value. Financial assets are measured using one of three measurement\napproaches (fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”), fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVTOCI”),\nor amortized cost). A financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it is not designated as FVTPL, it is held within a\nbusiness model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows and its contractual terms give rise on\nspecified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. A debt\ninvestment is measured at FVTOCI if it is not designated at FVTPL, it is held within a business model whose objective\nis achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and its contractual terms give rise on\nspecified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amounts outstanding.\nOn initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Company may irrevocably elect to present\nsubsequent changes in the investment’s fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment by investment basis.\nAll financial assets not classified as measured at amortized cost or FVTOCI as described above are measured at FVTPL.\nTelesat does not have any financial assets measured at FVTOCI as at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe following accounting policies apply to the subsequent measurement of the Company’s financial assets:\n• Amortized cost: The financial assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost in accordance with\nthe effective interest method. The amortized cost is reduced by any impairment losses; and\nF-18\nTelesat Corporation\nNotes to the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n(all amounts in thousands of Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)\n4. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont.)\n• FVTPL: These financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes in fair value\nrecorded in the consolidated statement of income (loss) as part of gain (loss) on changes in fair value of\nfinancial instruments.\nFinancial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Financial liabilities are classified as amortized cost\nor FVTPL. Financial liabilities that are classified as amortized cost are measured and recorded at amortized cost in\naccordance with the effective interest method. Financial liabilities classified as FVTPL are subsequently measured at\nfair value with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statement of income (loss) as part of the gain (loss)\non changes in fair value of financial instruments.\nThe Company has used derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign exchange risk\nassociated with debt denominated in foreign currencies, as well as to reduce its exposure to interest rate risk associated\nwith debt. Currently, the Company does not designate any of its derivative financial instruments as hedging instruments\nfor accounting purposes. All realized and unrealized gains and losses on these derivative financial instruments are\nrecorded in the consolidated statement of income (loss) as part of gain (loss) on changes in fair value of financial\ninstruments.\nDerivatives, including embedded derivatives that must be separately accounted for, are recorded at fair value\non the consolidated balance sheet at inception and marked to market at each reporting period thereafter. Derivatives\nembedded in financial liabilities and other non-financial instrument contracts are treated as separate derivatives when\ntheir risk and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is measured\nseparately according to its characteristics. The Company accounts for embedded foreign currency derivatives and the\nrelated host contract as a single instrument where the contract requires payments denominated in the currency that\nis commonly used in contracts to procure non-financial items in the economic environment in which the Company\ntransacts.\nTransaction costs for instruments classified as FVTPL are expensed as incurred. Transaction costs that are\ndirectly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets and liabilities (other than FVTPL) are added or deducted from\nthe fair value of the financial asset or financial liability on initial recognition.\nThe Company’s financial assets classified as amortized cost and contract assets are subject to impairment\nrequirements. The Company has elected to measure loss allowances for trade receivables and other contract assets at\nan amount equal to lifetime expected credit loss. The lifetime expected credit losses are the expected credit losses that\nresult from possible default events over the expected life of the instrument.\nFinancing Costs\nThe debt issuance costs related to the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the 6.5% Senior Unsecured Notes (“Senior\nUnsecured Notes”), the 4.875% Senior Secured Notes (“Senior Secured Notes”) and the 5.625% Senior Secured\nNotes (“2026 Senior Secured Notes”) are included in current and long-term indebtedness and are amortized to interest\nexpense using the effective interest method. All other debt issuance costs are accounted for as short-term and long-term\ndeferred charges and are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other long-term assets. The deferred\ncharges are amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the indebtedness to which they relate.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nTelesat Canada maintains one contributory and three non-contributory defined benefit pension plans which\nprovide benefits based on length of service and rate of pay. Two of these defined-benefit plans were closed to new\nmembers in 2013. Effective January 1, 2024, the Pension Plan for Employees of Telesat Canada and the Pension Plan\nfor Designated Employees of Telesat Canada were merged into one plan, the Pension Plan for Employees of Telesat\nF-19\nTelesat Corporation\nNotes to the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n(all amounts in thousands of Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)\n4. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont.)\nCanada, subject to final regulatory filings and approvals. The combined plan is closed entirely to new members with\nrespect to the defined benefit provisions. The merged plan offers a defined contribution pension to all employees of\nTelesat Canada and Telesat LEO Inc. effective January 1, 2024.\nTelesat Canada also provides other post-employment and retirement benefits, including health care and life\ninsurance benefits on retirement and various disability plans, worker’s compensation and medical benefits to former\nor inactive employees of Telesat Canada, their beneficiaries and covered dependents, after employment but before\nretirement, under certain circumstances.\nIn addition, Telesat Canada provides defined contribution pension plans, under certain circumstances, for\nemployees who are not eligible for the defined benefit pension plans.\nTelesat also provides health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees. These benefits\nare funded primarily on a pay-as-you-go basis, with the retiree paying a portion of the cost through contributions,\ndeductibles and co-insurance provisions. Commencing in 2015, as a result of an amendment to one of the plans,\nTelesat has contributed to a health reimbursement account instead of providing the health care and life insurance\nbenefits directly to certain retired employees.\nAs a result of the Transaction, the Company has become responsible for the defined benefit plan and health\nand life insurance benefits for retired employees of Loral. Loral maintained a defined benefit pension plan for its\nemployees. Loral pension plan is a qualified defined benefit pension plan in which only the employees hired prior\nto July 1, 2006 could participate. Benefits are based primarily on members’ compensation and/or years of service.\nIn addition to pension plan, certain health care and life insurance benefits are also provided to retired employees and\ndependents. Healthcare benefits end when the retiree reaches age 65.\nThe Company is responsible for adequately funding the defined benefit pension plans. Contributions are made\nbased on actuarial cost methods that are permitted by pension regulatory bodies and reflect assumptions about future\ninvestment returns, salary projections and future service benefits.\nCosts for defined contribution pension plans are recognized as an expense during the year in which the employees\nhave rendered service entitling them to the Company’s contribution.\nThe Company accrues the present value of its obligations under employee benefit plans and the related costs\nreduced by the fair value of plan assets. Pension costs and other retirement benefits are determined using the projected\nunit credit method prorated on service and management’s best estimate of expected investment performance, salary\nescalation, retirement ages of employees and expected health care costs.\nPension plan assets are valued at fair value. The discount rate is based on the market interest rate of high quality\nbonds. Past service costs arising from plan amendments are recognized immediately to the extent that the benefits\nare already vested, and otherwise are amortized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining vesting period.\nA valuation is performed at least every three years to determine the present value of the accrued pension and other\nretirement benefits.\nRemeasurements arising from defined benefit pension plans comprise actuarial gains and losses and the return\non plan assets (excluding interest). The Company recognizes them immediately in other comprehensive income (loss),\nwhich is included in accumulated earnings, in the year in which they occur.\nThe current service costs and administration fees not related to asset management are included in operating\nexpenses. The net interest expense (income) on the net defined benefit liability (asset) for the period is calculated by\napplying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the year to the net defined\nbenefit liability (asset) at the beginning of the year while considering any changes in the net defined benefit liability\n(asset) during the year as a result of contributions and benefit payments. The net interest expense (income) is included\nin interest expense.\nF-20\nTelesat Corporation\nNotes to the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n(all amounts in thousands of Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)\n4. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont.)\nShare-Based Compensation Plans\nThe Company offers equity-settled share-based compensation plans for certain key employees under which it\nreceives services from employees in exchange for equity instruments of the Company. The expense is based on the\nfair value of the awards granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The expense is recognized over the\nvesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are satisfied, with a corresponding\nincrease in equity. For awards with graded vesting, the fair value of each tranche is recognized over the respective\nvesting period with a significant higher proportionate amount of the total expense being recognized earlier in the\nvesting period.\nRestricted Share Units, Performance Share Units and Deferred Share Units\nFor each restricted share unit (“RSU”), performance share unit (“PSU”) or deferred share unit (“DSU”) an\nexpense is recorded over the vesting period equal to the fair value of the Non-Voting Participating Preferred shares\nprior to the close of the Transaction and equal to the fair value of the either Class A Common shares or Class B Variable\nVoting shares of Telesat Corporation after the close of the Transaction, with a corresponding increase in equity. For\nawards with graded vesting, the fair value of each tranche is recognized over the respective vesting period with a\nsignificant higher proportionate amount of the total expense being recognized earlier in the vesting period. All RSU’s,\nPSU’s and DSU’s, including those issued prior to the close of the Transaction, are expected to be settled in either\nClass A Common shares or Class B Variable Voting shares of Telesat Corporation.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense, comprising current and deferred income tax, is recognized in income except to the extent\nit relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) or equity, in which case the income tax expense is\nrecognized in other comprehensive income (loss) or equity, respectively.\nCurrent income tax is measured at the amount expected to be paid to the taxation authorities, net of recoveries,\nbased on the tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted as at the balance sheet date.\nDeferred taxes are the result of temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities\nand their carrying amount. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply\nin the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted\nor substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary\ndifferences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary\ndifference can be utilized.\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that\nit is no longer probable that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at\neach balance sheet date and recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow\nthe deferred tax assets to be recovered.\nDeferred tax assets are netted against the deferred tax liabilities when they relate to income taxes levied by the\nsame taxation authority on either:\ni) the same taxable entity; or\nii) different taxable entities which intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realize\nthe assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of\ndeferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.\nF-21\nTelesat Corporation\nNotes to the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n(all amounts in thousands of Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)\n4. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont.)\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences except when the deferred tax liability\narises from the initial recognition of goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is\nnot a business combination. For taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, a deferred\ntax liability is recognized unless the parent can control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is\nprobable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\nEarnings Per Share\nFor periods prior to the close of the Transaction, basic earnings per share are computed based upon the weighted\naverage number of Common Shares, Non-Voting Participating Preferred Shares and Voting Participating Preferred\nShares of Telesat Canada. The quantity of these shares has been recalculated to take into effect the conversion of\nshares that have occurred during the Transaction. As there was no non-controlling interest in the period prior to the\nclose of the Transaction, all converted amounts have been included as Class A Common Shares, Class B Variable\nVoting Shares, Class C Fully Voting Shares and Class C Limited Voting Shares of Telesat Corporation.\nFor periods subsequent to the close of the Transaction, basic earnings per share are computed based upon the\nweighted average number of Class A Common Shares, Class B Variable Voting Shares, Class C Fully Voting Shares\nand Class C Limited Voting Shares during each period. Variable Voting and Limited Voting shares are in all respects\nidentical to and treated equally to voting common shares.\nFor periods prior to the close of the Transaction, diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted average\nnumber of common shares as calculated in the basic earnings per share, adjusted for the effect of unvested or\nunconverted RSUs and stock options that have a dilutive effect. The average market value of the Company’s shares for\nthe purpose of calculating the dilutive effect of the stock options was based on calculated share price of the shares of\nTelesat Canada, adjusted to consider the impact of the Transaction.\nFor periods subsequent to the close of the Transaction, diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted\naverage number of Common, Limited Voting and Variable Voting shares outstanding during each period, adjusted\nfor the effect of unvested or unconverted RSUs, PSUs, DSUs and stock options which have a dilutive effect.\nFor 2021, the average market value of the Company’s shares for the purposes of calculating the dilutive effect\nof the stock options was based on the quoted market prices for the period from November 19, 2021 through\nDecember 31, 2021.\nNon-Controlling Interests\nNon-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Company’s equity therein. Those\ninterests of non-controlling shareholders that are present ownership interests entitling their holders to a proportionate\nshare of net assets upon liquidation may initially be measured at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’\nproportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement is made on\nan acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Other non-controlling interests are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to\nacquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus\nthe non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity.\nThe Company reports non-controlling interests as equity, separately on the consolidated balance sheets. In\naddition, net income (loss) and each component of other comprehensive income (loss) is separately attributed to the\nnon-controlling interests. Total comprehensive income (loss) is attributed to non-controlling interests even if it results\nin the non-controlling interest having a deficit balance. This is the case even without any existing obligation on the part\nof the non-controlling interests to make an additional investment to cover the losses. Allocation of net income (loss)\nand total comprehensive income (loss) is based only on existing ownership interests.\nF-22\nTelesat Corporation\nNotes to the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n(all amounts in thousands of Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)\n4. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont.)\nFuture Changes in Accounting Policies\nThe IASB periodically issues new and amended accounting standards. The new and amended standards\ndetermined to be applicable to the Company are disclosed below. The remaining new and amended standards have\nbeen excluded as they are not applicable.\nAmendments to IAS 1\nIn October 2022, the IASB amended IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements with the aim of improving the\ninformation companies provide about long-term debt covenants.\nThe amendments specify that covenants to be complied with after the reporting date do not affect the classification\nof debt as current or non-current at the reporting date. Only covenants with which an entity is required to comply on\nor before the reporting date affect the classification of a liability as current or non-current. The amendment requires\na company to disclose information that enables users of financial statements to understand the risk that the liabilities\ncould become repayable within twelve months after the reporting period. Such disclosure includes information about\ncovenants and facts and circumstances, if any, that indicate the entity may have difficulty complying with the covenants.\nThe amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024 with early\nadoption permitted.\nThe amendments will not have any impact on the financial statements.\n5. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES\nCritical judgments in applying accounting policies\nThe following are the critical judgments made in applying the Company’s accounting policies which have the\nmost significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements:\nDeferred revenue\nThe Company’s accounting policy relating to deferred revenue is described in Note 4. Certain of the Company’s\nrevenue agreements were noted to include a significant financing component. Judgment by management is required to\ndetermine the discount rate used in the significant financing component calculation.\nLease liabilities\nThe Company’s accounting policy relating to leases is described in Note 4. Judgment by management is required\nin the determination of the likelihood that the lease renewal periods will be exercised as well as the determination of\nthe incremental borrowing rate.\nUncertain income tax positions\nThe Company operates in numerous jurisdictions and is subject to country-specific tax laws. Management\nuses significant judgment when determining the worldwide provision for tax, and estimates provisions for uncertain\ntax positions as the amounts expected to be paid based on a qualitative assessment of all relevant factors. In the\nassessment, management considers risk with respect to tax matters under active discussion, audit, dispute or appeal\nwith tax authorities, or which are otherwise considered to involve uncertainty. Management reviews the provisions as\nat each balance sheet date.\nF-23\nTelesat Corporation\nNotes to the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n(all amounts in thousands of Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)\n5. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES (cont.)\nSoftware as a Service arrangements\nThe Company’s accounting policy relating to SaaS is described in Note 4. Judgment by management is required\nto determine whether configuration or customization of a software results in an intangible asset for Telesat.\nCritical accounting estimates and assumptions\nThe Company makes accounting estimates and assumptions that affect the carrying value of assets and liabilities,\nreported net income (loss) and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates and assumptions are based\non historical experience, current events and other relevant factors, therefore, actual results may differ and differences\ncould be material.\nThe accounting estimates and assumptions critical to the determination of the amounts reported in the financial\nstatements were as follows:\nDerivative financial instruments measured at fair value\nAs at December 31, 2023 and 2022, the balances of the derivative assets and liabilities were $Nil.\nQuoted market values are unavailable for the Company’s financial instruments and, in the absence of an active\nmarket, the Company determines fair value for financial instruments based on prevailing market rates (bid and ask\nprices, as appropriate) for instruments with similar characteristics and risk profiles or internal or external valuation\nmodels, such as option pricing models and discounted cash flow analysis, using observable market-based inputs. The\ndetermination of fair value is significantly impacted by the assumptions used for the amount and timing of estimated\nfuture cash flows and discount rates. As a result, the fair value of financial assets and liabilities and the amount of\ngain/loss on changes in fair value of financial instruments recorded to net income (loss) could vary.\nImpairment of goodwill\nGoodwill represented $2,446.6 million of total assets as at December 31, 2023 and 2022. Determining whether\ngoodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the Company’s fair value which requires management to estimate the\nfuture cash flows expected to arise from operations and to make assumptions regarding the underlying business plan,\ndiscount rate, and growth rate assumptions. Actual operating results and the related cash flows of the Company could\ndiffer from the estimates used for the impairment analysis.\nImpairment of intangible assets\nIntangible assets represented $692.8 million of total assets as at December 31, 2023 (December 31,\n2022 — $756.9 million). Impairment of intangible assets is tested annually or more frequently if indicators of\nimpairment or reversal of a prior impairment loss exist. The impairment analysis requires the Company to estimate\nthe future cash flows expected to arise from operations and to make assumptions regarding the underlying business\nplan, discount rates, growth rate assumptions and royalty rate. Significant judgments are made in establishing these\nassumptions. Actual operating results and the related cash flows of the Company could differ from the estimates used\nfor the impairment analysis.\nEmployee benefits\nThe cost of defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefits, and the present value of the\npension obligation are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various\nassumptions which may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount\nrate, future salary increases, mortality rates, future pension increases and return on plan assets. Due to the complexity\nof the valuation, the underlying assumptions, and its long-term nature, the defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive\nto changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed annually.\nF-24\nTelesat Corporation\nNotes to the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n(all amounts in thousands of Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)\n5. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES (cont.)\nShare-based compensation\nThe expense for stock options is based on the fair value of the awards granted using the Black-Scholes option\npricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model includes estimates of the dividend yield, expected volatility,\nrisk-free interest rate and the expected life in years. Any changes in these estimates may have a significant impact on\nthe amounts reported.\nDetermination of useful life of satellites and finite life intangible assets\nThe estimated useful life and depreciation method for satellites and finite life intangible assets are reviewed\nannually, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. Any change in these\nestimates may have a significant impact on the amounts reported.\nIncome taxes\nManagement assesses the recoverability of deferred tax assets based upon an estimation of the Company’s\nprojected taxable income using enacted or substantively enacted tax laws, and its ability to utilize future tax deductions\nbefore they expire. Actual results could differ from expectations.\n6.

They are limited in availability and represent a scarce resource. Usage of orbital\nslots is licensed through the International Telecommunications Union. Satellite operators can generally expect, with a\nrelatively high level of certainty, continued occupancy of an assigned orbital slot either during the operational life of\nan existing orbiting satellite or upon replacement by a new satellite once the operational life of the existing orbiting\nsatellite is over. As a result of the expectancy right to maintain the once awarded orbital slots, an indefinite life is\ntypically associated with orbital slots.\nThe Company’s trade name has a long and established history, a strong reputation and has been synonymous\nwith quality and growth within the satellite industry. It has been assigned an indefinite life because of expected\nongoing future use.\nThe Company’s intellectual property relates to development of the planned Telesat Lightspeed constellation. It\nhas been assigned an indefinite life because of anticipated ongoing future use.\nF-34\nTelesat Corporation\nNotes to the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n(all amounts in thousands of Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)\n17. INTANGIBLE ASSETS (cont.)\nThe following are the remaining useful lives of the intangible assets:\nYears\nRevenue backlog 1\nCustomer relationships 3 to 5\nCustomer contracts 3\nConcession rights 1 to 14\nSoftware 2\nPatent 2\nAll of the Company’s intangible assets, excluding the intangible assets held in unrestricted subsidiaries, have\nbeen pledged as security as a requirement of the Company’s Senior Secured Credit Facilities, Senior Secured Notes\nand 2026 Senior Secured Notes (Note 24).\nImpairment\nFinite life intangible assets are assessed for impairment at the Company’s CGU level. With the exception of trade\nname, which is tested for impairment at the asset level, the indefinite life intangible assets are tested for impairment at\nthe individual CGU level. In the case of orbital slots, the CGU is based on geography. The annual impairment tests for\nthese assets were performed in the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022 in accordance with the policy described in Note 4.\nSubsequent to the annual impairment tests, the Company identified indicators of impairment as of December 31,\n2023, requiring additional impairment tests of the geographical CGUs. This resulted in an impairment of $64.0 million\nrecorded against the North American CGU and $15.8 million relating to the international CGU. The full amount of\nthe impairment for the North American CGU was recorded against intangible assets. For the international CGU, the\nimpairment was split between $2.0 million being recorded against intangible assets and $13.8 million being recorded\nagainst satellites, property and other equipment (Note 16). The impairment resulted from changes to the underlying\nassumptions associated with the related business plan, particularly related to the revenue forecasts as a result of\nintensifying competition.\nApart from the orbital slots, there were no other impairments recognized in the year ended December 31, 2023\ntied to intangible assets. There was no impairment recognized for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nOrbital slots\nThe orbital slots were valued using an income approach.\nThe income approach is most sensitive to the following assumptions:\n• Movements in the underlying business plan;\n• Discount rate; and\n• Growth rate assumptions.\nMovements in the underlying business plan\nThe business plans reflect the most up-to-date assumptions concerning the markets and development and trends\nin the business. For the provision of satellite capacity, the business plan will take into account the following factors:\n• The expected developments in sale of satellite capacity;\n• Any changes in the expected capital expenditure cycle; and\n• Any changes in satellite procurement, launch or cost assumptions.\nF-35\nTelesat Corporation\nNotes to the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n(all amounts in thousands of Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)\n17. INTANGIBLE ASSETS (cont.)\nDiscount rates\nDiscount rates reflect management’s estimates of the specific risks. Management uses a weighted average cost\nof capital as a discount rate. The discount rates used was 9.0% and 9.5% in 2023 (9.0% in 2022).\nGrowth rate assumptions\nGrowth rate assumptions used to extrapolate the cash flows beyond the business planning period are based on\ncommercial experience and the expectations for the development of the markets which they serve.\nTrade name\nRelief from royalty method was used to calculate the fair value of the Telesat trade name. The relief from royalty\nanalysis requires determining a hypothetical royalty rate and subsequent application of the rate to projected revenue.\nThe relief from royalties method is most sensitive to the following assumptions:\n• Movements in the underlying business plan;\n• Royalty rate;\n• Discount rate; and\n• Growth rate assumptions.\nMovements in the underlying business plan\nThe business plans reflect the most up-to-date assumptions concerning the markets and development and\ntrends in the business. For the provision of satellite capacity, the business plan will take into account the expected\ndevelopments in sale of satellite capacity.\nRoyalty rate\nThe determination of the hypothetical royalty rate used in the relief from royalty approach will consider comparable\nlicense agreements and other qualitative factors. The royalty rate used for 2023 and 2022 was 0.25% of revenue.\nDiscount rates\nDiscount rates reflect management’s estimates of the specific risks.

GOODWILL\nThe Company carries goodwill at its cost of $2,446.6 million with no accumulated impairment losses since\nacquisition.\nImpairment\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the entity level because that represents the lowest level at which goodwill\nsupports the Company’s operations and is monitored internally. The annual impairment test on goodwill was performed\nin the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022 in accordance with the policy described in Note 4.\nIn 2023 and 2022, the Company’s recoverable amount exceeded the carrying value therefore, no impairment\nwas recognized.\nThe calculation of the recoverable amount is most sensitive to the following assumptions:\n• Movements in the underlying business plan;\n• Discount rate; and\n• Growth rate assumptions.\nMovements in the underlying business plan\nThe business plans reflect the most up-to-date assumptions concerning the markets and development and trends\nin the business. For the provision of satellite capacity, the business plan will take into account the following factors:\n• The expected developments in sale of satellite capacity and the development of the Telesat Lightspeed\nmarket;\n• Any changes in the expected capital expenditure cycle, including estimated costs on the development of\nthe Telesat Lightspeed constellation; and\n• Any changes in satellite procurement, launch or cost assumptions.\nDiscount rates\nDiscount rates reflect management’s estimates of the specific risks.

This Revolving Facility\nis available to be drawn at any time in U.S. funds or Canadian dollar equivalent funds. Loans under the\nRevolving Facility bore interest at a floating interest rate. For Canadian Prime Rate and Alternative Base\nRate (“ABR”) loans, an applicable margin ranging from 0.75% to 1.25% is applied to the Prime Rate and\nABR as these interest rates are defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

The Revolving Facility has an unused commitment fee that ranges from 25.0\nto 37.5 basis points per annum, depending upon the result of the total leverage ratio.\nOn May 9, 2023, Telesat Canada entered into a seventh amendment to the Credit Agreement. The seventh\namendment amends the Credit Agreement to replace LIBOR-based benchmark rates with Secured\nOvernight Financing Rate (“SOFR”)-based benchmark rates and to make certain other conforming\nchanges. Following the seventh amendment, loans under the Revolving Facility will bear interest, at\nTelesat Canada’s option, at either (x) in the case of loans denominated in Canadian Dollars, (i) a floating\nrate based on the Canadian prime rate, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.75% to 1.25% or (ii) a\nfloating rate based on the Canadian BA rate, plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.25%,\nor (y) in the case of loans denominated in US dollars, (i) a floating rate based on the base rate, plus an\napplicable margin ranging from 0.75% to 1.25% or (ii) a floating rate based on SOFR, plus an applicable\nmargin ranging from 1.75% to 2.25%. As at December 31, 2023, other than $0.2 million (December 31,\n2022 — $0.2 million) in drawings related to letters of credit, there were no borrowings under this facility.\n(ii) The U.S. TLB Facility is a US$1,908.5 million facility maturing in December 2026 (“U.S. TLB Facility”).\nThe borrowings under the U.S. TLB Facility bore interest at a floating rate of either: (i) LIBOR as\nperiodically determined for interest rate periods selected by Telesat Canada in accordance with the terms\nof the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, plus an applicable margin of 2.75%; or (ii) Alternative Base Rate\nas determined in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities plus an applicable\nmargin of 1.75%. The mandatory principal repayment is equal to 0.25% of the original aggregate principal\namount, payable on the last day of each quarter, commencing on March 31, 2020. As a result of the\nprepayment made in December 2020, mandatory quarterly principal repayments are no longer be required.\nOn May 9, 2023, Telesat Canada entered into a seventh amendment to the Credit Agreement. The seventh\namendment amends the Credit Agreement to replace LIBOR-based benchmark rates with SOFR-based\nbenchmark rates and to make certain other conforming changes. Following the seventh amendment, loans\nunder the Term Loan B Facility bear interest, at Telesat Canada’s option, at either (i) a floating rate based\non the base rate, plus an applicable margin of 1.75% or (ii) a floating rate based on SOFR, plus an\napplicable margin of 2.75%. In addition, loans benchmarked against SOFR will be subject to a credit\nspread adjustment of 0.11448% for a one-month interest period, 0.26161% for a three-month interest\nperiod and 0.42826% for a six-month interest period.\nDebt issue costs of $16.0 million were incurred in connection with the 2019 Amendment, inclusive of $1.3 million\nrelating to the revolving credit facility. As at December 31, 2023, the debt costs had a carrying value of $6.1 million\n(December 31, 2022 — $8.6 million). The Senior Secured Credit Facilities are secured by substantially all of Telesat\nCanada’s assets, excluding those in the unrestricted subsidiaries. All obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed\nby Telesat Canada and certain existing subsidiaries (“Guarantors”). The obligations under the Credit Agreement and the\nguarantees of those obligations are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by first priority liens and security interest in the\nassets of Telesat Canada and the Guarantors. The Credit Agreement contains total leverage ratio covenants that restrict,\nwith certain exceptions, the ability of Telesat Canada and the Guarantors to take specified actions, including, among other\nthings and subject to certain significant exceptions: creating liens, incurring indebtedness, making investments, engaging\nin mergers, selling property, paying dividends, entering into sale-leaseback transactions, creating subsidiaries, repaying\nsubordinated debt or amending organizational documents. If the Revolving Credit Facility is drawn by more than 35%\nof the Credit Facility amount, the Credit Agreement requires Telesat Canada to comply with a first lien net leverage ratio\nof 5.75:1.00, tested quarterly, and failure to comply will result in an event of default. As at December 31, 2023, the total\nleverage ratio was 5.32:1.00, which is more than the maximum test ratio of 4.50:1.00 (December 31, 2022 — 6.17:1.00).\nIn December 2020, the Company made a US$341.4 million prepayment on the Term Loan B — U.S. Facility.\nThe prepayment was applied to all mandatory future quarterly principal repayments, with the remaining balance of\nthe prepayment being applied towards the principal amount outstanding on maturity. The prepayment resulted in the\nF-40\nTelesat Corporation\nNotes to the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n(all amounts in thousands of Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)\n24.

The loss\nrecorded against the indebtedness is subsequently amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method and\nhad a carrying value of $1.1 million as at December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022 — $1.6 million).\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, Telesat Canada repurchased a portion of Term Loan B — U.S. Facility\nwith a principal amount of $177.6 million (US$131.0 million) in exchange for $133.8 million (US$98.8 million). The\nrepurchase resulted in a write-off of the related debt issue costs and loss on repayment in the amount of $0.5 million\n(US$0.4 million), and a gain on repurchase of debt of $43.8 million (US$32.3 million).\nThe weighted average effective interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 8.08% (December 31,\n2022 — 4.64%).\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nOn October 11, 2019, Telesat Canada issued, through a private placement, US$550 million of Senior Unsecured\nNotes which mature in October 2027.

The Senior\nUnsecured Notes are governed by the Senior Unsecured Notes Indenture.\nThe indenture agreement for the Senior Unsecured Notes contained provisions for certain prepayment options\nwhich were fair valued at the time of debt issuance. The initial fair value impact, as at October 11, 2019, of the\nprepayment option related to the Senior Unsecured Notes was a $17.8 million increase to the indebtedness.

Additionally, each holder of a Partnership exchangeable unit\nis entitled to vote in respect of matters on which holders of the Company’s common shares are entitled to vote through\na special voting share of the Company. Any time after the one year anniversary of the Transaction’s effective date, the\nholder of a Partnership exchangeable unit will have the right to require the Partnership to exchange all or any portion\nof such holder’s Partnership exchangeable units for the Company’s common shares at a ratio of one common share for\neach Partnership exchangeable unit, subject to the Company’s right as the general partner of the Partnership, in its sole\ndiscretion, to deliver a cash payment in lieu of its common shares.\nNet income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests represents the non-controlling interests’ portion of the\nPartnership’s net income (loss).\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, a third-party was engaged to perform a formal valuation of the fair value of\nthe RSUs issued in the second quarter of 2021.

The decrease in compensation and employee benefits in the\nfourth quarter of 2021 resulted in higher proportion of net income being attributed to the non-controlling interest.\nIn connection with the Transaction, a final adjustment amount was required to be made. The adjustment amount\nis defined within the Transaction agreement and represents any portion of the inducement payment that was unpaid\nby Loral, combined with the calculated negative net asset value of Loral. During the year ended December 31, 2022, a\npayment of $20.8 million (US$15.3 million) was made to Red Isle Private Investment Inc.

CAPITAL DISCLOSURES\nThe Company’s financial strategy is designed to maintain compliance with the financial covenant under its\nSenior Secured Credit Facilities (Note 24), and to maximize returns to its shareholders and other stakeholders. The\nCompany meets these objectives through regular monitoring of the financial covenant and operating results on a\nquarterly basis. The Company’s overall financial strategy remains unchanged from 2022.\nThe Company defines its capital as Telesat Corporation’s shareholders’ equity (comprising issued share capital,\naccumulated earnings and excluding reserves), non-controlling interest and debt financing (comprising indebtedness\nand excluding deferred financing costs, prepayment options and loss on repayment as defined in Note 24).\nThe Company’s capital was as follows:\nAs at December 31, 2023 2022\nShareholders’ equity (excluding reserves) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 585,310 $ 402,827\nNon-controlling interest . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 1,737,065 $ 1,358,716\nDebt financing (excluding deferred financing costs, prepayment options and\nloss on repayment) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 3,199,247 $ 3,853,151\nIf the Revolving Facility is drawn by more than 35% of the credit facility amount, the Senior Secured Credit\nFacilities require the Company to comply with a first lien net leverage ratio test. As at December 31, 2023, the first\nlien net leverage ratio was 4.65:1.00 (December 31, 2022 — 5.30:1.00), which was less than the maximum test ratio\nof 5.75:1.00.\nThe Company’s operating results are tracked against budget on a regular basis, and this analysis is reviewed by\nsenior management.\n30. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nMeasurement of Risks\nThe Company, through its financial assets and liabilities, is exposed to various risks. The following analysis\nprovides a measurement of risks as at December 31, 2023.\nCredit risk\nCredit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial asset will default, resulting in the Company incurring\na financial loss. As at December 31, 2023, the maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying value of the\nfinancial assets which totaled $1,754.6 million (December 31, 2022 — $1,730.0 million).\nThe following table provides breakdown by maturity of financial assets as at December 31, 2023:\nCarrying Contractual cash flows\namount 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter\nCash and cash equivalents . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 1,669,089 $ 1,669,089 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nTrade and other receivables, excluding\ndeferred receivables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 74,942 74,942 — — — — —\nDeferred receivables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8,982 3,347 1,308 1,411 664 549 1,703\nOther financial assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,629 631 — — — — 998\n$ 1,754,642 $ 1,748,009 $ 1,308 $ 1,411 $ 664 $ 549 $ 2,701\nF-49\nTelesat Corporation\nNotes to the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n(all amounts in thousands of Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)\n30. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (cont.)\nCash and cash equivalents are invested with high quality investment grade financial institutions and are\ngoverned by the Company’s corporate investment policy, which aims to reduce credit risk by restricting investments to\nhigh-grade, mainly U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar denominated investments.\nThe Company has credit evaluation, approval and monitoring processes intended to mitigate potential credit\nrisks related to trade accounts receivable. The Company’s standard payment terms are 30 days with interest typically\ncharged on balances remaining unpaid at the end of standard payment terms. The Company’s historical experience\nwith customer defaults has been minimal. As at December 31, 2023, North American and International customers\nmade up 49% and 51% of the outstanding trade receivable balance, respectively (December 31, 2022 — 48% and\n52%, respectively). Anticipated bad debt losses have been provided for in the allowance for doubtful accounts. The\nallowance for doubtful accounts as at December 31, 2023 was $6.5 million (December 31, 2022 — $4.9 million).\nThe Company mitigates the credit risk associated with derivative instruments by entering into them with only\nhigh quality financial institutions.\nForeign exchange risk\nThe Company’s operating results are subject to fluctuations as a result of exchange rate variations to the\nextent that transactions are made in currencies other than Canadian dollars. The Company’s main currency\nexposures lie in its U.S. dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, trade and other\npayables and indebtedness with the most significant impact being on the U.S. dollar denominated indebtedness,\ncash and short-term investments. As at December 31, 2023 and 2022, the entire indebtedness was denominated\nin U.S. dollars, with the Canadian dollar equivalent of the U.S. dollar denominated indebtedness equaling\n$3,199.2 million and $3,853.2 million, respectively, before netting of deferred financing costs, prepayment\noptions and loss on repayment.\nAs at December 31, 2023, the impact of a 5 percent increase (decrease) in the value of the Canadian dollar\nagainst the U.S. dollar on financial assets and liabilities would have decreased (increased) net income (loss) by\n$146.4 million (December 31, 2022 — $172.1 million) and increased (decreased) other comprehensive income (loss)\nby $68.6 million (December 31, 2022 — $57.5 million). This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular\ninterest rates, remain constant.\nInterest rate risk\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its cash and cash equivalents and its indebtedness. The interest\nrate risk on the indebtedness is from a portion of the indebtedness having a variable interest rate. Changes in the\ninterest rates could impact the amount of interest that the Company is required to pay or receive.\nIn October 2017, the Company entered into four interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk associated with\nthe variable interest rate on US$1,800.0 million of the U.S. denominated Term Loan B at fixed interest rates, excluding\napplicable margins, ranging from 1.72% to 2.04%. As the final interest rate swap matured in 2022, there were no\noutstanding interest rate swaps as at December 31, 2023 or 2022.\nIf the interest rates on the variable rate indebtedness change by 0.25%, the result would be an increase or decrease\nto net income (loss) of $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022 — $4.3 million).\nLiquidity risk\nThe Company maintains credit facilities to ensure it has sufficient funds available to meet current and foreseeable\nfinancial requirements.\nF-50\nTelesat Corporation\nNotes to the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n(all amounts in thousands of Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)\n30.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (cont.)\nAssets pledged as security\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities, Senior Secured Notes and 2026 Senior Secured Notes are secured by\nsubstantially all of Telesat’s assets excluding the assets of unrestricted subsidiaries.\nFair Value\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants in the principal market under current market conditions at the measurement date. Where\npossible, fair values are based on the quoted market values in an active market. In the absence of an active market, the\nCompany determines fair values based on prevailing market rates (bid and ask prices, as appropriate) for instruments\nwith similar characteristics and risk profiles or internal or external valuation models, such as option pricing models\nand discounted cash flow analysis, using observable market-based inputs.\nThe fair value hierarchy is as follows:\nLevel 1 is based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company\ncan access at the measurement date.\nLevel 2 is based on observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or\nliabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by\nobservable market data for substantially all of the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 is based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant\nto the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose values are\ndetermined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments\nfor which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.\nEstimates of fair values are affected significantly by the assumptions for the amount and timing of estimated\nfuture cash flows and discount rates, which all reflect varying degrees of risk. Potential income taxes and other expenses\nthat would be incurred on disposition of these financial instruments are not reflected in the fair values. As a result, the\nfair values are not necessarily the net amounts that would be realized if these instruments were actually settled.\nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables\napproximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of these instruments. As at December 31, 2023, cash and cash\nequivalents included $245.2 million (December 31, 2022 — $8.5 million) of short-term investments.\nThe fair value of the satellite performance incentive payments, included in other current and long-term financial\nliabilities, was determined using a discounted cash flow methodology. The calculation is performed on a recurring\nbasis. As at December 31, 2023 and 2022, the discount rate used was 7.4% and 6.6%, respectively.\nThe fair value of the indebtedness was based on transactions and quotations from third parties considering market\ninterest rates and excluding deferred financing costs, prepayment options and loss on repayment. The calculation of\nthe fair value of the indebtedness is performed on a recurring basis. The rates used were as follows:\nAs at December 31 2023 2022\nU.S. TLB Facility . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 63.75% 45.63%\nSenior Unsecured Notes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 47.31% 29.90%\nSenior Secured Notes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 59.42% 45.71%\n2026 Senior Secured Notes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 62.38% 47.02%\nF-52\nTelesat Corporation\nNotes to the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n(all amounts in thousands of Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)\n30.

The calculations of the fair value of the\nderivatives are performed on a recurring basis.\nPrepayment option cash flows were calculated with a third party option valuation model which is based on the\ncurrent price of the debt instrument and discounted based on a discount curve.\nThe discount rates used to discount cash flows as at December 31, 2023 ranged from 4.06% to 5.59%\n(December 31, 2022 — 4.00% to 5.16%).\n31.

(the predecessor entity to Telesat Canada and Telesat Corporation) adopted a management\nstock incentive plan in September 2008, as amended (the “2008 Telesat Plan”) and a second management stock\nincentive plan in April 2013, as amended (the “2013 Telesat Plan”). In the first half of 2021, Telesat Canada also\nadopted a restricted share unit plan (the “RSU Plan” together with the 2008 Telesat Plan and 2013 Telesat Plan, the\n“Historic Plan”).\nThe purpose of the Historic Plan was to promote the interests of Telesat and its shareholders by providing certain\nkey employees of Telesat and its affiliates with an appropriate incentive to encourage them to continue in the employ\nof, or engagement with, Telesat or an affiliate and to improve Telesat’s growth and profitability.\nThe 2008 Telesat Plan reserved a total of 8,824,646 Telesat Canada Non-Voting Participating Preferred Shares\nfor issuance upon due exercise of Telesat Canada Options. In connection with the completion of the Transaction, no\nfurther Telesat Canada Options will be granted under the 2008 Telesat Plan. Prior to the close of the Transaction,\n738,667 Telesat Canada stock options were issued and outstanding. Upon the completion of the Transaction the\n738,667 Telesat Canada stock options were converted into 305,499 Telesat Corporation stock options.\nThe 2013 Telesat Plan reserved a total of 8,680,399 Telesat Canada Non-Voting Participating Preferred Shares\nfor issuance upon due exercise of Telesat Canada Options. In connection with the completion of the Transaction, no\nfurther Telesat Canada Options will be granted under the 2013 Telesat Plan. Prior to the close of the Transaction,\n1,446,797 Telesat Canada stock options were issued and outstanding. Upon the completion of the Transaction the\n1,446,797 Telesat Canada stock options were converted into 595,290 Telesat Corporation stock options.\nIn each case, the Telesat Options were convertible at the option of the holder into Telesat Public Shares (provided\nthat the holder complied with the constrained share provisions in the Telesat Corporation Articles).\nUnder the stock incentive plans, two different types of stock options could be granted: time-vesting options\nand performance-vesting options. The time-vesting options generally become vested and exercisable over a five-year\nperiod by 20% annual increments. The performance-vesting options become vested and exercisable over a five-year\nperiod, provided that the Company has achieved or exceeded an annual or cumulative target consolidated EBITDA\nestablished by the Board of Directors. The exercise period of the stock options expires 10 years from the grant date.\nThe exercise price of each share underlying the options was the higher of a fixed price, established by the Board of\nDirectors on the grant date, and the fair market value of a Non-Voting Participating Preferred Share on the grant date.\nBoth plans authorized the Board of Directors to grant tandem SARs, at their discretion.\nF-53\nTelesat Corporation\nNotes to the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n(all amounts in thousands of Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)\n31. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS (cont.)\nThe Company expenses the fair value of stock options that are expected to vest over the vesting period using\nthe Black-Scholes option pricing model. The share-based compensation expense is included in operating expenses.\nIn April 2021, 6,197,776 issued and outstanding, vested and unvested stock options were cancelled. This resulted\nin a non-cash operating expense recorded in the year ended December 31, 2021 of $8.5 million.\nIn April 2021, a total of 3,660,000 Non-Voting Participating Preferred Shares are reserved for issuance upon\nvesting of the RSUs awarded under the RSU Plan, provided that the aggregate number of Non-Voting Participating\nPreferred Shares issuable under the RSU Plan (and under all other share compensation arrangements) does not exceed\n10% of the total number of Non-Voting Participating Preferred Shares outstanding from time to time (on a non-diluted\nbasis). A total of 3,530,000 Telesat Canada RSUs were issued in connection with the plan. Upon completion of the\nTransaction the 3,530,000 Telesat Canada RSUs were converted into 1,460,008 Telesat Corporation RSUs.\nTelesat Corporation Stock Incentive Plans\nIn connection with the Transaction, the holders of Telesat Canada Tandem SARs, Telesat Canada Options and\nTelesat Canada RSUs were offered the opportunity to enter into exchange agreements with Telesat Corporation in\nrespect of their Telesat Canada Tandem SARs, Telesat Canada Options and Telesat Canada RSUs, pursuant to which,\nupon the Closing, they exchanged such instruments for corresponding instruments in Telesat Corporation. The stock\noptions, share appreciation rights and RSUs will have similar vesting terms, however, the quantity and exercise prices\nhave been adjusted.\nOn November 19, 2021, Telesat Corporation adopted an omnibus long-term incentive plan (“Omnibus Plan”).\nThe Omnibus Plan allows for a variety of equity-based awards including stock options, RSUs, PSUs and DSUs. The\nstock options, RSUs, PSUs and DSUs are collectively referred to as “Award”. Each Award will represent the right to\nreceive Public Shares or, in the case of PSUs, RSUs or DSUs, Public Shares or cash, in accordance with the terms of\nthe Omnibus Plan.\nThe maximum number of Public Shares reserved for issuance under the Omnibus Plan is 2,972,816.\nHistoric Plan\nThe change in number of stock options outstanding and their weighted average exercise price for the Historic\nPlan were summarized below:\nTelesat Corporation\ntime vesting options\nWeighted\naverage\nNumber of exercise\noptions price\nOutstanding at December 31, 2021 and January 1, 2022 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 900,789 $ 48.77\nForfeited . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\nThe Company maintains defined benefit pension plans for Telesat Canada employees (“Canadian Pension\nPlans”). In October 2013, the Company ceased to allow new employees to join certain defined benefit plans, except\nunder certain circumstances, and commenced a defined contribution pension plan for new employees.\nOn completion of the Transaction, the Company also took over the defined benefit pension plans for certain\nformer employees of Loral (“US Pension Plans”). Under the US Pension Plans, certain former Loral employees hired\nprior to July 1, 2006 contributed until November 18, 2021 in order to receive enhanced pension benefits.\nEffective January 1, 2024, the Pension Plan for Employees of Telesat Canada and the Pension Plan for Designated\nEmployees of Telesat Canada were merged into one plan, the Pension Plan for Employees of Telesat Canada, subject\nto final regulatory filings and approvals. The combined plan is closed entirely to new members with respect to the\ndefined benefit provisions. The merged plan offers a defined contribution pension to certain pre-existing and all new\nemployees of Telesat Canada and Telesat LEO Inc.\nIn addition to the pension plans, the Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for some\nof Telesat Canada’s retired employees and their dependents (“Canadian Other Post-employment Benefit Plans”).\nParticipants are eligible for these benefits generally when they retire from active service and meet the eligibility\nrequirements for the pension plan. These benefits are funded primarily on a pay-as-you-go basis, with the retiree\ngenerally paying a portion of the cost through contributions, deductibles and coinsurance provisions.\nThe Company also provides medical coverage for certain of its retired employees and dependents including\ncertain retired Loral employees (“US Other Post-employment Benefit Plans”). Under the US Other Post-employment\nBenefit Plans, an annual subsidy is provided to cover for medical benefits to the retired employees and their dependents.\nFor the Loral retired employees, the coverage ends when the retiree reaches age 65.\nF-56\nTelesat Corporation\nNotes to the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n(all amounts in thousands of Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)\n32. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS (cont.)\nThe Company’s funding policy is to make contributions to its defined benefit pension funds based on actuarial\ncost methods as permitted and required by pension regulatory bodies. Contributions reflect actuarial assumptions\nconcerning future investment returns, salary projections and future service benefits. Plan assets are represented\nprimarily by equity securities, fixed income instruments and short-term investments.\nThe defined benefit plans typically expose the Company to actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest\nrate risk, longevity risk and salary risk. Investment risk is managed by specifying allowable investment types, setting\ndiversification strategies and determining target asset allocations. The investment objectives of the fund are to optimize\nthe return on investments, taking into account the risks associated with the securities for the protection of the pension\nbenefits of the members of the plan.\nAs part of the risk management process, for Canadian Plans, the Investment Committee establishes a Statement\nof Investment Policies and Procedures which includes a diversification strategy and processes to manage foreign\ncurrency, credit and other risks. Given the long-term nature of plan liabilities, it is considered appropriate to invest a\nreasonable portion of the plan assets in equity securities and thus ensure higher return. The Statement of Investment\nPolicies and Procedures is reviewed on an annual basis by the Management Level Pension Fund Investment Committee\nwith approval of the policy being provided by the Audit Committee.\nAs regards the US Pension Plans, the funding policy is to fund the qualified pension plan in accordance with\nthe Internal Revenue Code and regulations thereon. Plan assets are generally invested in equity, fixed income and\nother investments. The expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account the\nexpected duration of the plan’s projected benefit obligation, asset mix and the fact that its assets are actively managed\nto mitigate risk.\nA decrease in interest rate will increase the plan liability. However, it will be partially offset by an increase in\nthe return on fixed income instruments. The present value of the plan liabilities is calculated by reference to the best\nestimates of the mortality and the future salaries of plan participants. Accordingly, an increase in life expectancy or\nsalary will increase the plan liability.\nAssets-liability matching strategies are geared towards maintaining an appropriate asset mix to ensure that liquid\nassets are available to discharge the liabilities as and when they become due. Any potential liquidity issue arising from\nmismatching of plan assets and benefit obligations is compensated by a broadly diversified investment portfolio,\nincluding cash and short-term investments, and cash flows from dividends and interest.\nFor Canadian Pension Plans, the pension expense for 2023 was determined based on membership data as at\nDecember 31, 2021. The accrued benefit obligation as at December 31, 2023 was determined based on the membership\ndata as at December 31, 2022, and extrapolated one year based on December 31, 2023 assumptions. For US Pension\nPlans, the pension expense for 2023 was determined based on membership data as at December 31, 2022. The accrued\nbenefit obligation as at December 31, 2023 was determined based on the membership data as at December 31, 2022,\nand extrapolated one year based on December 31, 2023 assumptions.\nFor Canadian Post-employment Benefit Plans, the expense for 2023 was based on membership and eligibility data\nas at September 30, 2021 and the accrued benefit obligations as at December 31, 2023 was based on membership data\nas at September 30, 2021. The accrued benefit obligation for US Post-employment Benefit Plans as at December 31,\n2023, related to certain retired Loral employees, was determined based on membership data as at December 31, 2022.\nFor other US Post-employment Benefit Plans, the accrued benefit obligation as at December 31, 2023 was determined\nbased on membership data as at December 31, 2022 and extrapolated, based on December 31, 2023 assumptions.\nF-57\nTelesat Corporation\nNotes to the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n(all amounts in thousands of Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)\n32.

Other operating commitments consisted of third party satellite\ncapacity arrangements as well as other commitments that are not categorized as property leases or capital commitments.\nThe Company’s off-balance sheet obligations included the future minimum payments for the non-cancellable period of\neach respective obligation, which have various terms and expire between 2024 to 2039.\nCertain variable costs associated with the capitalized leases have been included in property leases commitments\nwith a termination date co-terminus with the lease liability.\nThe Company has entered into contracts for the development of the Telesat Lightspeed constellation and\nother capital expenditures. The total outstanding commitments as at December 31, 2023 were included in capital\ncommitments.\nThe Company has agreements with various customers for prepaid revenue on several service agreements\nwhich take effect when the satellite is placed in service. The Company is responsible for operating and\ncontrolling these satellites. As at December 31, 2023, customer prepayments of $279.4 million (December 31,\n2022 — $326.4 million), a portion of which is refundable under certain circumstances, were reflected in other\ncurrent and long-term liabilities.\nF-66\nTelesat Corporation\nNotes to the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n(all amounts in thousands of Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)\n34. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (cont.)\nIn the normal course of business, the Company has executed agreements that provide for indemnification and\nguarantees to counterparties in various transactions. These indemnification undertakings and guarantees may require\nthe Company to compensate the counterparties for costs and losses incurred as a result of certain events including,\nwithout limitation, loss or damage to property, change in the interpretation of laws and regulations (including tax\nlegislation), claims that may arise while providing services, or as a result of litigation that may be suffered by the\ncounterparties. The nature of substantially all of the indemnification undertakings prevents the Company from making\na reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount the Company could be required to pay counterparties as the\nagreements do not specify a maximum amount and the amounts are dependent upon the outcome of future contingent\nevents, the nature and likelihood of which cannot be determined at this time. Historically, the Company has not made\nany significant payments under such indemnifications.\nTelesat Corporation and Telesat CanHold Corporation have entered into an indemnification agreement with PSP\nInvestments where they will indemnify PSP Investments on a grossed-up basis for PSP Investment’s pro rata share\nof the costs relating to: (a) certain losses and litigation proceedings related to the Transaction, (b) certain losses with\nregard to Loral and out-of-pocket expenses of Loral and (c) certain tax matters.\nIn the case of indemnification for certain tax matters only, there will be a cap of US$50 million (other than with\nrespect to defense costs and grossed-up payments) and all other indemnification obligations will be uncapped.\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company participates from time to time in legal proceedings arising in the normal course of its business.\nTelesat previously received assessments from Brazilian tax authorities alleging that additional taxes are owed on\nrevenue earned for the period 2003 to 2018. The total disputed amount for the period 2003 to 2018, including interest\nand penalties, is now $111.7 million. The disputes relate to the Brazilian tax authorities’ characterization of revenue.\nThe Company has challenged the assessments. The Company believes the likelihood of a favorable outcome in these\ndisputes is more likely than not and, as such, no reserve has been established.\nIn Canada, the tax authorities previously reassessed $13.1 million relating to transfer pricing issues for the years\n2009 to 2014. All disputes relate to Canadian tax authorities’ repricing of certain transactions between Telesat and its\nsubsidiaries. The Company had challenged the reassessments and paid 50% of the outstanding amounts in order to\nformally object. In late 2023, the Minister of National Revenue rendered a decision in Telesat’s favor and reversed the\ntaxes previously assessed. In March 2024, we received a refund of the taxes paid with interest.\nThe Canadian tax authorities have reassessed the Company for $11.6 million relating to its Scientific Research\nand Experimental Development claims for the years 2016 and 2017. The Company has challenged the reassessments\nand paid 50% of the outstanding amounts in order to formally object. The Company believes the likelihood of a\nfavorable outcome in these disputes is more likely than not and, as such, no reserve has been established.\nOther than the legal proceedings disclosed above, the Company is not aware of any proceedings outstanding or\nthreatened as of the date hereof by or against it or relating to its business which may have, or have had in the recent\npast, significant effects on the Company’s financial position or profitability.\nF-67\nTelesat Corporation\nNotes to the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n(all amounts in thousands of Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)\n35.

Operating results\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nThe following management’s discussion and analysis (the “MD&A”) for Telesat Corporation is dated March 27,\n2024 and provides information concerning our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. You should read this MD&A together with Telesat Corporation’s audited consolidated financial\nstatements and the related notes for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nAs used in this MD&A, unless the context states or requires otherwise, references to “Telesat,” “Company,” “we,”\n“our” and “us” refer to Telesat Corporation and its subsidiaries. Unless the context states or requires otherwise,\nreference herein to “the consolidated financial statements” or “the financial statements” or similar terms refer to\nTelesat Corporation’s audited consolidated financial statements included herein.\nAll figures reported in this MD&A are in Canadian dollars, except where we indicate otherwise, and are\nreferenced as “$” and “dollars”.\nThis MD&A contains a translation of some Canadian dollar amounts into United States dollars at specified\nexchange rates solely for your convenience. All references to “US$” and “U.S. dollar” refer to United States dollars.\nCertain totals, subtotals and percentages may not reconcile due to rounding.\nThe information contained in this MD&A takes into account information available up to March 27, 2024, unless\notherwise noted.\nThis MD&A makes reference to certain non-IFRS measures, namely, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin\nand Consolidated EBITDA. These measures are not recognized measures under International Financial Reporting\nStandards (“IFRS”) and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be\ncomparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered\nin isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of our financial information reported under IFRS. Rather, these non-IFRS\nmeasures are used to provide investors with supplemental measures of our operating performance and thus highlight\ntrends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS measures. We also believe\nthat securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use non-IFRS measures in the evaluation of\nissuers. Our management also uses non-IFRS measures in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons from\nperiod to period, to prepare annual operating budgets and forecasts and to determine components of management\ncompensation. For a reconciliation of the non-IFRS measure to the most closely comparable IFRS measure, see below\nunder the heading “Non-IFRS Measures”.\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis MD&A contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation\nReform Act of 1995. When used in this MD&A, the words “believes,” “expects,” “plans,” “may,” “will,” “would,”\n“could,” “should,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “project,” “intend” or “outlook” or other variations of these words or\nother similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements and information. In addition, Telesat or\nits representatives have made or may make forward-looking statements, orally or in writing, which may be included\nin, but are not limited to, various filings made from time to time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\n(“SEC”) and Canadian securities regulatory authorities, and press releases or oral statements made with the approval\nof an authorized executive officer of Telesat. Statements containing forward-looking information are not historical\nfacts nor assurances of future performance but instead represent management’s expectations, estimates and projections\nregarding future events or circumstances.\nThese forward-looking statements and other forward-looking information are based on our opinions, estimates\nand assumptions in light of our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future\ndevelopments, as well as other factors that we currently believe are appropriate and reasonable in the circumstances.\n82\nActual results may differ materially from anticipated results as a result of certain risks and uncertainties which are\ndescribed, but are not limited to, the risks listed below and in the section entitled “Risk Factors” included in Telesat’s\nannual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “Annual Report”). There may be additional\nrisks of which we are not presently aware or that we currently believe are immaterial which could have an adverse\nimpact on our business. We make no commitment to revise or update any forward-looking statements in order to\nreflect events or circumstances that may change, except where we are expressly required to do so by law.\nFactors that could cause actual results to differ from those projected include, but are not limited to (1) risks\nassociated with financial factors, including swings in the global financial markets, increases in interest rates, fluctuations\nin foreign exchange rates, and access to capital; (2) risks associated with satellite services, including dependence on\nlarge customers, launch delays and failures, in-orbit failures and competition; (3) risks and uncertainties associated\nwith Telesat Lightspeed, including overcoming technological challenges, access to spectrum and markets, governmental\nrestrictions or regulations, the impact of inflation on development costs and financing, raising sufficient capital to\ndesign and implement the system and competition from other low earth orbit systems; (4) regulatory risks, such as the\neffect of industry and government regulations that affect Telesat; and (5) other risks. The foregoing list of important\nfactors is not exclusive. Furthermore, Telesat operates in an industry sector where securities values may be volatile and\nmay be influenced by economic and other factors beyond Telesat’s control.\nThese factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read with the other cautionary statements\nin this MD&A. These forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations, estimates, forecasts and\nprojections about our business and the industry in which we operate and management’s beliefs and assumptions, and\nare not guarantees of future performance or development and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and\nother factors that are in some cases beyond our control. As a result, any or all of our forward-looking statements in this\nMD&A may turn out to be inaccurate.\nComparisons of results for current and any prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or\nindications of future performance, unless specifically expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data.\nThese forward-looking statements speak only as at the date of this MD&A. Except as required by law, we assume\nno obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements for any reason, even if new information becomes\navailable in the future. You should, however, review the factors and risks we describe in the reports we will file from\ntime to time with the SEC and the Canadian securities regulatory authorities, after the date of this MD&A.\nThis MD&A contains estimates, projections, market research and other information concerning our industry,\nour business, and the markets for our services. Information that is based on estimates, forecasts, projections, market\nresearch or similar methodologies is inherently subject to uncertainties, and actual events or circumstances may differ\nmaterially from events and circumstances that are assumed in this information.\nUnless otherwise expressly stated, we obtained this industry, business, market and other data from our own\ninternal estimates and research as well as from reports, research surveys, studies and similar data prepared by market\nresearch firms and other third parties, industry and general publications, government data and similar sources.\nIn addition, assumptions and estimates of our and our industry’s future performance are necessarily subject to a\nhigh degree of uncertainty and risk due to a variety of factors, including those described in the section of our Annual\nReport entitled “Risk Factors.” These and other factors could cause our future performance to differ materially from\nour assumptions and estimates.\nAny references to forward-looking statements in this MD&A include forward-looking information within the\nmeaning of applicable Canadian securities laws.\nAdditional information regarding the Company, including results of operations and variances between the year\nended December 31, 2022 and 2021, can be obtained on the SEC’s website at https://www.sec.gov and on SEDAR+ at\nhttps://www.sedarplus.ca.\nOPERATING HIGHLIGHTS\nSuccessful Launch of LEO 3 Demonstration Satellite\nIn July 2023, we launched our LEO 3 demonstration satellite, which has successfully completed in-orbit testing.\nThe LEO 3 satellite features Ka-and V-band payloads and will provide continuity for customer and ecosystem vendor\ntesting campaigns following the decommissioning of Telesat’s Phase 1 LEO satellite.\n83\nMDA Ltd Contracted to Manufacture Lightspeed Satellites; Telesat Lightspeed Funded Through Global Service\nDelivery\nIn August 2023, we announced that space technology company MDA Ltd. has been contracted to build the\nadvanced satellites for the Telesat Lightspeed program. We also announced that we expect to receive funding from our\nCanadian federal and provincial government partners in the combined amount of up to approximately US$2 billion\nand that this funding, combined with our own approximately US$1.6 billion equity contribution, as well as certain\nvendor financing, would provide the Telesat Lightspeed program with sufficient funds to launch global service, which\nwill occur once the first 156 satellites are in orbit.\nThe finalization of the Canadian federal and provincial funding is dependent on a number of conditions,\nincluding the conclusion of definitive agreements.\nSpaceX Launch Agreement\nIn September 2023, we announced that we had entered into a launch agreement with SpaceX for 14 launches on\nSpaceX’s Falcon 9. These launches will carry up to 18 of our Lightspeed satellites per launch from SpaceX’s launch\nfacilities in California and Florida.\nC-band Spectrum Clearing Payments\nOn June 30, 2023, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission\ncompleted their validation of our Phase II certification of accelerated C-band clearing activities in the 3.7 GHz band\nand confirmed we were eligible to receive our second accelerated relocation payment of US$259.6 million.\nAn amount of $344.9 million (US$259.6 million) was recognized and was recorded under other operating gains\n(losses), net.\nRepurchase of Debt\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased, Senior Secured Notes, 2026 Senior Secured Notes,\nSenior Unsecured Notes and a portion of our U.S. TLB Facility with an aggregate principal amount of US$427.0 million\nin exchange for US$255.6 million.\nOVERVIEW OF THE BUSINESS\nWe are a leading global satellite services operator, providing our customers with mission-critical communications\nservices since the start of the satellite communications industry in the 1960s. Through a combination of advanced\nsatellites and ground facilities and a highly expert and dedicated staff, our communications solutions support the\nrequirements of sophisticated satellite users throughout the world. We are organized into one operating segment, the\nsatellite services business; however, we provide our services through three business categories: Broadcast, Enterprise\nand Consulting and other.\nThe satellite services business is capital intensive and the build-out of a satellite fleet requires substantial time\nand investment. Once the investment in a satellite is made, the incremental costs to maintain and operate the satellite\nare relatively low over the life of the satellite, with the exception of in-orbit insurance. Historically, we have been able\nto generate a large contracted revenue backlog by entering into long-term contracts with some of our customers for all\nor substantially all of a satellite’s life.\nAs at December 31, 2023, we provided satellite services to customers from our fleet of 15 in-orbit geostationary\nsatellites, as well as our Canadian payload on the ViaSat-1 satellite. We also manage the operations of additional\nsatellites for third parties.\nWe are developing what we believe will be one of the world’s most advanced constellations of low earth orbit\nsatellites and integrated terrestrial infrastructure, called “Telesat Lightspeed” — a platform designed to revolutionize the\nprovision of global broadband connectivity. In January 2018, our first LEO satellite, LEO 1, was successfully launched\ninto orbit. The LEO 1 satellite demonstrated certain key features of the Telesat Lightspeed system design, specifically\nthe capability of the satellite and customer terminals to deliver a low latency broadband experience. In July 2023, we\nsuccessfully launched our LEO 3 satellite into orbit. We also installed ground infrastructure at our teleport in Allan Park,\nOntario, to support testing with a variety of existing and prospective customers and potential suppliers of the Telesat\nLightspeed system hardware who have been participating in trials since the second half of 2018.\n84\nTelesat and its affiliates operate satellites pursuant to authorizations granted by governments, including those\nof Canada, the United States, Brazil, the Kingdom of Tonga and the United Kingdom, to access and use certain\ngeostationary orbital locations and associated spectrum resources. The use of these orbital locations, as well as our\nother operations, is subject to a variety of Canadian and international regulations.\nRevenue\nWe earn most of our revenue by providing video and data services using satellite transponder capacity. We\nalso earn revenue by providing ground-based transmit and receive services, selling equipment, managing satellite\nnetworks, and providing consulting services in the field of satellite communications.\nWe recognize revenue from satellite services on a monthly basis as services are performed in an amount that\nreflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those services. We account for a contract when it has\napproval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the\ncontract has commercial substance and collectability is considered probable.\nConsulting revenue for cost plus contracts is recognized as the approved time and labor is completed by Telesat.\nWe recognize consulting revenue for fixed price contracts using the input method to determine the progress towards\ncomplete satisfaction of the performance obligation. Equipment sale revenue is recognized when the customer obtains\ncontrol of the equipment, being at the time the equipment is delivered to and accepted by the customer.\nExpenses\nOur operating expenses consist of labor, the cost of which has historically been relatively stable, and variable\noperating expenses which include in-orbit insurance and direct-billed expenses, such as third-party contractor services.\nAs we further our Lightspeed development, we anticipate that our labor costs will increase.\nInterest expense is significant and arises principally from our: Senior Secured Credit Facilities comprised of two\noutstanding secured credit facilities, which include a revolving facility maturing in 2024 and Term Loan B (“U.S. TLB\nFacility”) maturing in 2026 (together, the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities”); 6.5% senior unsecured notes due in 2027\nissued by Telesat Canada and Telesat LLC, as the co-issuer (the “Senior Unsecured Notes”); 4.875% senior secured\nnotes due in 2027 issued by Telesat Canada and Telesat LLC, as the co-issuer (the “Senior Secured Notes”); and\n5.625% senior secured notes due in December 2026 issued by Telesat Canada and Telesat LLC, as the co-issuer (the\n“2026 Senior Secured Notes”).\nOther significant operating expenses include the straight-line depreciation of the cost of each of our satellites\nover their useful lives and amortization expense related to various finite-life intangible assets.\nFUTURE OUTLOOK\nOur desirable spectrum rights, commitment to providing the highest level of customer service, deep technical\nexpertise and culture of innovation have enabled us to successfully develop our business to date. Leveraging these\nstrengths and building on our existing contractual revenue backlog, our focus is on profitably growing our business by\nincreasing the utilization of our in-orbit satellites and, in a disciplined manner, deploying expansion satellite capacity\nwhere we anticipate there will be strong market demand.\nAfter decades of developing and successfully operating our geosynchronous orbit-based satellite services business,\nwe are now poised to revolutionize the provision of global broadband connectivity by developing what we believe will be the\none of world’s most advanced constellations of LEO satellites and integrated terrestrial infrastructure, Telesat Lightspeed.\nWe believe we are well-positioned to serve our customers and the markets in which we participate. Although we\npursue opportunities to develop new satellites, we do not procure additional or replacement satellites until we believe\nthere is a demonstrated need and a sound business plan for such satellite capacity.\nLeading into 2024, we remain focused on increasing the utilization of our existing satellites, the development of\nour global Telesat Lightspeed constellation, and identifying and pursuing opportunities to invest in expansion satellite\ncapacity all while maintaining our operating discipline.\n85\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nReview of financial performance\nTelesat’s net income for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $583.3 million compared to net loss of\n$81.6 million for the prior year. The positive variation of $664.9 million was principally due to C-band clearing\nproceeds recognized in the second quarter of 2023 combined with a positive variation in foreign exchange gain (loss)\non the conversion of U.S. dollar debt into Canadian dollars and a higher gain on repurchase of debt. This was partially\noffset by the impairment tied to certain orbital slots and Telstar 19 VANTAGE.\nBelow are the foreign exchange rates used for our audited consolidated financial statements and this MD&A:\n2023 2022 2021\nUS$ to $ spot rate as at December 31, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.3243 1.3554 1.2637\nUS$ to $ average rate for the year ended December 31, . . . . . . 1.3493 1.3017 1.2556\nRevenue\nYears ended December 31, % Increase\n($ millions except percentages) 2023 2022 (Decrease)\nBroadcast . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 331.8 $ 358.7 (7.5)%\nEnterprise . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 359.7 389.0 (7.5)%\nConsulting and other . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12.6 11.5 9.2%\nRevenue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 704.2 $ 759.2 (7.2)%\nTotal revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, decreased by $55.0 million to $704.2 million compared to\n$759.2 million for the prior year.\nRevenue from Broadcast services decreased by $26.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, when\ncompared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to a lower rate on the renewal of a long-term agreement\nwith a North American DTH customer, combined with a reduction of services and rate by another North American\nDTH customer. This was partially offset by a favorable foreign exchange impact on the conversion of U.S. dollar\ndenominated revenue into the Canadian dollar equivalent.\nRevenue from Enterprise services decreased by $29.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, when\ncompared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to the completion of an equipment sale in 2022 to the\nDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (“DARPA”) which was not repeated in 2023, combined with lower\nrevenue from certain Latin American customers, partially offset by a favorable foreign exchange impact on the\nconversion of U.S. dollar denominated revenue into the Canadian dollar equivalent.\nConsulting and other revenue increased by $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, when compared\nto the prior year. The increase was primarily due to an increased level of consulting activity.\nExpenses\nYears ended December 31, % Increase\n($ millions except percentages) 2023 2022 (Decrease)\nDepreciation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 182.7 $ 188.8 (3.2)%\nAmortization . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13.1 15.0 (12.6)%\nOperating expenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 204.6 259.0 (21.0 )%\nOther operating (gains) , net . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The increase in interest expense\nwas primarily due to an increase in interest rates on the U.S. TLB Facility combined with an unfavorable foreign\nexchange impact on the conversion of U.S. dollar denominated debt service costs into the Canadian dollar equivalent.\n87\nThis was partially offset by the impact of the repurchase of a portion of the U.S. TLB Facility, Senior Unsecured Notes,\nSenior Secured Notes and 2026 Senior Secured Notes combined with the impact of the maturity of one of our interest\nrate swaps in September 2022.\nInterest expense on significant financing component decreased by $1.5 million for the year ended December 31,\n2023, when compared to the prior year. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower average prepayment\nbalances for revenue agreements with a significant financing component.\nInterest on satellite performance incentive payments decreased by $0.3 million for the year ended December 31,\n2023, when compared to the prior year, primarily due to declining balances of satellite performance incentive liabilities.\nInterest expense on employee benefit plans decreased by $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023,\nwhen compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to a lower estimate of interest expense according to\nactuarial reports.\nInterest expense on leases decreased by $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, when compared to\nthe prior year.

The majority of our contracted\nrevenue backlog is generated from contractual agreements for satellite capacity. We do not include revenue beyond the\nstated expiration date of a contract regardless of the potential for a renewal. As at December 31, 2023, our contracted\nbacklog was approximately $1.3 billion, which does not include any backlog associated with the Telesat Lightspeed\nprogram. For the last three years we have had, on average, approximately 80% of each year’s total revenue already\nunder contract at the beginning of the year.\nGenerally, following the successful launch of a satellite, if the satellite is operating nominally, our customers may\nonly terminate their service agreements for satellite capacity by paying us all, or substantially all, of the payments that\nwould have otherwise become due over the term of the service agreement. However, if certain of our existing satellites\nwere to experience an in-orbit failure, or otherwise fail to operate as anticipated, our customers may be entitled to\nterminate their agreement and we may be obligated to return all or a portion of the customer prepayments made\nunder service agreements for that satellite and reduce the associated contractual revenue from revenue backlog. Any\nrepayments under such conditions would be funded by insurance proceeds we may receive, cash on hand, short-term\ninvestments, and funds available under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below).\nWe expect our backlog as at December 31, 2023 to be recognized as follows:\n($ millions) 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter\nBacklog . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 453.5 $ 276.5 $ 202.4 $ 131.4 $ 67.5 $ 216.5\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCash and Available Credit\nAs at December 31, 2023, we had $1,669.1 million of cash and short-term investments, including $1,247.2 million\nheld in unrestricted subsidiaries, as well as approximately $200.0 million U.S. dollars (or Canadian dollar equivalent)\nborrowing availability under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nCash Flows generated from Operating Activities\nCash generated from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $169.1 million, a\n$59.8 million decrease compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to higher interest paid combined\nwith an increase in accounts receivable, partially offset by lower income taxes paid and higher interest received.\n89\nCash Flows generated from Investing Activities\nCash generated from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $211.9 million. This consisted\nof proceeds received from the Phase II accelerated clearing payments for the repurposing of C-band spectrum of\n$351.4 million. This cash inflow was partially offset by payments associated with the Telesat Lightspeed constellation\nand the newly acquired Anik F4 satellite.\nCash generated from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $0.1 million. This consisted\nof proceeds received from the Phase I accelerated clearing payments for the repurposing of C-band spectrum of\n$64.7 million. This cash inflow was partially offset by $31.8 million on payments associated with the Telesat Lightspeed\nconstellation and $32.7 million of payments for property and other equipment.\nCash Flows used in Financing Activities\nCash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $354.7 million. This was primarily\ndue to the repurchase of a portion of the Senior Unsecured Notes, Senior Secured Notes, 2026 Senior Secured Notes\nand U.S. TLB Facility.\nCash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $104.9 million. This was primarily\ndue to the repurchase of a portion of the Senior Unsecured Notes, combined with the payment of final transaction\nadjustment amount and payments on the satellite performance incentive liabilities. This was partially offset by cash\nreceived from our government grant.\nGovernment Grant\nIn 2019, we entered into an agreement with the Government of Canada (“GoC”) pursuant to which the GoC\nwould contribute up to $85.0 million to support the development of the Telesat Lightspeed constellation through\nthe GoC Strategic Innovation Fund. In return for the grant, Telesat has made a number of commitments to the GoC,\nincluding commitments to conduct over $200.0 million of research and development activities in Canada as well as to\nexpand its Canadian workforce.\nThe costs that were incurred in connection with this program to date are summarized below:\nYears ended December 31,\n($ millions) 2023 2022 2021\nSatellites, property and other equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 106.9 $ 51.3 $ 323.0\nIntangible assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16.4 — —\nOperating expenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 48.3 65.8 31.7\nTotal costs incurred . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 171.6 $ 117.1 $ 354.7\nTotal research and development costs for Telesat Lightspeed for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by\n$54.4 million, when compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in the development\nactivities in the Telesat Lightspeed program.\nTotal research and development costs for Telesat Lightspeed for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased by\n$237.6 million from $354.7 million to $117.1 million, when compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily\ndriven by a reduction in the development activities in the Telesat Lightspeed program.\nThe following claims against the government grant have been made to date against the costs incurred associated\nwith the program:\nYears ended December 31,\n($ millions) 2023 2022 2021\nSatellites, property and other equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 15.0 $ 3.5 $ 10.0\nOperating expenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4.5 5.2 4.8\nPrepaid expenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . — 0.1 —\nTotal costs incurred . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 19.5 $ 8.8 $ 14.8\n90\nLiquidity\nA large portion of our annual cash receipts are reasonably predictable because they are primarily derived from\nan existing backlog of long-term customer contracts. We believe cash and short-term investments as at December 31,\n2023, cash flows from operating activities, and drawings on the Revolving Credit Facility under our Senior Secured\nCredit Facilities will be adequate to meet our expected cash requirements for at least the next twelve months for\nactivities in the normal course of business, including required interest and principal payments on our indebtedness and\nour capital requirements. This includes the commitments we have made to date for our Telesat Lightspeed program, but\nit does not include the capital that would be required to commence construction of the constellation.\nWe have from time to time used available cash to repurchase some of our existing debt. In the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, we repurchased Senior Secured Notes, 2026 Senior Secured Notes, Senior Unsecured Notes and\na portion of our U.S. TLB Facility with a principal amount of US$100.0 million, US$101.0 million, US$95.0 million\nand US$131.0 million, respectively, in exchange for a combined total of US$255.6 million. We may from time to\ntime continue to seek to repay, repurchase, exchange, refinance or otherwise retire our existing debt in open market\ntransactions, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers, exchange offers, pursuant to the term of debt or otherwise,\nand have been authorized by our Board of Directors to use up to an additional US$195 million on the further repurchase\nof our existing debt, should we choose to do so. We may also incur additional debt to fund such transactions or\nexchange existing debt for newly issued debt obligations or equity or equity-like securities. Such transactions, if any,\nwill depend on prevailing market conditions, trading prices of debt from time to time, our liquidity requirements and\ncash position, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amount involved in any such transactions, individually\nor in the aggregate, may be material. We cannot provide any assurance as to if or when we will consummate any such\ntransactions or the terms of any such transactions.\nThe construction of any satellite replacement or expansion program will require significant capital expenditures,\nin particular the planned Telesat Lightspeed constellation. Cash required for any future satellite programs may be\nfunded from a range of sources including: cash and short-term investments, cash flows generated from operating\nactivities, cash flows from customer prepayments or through borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility under the\nSenior Secured Credit Facilities; vendor financing; equity investments, including through the issuance of public equity;\nexport credit agency financing; additional secured or unsecured debt financing; and from government sources. We\nmay raise additional funding for the Telesat Lightspeed constellation through the issuance of additional equity of, or\ndebt at, our unrestricted subsidiaries which will own, operate and commercialize the Telesat Lightspeed constellation.\nIn addition, we may sell certain satellite assets and, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Senior\nSecured Credit Facilities, reinvest the proceeds in replacement satellites or pay down indebtedness under the Senior\nSecured Credit Facilities. However, our ability to access these sources of funding is not guaranteed, and therefore, we\nmay not be able to fully fund additional replacement or new satellite programs.\nWe are developing our planned Telesat Lightspeed constellation in Unrestricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the\ncredit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities (the “Credit Agreement”) and indentures governing\nthe Senior Unsecured Notes, Senior Secured Notes and 2026 Senior Secured Notes (together, the “Indentures”)), and\nwe expect to complete the development of, fund, and operate our Telesat Lightspeed constellation through current or\nfuture Unrestricted Subsidiaries.\nDebt\nSenior Secured Credit Facilities\nThe obligations under the Credit Agreement and the guarantees of those obligations are secured, subject to\ncertain exceptions, by a first priority security interest in the assets of Telesat Canada and certain of our subsidiaries\n(“Guarantors”). The Credit Agreement contains covenants that restrict the ability of Telesat Canada and the Guarantors\nto take specified actions, including, among other things and subject to certain significant exceptions: creating liens,\nincurring indebtedness, making investments, engaging in mergers, selling property, paying dividends, entering into\nsale-leaseback transactions, creating subsidiaries, repaying subordinated debt or amending organizational documents.\nThe Credit Agreement also requires Telesat Canada and the Guarantors to comply with a maximum first lien leverage\nratio and contains customary events of default and affirmative covenants, including an excess cash sweep, that may\nrequire us to repay a portion of the outstanding principal under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities prior to the stated\nmaturity.\n91\nOur Senior Secured Credit Facilities are comprised of the following facilities:\ni — Revolving Credit Facility\nOur Revolving Credit Facility (“Revolving Facility”) is a $200.0 million loan facility available in either U.S. dollar\nor Canadian dollar equivalent, maturing in December 2024. Loans under the Revolving Facility bore interest at a\nfloating interest rate. For Canadian Prime Rate and Alternative Base Rate (“ABR”) loans, an applicable margin ranging\nfrom 0.75% to 1.25% is applied to the Prime Rate and ABR as these interest rates are defined in the Senior Secured\nCredit Facilities. For Bankers Acceptance (“BA”) Loans and Eurodollar Loans, an applicable margin ranging from\n1.75% to 2.25% is applied to either the BA interest rate or London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). The rates on\nthe Revolving Facility vary depending upon the results of the first lien leverage ratio. Our Revolving Facility currently\nhas an unused commitment fee that ranges from 25 to 37.5 basis points per annum, depending upon the result of the\ntotal leverage ratio.\nOn May 9, 2023, Telesat Canada entered into a seventh amendment (the “Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement.\nThe Amendment amended the Credit Agreement to replace LIBOR-based benchmark rates with Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate (“SOFR”)-based benchmark rates and to make certain other conforming changes. Following the\nAmendment, loans under the Revolving Facility will bear interest, at Telesat Canada’s option, at either (x) in the case of\nloans denominated in Canadian Dollars, (i) a floating rate based on the Canadian prime rate, plus an applicable margin\nranging from 0.75% to 1.25% or (ii) a floating rate based on the Canadian BA rate, plus an applicable margin ranging\nfrom 1.75% to 2.25%, or (y) in the case of loans denominated in US dollars, (i) a floating rate based on the base rate,\nplus an applicable margin ranging from 0.75% to 1.25% or (ii) a floating rate based on SOFR, plus an applicable\nmargin ranging from 1.75% to 2.25%.\nAs at December 31, 2023, other than approximately $0.2 million in drawings related to letters of credit, there\nwere no borrowings under this facility.\nii — Term Loan B — U.S. Facility\nOur Term Loan B — U.S. Facility is a US$1,908.5 million facility maturing in December 2026. As at December 31,\n2023, the outstanding balance was US$1,421.8 million.\nThe borrowings under our U.S. TLB Facility bore interest at a floating rate of either: (i) LIBOR as periodically\ndetermined for interest rate periods selected by Telesat Canada in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured\nCredit Facilities plus an applicable margin of 2.75%; or (ii) Alternative Base Rate as determined in accordance with\nthe terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities plus an applicable margin of 1.75%.\nOn May 9, 2023, Telesat Canada entered into the Amendment to the Credit Agreement. The Amendment amends\nthe Credit Agreement to replace LIBOR-based benchmark rates with SOFR-based benchmark rates and to make\ncertain other conforming changes. Following the Amendment, loans under the Term Loan B Facility will bear interest,\nat Telesat Canada’s option, at either (i) a floating rate based on the base rate, plus an applicable margin of 1.75%\nor (ii) a floating rate based on SOFR, plus an applicable margin of 2.75%. In addition, loans benchmarked against\nSOFR will be subject to a credit spread adjustment of 0.11448% for a one-month interest period, 0.26161% for a\nthree-month interest period and 0.42826% for a six-month interest period.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased a portion of our U.S. TLB Facility with a principal\namount of $177.6 million (US$131.0 million) in exchange for $133.8 million (US$98.8 million). The repurchases\nresulted in a gain on repurchase of debt of $43.8 million.\nAs at December 31, 2023, US$1,421.8 million of this facility was outstanding, which represents the full amount\navailable.\nThe mandatory principal repayments on our U.S. TLB Facility are one quarter of 1.00% of the value of the loan,\nwhich must be paid on the last day of each quarter. There are currently no mandatory quarterly principal repayments\nrequired.\n92\nSenior Secured Notes\nOur Senior Secured Notes, in the amount of US$400.0 million, bear interest at an annual rate of 4.875% and\nare due in June 2027. The indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes includes covenants or terms that restrict\nour ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, incur liens, pay dividends or make certain other\nrestricted payments, investments or acquisitions, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, modify or cancel our\nsatellite insurance, effect mergers with another entity, and redeem our Senior Secured Notes, without penalty, before\nDecember 1, 2024, in each case subject to exceptions provided in the Senior Secured Notes indenture.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased Senior Secured Notes with a principal amount of\n$133.6 million (US$100.0 million) in exchange for $77.0 million (US$57.6 million). The repurchases resulted in a\ngain on repurchase of debt of $56.7 million. The repurchases also resulted in a write-off of the related debt issue costs\nand prepayment options.\nAs at December 31, 2023, US$300.0 million Senior Secured Notes were outstanding.\n2026 Senior Secured Notes\nOn April 27, 2021, we issued US$500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2026 Senior Secured\nNotes which bear interest at an annual rate of 5.625% and are due in December 2026. The indenture governing the\n2026 Senior Secured Notes includes covenants and terms that restrict our ability to, among other things, incur additional\nindebtedness, incur liens, pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments, investments or acquisitions, enter\ninto certain transactions with affiliates, modify or cancel its satellite insurance, and effect mergers with another entity,\nin each case subject to exceptions provided in such indenture.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased 2026 Senior Secured Notes with a principal amount\nof $134.5 million (US$101.0 million) in exchange for $79.6 million (US$59.7 million). The repurchases resulted in a\ngain on repurchase of debt of $55.0 million. The repurchases also resulted in a write-off of the related debt issue costs\nand prepayment options.\nAs at December 31, 2023, US$399.0 million 2026 Senior Secured Notes were outstanding.\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nOur Senior Unsecured Notes, in the original principal amount of US$550.0 million, bear interest at an annual\nrate of 6.5% and are due in October 2027. The indenture governing the Senior Unsecured Notes includes covenants\nor terms that restrict our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, incur liens, pay dividends or\nmake certain other restricted payments, investments or acquisitions, enter into certain transactions with affiliates,\nmodify or cancel our satellite insurance, effect mergers with another entity, and redeem our Senior Unsecured Notes,\nwithout penalty, before October 15, 2024, in each case subject to exceptions provided in the Senior Unsecured Notes\nindenture.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased Senior Unsecured Notes with a principal amount of\n$128.9 million (US$95.0 million) in exchange for $53.7 million (US$39.5 million). The repurchases resulted in a gain\non repurchase of debt of $75.3 million. The repurchases also resulted in a write-off of the related debt issue costs and\nprepayment options.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased for retirement Senior Unsecured Notes with a\nprincipal amount of $202.1 million (US$160.0 million) in exchange for $97.2 million (US$77.0 million). The\nrepurchase resulted in a write-off of the related debt issue costs and prepayment options in the amount of $1.9 million\n(US$1.5 million) and a gain on extinguishment of debt of $106.9 million (US$84.5 million).\n93\nAs at December 31, 2023, US$295.0 million Senior Unsecured Notes were outstanding.\nCovenant Compliance\nAs at December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with the financial covenants of our Senior Secured Credit\nFacilities, the indenture governing our Senior Unsecured Notes, the indenture governing our Senior Secured Notes and\nthe indenture governing our 2026 Senior Secured Notes.\nDebt Service Cost\nThe interest expense on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, Senior Unsecured Notes, Senior Secured Notes,\nand 2026 Senior Secured Notes, excluding the impact of the amortization of deferred financing costs, prepayment\noptions and loss on repayment for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $252.2 million.\nDerivatives\nWe use, from time to time, interest rate and currency derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in interest\nrates and foreign exchange rates.\nWe also have embedded derivatives that are accounted for separately at fair value. These embedded derivatives\nare related to the prepayment option on our Senior Unsecured Notes, the prepayment option on our Senior Secured\nNotes and the prepayment option on our 2026 Senior Secured Notes. As at December 31, 2023, the fair value of the\nembedded derivatives related to the prepayment option on our Senior Unsecured Notes, Senior Secured Notes and\n2026 Senior Secured Notes was $Nil.\nThe changes in the fair value of these embedded derivatives are recorded on our consolidated statements of\nincome as a gain or loss on changes in fair value of financial instruments and are non-cash.\nAll derivative instruments are measured at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset\nor paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal market under current\nmarket conditions at the measurement date. Where possible, fair values are based on the quoted market values in an\nactive market. In the absence of an active market, we determine fair values based on prevailing market rates (bid and\nask prices, as appropriate) for instruments with similar characteristics and risk profiles or internal or external valuation\nmodels, such as option pricing models and discounted cash flow analysis, using observable market-based inputs.\nThese estimates are affected significantly by the assumptions for the amount and timing of estimated future\ncash flows and discount rates, which all reflect varying degrees of risk. Potential income taxes and other expenses\nthat would be incurred on disposition of our derivative instruments are not reflected in the fair values. The fair values\nalso include an adjustment related to the counterparty credit risk. As a result, the fair values are not necessarily the net\namounts that would be realized if these instruments were actually settled.\n94\nMATERIAL CASH REQUIREMENTS\nA summary of the material cash requirements that are due in each of the next five years and after 2028 are\nsummarized the table below:\n($ millions) 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Total\nSatellite performance\nincentive payments,\nincluding interest(1) . . . . . . $ 5.6 $ 3.3 $ 3.3 $ 2.5 $ 2.4 $ 5.4 $ 22.5\nSenior Secured Credit\nFacilities and Notes(2) . . . . $ — $ — $ 2,411.3 $ 788.0 $ — $ — $ 3,199.2\nInterest on long-term\nindebtedness(2) . . . . . . . . . . $ 249.8 $ 234.8 $ 224.3 $ 35.1 $ — $ — $ 744.0\nLease liabilities(3) . . . . . . . . . . $ 3.8 $ 3.7 $ 3.1 $ 2.9 $ 2.9 $ 30.8 $ 47.2\nProperty lease\ncommitments(4) . . . . . . . . . $ 1.1 $ 1.1 $ 1.1 $ 1.0 $ 1.0 $ 10.2 $ 15.5\nCommitments for capital\nexpenditures(5) . . . . . . . . . . $ 76 .9 $ 55.1 $ 5.3 $ 6.0 $ — $ — $ 143.3\nOther operating\ncommitments(6) . . . . . . . . . $ 31.5 $ 14.1 $ 9.4 $ 8.3 $ 18.7 $ 68.0 $ 150.1\nContributions to defined\nbenefit plans(7) . . . . . . . . . . $ 4.7 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 4.7\n(1) Satellite performance incentive payments are obligations payable to satellite manufacturers over the lives of certain satellites.\nSatellite performance incentive payments will be paid through the usage of cash and short-term investments, cash flows from\noperating activities, or drawings on the Revolving Credit Facility under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities.\n(2) Balance relates to Senior Secured Credit Facilities, Senior Unsecured Notes, Senior Secured Notes and 2026 Senior Secured\nNotes and all corresponding interest thereon, excluding the impact of the amortization of deferred financing costs, loss on\nrepayment and prepayment options. Over the next twelve months, the payments will be paid through the usage of cash and\nshort-term investments, cash flows from operating activities, or drawings on the Revolving Credit Facility under our Senior\nSecured Credit Facilities.\n(3) Balance relates to payments to be made in connection with leases. Over the next twelve months, the payments will be made\nthrough the usage of cash and short-term investments, cash flows from operating activities, or drawings on the Revolving\nCredit Facility under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities.\n(4) Property lease commitments consists of off-balance sheet contractual obligations for land or building usage. Over the next\ntwelve months, the payments will be made through the usage of cash and short-term investments, cash flows from operating\nactivities, or drawings on the Revolving Credit Facility under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities.\n(5) We have entered into contracts for the development of our Telesat Lightspeed constellation and other capital expenditures.\nThese expenditures may be funded from some or all of the following: cash and short-term investments, cash flow from\noperating activities, cash flow from customer prepayments or funds available under our Revolving Credit Facility.\n(6) Other operating commitments consisted of third-party satellite capacity arrangements as well as other commitments that are\nnot categorized as property leases or capital commitments. Over the next twelve months, the payments will be made through\nthe usage of cash and short-term investments, cash flows from operating activities, or drawings on the Revolving Credit\nFacility under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities.\n(7) Over the next twelve months, contributions to the defined benefit pension plans will be made through the usage of cash\nand short-term investments and cash flows from operating activities. Certain contributions subsequent to 2024 are not\nquantifiable as they are largely dependent on the result of actuarial valuations that are performed periodically and on the\ninvestment performance of the pension fund assets.\nMARKET RISK\nCredit Risk Related to Financial Instruments\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash and\nshort-term investments, accounts receivable, derivative assets and other assets. Cash and short-term investments are\ninvested with high quality financial institutions and are governed by our corporate investment policy, which aims\nto reduce credit risk by restricting investments to high-grade, mainly U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar denominated\ninvestments. Credit checks are performed to minimize exposure to any one customer. We are exposed to credit risk if\n95\ncounterparties to our derivative instruments are unable to meet their obligations. It is expected that these counterparties\nwill be able to meet their obligations as they are institutions with strong credit ratings, but we continue to periodically\nmonitor their credit risk and credit exposure.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nOur operating results are subject to fluctuations as a result of exchange rate variations to the extent that transactions\nare made in currencies other than Canadian dollars. The most significant impact of variations in the exchange rate\nis on our U.S. dollar denominated indebtedness and cash and short-term investments. In addition, a portion of our\nrevenue and expenses, as well as the majority of our capital expenditures are denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result,\nthe volatility of the U.S. currency exposes us to foreign exchange risks.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded a mainly non-cash foreign exchange gain of approximately\n$77.8 million due to a weaker U.S. dollar to Canadian dollar spot rate ($1.3243) compared to December 31, 2022\n($1.3554).\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a mainly non-cash foreign exchange loss of approximately\n$239.6 million due to stronger U.S. dollar to Canadian dollar spot rate ($1.3554) compared to December 31, 2021\n($1.2637).\nThe approximate amount of our revenue and certain expenses denominated in U.S. dollars, as a percentage of\ntheir overall balance, is summarized in the table below:\nYears ended December 31, 2023 2022\nRevenue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 52.3% 53.8%\nOperating expenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 39.3 % 37.1%\nInterest on our indebtedness . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100.0% 100.0%\nWe use, from time to time, the following instruments to manage our exposure to foreign exchange risk:\n• forward currency contracts to hedge foreign exchange risk on anticipated cash flows, mainly related to the\nconstruction of satellites and interest payments; and\n• currency derivative instruments to hedge the foreign exchange risk on our U.S. dollar denominated\nindebtedness.\nOur policy is that we do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes. As at December 31, 2023, we\nhave no forward currency contracts nor any currency derivative instruments.\nA five percent increase (decrease) in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar would have\nincreased (decreased) our indebtedness as at December 31, 2023 and (decreased) increased our net income for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023 by $160.0 million.\nA five percent increase (decrease) in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar would have increased\n(decreased) our cash and cash equivalents by $75.5 million, increased (decreased) our net income by $10.6 million and\nincreased (decreased) our other comprehensive income by $64.9 million as at and for the year ended December 31,\n2023.\nA five percent increase (decrease) in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar would have increased\n(decreased) our revenue and certain expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023, as summarized in the table below:\n($ millions)\nRevenue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 18.4\nOperating expenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 4.0\nInterest on our indebtedness . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 12.7\nThe sensitivity analyses above assume that all other variables remain constant.\nThrough our U.S. dollar denominated indebtedness, we are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations.

The interest\nrate risk on the indebtedness is from a portion of the indebtedness having a variable interest rate. Changes in the\ninterest rates could impact the amount of interest that we receive or are required to pay.\nWe use, from time to time, interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk related to our indebtedness.\nOur policy is that we do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes. In October 2017, we entered into\nfour interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the variable interest rate on US$1,800.0 million\nof the U.S. denominated Term Loan B at fixed interest rates, excluding applicable margins, ranging from 1.72% to\n2.04%. As the final interest rate swap matured in 2022, there were no outstanding interest rate swaps as at December 31,\n2023 or 2022.\nIf the interest rates on our variable rate debt increased (decreased) by 0.25%, the result would be a decrease\n(increase) of $5.1 million to our net income for year ended December 31, 2023.\nAs at December 31, 2023, through our U.S. TLB Facility we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations. The\nfollowing table contains the balance of the U.S. TLB facility at the beginning of each respective year, net of our\nscheduled repayments, and based on the foreign exchange rate as at December 31, 2023.\n($ millions) 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter\nU.S. TLB Facility . . . . . . . . $ 1,882.8 $ 1,882.8 $ 1,882.8 $ — $ — $ —\nGuarantees\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into agreements that provide for indemnification and guarantees\nto counterparties in transactions involving sales of assets, sales of services, purchases and development of assets,\nsecuritization agreements and operating leases. The nature of almost all of these indemnifications prevents us from\nmaking a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount that we could be required to pay counterparties. As a\nresult, we cannot determine how they could affect future liquidity, capital resources or our credit risk profile. We have\nnot made any significant payments under these indemnifications in the past. For more information, see Note 34 of our\naudited consolidated financial statements.\nNON-IFRS MEASURES\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure. The common definition of EBITDA is “Earnings Before Interest,\nTaxes, Depreciation and Amortization.” In evaluating financial performance, we use revenue and deduct operating\nexpenses (excluding share-based compensation expense and unusual and non-recurring items, including restructuring\nrelated expenses) to obtain operating income before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted\nEBITDA”) and the Adjusted EBITDA margin (defined as the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to revenue) as measures of\nour operating performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA allows investors and us to compare our operating results with that of competitors exclusive\nof depreciation and amortization, interest and investment income, interest expense, taxes and certain other expenses.\nFinancial results of competitors in the satellite services industry have significant variations that can result from timing\nof capital expenditures, the amount of intangible assets recorded, the differences in assets’ lives, the timing and amount\nof investments, the effects of other income (expense), and unusual and non-recurring items. The use of Adjusted\n97\nEBITDA assists investors and us to compare operating results exclusive of these items. Competitors in the satellite\nservices industry have significantly different capital structures. We believe the use of Adjusted EBITDA improves\ncomparability of performance by excluding interest expense.\nWe believe the use of Adjusted EBITDA and the Adjusted EBITDA margin along with IFRS financial measures\nenhances the understanding of our operating results and is useful to investors and us in comparing performance with\ncompetitors, estimating enterprise value and making investment decisions. Adjusted EBITDA as used here may not\nbe the same as similarly titled measures reported by competitors. Adjusted EBITDA should be used in conjunction\nwith IFRS financial measures and is not presented as a substitute for cash flows from operations as a measure of our\nliquidity or as a substitute for net income (loss) as an indicator of our operating performance.\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA.\nYears ended December 31,\n($ millions) 2023 2022\nNet income (loss) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 583 .3 $ (81.6 )\nTax expense (recovery) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 89.6 51.4\n(Gain) loss on changes in fair value of financial instruments . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . — (4.3)\n(Gain) loss on foreign exchange . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in revenues, as discussed above, partially offset by a\ndecrease in operating expense.\nConsolidated EBITDA for Covenant Purposes\nUnder the terms of the Credit Agreement for our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, we are required to comply\nwith a senior secured leverage ratio maintenance covenant as well as with other financial ratio covenants that impact,\namong other items, our ability to incur debt and make dividend payments.\nIf our Revolving Credit Facility is drawn by more than 35% of the Credit Facility amount, our Credit Agreement\nrequires us to comply with a first lien net leverage ratio of 5.75:1.00, tested quarterly, and failure to comply will\nresult in an event of default. We refer to this first lien net leverage ratio as the Consolidated Total Secured Debt to\nConsolidated EBITDA for Covenant Purposes ratio.\nOur Credit Agreement limits, among other items, our ability to incur debt and make dividend payments if the\ntotal leverage ratio is above 4.50:1.00, with certain exceptions. We refer to this total leverage ratio as the Consolidated\nTotal Debt for Covenant Purposes to Consolidated EBITDA for the purposes of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities.\nOur Consolidated Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Covenant Purposes is\ndefined as net income (loss) for Telesat Canada and Restricted Subsidiaries plus interest expense, net of cash interest\nincome earned on cash and cash equivalents, depreciation expense, amortization expense, extraordinary losses and\nunusual and non-recurring charges, non-cash charges, any expenses or charges incurred in connection with any\nissuance of debt, any impairment charges or asset write off, foreign withholding taxes paid or accrued and non-cash\n98\ncharges related to share-based compensation expense. Additional sums which may be added include projected cost\nsavings from an acquisition and lost revenue which may have been earned by satellites that have been subject to\nan insured loss. Deductions which are made in calculating Consolidated EBITDA for Covenant Purposes include\nextraordinary, non-recurring gains and losses and non-cash gains and losses.\nFurther adjustments are made to account for income from Unrestricted Subsidiaries, and currency gains and losses\n(including non-cash gains or losses on derivative contracts). Unrestricted Subsidiaries are (a) any Subsidiary of Telesat\nthat is formed or acquired after the closing date of the Credit Agreement, provided that such Subsidiary is designated as\nan Unrestricted Subsidiary, and (b) any Restricted Subsidiary subsequently re-designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary.\nConsolidated EBITDA for Covenant Purposes is not a presentation made in accordance with IFRS, is not a\nmeasure of financial condition or profitability, and should not be considered as an alternative to (1) net income\n(loss) determined in accordance with IFRS or (2) cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance\nwith IFRS. Additionally, Consolidated EBITDA for Covenant Purposes is not intended to be a measure of free cash\nflow for management’s discretionary use as it does not include certain cash requirements for such items as interest\npayments, tax payments and debt service requirements. We believe that the inclusion of Consolidated EBITDA for\nCovenant Purposes herein is appropriate to provide additional information concerning the calculation of the financial\nratio maintenance covenant and other covenants on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Consolidated EBITDA for\nCovenant Purposes is a material component of these covenants. Non-compliance with the financial ratio maintenance\ncovenant contained in our Senior Secured Credit Facilities could result in the requirement to immediately repay all\namounts outstanding. This presentation of Consolidated EBITDA for Covenant Purposes is not comparable to other\nsimilarly titled measures of other companies because not all companies use identical calculations of EBITDA. We\nbelieve the disclosure of the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA for Covenant Purposes provides information that is\nuseful to an investor’s understanding of our liquidity and financial flexibility.\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income (loss), which is an IFRS measure of our operating results, to\nConsolidated EBITDA for Covenant Purposes, as defined in the Credit Agreement and the calculation of the ratio of\nConsolidated Total Secured Debt to Consolidated EBITDA for Covenant Purposes as defined in the Credit Agreement.\nThe terms and related calculations are defined in the Credit Agreement, a copy of which is publicly available at\nhttps://www.sec.gov.\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n( $ millions) 2023\nNet income (loss) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 583 .3\nImpact of unrestricted subsidiaries . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

preparation of financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as\nissued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as at the date of\nthe financial statements, and the amounts of revenue and expenses reported for the year� Actual results could differ\nfrom these estimates under different assumptions and conditions� For more details on these estimates, refer to Note 5\nof our audited consolidated financial statements�\nCritical judgments in applying accounting policies\nDeferred revenue\nCertain of our revenue agreements were noted to have a significant financing component� Judgment by\nmanagement is required to determine the discount rate used in the significant financing component calculation� There\nwere no new agreements entered into in 2023 which included a significant financing component�\nLease liability\nJudgment by management is required in the determination of the likelihood that the lease renewal periods will be\nexercised as well as the determination of the incremental borrowing rate� There were no new material lease agreements\nin 2023�\nUncertain income tax positions\nWe operate in numerous jurisdictions and are subject to country-specific tax laws� We use significant judgment\nwhen determining the worldwide provision for tax, and estimate provisions for uncertain tax positions as the amounts\nexpected to be paid based on a qualitative assessment of all relevant factors� In the assessment, we consider risk with\nrespect to tax matters under active discussion, audit, dispute or appeal with tax authorities, or which are otherwise\nconsidered to involve uncertainty� We review the provisions at each balance sheet date�\nSoftware as a service arrangements\nJudgment by management is required to determine whether configuration or customization of a software results\nin an intangible asset for Telesat�\nCritical accounting estimates and assumptions\nDerivative financial instruments measured at fair value\nDerivative financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value� When quoted market values are unavailable\nfor our financial instruments, and in the absence of an active market, we determine fair value for financial instruments\nbased on prevailing market rates (bid and ask prices, as appropriate) for instruments with similar characteristics and\nrisk profiles or we make use of internal or external valuation models, such as option pricing models and discounted\ncash flow analysis, using observable market-based inputs� The determination of fair value is significantly impacted\nby the assumptions used for the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and discount rates� As a result, the\nfair value of financial assets and liabilities, and the amount of gains or losses on changes in fair value recorded to net\nincome could vary� The discount rates used to discount cash flows as at December 31, 2023 ranged from 4�06% to\n5�59% while as at December 31, 2022 the discount rates ranged from 4�00% to 5�16%�\n110\nImpairment of goodwill\nGoodwill represented $2,446�6 million of our total assets as at December 31, 2023� Determining whether goodwill\nis impaired using a quantitative approach requires an estimation of our fair value, which requires us to estimate the\nfuture cash flows expected to arise from operations and to make assumptions regarding the underlying business plan,\ndiscount rates, and growth rate assumptions� Actual operating results and our related cash flows could differ from the\nestimates used for the impairment analysis� The discount rate utilized on the goodwill impairment assessment ranged\nfrom 9�5% to the midpoint between 15% and 20% in 2023 (2022 – 9�0% to the midpoint between 15% and 20%)�\nImpairment of intangible assets\nIntangible assets represented a significant portion of our total assets as at December 31, 2023� We test intangible\nassets for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment or reversal of a prior impairment\nloss exist� The quantitative impairment analysis requires us to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from\noperations, and to make assumptions regarding the underlying business plan, discount rates, growth rate assumptions\nand royalty rate� Significant judgments are made in establishing these assumptions� Actual operating results and\nour related cash flows could differ from the estimates used for the impairment analysis� The discount rate utilized\non the intangible assets impairment assessment ranged from 9�5% to the midpoint between 15% and 20% in 2023\n(2022 – 9�0% to the midpoint between 15% and 20%)�\nIndefinite life intangible assets are tested for impairment at the individual CGU level� In the case of orbital slots,\nthe CGU is based on geography� During the year ended December 31, 2023, as a result of impairment testing of the\ngeographical CGUs, there was an impairment of $66�0 million recorded against intangible assets and $13�8 million\nrecorded against satellites, property and other equipment� For additional details of the impairment that was recorded,\nrefer to Notes 16 and 17 of the 2023 consolidated financial statements�\nEmployee benefits\nThe cost of defined benefit pension plans, other post-employment benefits, and the present value of the pension\nobligation are determined using actuarial valuations� An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions\nwhich may differ from actual developments in the future� These include the determination of the discount rate, future\nsalary increases, mortality rates, future pension increases and return on plan assets� Due to the complexity of the\nvaluation, the underlying assumptions, and its long-term nature, the defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive\nto changes in these assumptions� All assumptions are reviewed annually� See Note 32 of our audited consolidated\nfinancial statements for a sensitivity analysis of the assumptions used in the actuarial valuation�\nShare-based compensation\nThe expense for stock options is based on the fair value of the awards granted using the Black-Scholes option\npricing model� The Black-Scholes option pricing model includes estimates of the dividend yield, expected volatility,\nrisk-free interest rate and the expected life in years� Any changes in these estimates may have a significant impact on\nthe amounts reported�\nDetermination of useful life of satellites and finite life intangible assets\nThe estimated useful life and depreciation method for satellites and finite life intangible assets are reviewed\nannually, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis� Any change in these\nestimates may have a significant impact on the amounts reported� There were no changes in the estimated useful lives\nof satellites and intangible assets during 2023�\nIncome taxes\nWe assess the recoverability of deferred tax assets based upon an estimation of our projected taxable income\nusing enacted or substantially enacted tax laws, and our ability to utilize future tax deductions before they expire�\nActual results could differ from expectations�\n111\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nChange in Accounting Policy\nAmendments to IAS 12\nIn May 2021, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 12�\nIn specified circumstances, companies are exempt from recognizing deferred tax when they recognize assets or\nliabilities for the first time� The amendments clarify that such initial recognition exemption does not apply to transactions\nin which equal amounts of deductible and taxable temporary differences arise on initial recognition� Accordingly,\nentities are required to recognize deferred tax associated with transactions, such as leases and decommissioning\nobligations, which give rise to equal and offsetting temporary differences�\nWe adopted the amendments effective for annual period beginning January 1, 2023� As a result of the amendment,\nwe were required to recognize deferred tax on the prepayment options associated with the Senior Unsecured Notes,\nSenior Secured Notes and 2026 Senior Secured Notes�\nAn adjustment was recorded as a decrease to the opening balance of accumulated earnings as at January 1, 2021\nin the amount of $1,412�\nThe cumulative impact on the balance sheet and the statement of changes in shareholders’ equity was as follows:\nAs at December 31, 2022 2021\nDeferred tax liabilities � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �

� � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � $ 3,379 $ 4,491\nAs a result of the amendment, there was also a change in the reallocation related to Transaction in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021�\nThe impact on the statements of income (loss) and the statements of comprehensive income (loss) was as follows:\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 2021\nTax (expense) recovery � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � $ (1,480) $ 7,342\nNet income (loss) per common share attributable to Telesat Corporation\nshareholders – Basic � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � $ (0�03) $ 0�16\nNet income (loss) per common share attributable to Telesat

issues new and amended accounting standards� The new and amended standards\ndetermined to be applicable to us are disclosed below� The remaining new and amended standards have been excluded\nas they are not applicable�\nAmendments to IAS 1\nIn October 2022, the IASB amended IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements with the aim of improving the\ninformation companies provide about long-term debt covenants�\nThe amendments specify that covenants to be complied with after the reporting date do not affect the\nclassification of debt as current or non-current at the reporting date� Only covenants with which an entity is required\nto comply on or before the reporting date affect the classification of a liability as current or non-current� The\namendment requires a company to disclose information that enables users of financial statements to understand\nthe risk that the liabilities could become repayable within twelve months after the reporting period� Such disclosure\nincludes information about covenants and facts and circumstances, if any, that indicate the entity may have difficulty\ncomplying with the covenants�\n112\nThe amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024 with early\nadoption permitted�\nThe amendments will not have any impact on the financial statements�\nITEM 6.

The solicitation is being made primarily by sending certain proxy-related\nmaterials to Shareholders by mail, and with respect to the delivery of the Notice of Meeting and this\nInformation Circular, by posting the Notice of Meeting and this Information Circular on the Company’s\nprofile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.com and by making such materials electronically available at a\nwebsite hosted by Computershare, as provided in the package received by Shareholders, pursuant to the\nnotice-and-access mechanism. Shareholder proxies may also be solicited personally or by telephone,\nfacsimile, oral communication or in person by officers or directors of the Company, at a nominal cost. In\naccordance with National Instrument 54-101 – Communication with Beneficial Owners of Securities of a\nReporting Issuer (“NI 54-101”), arrangements have been made with brokerage houses and other\nintermediaries, clearing agencies, custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to forward solicitation materials to\nthe non-registered (beneficial) owners of Telesat Corporation Shares (“Non-Registered Holders”) held of\nrecord by such persons and the Company may reimburse such persons for reasonable fees and\ndisbursements incurred by them in doing so.\n1\nRegistered Shareholders and Holders of Exchangeable Units\nA Shareholder is a registered Shareholder (a “Registered Holder”) if shown on April 25, 2024 (the\n“Record Date”) on the list of Shareholders kept by Computershare, as registrar and transfer agent of the\nCompany. Registered Holders will receive a form of proxy from Computershare representing the Telesat\nCorporation Shares held by the Registered Holder.\nRegistered Holders may attend, ask questions and vote at the virtual only Meeting via live audio webcast\nonline at https://meetnow.global/MZCGDNP. See “Attending and Voting at the Virtual Meeting” below.\nRegistered holders of Exchangeable Units of the Partnership shown on the Record Date on the list of holders\nof Exchangeable Units kept by Computershare will receive a voting instruction form representing an equal\nnumber of votes such holder of Exchangeable Units would have if such Exchangeable Units were\nexchanged and converted into the corresponding class of Telesat Corporation Share. Holders of\nExchangeable Units are indirectly entitled to vote in respect of matters on which holders of Telesat\nCorporation Shares are entitled to vote, including in respect of the election of directors of Telesat, through\nthe Special Voting Shares.\nThe Special Voting Shares are held by the TSX Trust Company (in its capacity as “Trustee” of the Voting\nTrust), entitling the Trustee to that number of votes on applicable matters on which holders of Telesat\nCorporation Shares are entitled to vote that is equal to the number of Telesat Corporation Shares into which\nthe Exchangeable Units held by the holders of such Exchangeable Units on the applicable record date are\nconvertible. Pursuant to the amended and restated Telesat Partnership LP limited partnership agreement\n(the “Partnership Agreement”), each holder of Exchangeable Units has the right to direct Telesat\nCorporation as to how to instruct the Trustee to vote the voting power of the Special Voting Shares\ncorresponding to such holder’s Exchangeable Units. Telesat, the Partnership and the Trustee have entered\ninto the Trust Voting Agreement (a copy of which has been filed under the Company’s profile on SEDAR+\nat www.sedarplus.com and on EDGAR at www.sec.gov). Pursuant to the Trust Voting Agreement, the\nTrustee is required to cast such votes in accordance with voting instructions provided to it by Telesat\nCorporation, in its capacity as general partner of the Partnership. For further information, see “Description\nof Share Capital and Voting Structure.”\nAdvice to Non-Registered Shareholders\nIn many cases, Telesat Corporation Shares beneficially owned by a Non-Registered Holder are registered\neither:\n1. in the name of an intermediary (an “Intermediary”) that the Non-Registered Holder deals with in\nrespect of the Telesat Corporation Shares. Intermediaries include banks, trust companies, securities\ndealers or brokers and trustees or administrators of self-administered registered retirement savings\nplans, registered education savings plans, registered disability savings plans, tax-free savings\naccounts (as such terms are used in the Tax Act and the regulations thereunder, as amended from\ntime to time) and similar plans; or\n2. in the name of a depository or clearing agency (such as CDS & Co.) of which the Intermediary is\na participant.\nNon-Registered Holders do not appear on the list of Shareholders of the Company maintained by\nComputershare.\n2\nIn accordance with Canadian securities laws, the Company has distributed copies of the notice-and-access\nnotice and voting instruction form directly to non-objecting Non-Registered Holders and to Intermediaries\nfor onward distribution to Non-Registered Holders that are objecting beneficial owners. Non-Registered\nHolders who have previously provided standing instructions will receive a printed copy of the Meeting\nMaterials.\nIntermediaries are required to forward Meeting Materials to Non-Registered Holders unless a\nNon-Registered Holder has waived the right to receive them. Typically, Intermediaries will use a service\ncompany to forward the Meeting Materials to Non-Registered Holders. Non-Registered Holders, other than\nnon-objecting beneficial owners, will receive either a voting instruction form or, less frequently, a form of\nproxy. The purpose of these forms is to permit Non-Registered Holders to direct the voting of the Telesat\nCorporation Shares they beneficially own. Non-Registered Holders who have not waived the right to\nreceive Meeting Materials should follow the procedures set out below, depending on which type of form\nthey receive:\n1. Voting Instruction Form. In most cases, a Non-Registered Holder will receive, as part of the\nMeeting Materials, a voting instruction form. If the Non-Registered Holder does not wish to attend\nand vote at the Meeting (or have another person attend and vote on the holder’s behalf), the voting\ninstruction form must be completed, signed and returned in accordance with the directions on the\nform. If a Non-Registered Holder wishes to attend and vote at the Meeting (or have another person\nattend and vote on the holder’s behalf), the Non-Registered Holder must complete, sign and return\nthe voting instruction form in accordance with the directions provided and a form of proxy giving\nthe right to attend and vote will be forwarded to the Non-Registered Holder; or\n2. Form of Proxy. Less frequently, a Non-Registered Holder will receive, as part of the Meeting\nMaterials, a form of proxy that has already been signed by the Intermediary (typically by a\nfacsimile, stamped signature) which is restricted as to the number of Telesat Corporation Shares\nbeneficially owned by the Non-Registered Holder but which is otherwise uncompleted. If the Non-\nRegistered Holder does not wish to attend and vote at the Meeting (or have another person attend\nand vote on the holder’s behalf), the Non-Registered Holder must complete the form of proxy and\ndeposit it with Computershare, either in person, by mail or courier, to 100 University Avenue, 8th\nFloor, Toronto, Ontario, M5J 2Y1, or via the internet at www.investorvote.com. If a\nNon-Registered Holder wishes to attend and vote at the Meeting (or have another person attend and\nvote on the holder’s behalf), the Non-Registered Holder must insert the Non-Registered Holder’s\n(or such other person’s) name in the blank space provided, and register the Non-Registered Holder\n(or such other person) for the online Meeting by contacting Computershare. See “Appointment of\nProxies” below.\nIn either case, the purpose of these procedures is to permit Non-Registered Holders to direct the voting of\nthe Telesat Corporation Shares which they beneficially own. Non-Registered Holders should carefully\nfollow the instructions on the form of proxy or voting instruction form that they receive from their\nIntermediary in order to vote the Telesat Corporation Shares that are held through that Intermediary. In\naddition, Non-Registered Holders are reminded that registering a Non-Registered Holder or third-party\nproxyholder online, as applicable, is an additional step to be completed after submitting the proxy\nauthorization form if such persons are to receive an invite code (“Invite Code”) and vote at the Meeting.\nSee “Attending and Voting at the Virtual Meeting” below.\n3\nNon-Objecting Beneficial Owners\nThe notice-and-access notice and voting instruction form are being sent to both Registered Holders and\nNon-Registered Holders. If you are a Non-Registered Holder, and the Company or its agent has sent these\nmaterials directly to you, your name and address and information about your holdings of securities have\nbeen obtained in accordance with applicable securities regulatory requirements from the Intermediary\nholding on your behalf. By choosing to send these materials to you directly, the Company (and not the\nIntermediary holding on your behalf) has assumed responsibility for: (i) delivering these materials to you,\nand (ii) executing your proper voting instructions. Please return your voting instructions as specified in the\nrequest for voting instructions or form of proxy delivered to you.\nAppointment of Proxies – Holders of Telesat Corporation Shares\nThe persons named in the accompanying form of proxy, Daniel S. Goldberg, or failing him, Christopher\nDiFrancesco (the “Management Nominees”), have been selected by the Board, and have indicated their\nwillingness, to represent Shareholders who appoint them as their proxy for the Meeting.\nThe Management Nominees named in the accompanying form of proxy are directors or officers of\nthe Company. A Shareholder has the right to designate a person (who need not be a Shareholder)\nother than the Management Nominees to represent him, her or it at the Meeting. Such right may be\nexercised by striking out the names of the specified persons and inserting in the space provided for\nthat purpose on the enclosed form of proxy the name of the person to be designated or by completing\nanother proper form of proxy. Such Shareholder should notify the nominee of the appointment,\nobtain his or her consent to act as proxy and should provide instructions on how the Telesat\nCorporation Shares held by the Shareholder are to be voted. In any case, a form of proxy should be\ndated and executed by the Shareholder or an attorney authorized in writing, with proof of such\nauthorization attached where an attorney has executed the form of proxy.\nShareholders who wish to appoint someone other than the Management Nominees to attend the Meeting as\ntheir proxy and vote their Telesat Corporation Shares MUST submit their form of proxy or voting\ninstruction form, as applicable, appointing that person as proxyholder, AND register that proxyholder, as\ndescribed below. Registering the proxyholder is an additional step that must be completed AFTER the form\nof proxy or voting instruction form has been submitted. Failure to register the proxyholder will result in the\nproxyholder not receiving an Invite Code, which is used as their online sign-in credentials and is required\nfor them to vote at the Meeting.\n(cid:120) Step 1 – Submit form of proxy or voting instruction form. Registered Holders unable\nto attend the Meeting are requested to complete, sign and date the accompanying form of\nproxy, and to return it, together with the power of attorney or other authority, if any, under\nwhich it was signed or a notarially certified copy thereof, to the Company’s transfer agent,\nComputershare, either in person, by mail or courier, to 100 University Avenue, 8th Floor,\nToronto, Ontario, M5J 2Y1, or via the internet at www.investorvote.com. This must be\ncompleted before registering the proxyholder to attend the Meeting online, which is an\nadditional step completed once the form of proxy or voting instruction form is submitted.\nNon-Registered Holders who receive the proxy through an Intermediary must deliver the\nproxy in accordance with the instructions given by such Intermediary.\nTo be effective, proxies must be received by Computershare not later than 2:00 p.m.\n(Ottawa time) on June 14, 2024 or 48 hours (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays)\nprior to any adjournment or postponement of the Meeting. Late proxies may be accepted\n4\nor rejected by the chair of the Meeting in his or her discretion, and the chair is under no\nobligation to accept or reject any particular late proxy.\n(cid:120) Step 2 - Register your proxyholder: To register a third party proxyholder, Shareholders\nmust visit http://www.computershare.com/telesat by 2:00 p.m. (Ottawa time) on June 14,\n2024, or 48 hours (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) prior to any adjournment\nor postponement of the Meeting, and provide Computershare with the required proxyholder\ncontact information so that Computershare may provide the proxyholder with an Invite\nCode by email. Without an Invite Code, proxyholders will not be able to vote or ask\nquestions at the Meeting. They will only be able to attend the Meeting online as a guest.\nRevocation of Proxies\nA Shareholder who has given a form of proxy may revoke it as to any matter on which a vote has not\nalready been held pursuant to its authority by an instrument in writing executed by the Shareholder or by\nthe Shareholder’s attorney duly authorized in writing or, if the Shareholder is a corporation, by an officer\nor attorney thereof duly authorized and deposited at either the above mentioned office of Computershare\nby not later than 2:00 p.m.(Ottawa time) on June 14, 2024 or 48 hours (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and\nholidays) prior to any adjournment or postponement of the Meeting. Late proxies may be accepted or\nrejected by the chair of the Meeting in his or her discretion, and the chair is under no obligation to accept\nor reject any particular late proxy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Registered Holder attends personally\nat the Meeting, such Registered Holder may revoke the proxy and vote at the Meeting.\nOnly Registered Holders have the right to revoke a proxy. Non-Registered Holders who wish to change\ntheir vote must arrange for their respective Intermediary to revoke the proxy on their behalf.\nA Shareholder who logs in to the Meeting online using their Control Number (as defined below) and accepts\nthe terms and conditions will be revoking any and all previously submitted proxies, and will be provided\nthe opportunity to vote online by ballot. See “Attending and Voting at the Virtual Meeting” below.\nVoting of Proxies\nThe persons named in the accompanying form of proxy will vote the Telesat Corporation Shares in respect\nof which they are appointed in accordance with the direction of the Shareholder appointing them. In the\nabsence of such direction, the Telesat Corporation Shares represented by such Shareholder’s proxy\nor voting instruction form will be voted by the persons named in the enclosed form of proxy: (i) IN\nFAVOUR of the election of the nominees for the Telesat Corporation Board named herein (the\n“Director Nominees”) as members of the Board; (ii) IN FAVOUR of the re-appointment of Deloitte\nLLP Chartered Professional Accountants as auditors of the Company and for the Board to fix such\nauditors’ remuneration; and (iii) IN FAVOUR of the amendment to the Company’s long-term equity\nincentive plan to increase the number of Telesat Public Shares available for issuance under the plan.\nExercise of Discretion of Proxy\nThe accompanying form of proxy confers discretionary authority upon the persons named therein, including\nthe Management Nominees, with respect to any amendments or variations to matters identified in the Notice\nof Meeting and this Information Circular and with respect to matters that may properly come before the\nMeeting. As of the date of this Information Circular, management of the Company does not know of any\namendments, variations or other matters to come before the Meeting other than the matters referred to in\nthe Notice of Meeting and this Information Circular. With respect to amendments to matters identified in\nthe Notice of Meeting or other matters that may properly come before the Meeting or any adjournment or\n5\npostponement thereof, Telesat Corporation Shares represented by properly executed proxies will be voted\nby the persons so designated in their discretion.\nNo Other Business\nThe Company knows of no matter to come before the Meeting other than those set forth above and in the\nNotice of Meeting. However, if any other matters do arise, the Management Nominees named in the proxy\nintend to vote on any poll, in accordance with their best judgment, exercising discretionary authority with\nrespect to amendments or variations of matters set out in the Notice of Meeting and other matters which\nmay properly come before the Meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the Meeting.\nAppointment of Proxies – Holders of Exchangeable Units\nShould a holder of Exchangeable Units want to exercise personally the votes attributable to such\nExchangeable Units (the “Beneficiary Votes”), such holder must provide instructions to Telesat\nCorporation, as general partner of the Partnership, by no later than 5:00 pm on June 11, 2024 and Telesat\nCorporation will instruct the Trustee to sign and deliver to such holder (or its designee) a proxy to the holder\n(or its designee) permitting the holder or such designee to attend the Meeting and exercise personally, as\nproxy of the Trustee, the Beneficiary Votes.\nATTENDING AND VOTING AT THE VIRTUAL MEETING\nThe Meeting will be held in a virtual only format, which will be conducted via live audio webcast.\nRegistered Holders and duly appointed proxyholders will have an opportunity to attend, ask questions and\nvote at the Meeting online.

Non-Registered Holders who wish to\nvote at the Meeting must (i) appoint themselves as proxyholder by inserting their name in the space provided\nfor appointing a proxyholder on the voting instruction form and (ii) follow all of the applicable instructions,\nincluding the deadline, provided by their Intermediary.

Directors are\nexpected to prepare for and actively participate in Board and committee meetings.\nCorporate Cease Trade Orders or Bankruptcies\nTo the knowledge of the Company, and based on the information furnished to the Company by the directors\nand executive officers, none of Company’s directors is, as at the date of this Information Circular, or has\nbeen within the ten years prior to the date of this Information Circular: (a) a director, chief executive officer\nor chief financial officer of any company (including Telesat Corporation and its other subsidiaries) that was\nsubject to an order that was issued while the director or executive officer was acting in the capacity as\ndirector, chief executive officer or chief financial officer; (b) was subject to an order that was issued after\nthe director or executive officer ceased to be a director, chief executive officer or chief financial officer and\nwhich resulted from an event that occurred while that person was acting in the capacity as director, chief\nexecutive officer or chief financial officer; or (c) a director or executive officer of any company (including\nTelesat Corporation and its other subsidiaries) that, while that person was acting in that capacity, or within\na year of that person ceasing to act in that capacity, became bankrupt, made a proposal under any legislation\nrelating to bankruptcy or insolvency or was subject to or instituted any proceedings, arrangement or\ncompromise with creditors or had a receiver, receiver manager or trustee appointed to hold its assets. For\nthe purposes of the above paragraph, “order” means a cease trade order, an order similar to a cease trade\norder or an order that denied the relevant company access to any exemption under securities legislation, in\neach case, that was in effect for a period of more than 30 consecutive days.\nPenalties or Sanctions\nTo the knowledge of the Company, and based on the information furnished to the Company by the directors\nand executive officers, other than as set out below, none of Company’s directors is, as at the date of this\nInformation Circular, or has, within the ten years prior to the date of this Information Circular, been subject\nto any penalties or sanctions imposed by a court relating to securities legislation or by a securities regulatory\nauthority or has entered into a settlement agreement with a securities regulatory authority or been subject\nto any other penalties or sanctions imposed by a court or regulatory body that would likely be considered\nimportant to a reasonable investor making an investment decision.\nFor the purposes of this section, a self-regulatory authority means a professional self-regulatory body that\ngoverns the activities of professional persons.\nPersonal Bankruptcies\nTo the knowledge of the Company, and based on the information furnished to the Company by the directors\nand executive officers, other than as set out below, none of Company’s directors is, as at the date of this\nInformation Circular, or has, within the ten years prior to the date of this Information Circular, become\nbankrupt, made a proposal under any legislation relating to bankruptcy or insolvency, or become subject to\nor instituted any proceedings, arrangement or compromise with creditors, or had a receiver, receiver\nmanager or trustee appointed to hold his or her assets.\nConflicts of Interest\nCertain of our directors and officers are associated with other companies or entities, which may give rise to\nconflicts of interest.

To the extent that conflicts of interest arise, such conflicts will be resolved\nin accordance with the provisions of the BCBCA and applicable internal corporate governance or polices\nof the Telesat Corporation Board, as applicable.\n3. Appointment of Auditors\nTelesat’s current auditors are Deloitte LLP Chartered Professional Accountants (“Deloitte”). Deloitte has\nbeen the auditors of the Company since its formation on October 26, 2020, and Telesat Canada since 1993.\nInformation about the fees paid to Deloitte for the financial years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 can\nbe found in the Annual Information Form on Form 20-F under item 16.C “Principal Accountant Fees and\nServices”, which is available at the Company’s profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.com and on EDGAR\nat www.sec.gov.\nThe Management Nominees intend to vote at the Meeting IN FAVOUR of this resolution, unless the\nShareholder has specified in the form of proxy that such Shareholder’s Telesat Corporation Shares\nare to be withheld from voting on the resolution.\n4. Proposed Amendment to the Omnibus Plan\nThe Omnibus Plan was adopted in 2021 in connection with Telesat becoming a public company and\nincludes a fixed maximum number of Telesat Public Shares that may be issued under the Omnibus Plan.\nThe maximum number of Telesat Public Shares reserved for issuance under our Omnibus Plan is currently\n2,972,816 Telesat Public Shares, which represents 5.9% of the aggregate number of issued and outstanding\nTelesat Corporation Shares, on a diluted basis assuming the exchange of all Exchangeable Units into Telesat\nCorporation Shares (not including any awards outstanding under the Historic Plans).\nThe purpose of the Omnibus Plan is to advance the interests of the Company by: (i) providing eligible\npersons with additional incentive; (ii) encouraging stock ownership by such eligible persons; (iii) increasing\nthe proprietary interest of eligible persons in the success of the Company; (iv) promoting growth and\nprofitability of the Company; (v) encouraging eligible persons to take into account long-term corporate\nperformance; (vi) rewarding eligible persons for sustained contributions to the Company and/or significant\nperformance achievements of the Company; and (vii) enhancing the Company’s ability to attract, retain and\nmotivate eligible persons.\nAs of the date of this Information Circular, 220,333 Telesat Public Shares have been issued upon the\nexercise of equity based awards under the Omnibus Plan, resulting in 2,752,483 Telesat Public Shares being\navailable for issuance, which represents 5.5% of the aggregate number of issued and outstanding Telesat\nCorporation Shares, on a diluted basis assuming the exchange of all Exchangeable Units into Telesat\nCorporation Shares (not including any awards outstanding under the Historic Plans). Of this reserve,\n2,646,224 Telesat Public Shares are issuable pursuant to outstanding equity based awards under the\nOmnibus Plan, leaving a reserve of 106,259 Telesat Public Shares available for issuance pursuant to future\nequity based awards under the Omnibus Plan. The remaining reserve represents 0.2% of the aggregate\nnumber of issued and outstanding Telesat Corporation Shares, calculated on the same basis as set forth\nearlier in this paragraph.\nThe Company proposes to increase the number of Telesat Public Shares available for issuance under the\nOmnibus Plan by 2,044,585 Telesat Public Shares. Following such amendment, the maximum number of\nTelesat Public Shares reserved for issuance under the Omnibus Incentive Plan would be equal to 5,017,401\n22\nTelesat Public Shares, which represents 10% of the aggregate number of issued and outstanding Telesat\nCorporation Shares, on a diluted basis assuming the exchange of all Exchangeable Units into Telesat\nCorporation Shares (not including any awards outstanding under the Historic Plans).\nThe Company believes that the proposed increase of the reserve under the Omnibus Plan is reasonable and\nappropriate in the circumstances, particularly in lieu of the reasoned dilution that will result from the\nincrease and the historical annual share utilization (burn rate) under the Omnibus Plan. See “Executive\nCompensation — Burn Rate”.\nShareholder approval is required to amend the Omnibus Plan to increase the maximum number of shares\nissuable thereunder. If the proposed amendment is not approved at the Meeting, the Omnibus Plan would\nhave only a limited number of Telesat Public Shares remaining available for issuance in connection with\nfuture awards. Once this remaining reserve is used, the Company would no longer be permitted to grant\nawards under the Omnibus Plan, other than awards which would not result in any new issuance of Telesat\nPublic Shares. This would limit the Company’s ability to continue its current practice of granting equity\nbased awards to eligible persons as a critical component of their at-risk compensation. This would, in turn,\nrequire the Company to provide an alternate form of long-term incentive compensation.\nThe Board has approved an amendment to the Omnibus Plan to increase the fixed number of Telesat Public\nShares reserved for issuance under the Omnibus Plan, subject to receiving the approval of the TSX and\nshareholder approval at the Meeting. A copy of the amended and restated Omnibus Plan in the form\napproved by the Board is attached to this Information Circular as Appendix “D”. The amendment has been\nconditionally approved by the TSX and, to be effective, must be approved by a majority of votes cast by\nshareholders at the Meeting. Accordingly, at the Meeting, the Company’s shareholders will be asked to\nconsider and, if thought fit, pass with or without amendment, the following resolution:\n“BE IT RESOLVED, as an ordinary resolution of the holders of Class A Common Shares, Class B\nVariable Voting Shares, Class C Fully Voting Shares, the Class A Special Voting Share, the Class B Special\nVoting Share, the Class C Special Voting Share, and the Golden Share of Telesat Corporation (the\n“Company”):\n(a) as approved by the board of directors of the Company, the amendment to the long-term\nequity incentive plan adopted by Telesat Corporation (the “Omnibus Plan”) to increase\nthe aggregate number of Class A Common Shares and Class B Variable Voting Shares\nissuable under the Omnibus Plan from 2,972,816 to 5,017,401 be and is hereby approved\nand authorized in accordance with the Omnibus Plan and the rules of the Toronto Stock\nExchange; and\n(b) any director or officer of the Company be and is hereby authorized and directed for and on\nbehalf and in the name of the Company to execute, deliver and file all such further\ndocuments, authorizations and instruments and to take any and all such further action as he\nor she may in his or her sole discretion determine to be necessary or desirable in connection\nwith, or to carry out the provisions of, the foregoing resolution, the execution of such\ndocumentation and the doing of such things to be conclusive evidence of such\ndetermination.”\nThe Management Nominees intend to vote at the Meeting IN FAVOUR of this resolution, unless the\nShareholder has specified in the form of proxy that such Shareholder’s Telesat Corporation Shares\nare to be voted against the resolution.\n23\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nOverview\nWe operate in a dynamic, highly competitive and rapidly evolving global market. To succeed in this\nenvironment and to achieve our business and financial objectives, we need to attract, retain and motivate a\nhighly talented team of executive officers, available on a limited basis internationally. Key talents include\nstrong leadership and management capabilities that are suited to our culture and the evolving nature of our\nindustry, global telecommunications experience, and advanced space and network engineering experience.\nOur executive officers demonstrate a proven ability to successfully lead and manage our growth and\noperational objectives in a dynamic and evolving market. They are also key to inspiring a culture of\noperational excellence which is at the foundation of our success and our ability to foster growth.\nOur executive officer compensation program is designed to achieve the following objectives:\n(cid:120) provide market-competitive compensation opportunities in order to attract and retain\ntalented, high-performing and experienced executive officers, whose knowledge, skills and\nperformance are critical to our success;\n(cid:120) motivate our executive officers to achieve our business and financial objectives;\n(cid:120) align the interests of our executive officers with those of our Shareholders by tying a\nmeaningful portion of compensation directly to the long-term value and growth of our\nbusiness; and\n(cid:120) provide incentives that encourage appropriate levels of risk-taking by our executive\nofficers and provide a strong pay-for-performance relationship.\nBefore we became a publicly traded company, we offered our executive officers cash compensation in the\nform of base salary, an annual bonus and, following a year in which we made distributions to shareholders,\na special bonus in lieu of an adjustment to equity-based compensation for such distributions. We also\noffered our executive officers an equity-based or equity-like compensation which was historically awarded\nin the form of Telesat Options, Telesat Tandem SARs and RSUs under various equity plans. See “— Long\nTerm Incentives — Historic Plans”.\nIn connection with becoming a public company, holders of existing equity incentive awards under the\nHistoric Plans were given the opportunity to exchange those awards for corresponding equity incentive\nawards of Telesat. Going forward, we will not be granting awards to executives or employees under the\nHistoric Plans. Rather, we expect that all equity compensation awards will be made under our Omnibus\nPlan that we adopted in connection with the completion of the Transaction.\nWe believe that equity-based compensation motivates our executive officers to achieve our business and\nfinancial objectives, and also aligns their interests with the long-term interests of our Shareholders. We\nprovide base salary to compensate executive officers for their day-to-day responsibilities, at levels that we\nbelieve are necessary to attract and retain executive officer talent. While we have determined that our\ncurrent executive officer compensation program is effective at attracting and maintaining executive officer\ntalent, we evaluate our compensation practices on an ongoing basis to ensure that we are providing market-\ncompetitive compensation opportunities for our executive team. See “— Principal Elements of\nCompensation.”\n24\nAs a publicly traded company, we evaluate our compensation philosophy and compensation program as\ncircumstances require, which may include the periodic review of our compensation program and the mix\nof components made available to our executive team. As part of this review process, we expect to be guided\nby the philosophy and objectives outlined above, as well as other factors which may become relevant, such\nas the evolution and growth of our business and the cost of replacing or enhancing our talent composition\nas needs may require.\n2023 Named Executive Officers\nThe Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and the Company’s three other\nmost highly compensated executives (together with the CEO and CFO, the “NEOs”), who are the subject\nof this Compensation Discussion and Analysis, are set forth in the following table:\nNamed Executive Officer Position\nDaniel S. Goldberg President and Chief Executive Officer\nAndrew Browne Chief Financial Officer\nMichael Schwartz Senior Vice President, Corporate & Business Development\nDavid Wendling Chief Technical Officer\nGlenn Katz Chief Commercial Officer\nCompensation Philosophy, Policies and Practices\nOur compensation philosophy is to pay fair, reasonable and competitive compensation with a significant\nequity-based component to align the interests of our executive officers with those of our Shareholders. Our\ncompensation policies and practices are designed to retain, motivate and reward our executive officers for\ntheir performance and contribution to our short- and long-term success. We compensate executive officers\nby combining short-term cash and long-term equity and cash incentives. We also seek to reward the\nachievement of corporate and individual performance objectives, and to align executive officers’ incentives\nwith our performance. The Company has adopted the following pay practices that reflect the Company’s\ncompensation philosophy:\nWhat We Do What We Don’t Do\n(cid:120) Link executive pay to Company performance (cid:120) Allow executives or directors to hedge or pledge\nthrough short-and long-term incentive plans equity holdings\n(cid:120) Balance among short- and long-term incentives, (cid:120) Reprice underwater stock options\ncash and equity, and fixed and variable pay\n(cid:120) Compare executive compensation and company (cid:120) Maintain pay policies or practices that pose material\nperformance to relevant peer group companies adverse risk to the Company\n(cid:120) Retain an independent compensation consultant (cid:120) Provide excessive perquisites\n25\nCompensation Governance\nThe Human Resources & Compensation Committee is responsible for assisting the Board in fulfilling its\ngovernance and supervisory responsibilities, and overseeing our human resources, succession planning, and\ncompensation policies, processes and practices.\nThe Human Resources & Compensation Committee is also responsible for ensuring that our compensation\npolicies and practices provide an appropriate balance of risk and reward consistent with Telesat\nCorporation’s risk profile. The Human Resources & Compensation Committee’s oversight includes\nreviewing objectives, evaluating performance and ensuring that total compensation paid to our executive\nofficers, personnel who report directly to the CEO and various other key executive officers and managers\nis fair, reasonable and consistent with the objectives of our philosophy and compensation program.\nThe Human Resources & Compensation Committee is comprised of three independent directors, Jane\nCraighead (Chair), Guthrie Stewart and Mark Rachesky.\nPlease see “Committees of our Board of Directors — Human Resources & Compensation Committee”\nbelow.\nThe charter for the Human Resources & Compensation Committee sets out its responsibilities for\nadministering our compensation programs and reviewing and making recommendations to the Board\nconcerning the level and nature of the compensation payable to our directors and officers. The Human\nResources & Compensation Committee is responsible for reviewing our compensation program to ensure\nit continues to meet its objectives and remain aligned with industry best practices, and make\nrecommendations for any changes to our board of directors, as appropriate. As part of this review, the\nHuman Resources & Compensation Committee engages independent compensation consultants to evaluate\nour executive compensation program against market practice.\nWe originally retained Pay Governance in 2020 to assist us in connection with executive officer and director\ncompensation matters, including, among other things, the following:\n(cid:120) assist in reviewing the competitiveness of our current cash and equity-based compensation\nprogram for our executive officers; and\n(cid:120) assist in designing a new incentive awards framework for our executive officers.\nIn 2021, the Human Resources & Compensation Committee first retained Mercer as its independent\ncompensation consultant to assist the committee in benchmarking executive pay and designing short- and\nlong-term incentive plans for 2022.\nIn 2023, Mercer advised the Human Resources & Compensation Committee on all aspects of executive\ncompensation including base salaries, short term incentives, and the design of the long-term incentive\nawards. Mercer conducted a market compensation review to validate and/or establish compensation values\nfor the NEOs and other senior executives. Mercer considered compensation at similarly-sized Canadian\nand US peers in the Aerospace & Defence, Telecommunications and High Tech/Software industries,\nconsidering Telesat’s size based on revenues, EBITDA, assets and market capitalization. Mercer also\nassisted the Committee and the Company on compensation structures and benchmarking for the Company’s\nnon-executive employees.\nThe compensation peer group used by Mercer and approved the Human Resources & Compensation\nCommittee and used for making informed compensation adjustments to our NEOs for Fiscal 2023 consisted\nof the following organizations:\n26\nCae Inc. Ducommun Incorporated\nViasat, Inc. Iridium Communications Inc.\nHexcel Corporation Comtech Telecommunications Corp.\nMercury Systems, Inc. Redwire Corporation\nConverge Technology Solutions Corp. Magellan Aerospace Corporation\nKratos Defense & Security & Solutions Inc. Globalstar, Inc.\nAxon Enterprise, Inc. Héroux-Devtek Inc.\nEchoStar Corporation Calian Group Ltd.\nKaman Corporation Enghouse Systems Limited\nKinaxis Inc. MDA Ltd.\nExecutive Compensation-Related Fees\nThe total fees incurred in consideration of the executive compensation-related services provided in 2022 by\nPay Governance was $975 and by Mercer was $288,490.\nThe total fees incurred in consideration of the services provided in 2023 by Pay Governance was $0 and by\nMercer was $242,096.\nNo other fees were paid to Pay Governance and Mercer for fiscal years 2023 and 2022.\nPrincipal Elements of Compensation\nThe compensation of our executive officers includes three major elements: (i) base salary; (ii) short-term\nincentives, consisting of an annual cash incentive award; (iii) long-term equity and cash incentive awards.\nIn 2023, NEO long-term incentives consisted of Telesat Corporation Options, Telesat Corporation PSUs,\nTelesat Corporation RSUs under our Omnibus Plan, see “Omnibus Long–term Incentive Plan” below and\na long-term incentive cash award.\n27\nNEOs also participate in our defined benefit pension plan and supplemental executive retirement plan, and\nreceive certain perquisites and personal benefits that are provided to each of our NEOs under their\nrespective employment agreements, see “Employment Agreements” below.\nPay Element Objectives Features\nBase Salary Provide a fixed level of cash Based on individual’s role, duties,\ncompensation for performing responsibilities, experience, performance and\nday-to-day responsibilities delivery of results\nAnnual Cash Incentive Reward short-term financial, Cash payments based on meeting Adjusted\nAwards operational and individual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and\nperformance amortization (EBITDA) performance goals\nLong-Term Incentive Align management interests with 2023: Telesat Corporation RSUs, Telesat\nCompensation those of Shareholders, encourage Corporation Stock Options and Telesat\nretention and reward long-term Corporation PSUs, were granted under our\nCompany performance Omnibus Plan along with a long-term incentive\ncash component, payable conditonal upon the\nvesting of the RSU and PSU awards\nBase Salaries\nBase salary is provided as a fixed source of compensation for our executive officers. Base salaries are\ndetermined on an individual basis taking into account the scope of the executive officer’s responsibilities\nand their prior experience. Base salaries are set out in each NEO’s employment agreement, see\n“Employment Agreements” below. Adjustments to base salaries are determined annually by the Board on\nthe recommendation of the Human Resources & Compensation Committee and may be increased based on\nthe executive officer’s performance, as well as to maintain market competitiveness. Additionally, base\nsalaries can be adjusted as warranted throughout the year to reflect promotions or other changes in the scope\nor breadth of an executive officer’s role or responsibilities.\n28\nThe following table sets forth each NEO’s annual base salary rates for Fiscal 2023:\nNamed Executive Officer 2023 Annual Base Salary Rate\nDaniel S. Goldberg $1,427,856\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nAndrew Browne $752,081\nChief Financial Officer\nMichael Schwartz(1) $726,445\nSenior Vice President, Corporate & Business Development\nDavid Wendling $430,560\nChief Technical Officer\nGlenn Katz $694,404\nChief Commercial Officer\nNote:\n(1) Mr. Schwartz was paid in U.S. dollars and these amounts were converted to Canadian dollars based on an average\nexchange rate for 2023 of CAD 1.3493 to $USD1.0. All other NEO’s were paid in Canadian dollars.\nAnnual Incentive Awards\nAnnual incentive awards are designed to motivate our executive officers to meet our business and financial\nobjectives generally and our annual financial performance targets in particular. In 2023, annual incentive\nawards were earned and measured with reference to Adjusted EBITDA1 performance for the fiscal year.\nWhen the annual budget and Adjusted EBITDA targets are established for the upcoming fiscal year, the\nHuman Resources & Compensation Committee establishes performance targets connected to the Adjusted\nEBITDA targets. In assessing performance against the Adjusted EBITDA targets, the Human Resources &\nCompensation Committee has discretion to consider unforeseen events and make additional one-time\nadjustments in the event it determines such adjustments are warranted in the circumstances to ensure NEOs\nare not penalized, or do not receive a windfall, for events outside of their control, including changes in\nforeign exchange rates or other one-time, non-recurring items, certain unbudgeted items or to take into\naccount significant achievements that may be unrelated to Adjusted EBITDA performance.\n1Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure. For more information on the Company’s use of non-IFRS financial measures\nand a reconciliation to the most closely comparable IFRS measure, see “Management’s Discussion & Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations – Non-IFRS Measures” in the Company’s 2022 Annual Information Form on Form 20-F\navailable on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.com.\n29\nThe annual incentive pay-outs can increase or decrease, compared to the target bonus applicable to each\nNEO (either 60% or 100% of base salary, in either case the “Target Bonus,”), depending on the level of\nachievement as determined by the Human Resources & Compensation Committee with respect to the\nAdjusted EBITDA targets for the fiscal year. The key metrics followed by Telesat in 2023 were:\nAdjusted EBITDAPerformance Annual Incentive Award\n<95% of target amount Nil\n95% of target amount 50% of Target Award\n97.5% of target amount 75% of Target Award\n100% of target amount 100% of Target Award\n102.5% of target amount 150% of Target Award\n(cid:149)(cid:20)(cid:19)(cid:24)(cid:8)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:74)(cid:72)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:80)(cid:82)(cid:88)(cid:81)(cid:87) 200% of Target Award\nActual performance: Actual incentive awards\n103.085%of target amount Actual incentive awards equal 161.7%of Target\nFor 2023, award opportunities, pay-out ranges and actual awards as a percentage of each NEO’s base salary\nwere as follows:\n2023 AIP\nTarget Actual\n2023 Salary Target Payout Range\nNamed Executive Officer Award Award\nLevel (% of Base (% of Target)\n($) ($)\nSalary)\nDaniel S.

Actual performance was $529 million.\nIn assessing performance against the 2023 Adjusted EBITDA target, the committee made adjustments for:\nforeign exchange rate changes to reflect the actual fluctuation in exchange rates for the year; non-cash\npension expenses associated with the current contribution holiday the company is experiencing; and to\neliminate expense savings associated with delays in the Telesat Lightspeed program.\nWe currently make annual incentive award payments in cash and anticipate continuing to do so in the future.\nLong-Term Incentives\nType of awards under Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan\nIn connection with becoming a public company, we adopted a new long-term equity incentive plan (the\n“Omnibus Plan”) to allow for a variety of equity based awards that provide different types of incentives\nto be granted to certain of our directors, executive officers, and employees, including options (“Telesat\nCorporation Options”), performance share units (“Telesat Corporation PSUs”), restricted share units\n(“Telesat Corporation RSUs”) and deferred share units (“Telesat Corporation DSUs”). Telesat\nCorporation Options, Telesat Corporation PSUs, Telesat Corporation RSUs and Telesat Corporation DSUs\nare collectively referred to herein as “Awards”. Each Award will represent the right to receive Telesat\nPublic Shares or, in the case of Telesat Corporation PSUs, Telesat Corporation RSUs and Telesat\nCorporation DSUs, Telesat Public Shares or cash, in accordance with the terms of the Omnibus Plan. The\nfollowing discussion is qualified in its entirety by the text of the Omnibus Plan, which is available on\nSEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.com.\nUnder the Omnibus Plan, the Board, or an authorized Board committee, may grant Awards to eligible\nparticipants, as applicable. Participation in the Omnibus Plan is voluntary and, if an eligible participant\nagrees to participate, the grant of Awards will be evidenced by a grant agreement with each such participant.\nAs at December 31, 2023 there were 2,087,743 equity awards issued and outstanding under the Omnibus\nPlan, which represents 15.3% of the aggregate number of Telesat Corporation Shares issued and\noutstanding as at December 31, 2023 (or 4.2%, assuming the exchange of all Exchangeable Units into\nTelesat Corporation Shares). As of the date of this Information Circular, there were 2,646,224 equity awards\nissued and outstanding under the Omnibus Plan, with 106,259 remaining available to be issued.\nTelesat Corporation Options\nA Telesat Corporation Option is exercisable during a period established by the Board which begins on the\ndate of the grant and ends no later than 10 years after the date of the granting of the Telesat Corporation\nOption or such shorter period as the Telesat Corporation Board may determine. The minimum exercise\nprice of a Telesat Corporation Option is determined based on the closing price of the Telesat Public Shares\non the last trading day before the date such option is granted. The Omnibus Plan provides that the exercise\nperiod will automatically be extended if the date on which it is scheduled to terminate falls during a blackout\nperiod. In these cases, the extended exercise period terminates 10 business days after the last day of the\nblack-out period. To facilitate the payment of the exercise price of the options, the Omnibus Plan has a\ncashless exercise feature under which a participant may elect to undertake either a broker assisted “cashless\nexercise” or an “option surrender” as set out in the Omnibus Plan, and including the consent of the Board,\nwhere required. As at December 31, 2023, there were 803,265 Telesat Corporation Options issued and\noutstanding under the Omnibus Plan, which represents 5.9% of the aggregate number of Telesat\nCorporation Shares issued and outstanding as at December 31, 2023 (or 1.6%, assuming the exchange of\nall Exchangeable Units into Telesat Corporation Shares). See “Details of the Omnibus Long-Term Incentive\n31\nPlan” below. As of the date of this Information Circular, there were 803,265 Telesat Corporation Options\nissued and outstanding under the Omnibus Plan.\nTelesat Corporation RSUs, PSUs, and DSUs\nThe terms and conditions of grants of Telesat Corporation RSUs, Telesat Corporation PSUs and Telesat\nCorporation DSUs, including the quantity, type of award, grant date, vesting conditions, vesting periods,\ntermination provisions, settlement date and other terms and conditions with respect to these Awards, will\nbe set out in the participant’s grant agreement. The purchase price for the Telesat Public Shares underlying\nthe participant’s grant of Telesat Corporation RSUs, Telesat Corporation PSUs and Telesat Corporation\nDSUs, as applicable, is determined by the Board and may be zero. As at December 31, 2023 there were\n784,725 RSUs, 375,137 PSUs and 124,616 DSUs issued and outstanding under the Omnibus Plan, which\nrepresents 9.4% of the aggregate number of Telesat Corporation Shares issued and outstanding as at\nDecember 31, 2023 (or 2.6%, assuming the exchange of all Exchangeable Units into Telesat Corporation\nShares). See “Details of the Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan” below. As of the date of this Information\nCircular, there were 904,604 RSUs, 786,025 PSUs and 152,330 DSUs issued and outstanding under the\nOmnibus Plan.\nTypes of Awards under Historic Plans\nTelesat Holdings Inc. (the predecessor entity to Telesat Canada and Telesat Corporation), adopted a\nmanagement stock incentive plan in September 2008, as amended (the “2008 Telesat Plan”), a second\nmanagement stock incentive plan in April 2013, as amended (the “2013 Telesat Plan”) and in April 2021\nadopted an RSU Plan (the “RSU Plan” and together with the 2008 Telesat Plan and the 2013 Plan, the\n“Historic Plans”). Types of awards under the Historic Plans included Telesat Options, Telesat Stock\nAppreciation Rights and Telesat Restricted Share Units (“RSUs”), as discussed below.\nIn connection with the completion of the Transaction in November 2021, no further Telesat Options, Telesat\nTandem SARs, and Telesat RSUs will be granted under the Historic Plans. Accordingly, there have been\nno Telesat Options, Telesat Tandem SARs or Telsat RSUs granted under the Historic Plans since 2021.\nTelesat Options\nThe Historic Plans provided that, unless otherwise specified in the grant agreement or employment\nagreement of a participant, the Telesat Options granted to any participant would vest as to 20% each year\nover five years. No Telesat Options have been granted to NEOs since 2021, and prior to the Transaction all\nvested and unvested stock options issued after 2009 (except 445,662 underwater option awards with a strike\nprice of $58.52 that our CEO retained, all of which have subsequently expired) and outstanding with respect\nto each NEO, were cancelled for nominal value, since the awards had no value and were no longer an\neffective retention vehicle.\nThe exercise price of any Telesat Option granted under the Historic Plans was fixed by the board of directors\nof Telesat Canada (the “Telesat Canada Board”) when Telesat Options were granted, at not less than fair\nmarket value. The Historic Plans provide that a Telesat Option will be exercisable during a period\nestablished by the Telesat Canada Board which would commence on the date of the grant and terminate no\nlater than 10 years after the date of the granting of the option or such shorter period as the Telesat Canada\nBoard may determine. However, in 2018 the Telesat Canada Board and Telesat Canada Compensation\nCommittee determined it would be in the best interests of Telesat to extend the expiry date of Telesat\nOptions issued under the 2008 Telesat Plan by five years. The result is that these Telesat Options expiration\ndates were extended to between 2023 and 2025.\n32\nTelesat Stock Appreciation Rights\nThe Historic Plans also provided for the issue of tandem share appreciation rights (referred to as “Telesat\nTandem SARs”) which may be granted in connection with Telesat Options granted under the Historic\nPlans, at or after the time of grant of such Telesat Options. Telesat Tandem SARs entitle the recipient to\nsurrender to Telesat, unexercised, the right to subscribe for Non-Voting Participating Preferred Shares\npursuant to the related Telesat Option and to receive from Telesat Canada cash or Non-Voting Participating\nPreferred Shares in an amount equal to the excess of the market value of a Telesat Option over the exercise\nprice under the related Telesat Option, net of any applicable withholding taxes and other required source\ndeductions. Telesat Tandem SARs were only awarded to certain executive officers and there are no\nremaining Tandem SARs issued and outstanding.\nTelesat Restricted Share Units\nA Telesat Canada restricted share unit (a “Telesat RSU”) entitled the recipient to receive Non-Voting\nParticipating Preferred Shares of Telesat Canada, which were convertible at the discretion of the holder into\nTelesat Common Shares, cash or other property equal in value to of the Telesat Common Shares.\nIn connection with the completion of the Transaction, each holder of Telesat Options, Telesat Tandem\nSARs and Telesat RSUs pursuant to the Historic Plans was provided with the option to enter into an\nexchange agreement with Telesat Corporation in respect of his or her Telesat Options, Telesat Tandem\nSARs and Telesat RSUs (the “Optionholder Exchange Agreements”). Pursuant to the Optionholder\nExchange Agreements, each holder of the Telesat Options, Telesat Tandem SARs and Telesat RSUs had\nthe right to exchange his or her Telesat Options, Telesat Tandem SARs and Telesat RSUs for corresponding\noptions, restricted share units and tandem share appreciation rights, as applicable, of Telesat Corporation.\nThe corresponding incentive securities have similar vesting terms as the Telesat Options, Telesat Tandem\nSARs and Telesat RSUs, however, the number of underlying Telesat Public Shares and exercise prices, as\napplicable, were adjusted to take into consideration the Telesat-to-Telesat Corporation Exchange Ratio. In\nconnection with the completion of the Transaction certain necessary modifications and amendments were\nmade to the Historic Plans and RSU Plan to meet the requirements of the NASDAQ and TSX, including\namendments (i) to give effect to the changes in our corporate structure contemplated by the Transaction;\nand (ii) include provisions and restrictions relating to amendment of the Historic Plans and RSU Plan or\noutstanding awards thereunder.\n2023 Long-term Incentive Awards\nGrants to the NEOs in 2023 under the Omnibus Plan consisted of RSUs, Telesat Corporation Options, PSUs\nand, in order to mitigate dilution to Telesat’s shareholders, a portion of the long-term incentive award was\npayable in cash. RSUs and Telesat Corporation Options vest rateably over three years with one-third vesting\nat the end of each year. PSUs vest over a three-year term based on meeting key milestones. The cash\ncomponent of the long-term incentive award is payable conditional upon the vesting of the RSU and PSU\nawards.\nDefined Benefit and Supplemental Retirement Plans for Designated Employees\nWe sponsor two non-contributory defined benefit pension arrangements for our executives: (i) the “Pension\nPlan for Designated Employees of Telesat Canada,” which is a registered pension plan as defined in the\nIncome Tax Act; and (ii) a supplemental employee retirement pension that covers pension benefits in excess\nof the tax limits imposed on the registered pension plan.\n33\nBoth pension programs provide for an annual pension based on service and final average earnings and\ninclude survivor benefits. The pension can commence without reduction as early as age 60 or 35 years of\nservice. Earlier retirement is possible with a reduction of 1/ % for each month before the unreduced\n4\nretirement date. Pensions are indexed to 50% of the consumer price index for each year.\nPrerequisites and Other Benefits\nThe Company does not provide significant perquisites to the NEOs, but they do receive medical insurance\ncoverage, relocation payments, as applicable, and in the case of our CEO, as discussed in the Employment\nAgreement section below, tax equalization payments. For certain NEOs, we provide US health insurance\ncoverage.\nCompensation Risk Oversight\nAs part of the review of the compensation paid to our executives, the Board and Human Resources &\nCompensation Committee consider the potential risks associated with the structure and design of our\nvarious compensation plans. Our compensation programs do not encourage excessive or unnecessary\nrisk-taking behavior. Overall, we found that there were no significant risks arising from our executive\ncompensation programs that were reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Telesat.\nHistorically, our NEOs were awarded Telesat Options and, in certain cases, Telesat Tandem SARs with\nvesting schedules that were aligned with mid and long-term decision making, which discourages excessive\nrisk taking for short-term gains and aligns our NEOs’ interests with those of our shareholders. As a public\ncompany, the Board and Human Resources & Compensation Committee will continue to work with our\ncompensation consultant to enhance our compensation program by considering additional measures\ndesigned to discourage excessive risk taking and promote long-term thinking.\nInsider Trading and Hedging Policy\nWe have adopted a customary insider trading policy, which, among other things, prohibits our executive\nofficers and directors from purchasing financial instruments that are designed to hedge or offset any\ndecrease in market value of Telesat Corporation’s equity securities granted as compensation or held,\ndirectly or indirectly, by the executive officer or director.\nExecutive Stock Ownership Guidelines\nWe have implemented share ownership guidelines for our executives to align the interests of such\nexecutives with those of our Shareholders. The ownership guidelines establish minimum equity ownership\nlevels for each of our executives based on a multiple of their annual base salary. Such executives are\nexpected to meet the prescribed ownership levels within five years of the later of (i) completion of the\nTransaction and (ii) the date of their appointment to their executive position. Common Shares and the value\nof equity-based awards will be included in determining an individual’s equity ownership value. The\nownership guideline for our CEO is 5x his annual base salary. The ownership guideline for our other NEOs\nis 2x their annual base salary and the ownership guideline for our other executives is 1x their annual base\nsalary.\nClawback Policy\nIn 2023, the Board adopted a specific policy to recoup or claw back incentive compensation under\nappropriate circumstances. The Board currently has discretion under the plans to reduce current or future\nawards should that be appropriate.\n34\nSummary Compensation Table\nThe following table sets out information concerning the compensation earned by, paid to, or awarded to our\nNEOs in the three most recently completed fiscal years:\nNon-equity Incentive\nPlan Compensation\n($)\nName and Fiscal Salary Share- Option- Annual Long- Pension All Other Total\nPrincipal Year ($) (1) based Based Incentive term Value ($) Compensation Compensation\nPosition Awards Awards plan ($)(5) incentive ($)(6) ($)\n($)(2)(3) ($)(4) plans ($)\nDaniel S. 2023 1,427,856 3,962,128 1,506,87 2,308,843 525,003 821,000 907,029 11,458,736\nGoldberg 7\nPresident and 2022 1,372,938 2,452,952 967,413 2,581,673 - 1,078,000 886,256(8) 8,452,976\nChief\nExecutive 2021 1,326,510 53,177,000 - 2,629,143 - 1,079,000 5,884,565(9) 58,211,653\nOfficer(7)\nAndrew 2023 752,081 943,341 358,778 1,216,115 125,023 13,000 132,772 3,541,110\nBrowne\nChief 2022 723,155 584,031 230,336 1,359,821 - 6,000 123,840 3,027,183\nFinancial\nOfficer\n2021 698,775 7,782,000 - 1,384,823 - - 98,959 (10) 9,865,598\nGlenn Katz 2023 694,404 754,682 287,023 673,711 100,009 139,000 502,854(14) 2,648,829\nChief\n2022 667,696 467,218 184,265 753,321 - 158,000 1,081,767 (11) 2,230,500\nCommercial\nOfficer\n2021 126,542 - - - - 52,000 16,053 194,595\nMichael 2023 726,445 754,682 287,023 1,176,526 100,009 - 29,118 3,073,803\nSchwartz\nSenior Vice 2022 675,120 467,218 184,265 1,269,143 - 442,000 82,338 3,120,084\nPresident,\nCorporate & 2021 682,517 9,208,700 - 1,352,749 - 552,000 376,209(12) 11,795,966\nBusiness -\nDevelopment\nDavid 2023 430,560 754,682 287,023 417,729 100,009 152,000 29,400 2,171,403\nWendling\n2022 414,000 467,218 184,265 467,091 - 227,000 29,400 1,788,974\nChief\nTechnical\n2021 400,000 3,891,000 - 356,760 - 178,000 133,180(13) 4,825,760\nOfficer\nNotes:\n(1) Mr. Schwartz was paid in U.S. dollars and converted to Canadian dollars based on an average exchange rate for 2023 of CAD $1.3493\nto $USD 1.0. All other NEOs were paid in Canadian dollars. Represents total base salary payable in fiscal year 2023.\n(2) The value attributed to the Share-based Awards in 2023 of $11.89 was derived from the Telesat Corporation share price on the NASDAQ\non date of grant, converted into Canadian dollars and multiplied by the number of RSUs and PSUs granted. The value attributed to the\nShare-based Awards in 2022 of $16.64 was derived from the Telesat Corporation share price on the NASDAQ on date of grant, converted\ninto Canadian dollars and multiplied by the number of RSUs and PSUs granted.\n35\n(3) The value attributed to the Share-based Awards in 2021 is derived from observable transactions of Telesat Canada equity which took\nplace at or about the time of grant at a value the equivalent of $62.72 per Telesat Corporation Share, multiplied by the number of Telesat\nRSUs granted. This differs from the value used to expense these share-based awards under IFRS 2 — Share based payment (accounting\nfair value). The value used to expense these options under IFRS 2 was derived from a valuation based on discounted projected future\ncash flows of Telesat’s GEO business and planned Telesat Lightspeed constellation, as at April 20, 2021, conducted by an independent\nthird party engaged by Telesat during the fourth quarter of 2021. That independent third-party evaluation implied a fair value of a share\nat the time of grant equivalent to $109.38 per Telesat Corporation Share. Accordingly, for expense purposes the value of the share-based\nawards with time-based vesting criteria, has been calculated based on a value of $109.38 per Telesat Corporation Share and the value of\nthe share-based awards with time and performance based vesting criteria, has been calculated based on a value of $66.10 per Telesat\nCorporation Share (discounted from $109.38 to reflect the potential that the performance criteria may not be met and the awards would\ntherefore not vest). The accounting value substantially exceeds the value of the observable transactions at or about the time of grant, as\nwell as the implied value of a Telesat Corporation Share of $45.26 based upon the closing price of Loral shares on the NASDAQ on\nApril 20, 2021. We believe that the observable value of $62.72 per Telesat Corporation Share is a more appropriate measure of these\nShare-based awards to our NEOs than the accounting fair value under IFRS 2.\n(4) The value attributed to the Option-based Awards in 2023 was calculated using Black Scholes methodology, which results in a value of\n$6.10 per Option, multiplied by the number of Options granted and was derived from the Telesat Corporation share price on the NASDAQ\non date of grant, converted into Canadian dollars, which was $11.89. The value attributed to the Option-based Awards in 2022 was\ncalculated using Black Scholes methodology, which results in a value of $8.53 per Option, multiplied by the number of Options granted\nand was derived from the Telesat Corporation share price on the NASDAQ on date of grant, converted into Canadian dollars, which was\n$16.64.\n(5) These awards were made by the Telesat Human Resources & Compensation Committee following review of Telesat’s performance for\nthe applicable year in accordance with the methodology set out under “Principal Elements of Compensation — Annual Bonuses.”\n(6) These amounts include all other compensation paid to a NEO during the course of the year, including medical insurance coverage, special\nbonuses, perquisites, tax equalization payments and relocation payments, as applicable.\n(7) All compensation paid to Mr. Goldberg is in consideration of his service as President and Chief Executive Officer of Telesat. Mr.\nGoldberg does not receive compensation for being a director of Telesat.\n(8) Includes a $750,000 tax equalization payment to Mr. Goldberg pursuant to his employment agreement to compensate him for the\nadditional tax costs incurred as a result of living in Ontario, Canada as opposed to the U.S.\n(9) Includes a going-public transaction bonus payment of $5,000,000 as per Mr. Goldberg’s bonus agreement executed in 2013.\n(10) Includes a one-time relocation payment of $88,296 paid in connection with Mr. Browne’s relocation to Ontario, Canada in 2020 following\nhis acceptance of employment with Telesat.\n(11) Includes compensation payments of US$201,250 and US$540,000 paid to Mr. Katz for bonuses that would have been received from his\nprior employer and prior employer equity that would have vested, respectively, had he not terminated his prior employment to join\nTelesat.\n(12) Includes a cash award of $285,994, pursuant to the special bonus paid in connection with a distribution to shareholders.\n(13) Includes a cash award of $103,780 pursuant to the special bonus paid in connection with a distribution to shareholders.\n(14) Includes compensation payment of US$270,000 paid to Mr. Katz for prior employer equity that would have vested had he not terminated\nhis prior employment to join Telesat.\nPerformance Graph\nThe following graph compares the Company’s cumulative shareholder return to the S&P/TSX Composite\nIndex on a quarterly basis over the time period November 19, 2021 (being the date the Company’s Class A\ncommon shares and Class B variable voting shares began trading on the TSX) until December 31, 2023,\nassuming a reinvestment of any dividends and considering a $100 investment on November 19, 2021.\nCumulative Total Sharehold Returns on $100 Investment\nNovember 19, 2021 to December 31, 2023\n150.00\n100.00\n50.00\n-\nTSAT:TSX S&P/TSX Composite Index\n36\nThe market price of Telesat Common Shares is subject to fluctuation based on several factors, many of\nwhich are outside Telesat’s control. These include market perception of the Company’s ability to achieve\nbusiness goals, trading volume of Telesat Common Shares, changes in economic conditions and the\nfinancial markets and other general developments in the industry that affect the Company. Accordingly, the\nTelesat Common Share price and total shareholder return over the measurement period may not be\nreflective of the Company’s financial performance or management’s efforts in enhancing shareholder value.\nFor the period since the Company became a reporting issuer, the total compensation of the NEOs is not\ndirectly correlated with the trend of the return on investment of the Telesat Common Shares shown in the\nabove graph.\nWhile a significant portion of the compensation of NEOs is performance-based, it is difficult to correlate\ncompensation to the trends shown in the above performance graph. As described in our “Compensation\nDiscussion and Analysis”, base salaries are not determined based on share price, benchmarks or a specific\nformula, but rather are set to be competitive with industry levels and are determined on an individual basis\ntaking into account the scope of the executive officer’s responsibilities and their prior experience.\nAdjustments to base salaries are determined annually by the Board on the recommendation of the Human\nResources & Compensation Committee and may be increased based on the executive officer’s performance,\nas well as to maintain market competitiveness. Additionally, base salaries can be adjusted as warranted\nthroughout the year to reflect promotions or other changes in the scope or breadth of an executive officer’s\nrole or responsibilities. Similarly, annual cash incentive awards are measured with reference to Adjusted\nEBITDA performance goals for the fiscal year. Total shareholder return and share price are not factored\ninto annual cash incentive awards. Long-term incentives (Telesat Corporation Options, Telesat Corporation\nRSUs, Telesat Corporation PSUs and Telesat Corporation DSUs) are awarded and vest as described in this\ncircular. The price of Telesat Common Shares at the time long-term incentives are awards will influence\nthe number of units granted (in the case of Telesat Corporation RSUs, Telesat Corporation PSUs and Telesat\nCorporation DSUs) and the number of Telesat Corporation Options granted, along with their exercise price.\nOnce long-term incentives vest, the value that an NEO may realize fluctuates based on the Telesat Common\nShare price, aligning the interests of NEOs with those of Telesat’s shareholders.\nEmployment Agreements\nWe have written employment agreements with each of our NEOs and each executive is entitled to receive\ncompensation established by us as well as other benefits in accordance with plans available to the most\nsenior employees of Telesat. Certain NEOs are, however, entitled to extended health benefits that are not\notherwise available to other senior employees of Telesat.\nDaniel S. Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer\nMr. Goldberg’s employment agreement executed in September 2008 provides for base salary, an annual\nperformance bonus, an annual tax gross up payment (that compensates Mr. Goldberg for the higher taxes\nhe is required to pay in Ontario, Canada as compared to the taxes he would pay if he resided in the United\nStates), health benefits, and participation in the Historic Plans and successor plans.\nThe employment agreement with Mr. Goldberg specifies the amounts or items payable, including\nseverance, to Mr. Goldberg in the event that he is terminated without cause or resigns with good reason.\nThe payment of severance to Mr. Goldberg is conditioned on his execution of a release of claims.\nIf Mr. Goldberg is terminated without cause or resigns with good reason, Mr. Goldberg will be entitled to:\n(i) his accrued but unpaid base salary, vacation pay, and any expenses, amounts or benefits which have\naccrued to the termination date, (ii) any earned but unpaid bonus from the previous year, (iii) a prorated\nbonus for the year in which termination occurs based on the prior year’s bonus, (iv) an amount equal to two\n37\nand a half times the sum of his base salary and the greater of the minimum bonus set out in the bonus\nagreement (see below) and his bonus paid in the previous year, (v) a payment for outplacement services\nand moving expenses up to US$25,000, and (vi) a monthly payment in lieu of continuing medical coverage\nfor 30 months to ensure Mr. Goldberg can maintain equivalent medical coverage to that which was in place\non the date of termination.\nIf Mr. Goldberg is terminated with cause or due to his resignation, Mr. Goldberg will be entitled to: (i) his\naccrued but unpaid base salary, vacation pay, and any expenses, amounts or benefits which have accrued\nto the termination date and (ii) any earned but unpaid bonus from the previous year.

Our objective\nregarding director compensation is to follow the best practices with respect to retainers and the format and\nweighting of the cash and equity components of compensation, and the implementation of share ownership\nguidelines. We believe the selected approaches have helped attract, and will help to attract and retain, strong\nmembers for the Board who will be able to fulfil their fiduciary responsibilities without competing interests.\nThe Board, through the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee, will be responsible for reviewing\nand approving any changes to the directors’ compensation arrangements.\nFollowing best practice, Telesat does not offer a meeting fee for directors. The total non-executive director\nretainer is deemed to be full payment for the role of director. The exception to this approach would be in the\nevent of a merger or acquisition, or other special circumstance that required more meetings than are typically\nrequired, in which case a “special” fee may be granted. Also, an additional retainer premium is provided to\nthe chair and each of the members of the Audit Committee, the Human Resources & Compensation\nCommittee and Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee, as well as the lead director, to the extent\n45\none is appointed, to reflect the additional time commitment, level of responsibility and skills required in such\nrole.\nThe fee schedule for Telesat’s non-executive directors is as follows:\nType of Fee Position Amount(1)\nBoard Retainer Board Member $75,000\n$100,000 Telesat\nCorporation DSU Award(2)\nCommittee Retainer Audit Committee Chair $25,000\nAudit Committee Member $10,000\nHuman Resources & Compensation $15,000\nCommittee Chair $7,500\nHuman Resources & Compensation $15,000\nCommittee Member $7,500\nNominating & Corporate Governance $15,000\nCommittee Chair\nNominating & Corporate Governance $7,500\nCommittee Member\nMeeting Fees Board and Committee Meetings Nil\nNotes:\n(1) Fees are paid in cash unless otherwise noted and subject to a non-execuitve director’s right to elect receive DSUs in lieu\nof cash.\n(2) Represents the portion of the directors’ annual retainer initially taken as Telesat Corporation DSUs. Any non-executive\ndirector may elect to receive up to 100% of their annual retainer in the form of DSUs in lieu of cash. All DSU awards are\npayable upon cessation of membership on the Board.\nAll directors are entitled to be reimbursed for expenses reasonably incurred by them in their capacity as\ndirectors.\n46\nThe table below shows compensation earned by directors for the financial year ended December 31, 2023.\nName Fees Share- Option- Non- Pension All Other Total\nearned based Based equity Value Compen- ($)\n($) Awards Awards incentive ($) sation\n($) ($) plan ($)\ncompen-\nsation ($)\nMr. Michael Boychuk 100,000 100,034 N/A N/A N/A N/A 200,034\nMr. Jason A. 44,153 58,983 N/A N/A N/A N/A 103,136\nCaloras(1)\nMs. Jane Craighead - 207,522 N/A N/A N/A N/A 207,552\nMr. Richard Fadden 82,500 100,034 N/A N/A N/A N/A 182,534\nMr. Daniel N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A\nGoldberg(2)\nMr. Henry Intven 100,000 100,034 N/A N/A N/A N/A 200,034\nMr. David Morin(3) N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A -\nDr. Mark H.

The ownership guidelines establish minimum equity ownership\nlevels for each of our directors based on a multiple of their annual Board retainer. Such directors are\nexpected to meet the prescribed ownership levels within five years of the later of (i) completion of the\nTransaction and (ii) the date of their appointment to the Board. Common Shares and the value of DSUs and\n48\nany other equity-based awards will be included in determining an individual’s equity ownership value. The\nownership guideline for these directors is 3x their annual Board cash retainer.\nDetails of the Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan\nThe interest of any participant in any Award is not assignable or transferable, whether voluntary,\ninvoluntary, by operation of law or otherwise, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution,\nprovided, however, that with the Board’s prior written consent and subject to certain conditions as the Board\nmay stipulate, Teleast Corporation Options may be transferred or assigned by a participant to a participant’s\nfamily or retirement savings trust or any registered retirement savings plans or registered retirement income\nfunds of which the participant is and remains the annuitant.\nThe Omnibus Plan provides that appropriate adjustments, if any, will be made by the Board in connection\nwith a reclassification, reorganization or other change of our shares, share split or consolidation,\ndistribution, merger, arrangement or amalgamation, in the Telesat Public Shares issuable or amounts\npayable to preclude a dilution or enlargement of the benefits under the Omnibus Plan.\nThe maximum number of Telesat Public Shares reserved for issuance under our Omnibus Plan is currently\n2,972,816 Telesat Public Shares, which represents 5.9% of the aggregate number of Telesat Corporation\nShares issued and outstanding as at December 31, 2023, on a diluted basis assuming the exchange of all\nExchangeable Units into Telesat Corporation Shares (not including any awards outstanding under the\nHistoric Plans). At the Meeting, the Company will seek the approval of Shareholders to increase the number\nof Telesat Public Shares reserved for issuance under the Omnibus Plan to 5,017,401, which represents 10%\nof the aggregate number of Telesat Corporation Shares issued and outstanding as at the date of this\nInformation Circular, calculated on the same basis as set forth earlier in this paragraph. Shareholders of the\nCompany are being asked to approve the increase by a majority of votes cast and the full text of the\nresolution is set forth above in “Business to be Conducted at the Meeting — Proposed Amendment to the\nOmnibus Incentive Plan”. For the purposes of calculating the maximum number of Telesat Public Shares\nreserved for issuance under the Omnibus Plan and the Historic Plans, any issuance from treasury by Telesat\nthat is issued in reliance upon an exemption under applicable stock exchange rules applicable to equity\nbased compensation arrangements used as an inducement to person(s) or company(ies) not previously\nemployed by and not previously an insider of Telesat shall not be included. All of the Telesat Public Shares\ncovered by Awards that are exercised or settled in cash or cancelled or terminated will again become\navailable Telesat Public Shares for the purposes of Awards that may be subsequently granted under the\nOmnibus Plan.\nThe maximum number of Telesat Public Shares that are: (i) issued to insiders of Telesat within any one-\nyear period; and (ii) issuable to insiders of Telesat at any time, in each case, under the Omnibus Plan alone,\nor when combined with all of Telesat’s other security-based compensation arrangements cannot exceed\n10% of the aggregate number of Telesat Corporation Shares issued and outstanding from time to time, on\na diluted basis assuming the exchange of all Exchangeable Units into Telesat Corporation Shares.\nThe total annual grant to any one non-employee director under all share compensation arrangements shall\nnot exceed an aggregate grant value of $100,000 in Options and $150,000 in equity, other than with respect\nto any DSUs granted to a non-employee director in lieu of their cash retainer.\nThe Omnibus Plan does not provide for a maximum number of shares which may be issued to an individual,\nother than an insider, pursuant to the Omnibus Plan and any other share compensation arrangement\n(expressed as a percentage or otherwise).\n49\nUnless the Board determines otherwise at the time of grant or issuance of the Award, when normal cash\ndividends (other than stock dividends) are paid on Telesat Public Shares, participants shall receive\nadditional DSUs, RSUs and/or PSUs, as applicable as of the dividend payment date (“Dividend Share\nUnits”). Dividend Share Units granted to a participant in accordance with the Omnibus Plan shall be subject\nto the same vesting conditions and settlement terms as applicable to the related DSUs, RSUs and/or PSUs\nin accordance with the respective Award Agreement.\nIn connection with a change of control event of Telesat, the Board may take such action as the Board in its\nsole discretion considers appropriate in the circumstances, including, without limitation, (i) changing the\nvesting or manner of settlement of any Award, (ii) changing the expiry date or term of any Award, (iii)\nproviding for the substitution or replacement of Awards, including with awards of the surviving entity, or\n(iv) providing for the cancellation of Awards, provided that all Awards to be so cancelled will first vest and\nbecome exercisable prior to such change of control event in accordance with the provisions of the Omnibus\nPlan.\nThe Board may, in its sole discretion, suspend or terminate the Omnibus Plan at any time, or from time to\ntime, amend, revise or discontinue the terms and conditions of the Omnibus Plan or of any Award granted\nunder the Omnibus Plan and any grant agreement relating thereto, subject to compliance with applicable\nlaw and any required shareholder, regulatory and/or NASDAQ, and, if applicable the TSX, approval,\nprovided that any such amendment or revision may not materially adversely affect the rights of a participant\nunder the Omnibus Plan without such participant’s consent.\nPursuant to the terms of the Omnibus Plan, shareholder approval is not required for the following\namendments, and the Board may make any amendments to the Omnibus Plan or to any Awards from time\nto time which may include but are not limited to:\n(cid:120) any amendment to the vesting provisions, if applicable, or assignability provisions of\nAwards;\n(cid:120) any amendment regarding the effect of termination of a participant’s employment,\nengagement, contract or office;\n(cid:120) any amendment which accelerates the date on which any Award may be exercised under\nthe Omnibus Plan;\n(cid:120) any amendment to the definition of persons eligible to be participants under the Omnibus\nPlan;\n(cid:120) any amendment to add provisions permitting for the granting of cash-settled awards, a form\nof financial assistance, or clawback and any amendment to a cash-settled award, financial\nassistance, dividend equivalent or clawback provision which is adopted;\n(cid:120) any amendment necessary to comply with applicable law or the requirements of the\nNASDAQ, and, if applicable the TSX, or any other regulatory body;\n(cid:120) any amendment of a “housekeeping” nature, including, without limitation, to clarify the\nmeaning of an existing provision of the Omnibus Plan, correct or supplement any provision\nof the Omnibus Plan that is inconsistent with any other provision of the Omnibus Plan,\ncorrect any grammatical or typographical errors or amend certain definitions in the\nOmnibus Plan;\n50\n(cid:120) any amendment regarding the administration of the Omnibus Plan;

Thereafter, the number of directors shall be set by resolution of the shareholders or as\nadjusted by the Telesat Corporation Board from time to time, subject to the provisions of the BCBCA.\nUntil the Special Nomination Termination Date, any designee of the Nominating & Corporate Governance\nCommittee may be rejected by the Telesat Corporation Board only for Good Cause (as defined in the Telesat\nCorporation Articles), in which case the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee shall have the\nright to designate a substitute designee.\nFollowing the Special Nomination Termination Date, approval of the Telesat Corporation Board will be\nrequired for the appointment of three of the designees proposed by the Nominating & Corporate\nGovernance Committee, though until the Special Board Date, such approval is not to be unreasonably\nwithheld and approval of at least a majority of the Specially Designated Directors then in office, not to be\nunreasonably withheld, will also be required. In addition, for purposes of Telesat Corporation’s annual\nmeeting of shareholders to be held in calendar year 2024, three of the designees proposed by the Nominating\n& Corporate Governance Committee may instead be designated by a subset of its members selected by the\nTelesat Corporation Board, with any such subset of the members of the Nominating & Corporate\nGovernance Committee to be selected by the Telesat Corporation Board and to include at least the three\nmembers required to be appointed to the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee under the Telesat\nCorporation Articles.\nPursuant to the Investor Rights Agreements, if PSP Investments or MHR, respectively, decreases their\nrespective aggregate ownership of Telesat Corporation Shares and Exchangeable Units at any time such\nthat it owns less than 25%, 15% or 5%, respectively, of all of the issued and outstanding Telesat Corporation\nShares and Exchangeable Units as of the completion of the Transaction, the number of directors which such\nparty is entitled to designate to the Telesat Corporation Board will decrease to two, one and zero,\nrespectively. The number of independent directors that the Nominating & Corporate Governance\nCommittee may designate to the Telesat Corporation Board will be increased by one each time the number\nof designees PSP Investments or MHR (or, if applicable, a person to whom PSP Investments or MHR has\ndelegated its right to designate directors to the Telesat Corporation Board under the Telesat Corporation\nArticles) is entitled to designate is reduced by one, until there are no such designees. In general, such\nindependent directors must be Canadian.\nDirectors of Telesat Corporation may only be removed with an affirmative vote of at least 75% of the votes\nattached to the outstanding Telesat Corporation Shares and Special Voting Shares, voting together as a\nsingle class. However, if PSP Investments or MHR (or one of its respective assignees, if applicable)\nprovides written notice to Telesat Corporation that one of the directors that it had designated to the Telesat\nCorporation Board will resign, the delivery of such notice will be deemed such designator’s resignation.\nSuch resignation will be effective immediately upon receipt of such written notice by Telesat Corporation\nwithout consent or acceptance of the Telesat Corporation Board or any of its shareholders.\nThe Telesat Corporation Board has established three committees in accordance with the terms of the Telesat\nCorporation Articles: the Audit Committee, the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee, and the\n54\nHuman Resources & Compensation Committee (each as defined below). See the remainder of this section\nand “— Committees of our Board of Directors” for a further description of the committees.\nCanadian Director and Committee Member Requirements\nThe Telesat Corporation Articles include certain requirements of directors of Telesat Corporation, so\nTelesat Corporation may maintain its status as a Canadian (for the purposes of this section, as defined in\nthe Investment Canada Act) controlled entity. These requirements include that, prior to the occurrence of\nan Unwind Trigger, at least a majority of the Telesat Corporation Board be comprised of directors who are\nboth (i) Canadian (as defined in the Investment Canada Act) and (ii) nominated for election by either: (x) the\nNominating & Corporate Governance Committee, if comprised of a majority of Canadian directors, (y) PSP\nInvestments, or its affiliates, or (z) a shareholder who is Canadian.\nAdditionally, until the occurrence of an Unwind Transaction, at least a majority of the directors serving on\neach of the Audit Committee, the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee, the Human Resources\n& Compensation Committee and any other committee formed in accordance with the Telesat Corporation\nBoard, is required to be both (i) Canadian and (ii) nominated for election by either: (x) the Nominating &\nCorporate Governance Committee, if comprised of a majority of Canadian directors, (y) PSP Investments,\nor its affiliates, or (z) a Shareholder who is Canadian; provided that no committee member designated by\nMHR (or its assignee, if applicable) shall be required to be Canadian.\nNomination Rights of Principal Shareholders\nAs described above, under the Investor Rights Agreements, Telesat Corporation’s principal shareholders,\nnamely PSP Investments and MHR and their affiliates, are each granted a right to nominate three directors\nto the Telesat Corporation Board. Further, so long as the applicable principal shareholder has the right to\ndesignate at least one director to the Telesat Corporation Board, it will have the right, though not the\nobligation, to select one of the directors it designated to the Telesat Corporation Board to serve on or be an\nobserver to Telesat Corporation’s Audit Committee, Human Resources & Compensation Committee, and\nNominating & Corporate Governance Committee or any other committee which may be formed in\naccordance with Telesat Corporation’s Articles (provided that the mandate of such committee is not solely\nto consider any contract or transaction between Telesat Corporation and the applicable principal shareholder\nor any of its affiliates).\nPursuant to the Investor Rights Agreements, PSP Investments and MHR agree, among other things, to not\n(i) call or knowingly facilitate the calling of a special meeting of the shareholders of Telesat Corporation\nor the partners of Telesat Partnership for the purpose of the election or removal of any directors of Telesat\nCorporation or amendments to the Telesat Corporation Articles or the Partnership Agreement, (ii) initiate\nproposals for action by the shareholders of Telesat Corporation or the partners of Telesat Partnership for\nthe purpose of the election or removal of any directors of Telesat Corporation or amendments to the Telesat\nCorporation Articles or the Partnership Agreement or (iii) request that Telesat Corporation or the Telesat\nCorporation Board take any action that is inconsistent with the foregoing.\nThe Investor Rights Agreements allow each of PSP Investments and MHR to transfer its respective right to\ndesignate one member of the Telesat Corporation Board to a third party if the applicable principal\nshareholder transfers an amount of Telesat Public Shares, Class C Shares, Exchangeable Units or any right\nor security that is exercisable for, convertible into or exchangeable for Telesat Corporation Shares\nrepresenting (i) at least 9.9% of the issued and outstanding Telesat Corporation Shares on a fully diluted\nbasis as of the completion of the Transaction and (ii) at least 5% of the issued and outstanding Telesat\nCorporation Shares on a fully diluted basis at the time of such transfer. The acquirer’s right to designate\none member to the Telesat Corporation Board will terminate upon the date that such acquirer holds Telesat\n55\nCorporation Shares, Exchangeable Units or any right or security that is exercisable for, convertible into or\nexchangeable for Telesat Corporation Shares representing less than 5% of the issued and outstanding\nTelesat Corporation Shares on a fully diluted basis. Telesat Corporation agrees to take certain actions to\nreasonably cooperate with PSP Investments and/or MHR to facilitate a sale of PSP Investments’ or MHR’s\nTelesat Corporation Shares or Exchangeable Units, as applicable, to a third party, at PSP Investments’\nand/or MHR’s sole cost and expense, for so long as PSP Investments or MHR, as applicable, beneficially\nowns at least 10% of the Telesat Corporation Shares or Exchangeable Units on a fully diluted basis.\nAdditional negotiated rights of PSP Investments and MHR are contained in the Telesat Corporation Articles\nand Partnership Agreement, and are discussed under “Description of Share Capital and Voting Structure.”\nDirector Independence\nPursuant to NASDAQ Rule 5605, an “independent director” means a person other than an executive officer\nor employee of the company to whose board they are appointed to or any other individual having a\nrelationship which, in the opinion of such company’s board of directors, would interfere with the exercise\nof independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. In addition, the NASDAQ\nMarketplace Rules contain certain “bright-line” tests of independence that a board of directors must\nconsider before making a determination of independence. Under NI 58-101, a director is considered to be\nindependent if he or she is independent within the meaning of Section 1.4 of National Instrument 52-110\n— Audit Committees of the securities commissions and similar regulatory authorities in all of the provinces\nand territories in Canada (“NI 52-110”). Pursuant to NI 52-110, an independent director is a director who\nis free from any direct or indirect material relationship with Telesat which could, in the view of the Telesat\nCorporation Board, be reasonably expected to interfere with the exercise of a director’s independent\njudgment.\nBased upon information requested from and provided by each director concerning his or her background,\nemployment and affiliations, including family relationships, the Telesat Corporation Board has determined\nthat all of the members of the Telesat Corporation Board, other than Daniel S. Goldberg and Michael\nTargoff, representing two of its ten directors, are “independent” within the meaning of NI 58-101 and\nNASDAQ Rule 5605. Telesat’s Chief Executive Officer, Daniel S. Goldberg, is not independent as a result\nof his position with Telesat Corporation. Michael Targoff is not independent because he received certain\nconsulting fees under a consulting agreement entered into between Mr. Targoff and Loral on December 14,\n2012, pursuant to which he was engaged as a part-time consultant to the board of directors of Loral to assist\nwith respect to the oversight of strategic matters relating to Telesat Canada and XTAR, LLC. Mr. Targoff\nreceived consulting fees of US$120,000 per month before deduction of certain net expenses for which he\nreimbursed Loral. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Mr. Targoff earned US$1,272,000 (before his\nexpense reimbursement to Loral of US$39,750). This agreement was terminated effective November 18,\n2021.\nPursuant to the Telesat Corporation Articles, the Telesat Corporation Board must also include three\nSpecially Designated Directors for so long as either PSP Investments or MHR (or either of their respective\naffiliates) has the right to designate at least one director to the Telesat Corporation Board pursuant to their\nrespective Investor Rights Agreements, as described above under “— Composition of the Telesat\nCorporation Board and Committees.” A “Specially Designated Director” is a director who (i) is initially\ndesignated as a Specially Designated Director or is nominated as a Specially Designated Director by the\nNominating & Corporate Governance Committee (or, for purposes of Telesat Corporation’s annual meeting\nof shareholders to be held in calendar year 2024, a subset thereof) and not designated to the Telesat\nCorporation Board by either PSP Investments or MHR, (ii) (x) satisfies the independence requirements of\nthe applicable U.S. and/or Canadian securities exchanges on which the Telesat Public Shares are listed, (y)\nis “independent” of Telesat Corporation within the meaning of NI 52-110 and (z) is “independent” of\n56\nTelesat Corporation within the meaning of Section 10A(m)(3)(B) of the United States Securities Exchange\nAct of 1934, (iii) is not an affiliate or associate of MHR, PSP Investments or any other person with a\ncontractual right to designate director nominees (or their respective affiliates), (iv) together with such\nperson’s immediate family and affiliates, has not received compensation or payments from MHR, PSP\nInvestments or any other person with a contractual right to designate director nominees (or their respective\naffiliates) in any of the past three years in an amount in excess of US$120,000 per annum, excluding for\nthese purposes any directors fees, and (v) is Canadian (as defined in the Investment Canada Act).\nDirector Term Limits and Other Mechanisms of Telesat Corporation Board Renewal\nThe Telesat Corporation Board has not adopted director term limits or other automatic mechanisms of\nrenewal of its members. Rather than adopting formal term limits, mandatory age-related retirement policies\nand other mechanisms of board renewal, the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee of the\nTelesat Corporation Board will seek to maintain the composition of the Telesat Corporation Board in a way\nthat provides, in the judgment of the Telesat Corporation Board, the best mix of skills and experience to\nprovide for Telesat Corporation’s overall stewardship. The Nominating & Corporate Governance\nCommittee also is expected to conduct an annual assessment of the Telesat Corporation Board, each\ncommittee, the Chair, each committee chair and each director regarding their effectiveness, efficiency and\nperformance, and to report evaluation results to the Telesat Corporation Board. See also “— Nominating &\nCorporate Governance Committee” and “— Diversity Policy”.\nMeetings of Independent Directors and Conflicts of Interest\nThe Telesat Corporation Board holds regularly scheduled meetings, as well as ad hoc meetings from time\nto time. The independent members of the Telesat Corporation Board meet regularly, and upon any\nmember’s request without the non-independent directors and members of management, and as may be\nrequired by NASDAQ or, if applicable, TSX listing standards from time to time. The Telesat Corporation\nBoard has appointed an independent chair of the Telesat Corporation Board (the “Chair”).\nIn 2023, the independent members of the Telesat Corporation Board met without the non-independent\ndirectors and management three times.\nTo the extent that Telesat Corporation does not have an independent Chair, it will arrange for the\nappointment of a lead director (the “Lead Director”) whose responsibilities will be to ensure that the\ndirectors who are independent have opportunities to meet without management and non-independent\ndirectors present, as required, and to provide leadership for the independent directors on the Telesat\nCorporation Board. To the extent required, a Lead Director will be appointed and replaced from time to\ntime by a majority vote of the directors who are independent, provided that such Lead Director is and will\nbe at all times an independent director (as determined under the NASDAQ rules and NI 58-101). The\nTelesat Corporation Board will adopt a written position description for a Lead Director, to the extent one\nis appointed, which provides, among other things, that the Lead Director will be responsible for: (a)\nproviding leadership to ensure that the Telesat Corporation Board functions independently of management\nof Telesat Corporation, (b) providing leadership to foster the effectiveness of the Telesat Corporation\nBoard, (c) suggesting items of importance for consideration on the agenda for Telesat Corporation Board\nmeetings, (d) chairing each board meeting, or the portion thereof, at which only independent directors are\npresent, as may be required from time to time, (e) ensuring that the independent directors have the\nopportunity to meet separately in camera, without non-independent directors and senior executives present,\n(f) working with the Chair and the Chief Executive Officer to enhance the effectiveness and performance\nof the Telesat Corporation Board, as well as the committees and individual directors of the Telesat\nCorporation Board, and (g) performing additional duties as requested by the Telesat Corporation Board.\n57\nConflicts of Interest and Related Party Transactions\nCertain of our directors and officers are associated with other companies or entities, which may give rise to\nconflicts of interest. In accordance with Part 5 — Division 3 — Conflicts of Interest under the BCBCA, in\nthe event that a director or senior officer (i) has a material interest in a contract or proposed contract or\ntransaction that is material to an issuer or (ii) is a director or senior officer of, or has a material interest in,\na person who has a material interest in the contract or transaction (a “disclosable interest”), the director or\nsenior officer shall disclose his or her disclosable interest in such contract or transaction and the director\nshall refrain from voting on any matter in respect of such contract or transaction, subject to and in\naccordance with the BCBCA. To the extent that conflicts of interest arise, such conflicts will be resolved\nin accordance with the provisions of the BCBCA and applicable internal corporate governance or polices\nof the Telesat Corporation Board, as applicable.\nThe Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee assists the Telesat Corporation Board in relation to\nrelated party transactions and other matters involving conflicts of interest unless such matters are within\nthe mandate of the Company’s Audit Committee. The Audit Committee establishes and periodically\nreviews the Company’s policies and procedures for reviewing and approving or ratifying related party\ntransactions. The Company has adopted a written Code of Ethics which provides that all members of senior\nmanagement (defined therein as the CEO and direct reports of the CEO) of the Company and the Telesat\nCorporation Board shall disclose to the CFO or CEO any material proposed transaction, including related\nparty transactions, or a relationship that could be expected to give rise to a conflict. The CFO or CEO will\ncoordinate with the General Counsel to notify the Audit Committee, as may be necessary. No action may\nbe taken with respect to such transaction or party unless and until such action has been approved by the\nTelesat Corporation Board or a duly authorized committee of the Telesat Corporation Board. A copy of the\nCode of Ethics can be obtained on the Company’s website at www.telesat.com.\nQuorum\nA quorum at any meeting of the Telesat Corporation Board consists of a majority of the directors then in\noffice. Until the Special Board Date, such quorum will also require a majority of the Specially Designated\nDirectors then in office. Further, prior to the occurrence of an Unwind Trigger, a quorum will also require\nthat a majority of the members of the Telesat Corporation Board present must be comprised of directors\nwho are both (i) Canadian (for the purposes of this section, as defined in the Investment Canada Act) and\n(ii) nominated for election by either: (x) the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee, if comprised\nof a majority of Canadian directors, (y) PSP Investments, or its affiliates, or (z) a shareholder who is\nCanadian. A director holding a disclosable interest in a contract or transaction to be considered at a meeting,\nif present at the meeting, is to be counted in a quorum notwithstanding such director’s interest.\nMajority Voting Policy\nIn accordance with the requirements of the TSX, the Telesat Corporation Board has adopted a “Majority\nVoting Policy” that will require a nominee for election as a director who does not receive a greater number\nof votes “for” than votes “withheld” with respect to the election of directors by shareholders to tender a\nresignation to the Chair promptly following the applicable meeting of shareholders. Under the terms of the\nMajority Voting Policy, our Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee will be required to consider\nsuch resignation and make a recommendation to the Telesat Corporation Board on whether such resignation\nshould be accepted. The Majority Voting Policy requires that the Telesat Corporation Board shall promptly\naccept the resignation unless it determines, in consultation with the Nominating & Corporate Governance\nCommittee, that there are exceptional circumstances that should delay the acceptance of the resignation or\njustify rejecting it. The Telesat Corporation Board will be required to make its decision and announce it in\na press release within 90 days following the meeting of shareholders. A director who tenders a resignation\n58\npursuant to the Majority Voting Policy will not be permitted to participate in any meeting of the Telesat\nCorporation Board or the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee at which the resignation is\nconsidered.\nDiversity Policy\nThe members of the Telesat Corporation Board and Telesat Corporation’s executive team have varying\nbackgrounds and expertise and were selected or nominated, both by Telesat Corporation and by MHR and\nPSP Investments (pursuant to the terms of the Investor Rights Agreements further described herein), on the\nbelief that Telesat Corporation and its stakeholders will benefit from a broad range of talent and cumulative\nexperience. As a result, Telesat Corporation has not adopted a formal written policy with respect to board\ndiversity, and in particular gender diversity. However, Telesat Corporation is committed to increasing\ndiversity on the Telesat Corporation Board and has set a goal of having women represent at least 30% of\nthe members of the Telesat Corporation Board. Following the Meeting, and assuming that all director\nnominees are elected, two of Telesat Corporation’s ten directors (or 20% of the Telesat Corporation Board)\nwill be women and one of the four directors nominated by Telesat Corporation (or 25%) will be a woman.\nAs Telesat Corporation has now completed its second full year as a public company, Telesat Corporation\nis diligently working towards identifying appropriate and qualified candidates to join the Telesat\nCorporation Board in an effort to achieve the 30% goal that has been set.\nWhile Telesat Corporation believes that the current composition of the Board is highly effective, Telesat\nCorporation is mindful of the benefits that increased diversity on the Telesat Corporation Board and in the\nexecutive team can bring to Telesat Corporation, including enhanced performance, effectiveness, and\ndecision-making abilities. To this end, in searches for new candidates, as one of several factors, Telesat\nCorporation considers the level of diversity, including female representation, on the Telesat Corporation\nBoard and in executive officer roles. Further, Telesat Corporation continuously monitors the level of female\nrepresentation and seeks to recruit qualified female candidates as part of its overall recruitment and selection\nprocess to fill openings, as the need arises, through vacancies, growth or otherwise. Consistent with the\nCorporation Governance Guidelines, the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee must take into\naccount a variety of criteria, including skills, qualifications, experience and diversity, with consideration to\nthe level of representation of women and other diverse candidates, when identifying, reviewing and\nevaluating candidates to serve as directors and executive officers of Telesat Corporation. Further, the\nTelesat Corporation Board may identify for the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee certain\nbusiness, financial, industry, diversity or other general attributes desirable in any of such persons, and\nrequest that the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee (i) nominate a candidate for election at\nthe next meeting of shareholders, or (ii) fill an actual or anticipated vacancy on the Telesat Corporation\nBoard, in each case, with an individual who has such attributes and who is approved in accordance with the\nTelesat Corporation Articles and, in each case, the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee shall\nuse its reasonable efforts to comply with any such requests. The Telesat Corporation Board will also\ncontinue to assess, on an annual basis, whether a formal diversity policy is necessary in order to retain and\nrecruit the best candidates for available openings.\nOrientation and Continuing Education\nThe Telesat Corporation Board conducts an orientation program for new directors under which a new\ndirector will meet with the Chair, members of senior management and Telesat Corporation’s secretary. New\ndirectors will be provided with comprehensive orientation and education as to the nature and operation of\nTelesat Corporation and its business, the role of the Telesat Corporation Board and its committees, and the\ncontribution that an individual director is expected to make. The Nominating & Corporate Governance\nCommittee is responsible for overseeing director continuing education designed to maintain or enhance the\nskills and abilities of the directors and to ensure that their knowledge and understanding of Telesat\n59\nCorporation’s business and operations remains current. The chair of each committee is responsible for\ncoordinating orientation and continuing director development programs relating to the committee’s\nmandate.\nPosition Descriptions\nThe Telesat Corporation Board has adopted a written position description for the Chair, setting out the\nChair’s key responsibilities, including, among others, duties relating to setting meeting agendas for the\nTelesat Corporation Board, chairing board and shareholder meetings of Telesat Corporation, director\ndevelopment and communicating with shareholders and regulators.\nThe Telesat Corporation Board has adopted a written position description for each of the committee chairs,\nwhich sets out such committee chair’s key responsibilities, including, among others, duties relating to\nsetting committee meeting agendas, chairing committee meetings and working with the committee and\nmanagement to ensure, to the greatest extent possible, the effective functioning of the committee.\nThe Telesat Corporation Board has adopted a written position description for Telesat Corporation’s Chief\nExecutive Officer, setting out its key responsibilities, including, among others, duties in relation to\nproviding overall leadership, ensuring the development of a strategic plan and recommending such plan to\nthe Telesat Corporation Board for consideration, ensuring the development of an annual corporate plan and\nbudget that supports the strategic plan and recommending such plan to the Telesat Corporation Board for\nconsideration and supervising day-to-day management and communicating with shareholders and\nregulators.\nMandate of the Telesat Corporation Board\nThe Telesat Corporation Board is responsible for supervising the management of the business and affairs\nof Telesat Corporation, including providing guidance and strategic oversight to management. The Telesat\nCorporation Board has adopted a formal mandate, set forth at Appendix “B”, that includes the following:\n(cid:120) selecting, appointing and supervising the Chief Executive Officer and approving the\ncompensation of the Chief Executive Officer;\n(cid:120) taking steps to satisfy itself as to the integrity of the Chief Executive Officer and other\nsenior executive officers and that the Chief Executive Officer and other senior executive\nofficers create a culture of integrity throughout the organization;\n(cid:120) adopting a strategic planning process and approving management’s strategic and business\nplans; and\n(cid:120) risk identification and ensuring that procedures are in place for the management of those\nrisks.\n60\nThe following table shows meeting attendance records for all Directors from January 1, 2022 to December\n31, 2023.\nNominating &\nCorporate Human Resources\nGovernance & Compensation\nName of Director Board Audit Committee Committee Committee\nMichael Boychuk 4/4 4/4 N/A N/A\nJason A.

One of our directors, Daniel S. Goldberg, also serves as Chief\nExecutive Officer of Telesat Canada. For information regarding the benefits upon termination of\nemployment contained in his employment agreement, see Employment Agreements, Termination and\nChange of Control Benefits — Daniel S. Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer.\nCommittees of our Board of Directors\nUnder the Telesat Corporation Articles, in addition to the three committees described below, and subject to\nthe rights of PSP Investments and MHR contained in their respective Investor Rights Agreements, prior to\nboth the Special Board Date and the Unwind Trigger, the Telesat Corporation Board may establish\nadditional committees of Telesat Corporation with the approval of a majority of the Specially Designated\nDirectors then in office. Prior to the occurrence of an Unwind Trigger, at least a majority of the members\nof each committee must meet the requirements to maintain Telesat Corporation’s status as a Canadian\ncontrolled entity described above under “Statement of Governance Practices — Canadian Director and\nCommittee Member Requirements.”\nSubject to the rights of PSP Investments and MHR contained in their respective Investor Rights Agreements\nand the rights of the Specially Designated Directors provided in the Telesat Corporation Articles, each as\ndescribed above, the Telesat Corporation Board has the ability to change the membership of, or fill\nvacancies in, or appoint members or observers to, any of its committees.\n61\nThe members of the Telesat Corporation Board may delegate to a new committee any of their powers, other\nthan: the power to fill vacancies in the Telesat Corporation Board, the power to change the membership of\n(or fill vacancies in) any committee of the Telesat Corporation Board, the power to declare dividends or\nother distributions to the Telesat Corporation’s shareholders, the power to appoint or remove officers\nappointed by the Telesat Corporation Board and, subject to limited exceptions, the power to issue securities\nof Telesat Corporation. However, such delegation requires the approval of a majority of all of the directors\nthen in office, which must include at least one designee appointed by PSP Investments, if one is serving, at\nleast one designee appointed by MHR, if one is serving, and one Specially Designated Director, for so long\nas either PSP Investments or MHR is a 5% Holder.\nAudit Committee\nThe Audit Committee must be comprised of at least three members, including at least one designee\nappointed by PSP Investments, for so long as PSP Investments has the right to designate at least one director\nto the Telesat Corporation Board pursuant to its Investor Rights Agreement, one designee appointed by\nMHR, for so long as MHR has the right to designate at least one director to the Telesat Corporation Board\npursuant to its Investor Rights Agreement, and one Specially Designated Director.

Under the Telesat\nPartnership Agreement, until no Telesat Corporation Shares remain outstanding, the general partner is\nrestricted from consummating any transaction unless (a) the terms of such transaction do not impair any of\nthe rights, duties, powers and authorities of the other parties to the Telesat Partnership Agreement in any\nmaterial respect and (b) its successor entity resulting from such transaction becomes bound by the terms of\nthe Telesat Partnership Agreement and the Trust Voting Agreement, such that they step into the shoes of\nTelesat Corporation and assume all obligations of Telesat Corporation as general partner of Telesat\nPartnership. In addition, Telesat Partnership must obtain the approval (i) of a majority of the Specially\nDesignated Directors then in office or (ii) approval by at least a simple majority of the votes cast by the\nholders of the Telesat Corporation Shares and the Special Voting Shares, voting together as a single class,\nbut excluding shares of Telesat Corporation beneficially owned by PSP Investments, MHR, or their\nrespective affiliates or associates and Special Voting Shares to the extent that the vote thereof is directed\nby PSP Investments, MHR, or their respective affiliates or associates.\nBecause of the limited liability of the limited partners of the Partnership, the authority of the limited partners\nis strictly limited. The Partnership Agreement will govern Telesat Partnership and set out the terms of the\nExchangeable Units and Telesat Partnership GP Units, as summarized in this section and under\n“Description of Exchangeable Units and GP Units” below.\n66\nPurpose of Telesat Partnership\nThe purpose of Telesat Partnership as described in the Partnership Agreement is to: (a) acquire and hold\ndirect and indirect equity interests in Loral, Telesat, Telesat CanHoldco and, subject to the approval of\nTelesat Corporation, in its capacity as general partner, any other persons, (b) engage in activities related to\nthe capitalization and financing of Telesat Partnership’s interests in such corporations and such other\npersons and (c) engage activities incidental to or in furtherance of the foregoing purposes or any other\nbusiness that it deems appropriate that is approved by its general partner and which complies with all\napplicable laws and the Partnership Agreement.\nAmendments to the Partnership Agreement\nGenerally, the Partnership Agreement may only be amended in writing and subject to the approval of\nholders of Telesat Corporation Shares or Exchangeable Units. However, the general partner of Telesat\nPartnership may also amend certain administrative provisions of the Partnership Agreement without the\nconsent of any limited partners, such as completing a name change of Telesat Partnership and certain\nchanges relating to taxation, provided that amendments to certain provisions of the Partnership Agreement\nthat may be made without the consent of any limited partners may only be made with the approval of a\nmajority of the Specially Designated Directors then in office. Telesat Partnership’s general partner is\nrequired to notify its limited partners of any amendment in writing within 30 days from when such\namendment takes effect.\nPower of Attorney\nPursuant to the Partnership Agreement, Telesat Corporation, as general partner, manages the Telesat\nPartnership, and, by entering into the Partnership Agreement, each limited partner has appointed Telesat\nCorporation, in its capacity as general partner, as such limited partner’s attorney for property to act on its\nbehalf in connection with Telesat Partnership’s administrative and operational matters. As limited partners,\nthe liability of each of the holders of Exchangeable Units for the debts, liabilities and obligations of Telesat\nPartnership will, subject to applicable law, be limited to the amount of such limited partner’s capital\ncontribution into Telesat Partnership, plus their share of any undistributed income of Telesat Partnership.\nReciprocal Changes\nHolders of Exchangeable Units will have the right to exchange their Exchangeable Units for Telesat\nCorporation Shares and will vote at Telesat Corporation through the Trust by way of the Special Voting\nShares. Because of this, and to avoid dilution of the voting powers of the holders of Exchangeable Units,\nthe Partnership Agreement provides that, generally, for so long as any Exchangeable Units not owned by\nthe general partner are outstanding, Telesat Corporation may not issue or distribute new shares in the capital\nof, or other interests in, Telesat Corporation to holders of Telesat Corporation Shares (in their capacity as\nsuch) unless Telesat Partnership also issues or distributes an equivalent class and type of securities to the\nholders of Exchangeable Units.\nAdditional restrictions on Telesat Corporation’s ability to take certain actions without effecting a\nsubstantially similar action at the Telesat Partnership level are described under “Description of\nExchangeable Units and GP Units — Economic and Voting Rights — Economic Rights.”\n67\nRemoval/Withdrawal of the General Partner\nTelesat Corporation, as general partner of Telesat Partnership, may not be removed as general partner of\nTelesat Partnership and, until no Exchangeable Units are owned by any person other than the general partner\nor any of its subsidiaries, not voluntarily withdraw from being the general partner.\nDESCRIPTION OF SHARE CAPITAL AND VOTING STRUCTURE\nTelesat Corporation\nThe authorized capital of Telesat consists of: (a) an unlimited number of Class A Common Shares, Class B\nVariable Voting Shares, Class C Fully Voting Shares, and Class C Limited Voting Shares (together, the\n“Class C Shares”); (b) the Class A Special Voting Share, Class B Special Voting Share, and Class C\nSpecial Voting Share; (c) the Golden Share; and (d) an unlimited number of Telesat Corporation “blank\ncheck” Class A Preferred Shares.\nAs of April 25, 2024, there are 13,641,019 Class A Common Shares and Class B Variable Voting Shares;\n112,841 Class C Fully Voting Shares; Nil Class C Limited Voting Shares; one Class A Special Voting\nShare; one Class B Special Voting Share; one Class C Special Voting Share; and the Golden Share issued\nand outstanding in the capital of Telesat.

The Special Voting Shares and the Golden Share have no material economic rights.\nThe following is a summary of the material rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions that attach to the\nTelesat Corporation Shares, the Special Voting Shares and the Golden Share. This is a summary only and\nis subject to the detailed provisions of the Telesat Corporation Articles, which are available at\nwww.sedarplus.com and www.sec.gov.\nPursuant to the Telesat Corporation Articles and formation documents of Telesat Partnership LP, the\nClass A Common Shares of Telesat Corporation and the Class A Units of Telesat Partnership LP, as\napplicable, may only be beneficially owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by Canadians (as defined\nin the Investment Canada Act).

The Non-Canadian Voting Limitation, defined and described below under the heading\n“Golden Share Mechanic”, do not apply to a vote on a Second Tabulation Matter. A “Second Tabulation\nMatter” means a resolution to effect:\n(cid:120) An increase or decrease of the maximum number of authorized shares of Telesat\nCorporation Shares, or an increase in the maximum number of authorized shares another\nclass or type with special rights or restrictions equal or superior to the Telesat Corporation\nShares;\n(cid:120) An exchange, reclassification or cancellation of all or part of the Telesat Corporation\nShares;\n(cid:120) An addition, change or removal of the special rights and restrictions attached to the Telesat\nCorporation Shares;\n(cid:120) An increase in the rights or privileges of any class of shares in the capital of Telesat that\nhas rights or privileges equal or superior to the Telesat Corporation Shares;\n(cid:120) The creation of a new class of Telesat Corporation Shares equal or superior to the Telesat\nCorporation Shares;\n(cid:120) The making of any class of shares in the capital of Telesat Corporation with rights or\nprivileges inferior to the Telesat Corporation Shares equal or superior to the Telesat\nCorporation Shares;\n(cid:120) An exchange or creation of a right of exchange of all or part of another class of shares in\nthe capital of Telesat Corporation into Telesat Corporation Shares;\n(cid:120) A constraining of the issuance, transfer or ownership of the Telesat Corporation Shares or\na change or removal of such constraint;\n70\n(cid:120) A change to the Telesat Corporation Articles;\n(cid:120) The taking of any steps to wind up, dissolve, reorganize or terminate Telesat Corporation;\n(cid:120) A sale, lease, exchange, encumbrance, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially\nall of Telesat Corporation’s assets;\n(cid:120) The removal of a director of Telesat Corporation from office; or\n(cid:120) The taking of action to effect an amalgamation, merger or other combination of Telesat\nCorporation with another person or to consolidate, recapitalize or reorganize Telesat\nCorporation or to continue Telesat Corporation under the laws of another jurisdiction.\nGolden Share Mechanic\nIn order to maintain Telesat Corporation’s status as Canadian-controlled, Telesat Corporation has issued a\n“Golden Share”, which is held and voted by the Trust.\nThe Golden Share is entitled to participate in a particular vote only when (i) in the event of a vote with\nrespect to the election of directors of Telesat Corporation, the number of fully diluted Class B Variable\nVoting Shares is greater than the aggregate number of fully diluted Class A Shares and Class C Fully Voting\nShares, (ii) in the event of a vote with respect to any matter other than the election of directors of Telesat\nCorporation, the number of fully diluted Class B Variable Voting Shares is greater than the aggregate\nnumber of fully diluted Class A Shares and Class C Shares, or (iii) a person who is not Canadian (as defined\nin the Investment Canada Act) beneficially owns or controls more than one-third of the sum of (a) the\nnumber of votes attached to the Telesat Corporation Shares and the Special Voting Shares then outstanding,\nand (b) the Golden Share Canadian Votes, as defined and described below (such person, a “Non-Canadian\nPrincipal Shareholder” and such limitation, the “Non-Canadian Voting Limitation”).\nVoting power is attributed to the Golden Share in two ways. First, the Golden Share is attributed with the\nnumber of votes required in order to ensure that the votes cast by the holders of Class A Shares and Class A\nUnits, Class C Shares and Class C Units and the Golden Share, together, represent a simple majority of the\nvotes cast and entitled to vote (such voting power, the “Golden Share Canadian Votes”). Second, the\nGolden Share is attributed with the number of votes in excess of the Non-Canadian Voting Limitation\nexercised by a Non-Canadian Principal Shareholder.\nThe Golden Share voting rights are voted pro rata consistent with the sum of the aggregate votes of the\nClass A Shares and the Class A Special Voting Share (in each case, excluding any votes cast by or on behalf\nof PSP Investments and/or its affiliates), the votes of each of which are controlled by holders that can\ndemonstrate that they are Canadian. However, if (i) one or more holders other than PSP Investments or its\ncontrolled affiliates holds an aggregate amount of Class A Shares and/or Class A Units exceeding 5% of\nthe aggregate number of outstanding Telesat Corporation Shares and Exchangeable Units taken as a whole\nas of the record date for the applicable vote (each such holder, a “5% Voter”) and (ii) the 5% Voters together\nhold over 50% of the aggregate number of outstanding Class A Shares and Class A Units (in each case,\nexcluding any Class A Shares or Class A Units held by or on behalf of PSP Investments and/or its affiliates)\ntaken as a whole as of the record date for the applicable vote, one-half of the voting rights attached to the\nGolden Share will be voted pro rata consistent with the aggregate votes cast on the applicable matter as\ndescribed in the first sentence of this paragraph and the other half will be voted pro rata consistent with the\naggregate votes cast on the applicable matter by the holders of Class A Shares and the Class A Special\nVoting Share (in each case, excluding any votes cast by or on behalf of the 5% Voters and PSP Investments\nand/or its affiliates).\n71\nVoting of the Special Voting Shares and the Golden Share\nThe holders of Exchangeable Units are indirectly entitled to vote in respect of matters on which holders of\nTelesat Corporation Shares are entitled to vote, including in respect of the election of directors of Telesat\nCorporation, through the Special Voting Shares., Telesat Corporation, Telesat Partnership and TSX Trust\nCompany (in its capacity as “Trustee” of the Trust) entered into the Trust Voting Agreement. This summary\nis qualified in its entirety by reference to that agreement, which is available at the Company’s profile on\nSEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.com and on EDGAR at www.sec.gov.\nThe Special Voting Shares are held by the Trustee, entitling the Trustee to that number of votes on\napplicable matters on which holders of Telesat Corporation Shares are entitled to vote that is equal to the\nnumber of Telesat Corporation Shares into which the Exchangeable Units held by the holders of such\nExchangeable Units on the applicable record date are convertible. Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement,\neach holder of Exchangeable Units has the right to direct Telesat Corporation as to how to instruct the\nTrustee to vote the voting power of the Special Voting Shares corresponding to such holder’s Exchangeable\nUnits. Pursuant to the Trust Voting Agreement, the Trustee is required to cast such votes in accordance\nwith voting instructions provided to it by Telesat Corporation, in its capacity as general partner of Telesat.\nIn the absence of instructions from Telesat Corporation with respect to all or any such votes, the Trustee\nwill not exercise those votes.\nPursuant to the Partnership Agreement and the articles of Telesat Corporation, Telesat Corporation, will\ninstruct the Trust how to vote. Telesat Corporation will also instruct the Trust how to vote the Golden Share.\nIn the absence of instructions from Telesat Corporation with respect to how to vote the Golden Share, the\nTrustee will not vote the Golden Share.\nUnwind of Canadian Structure\nUpon a determination by the Telesat Corporation Board that the structure designed to ensure sufficient\nCanadian voting power and control over Telesat Corporation is no longer required for Telesat Corporation’s\nbusiness, then an Unwind Transaction may be effected. In order for an Unwind Transaction to be\nconsummated, any necessary governmental approvals must have been obtained and the Telesat Corporation\nBoard must not have identified any breach or acceleration issues under material contracts of Telesat\nCorporation. Upon the consummation of an Unwind Transaction, each issued and outstanding Class B\nVariable Voting Share will immediately be converted into one Class A Share automatically and without\nany further act of Telesat Corporation or the holder thereof, and Telesat Corporation will redeem the Golden\nShare and the Special Voting Shares.

See\n“Description of Share Capital and Voting Structure.”\n(3) Red Isle Private Investments Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of PSP Investments and is the legal owner of the Telesat\nCorporation Shares and Units attributed to PSP Investments in the table above.

These are the responsibilities of\nmanagement and the external auditors. The Committee, the Chair and any Members identified as having\naccounting or related financial expertise are members of the Board, appointed to the Committee to provide\nbroad oversight of the financial, risk and control related activities of Telesat, and are specifically not\naccountable or responsible for the day to day operation or performance of such activities. Although the\ndesignation of a Member as having accounting or related financial expertise for disclosure purposes is based\non that individual’s education and experience, which that individual will bring to bear in carrying out their\nduties on the Committee, such designation does not impose on such person any duties, obligations or\nliability that are greater than the duties, obligations and liability imposed on such person as a member of\nthe Committee and Board in the absence of such designation.

Reporting and Evaluation\nThe Chair will report to the Board at each Board meeting on the Committee’s activities since the last Board\nmeeting. The Committee will annually review and approve the Committee’s report for inclusion in the\nCompany’s annual information form. The Secretary will circulate the minutes of each meeting of the\nCommittee to the members of the Board.\nThe Committee shall periodically evaluate its own performance and report to the Nominating & Corporate\nGovernance Committee on such evaluation. The performance of the Committee shall be evaluated by the\nNominating & Corporate Governance Committee as part of its regular evaluation of the Board committees.\n19. Access to Information and Authority to Retain Independent Advisors\nThe Committee shall have unrestricted access to all information regarding Telesat that is necessary or\ndesirable to fulfill its duties and all directors, officers and employees will be directed to cooperate as\nrequested by Members.\nThe Committee has the authority to retain, at Telesat’s expense, independent legal, financial and other\nadvisors, consultants and experts, to assist the Committee in fulfilling its duties and responsibilities,\nincluding sole authority to retain and to approve any such firm’s fees and other retention terms without\nprior approval of the Board. The Committee also has the authority to communicate directly with internal\nand external auditors.\nThe Committee shall discharge its responsibilities and shall assess the information provided by the\nCompany’s management and the external advisers, in accordance with its business judgment. Members are\nentitled to rely, absent knowledge to the contrary, on the integrity of the persons and organizations from\nwhom they receive information, and on the accuracy and completeness of the information provided.\nNothing in this Charter is intended or may be construed as imposing on any member of the Committee or\nthe Board a standard of care or diligence that is in any way more onerous or extensive than the standard to\nwhich the directors are subject under applicable law.\n20. Review of Charter\nThe Committee will review and assess annually the adequacy of this Charter and recommend any proposed\nchanges to the Board for consideration.\nDated: November 4, 2022\nApproved by:

If, however,\nthe potential Change of Control Event referred to in this Section 7.1(3) is not completed\nwithin the time specified (as the same may be extended), then despite this Section 7.1(3)\nor the definition of “Change of Control Event”: (i) any conditional exercise or settlement\nof vested Awards, as applicable, will be deemed to be null, void and of no effect, and such\nconditionally exercised or settled Awards will for all purposes be deemed not to have been\nexercised or settled, and (ii) Awards which vested pursuant to this Section 7.1(3) will be\nreturned by the Participant to the Corporation and reinstated as authorized but unissued\nShares and the original terms applicable to such Awards will be reinstated.\n19\n(4) If the Board has, pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.1(3), permitted the conditional\nexercise or settlement of Awards in connection with a potential Change of Control Event,\nthen the Board will have the power, in its sole discretion, to terminate, immediately\nfollowing actual completion of such Change of Control Event and on such terms as it sees\nfit, any Awards not exercised or settled (including all unvested Awards), as applicable.\nARTICLE 8\nADJUSTMENTS AND AMENDMENTS\nSection 8.1 Adjustment\nIn the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or exchange of Shares, merger,\nconsolidation, spin-off or other distribution (other than normal cash dividends) of the\nCorporation’s assets to Shareholders, or any other change in the Shares, the Board will make such\nproportionate adjustments, if any, as the Board in its discretion, subject to regulatory approval,\nmay deem appropriate to reflect such change (for the purpose of preserving the value of the\nAwards), with respect to (i) the number or kind of Shares or other securities reserved for issuance\npursuant to the Plan; and (ii) the number or kind of Shares or other securities subject to unexercised\nAwards previously granted and the exercise price of those Awards provided, however, that no\nsubstitution or adjustment will obligate the Corporation to issue or sell fractional Shares.

Following any applicable six month delay, all such delayed\npayments will be paid in a single lump sum on the earliest date permitted under\nSection 409A.\n(iii) In the event that the timing of payments in respect of any Award that would\notherwise be considered “nonqualified deferred compensation” subject to\nSection 409A would be accelerated upon the occurrence of (a) a Change of Control\nEvent, no such acceleration shall be permitted unless the event giving rise to the\nChange of Control Event constitutes a “change in the ownership or effective\ncontrol” of the Corporation or a “change in the ownership of a substantial portion\nof the assets” of the Corporation within the meaning of U.S. Treasury Regulation\nSections 1.409A-3(a)(5) and 1.409A-3(i)(5) shall not be treated as a Change of\nControl Event; or (b) a “disability” or “incapacity”, no such acceleration shall be\npermitted unless the “disability” or “incapacity” also satisfies the definition of\n“Disability” pursuant to Section 409A.\n4. Miscellaneous\n(i) If any provision of the Plan, an Award Agreement or any Award issued to a U.S.\nParticipant contravenes Section 409A or could cause the U.S. Participant to incur\nany tax, interest or penalties under Section 409A, the Board may, in its sole\ndiscretion and without the U.S. Participant’s consent, modify such provision to the\nminimum extent necessary to: (a) comply with, or avoid being subject to,\nSection 409A, or to avoid incurring taxes, interest and penalties under\nSection 409A; and/or (b) maintain, to the maximum extent practicable, the original\nintent and economic benefit to the U.S. Participant of the applicable provision\nwithout materially increasing the cost to the Corporation or contravening\nSection 409A.\n(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan or otherwise, the Board shall\nretain the power and authority to amend or modify this Addendum to the extent the\nBoard in its sole discretion deems necessary or advisable to comply with any\nguidance issued under Section 409A. Such amendments may be made without the\napproval of any U.S. Participant.\nA-2\n(iii) The Corporation shall have no obligation to modify the Plan or any Share Unit and\ndoes not guarantee that Share Units will not be subject to taxes, interest and\npenalties under Section 409A. Each Participant is solely responsible and liable for\nthe satisfaction of all taxes and penalties that may be imposed on or in respect of\nsuch Participant in connection with the Plan or any Award granted thereunder\n(including any taxes and penalties under Section 409A), and none of the\nCorporation or any of its Affiliates shall have any obligation to indemnify or\notherwise hold such Participant (or any beneficiary) harmless from any or all of\nsuch taxes or penalties.\nA-3"

Since you have the same optical\nterminal provider, does it look like Lightspeed will be able\nto communicate with the military constellation in the U.S.,\nOperator PWSA?\nThank you. The next question is from Caleb Henry from\nQuilty Space. Please go ahead. Dan Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer\nListen, we've tried really hard to track what the U.S.\nCaleb Henry, Quilty Space government has been saying about interoperability of\nthese—I mean, it's really important for the U.S.\nHi. Thanks, guys. A couple of questions around just government that as part of their proliferated LEO initiative\nLightspeed and also LEO constellations. Telesat had that these various LEO constellations are interoperable. It\nrecently announced a contract, I think it was 127 antennas gives them more resilience. It gives them more flexibility,\nfrom Intellian. I was just curious how far that gets you with greater deterrence value and all of that. That was certainly\nmeeting your gateway needs? And also, kind of what the a consideration for us when Telesat and MDA chose\nstatus is of the gateways for Lightspeed so far? My guess TSAT. I think that we're going to be interoperable.\nis it's probably—that sounds like it's about half the\nantennas you would need, but I wasn't sure. But it goes beyond just the ISLs, like we're also using\nAalyria. We announced that too, I believe we did. We\nannounced Aalyria, which is a software provider that is\nproviding at least some level of the software platform that\nDan Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer\nwe'll be using to manage the traffic of the constellation and\nwhat not. And the U.S. government, I believe, is also\nI'm looking at our CTO Dave Wendling. I think the order\nworking with Aalyria.\nthat we made with Intellian covers about, David, it's like\nsomewhere between 25 and 30 gateways, help me out.\nNot only do the ISLs facilitate interoperability in terms of\nthe constellations being able to pass traffic between each\nother optically, and there are ways to do it with RF as well,\nDave Wendling, Chief Technical Officer\nbut it's also handy to have your systems being able to talk\nto each other to facilitate traffic flows across networks.\nYes. 27 gateways, Dan.\nAnd so anyway, we've been very intentional about trying\nto make Lightspeed interoperable. And certainly, again,\nDan Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer\nwe've already acknowledged that we're talking to Viasat,\nthat's obviously a big consideration for them as well. They\nThat's between 25 and 30. So, 27 gateways, and we're\nenvision a multi-orbit hybrid network.

It's good for the ecosystem at large. It's\nas well. Yes, we're plowing forward.\ngood for Telesat.\nSome of the sites, in Canada at least, will be kind of more\ngreenfield in nature.

Then last question. I know that Canada is obviously There you go.\nnot part of the European Union, but Canada is part of the\nEuropean Space Agency. And given how they're funding\nor co-funding the IRIS² network, I was wondering, is there Walt Piecyk, LightShed\nany chance for overlap or perhaps discussions around\ninteroperability.

Great. Thank you.\npercent reduction. I just want to make sure I heard that\ncorrectly.\nOperator\nDan Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you. The next question is from Walt Piecyk from\nLightShed. Please go ahead.\nYes, that's right. It's 70 percent reduction. And again, from\nthe cash that we've been taking in, and we tend to care\nabout cash around here. That's right.\nDan Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer\nWalter, are you with us? Operator, I think we're going to\nWalt Piecyk, LightShed\nneed to…\nUnderstood. And then--\nWalt Piecyk, LightShed\nDan Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer\nCan you hear me now?\nSorry to interrupt you, Walter, but it will be about a year\nfrom now, half the capacity and paying about a third of\nDan Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer\nwhat they used to pay. The lower cash that we're getting\nreflects that they're taking less capacity and the capacity\nPage 8\nTelesat Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nThursday, November 14, 2024 – 10:30 AM ET\nthey are taking, they're taking at a somewhat lower rate Llook, we've got a great relationship with Viasat.

Over the years, we've\nbought VSAT hubs from them and other things to support\nWalt Piecyk, LightShed R2A broadband business here in Canada. Anyway, we go\nway back.\nGot it. And then the expectation would be at the end of the\nfive years that would effectively go to zero and then in\nterms of their usage and their need to not to do another Walt Piecyk, LightShed\nrenewal. I mean, obviously…\nThen in terms of, I guess, let's call it, L-band and S-band\nspectrum that's out there. Has anyone approached you in\nDan Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer terms of possibly integrating the use of spectrum beyond\nwhat you already planned for Lightspeed prior to launch?\nWell, no, I don't know. Look, I don't know about that. And Is that possible?\nwhat I also don't know is at the end of the first year, a little\nmore than that, it comes up in January of 2026.\nDan Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer\nJohn Flaherty, Vice President, Business Planning and People have approached us wondering if we had scope on\nMarketing our satellites to host those kind of payloads. And the\nanswer is we just don't. We're using every ounce of power\nTwenty twenty-six. and mass and whatnot to support our mission.\nBut certainly, for MDA, look, I mean, it's public now. MDA\nis building those satellites for Globalstar and they're\nDan Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer\nleveraging—I'm looking at Dave, they're leveraging the\nsame Bus.

And like what's\nWalt Piecyk, LightShed\nthe deadline for when an agreement like that would have\nto be put in place for it to actually be part of that?\nThen moving to the LEO and Viasat. I think you said you\naffirmed that's the case about Viasat. Are you affirming\ndiscussions or have you affirmed that they have, in fact,\nalready contracted? Dan Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer\nRight now, for the first 198 satellites we have—the ship\nhas sailed, we're doing that. It will be beyond that.\nDan Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer\nNo, no, no, no. No, affirming discussions. Yes, they said\non their last call, they were engaged in discussions with us Walt Piecyk, LightShed\naround a Lightspeed commitment, and that's all we're\naffirming. Understood. And my last question, I guess, is you talked\nabout, again, in the prepared comments about how the\nenterprise customers, the concept of a LEO constellation\nPage 9\nTelesat Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nThursday, November 14, 2024 – 10:30 AM ET\nwas resonating with them, maybe even a preference. Then of our time, which it did and we are glad for all sorts of\nlater, you talked about maybe at the end of the year reasons to have that in the rear-view mirror now, one of\nproviding some booking numbers.

I mean,\nquarter? we're just spending a ton of time with our partners moving\nthe program forward, spending a lot of time hiring lots of\npeople right now. That takes a lot of time.\nDan Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer\nThen for myself, I'm spending much more of my time\nYes. Llisten, I am always loath to create high expectations working with the customer community. And we're going to\nat home and at work. Look, we're not giving any targets turn our attention a little bit to the Investor Relations\nright now for backlog.

We're out there working—\nwe got regulatory approval to use Nimiq 5, not just for\nbroadcast applications in Canada, but for non-broadcast\nservices as well so that we have some more utility in terms\nWalt Piecyk, LightShed\nof what we can do with that satellite.\nGreat.

Thanks.\nUnidentified Male Speaker\nDaniel Goldberg, President and Chief Executive\nYes, we are currently recognizing revenue at Xplore.

How we thought about the year, certainly, even if this\nrenews, we expect that it will be at a materially lower rate.\nWe’ve captured different outcomes with DISH that\nSean Mahoney, Bank of America explain part of the decline.

We’re giving certainly nothing that—other than the Xplore restructuring\nconsideration to selling a non-core business that we own, that’s going on, we don’t know where that’s going to\nand that could potentially get done in the near term, so it land—there’s nothing about how the second half of the\nwould be impactful for this year.

So, it’s all those kinds of things.\nThen yes, we gave a range, right? I mean, there’s a low Andrew Browne, Chief Financial Officer\nend of the range, there’s a high end of the range.\nAndrew, do you want to add anything to that? If you look at the segmentation breakout we’ve done,\nwhich I think is very useful and very transparent, the\nissues we just mentioned about the OpEx (inaudible) the\nAndrew Browne, Chief Financial Officer revenues in LEO, you can actually see that quite clearly,\nparticularly pertaining to the first three months.\nYes, indeed. If you look at the OpEx, as we know, as Dan\nsaid, we’re hiring people, so our OpEx in LEO, our\ninvestment in LEO from the people perspective is going Sean Mahoney, Bank of America\nto increase. If you look at our segmentation, our\noperating expenses for the six months were about $32.8 Okay, got it. Thank you. Then, just the last one for me,\nmillion, and our guidance we’ve given for OpEx for LEO based on what you’ve said, that non-core asset that you\nis between $80 million to $90 million. So, that will also mentioned, is that in the restricted group, and can you\nkind of play in overall as to what the potential increase in give us any sense for, like, order of magnitude of what\nOpEx in the second half versus first half. So, that plays in you expect to sell that for?

It’s certainly not\nMaybe one other thing that James is pointing out to me material from an EBITDA perspective because, as I\nthat—and now that we’ve broken out our GEO and LEO mentioned, it’s pretty much EBITDA neutral for us.\nnumbers separately, it’s easier for you guys all to see that\nwe recognized revenue in LEO for the first half of the Then, in terms of top line contribution order of magnitude\nyear, and that’s chunky, non-linear kind of revenue.
