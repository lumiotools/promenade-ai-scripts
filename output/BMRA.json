([NASDAQ: BMRA](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/bmra)), a global biomedical technology company, announces they have recently received three patent notices of allowance covering technology and methods for treating Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (“GERD”), Crohn’s Disease, and Ulcerative Colitis using its proprietary inFoods® Technology. These patents apply to countries under the European Patent Organization (“EPO”), including major markets such as Germany, UK, France, Italy, and Spain, as well as over 30 other nations within the EPO.\n\n**Prevalence and Market Potential in Europe**\n\nGERD, Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis represent significant worldwide healthcare challenges across Europe.\n\n**GERD** : The GERD treatment market in Europe exceeds $4 billion annually. Studies indicate that 8.8% to 25.9% of Europeans experience GERD symptoms weekly ([gut.bmj.com](http://gut.bmj.com)), with lifetime risk ranging between 20% and 30%. Recent research has linked long-term use of proton pump inhibitors (“PPIs”)—a common GERD treatment—to serious health risks, including Alzheimer’s disease and kidney damage, underscoring the need for safer, innovative solutions like inFoods®.\n\n**Crohn’s Disease** : The market for Crohn’s Disease treatments in Europe is estimated at $2.5 billion annually ([gminsights.com](http://gminsights.com)). This chronic inflammatory condition requires new approaches to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.\n\n**Ulcerative Colitis** : The European market size of $1.5 billion in 2023 is projected to surpass $1.9 billion by 2028 according to Market Data Forecasts.\n\nThese recent notices of allowance and issuance of patents are a significant milestone in Biomerica's mission to enhance patient care through personalized medical solutions. The Company is currently marketing an inFoods® Technology test to treat IBS sufferers, which is already covered by 15 different patents globally. The issuance of patents in these additional disease states opens the door for Biomerica to complete development of inFoods therapeutic products to treat patients within this broader spectrum of gastrointestinal diseases.\n\n**inFoods ®: A Personalized and Safer Approach to GI Care**\n\nBiomerica’s inFoods® Technology is a diagnostic-guided platform that identifies specific foods in each patient that trigger worsening symptoms in GERD, Crohn’s Disease, and Ulcerative Colitis. This allows healthcare providers to create personalized dietary plans, addressing the root cause of symptoms and reducing reliance on medications with severe side effects.\n\n**For GERD** : inFoods® offers an alternative to proton pump inhibitors (“PPIs”), which are widely prescribed despite their links to dementia, Alzheimer’s, and kidney disease. This non-drug, dietary-based solution is a safer option for millions of patients.\n\n**For Crohn’s and Ulcerative Colitis** : inFoods® supports tailored dietary interventions that work alongside traditional pharmaceutical therapies, potentially reducing symptom severity, healthcare costs, and improving overall quality of life.\n\n“With these European patents, Biomerica can expand its GI offerings to address GERD, Crohn’s, and Ulcerative Colitis,” said Zack Irani, CEO of Biomerica. “inFoods® represents a paradigm shift in gastrointestinal care, offering safer, non-drug solutions that align with the growing demand for personalized medicine. This achievement underscores our dedication to enhancing patient outcomes and creating value for our investors.”\n\nThe issuance of each patent in individual countries, following approval by the respective national patent authorities, depends on the Company completing required steps, such as payment of the necessary patent issuance fees. In some cases, the Company may strategically prioritize certain countries within the EPO or other regions and may not proceed with issuance in every eligible country.

([www.biomerica.com](http://www.biomerica.com/)) is a global biomedical technology company that develops, patents, manufactures and markets advanced diagnostic and therapeutic products used at the point of care (in home and in physicians' offices) and in hospital/clinical laboratories for detection and/or treatment of medical conditions and diseases. The Company's products are designed to enhance the health and well-being of people, while reducing total healthcare costs. Biomerica’s primary focus is on gastrointestinal and inflammatory diseases where the Company has multiple diagnostic and therapeutic products in development.\n\n**About inFoods ®**The Biomerica inFoods® IBS product is designed to allow physicians to identify patient-specific foods (e.g., eggs, broccoli, wheat, potatoes, pork, etc.), that when removed from the diet, may alleviate or improve an individual's IBS symptoms including, but not limited to, constipation, diarrhea, bloating, pain and indigestion. This patented, diagnostic-guided therapy is designed to allow for a patient-specific, guided dietary regimen to improve IBS outcomes. A point-of-care version of the product is being developed to allow physicians to perform the test in-office using a finger stick blood sample, while a clinical lab version of the product is expected to be the first for which the company will seek regulatory approval. A billable CPT code that can be used by both clinical labs and physicians' offices is already available for inFoods® products. Since the inFoods® product is a diagnostic-guided therapy, and not a drug, it has no drug type side effects. An estimated 45 million people in America currently suffer from IBS making it a leading cause for patient doctor visits.\n\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a \"safe harbor\" for forward-looking statements.

(Nasdaq: BMRA), a leading global provider of advanced medical diagnostics, announced that it has been granted an additional 180-day compliance period from the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\"Nasdaq\") to meet the minimum $1.00 per share bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. This extension allows Biomerica until May 5, 2025, to regain compliance.\n\nThis extension was provided because Biomerica currently meets the other continued listing requirement, including the minimum market value of publicly held shares, as well as all other applicable requirements for initial listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price requirement. The 180-day extension was also granted based on the Company’s written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the 180-day compliance period.\n\nTo regain compliance, Biomerica’s common stock must close at or above a $1.00 per share bid price for at least ten consecutive business days prior to May 5, 2025.

The clinical results for improvement in the Abdominal Pain Intensity (API) responder endpoint of >30% reduction in pain, for IBS patients in the treatment diet arm was greater than patients in the placebo diet arm (p-value of 0.0246). The improvement for patients in the treatment arm versus the placebo arm is considered clinically significant and for certain endpoints is similar and, in some cases, better than the current drugs in the market.

(Nasdaq: BMRA), a leading global provider of advanced medical diagnostics, is excited to announce a major enhancement to its inFoods® IBS platform. US consumers can now seamlessly order the inFoods® IBS test directly from [infoodsibs.com](http://infoodsibs.com) and consequently collect a sample in the comfort of their home. As part of this ordering process, a licensed physician remotely authorizes the test, ensuring professional medical oversight, without the need for visiting a doctor’s office.\n\n**A New Era in IBS Treatment with At-Home Convenience**. The InFoods IBS test provides a breakthrough tool for individuals with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) who seek to manage symptoms such as bloating and gastrointestinal pain. The inFoods® IBS test offers a personalized and non-invasive solution, helping patients to manage their condition naturally by identifying foods that may trigger their symptoms. Now, patients can access the inFoods IBS test from the comfort of their home with physician oversight, offering a more convenient pathway to health management helping IBS patients to regain control of their life.\n\nThe inFoods® IBS test is a groundbreaking advancement in the personalized treatment of IBS. Unlike IBS treatments that rely on medications to reduce symptoms, inFoods® IBS identifies specific foods that may trigger the patient´s symptoms allowing for tailored dietary changes that can reduce both bloating and gastrointestinal pain, encouraging patients to manage their condition naturally by avoiding the problematic foods identified by the inFoods IBS test. The test uses a patented technology to detect personal food sensitivities, helping patients achieve significant symptom relief by removing those trigger foods from their diet.\n\nA recent double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical study—conducted at prestigious institutions including Mayo Clinic, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (a Harvard Medical School teaching hospital), the University of Michigan, and Houston Methodist Hospital—demonstrated that the inFoods® IBS test significantly improved key IBS symptoms, such as Abdominal Pain Intensity (API) and bloating. Patients in the treatment group experienced significant symptom improvements but without the side effects commonly associated with drug therapies.\n\n**IBS: A Widespread Condition with High Economic Impact**. Irritable Bowel Syndrome affects 1 in 20 Americans, according to the American College of Gastroenterology, contributing to an estimated $10 billion in annual direct medical costs. Despite the high prevalence and economic burden, many individuals still struggle to find effective treatments due to the complex nature of the disorder.\n\nBiomerica’s InFoods® IBS platform offers new hope for millions of IBS sufferers by providing a tailored approach to treatment that addresses the root causes of their symptoms.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\nNOTE 1: BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nBiomerica, Inc. and its subsidiaries (which includes wholly-owned subsidiaries, Biomerica de Mexico and BioEurope GmbH) is a global biomedical\ntechnology company that develops, patents, manufactures and markets advanced diagnostic and therapeutic products used at the point-of-care (physicians’\noffices and over-the-counter through drugstores and online) and in hospital/clinical laboratories for detection and/or treatment of medical conditions and\ndiseases. Our diagnostic test products utilize immunoassay technology to analyze blood, urine, nasal, or fecal material from patients in the diagnosis of various\ndiseases, food intolerances and other medical complications, and to measure the level of specific hormones, antibodies, antigens, or other substances, which\nmay exist in the human body in extremely small concentrations. Our other existing products are primarily focused on gastrointestinal diseases, food\nintolerances, and certain esoteric tests. Company’s products are designed to enhance the health and well-being of people, while reducing total healthcare costs.\nOur primary focus is the research, development, commercialization and in certain cases regulatory approval, of patented, diagnostic-guided therapy (“DGT”)\nproducts to treat gastrointestinal diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome (“IBS”), and other inflammatory diseases. These products are directed at chronic\ninflammatory illnesses that are widespread, common, and address very large markets. Our inFoods® IBS product uses a simple blood sample and is designed\nto identify patient-specific foods that, when removed from the diet, may alleviate IBS symptoms such as pain, bloating, diarrhea, and constipation. Instead of\nbroad and difficult to manage dietary restrictions, the inFoods® IBS product works by identifying specific foods that may be causing an abnormally high\nimmune response in the patient. A food identified as positive, which is causing an abnormal immune response in the patient, is simply removed from the diet to\nhelp alleviate IBS symptoms.\nOur existing medical diagnostic products are sold worldwide primarily in two markets: a) clinical laboratories and b) point-of-care (physicians’ offices and\nover-the-counter drugstores such as Walmart and CVS Pharmacy). Most of our products are Conformite Europeenne (“CE”) marked and/or sold for diagnostic\nuse where they are registered by each country’s regulatory agency. In addition, some products are cleared for sale in the United States by the FDA.\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements herein have been prepared by management pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United\nStates Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the\npresumption that users of the interim financial information have either read or have access to the audited consolidated financial statements for the latest fiscal\nyear ended May 31, 2024. Accordingly, certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with United\nStates generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In the opinion of\nmanagement, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three months ended August 31, 2024 are\nnot necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2025. For further information, refer to the audited consolidated\nfinancial statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024 included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on\nAugust 28, 2024. Management has evaluated all subsequent events and transactions through the date of filing this report.\nNOTE 2: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nPRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Biomerica, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Biomerica de Mexico and\nBioEurope GmbH. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n5\nACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nIn order to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, we must make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Such estimates and\nassumptions affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various\nother assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different assumptions or conditions may cause actual results to differ materially\nfrom these estimates. We monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements on an ongoing basis. We believe our estimates\nand assumptions are reasonable under the current conditions; however, actual results may differ from these estimates under different future conditions.\nWe believe that the estimates and assumptions that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, in that they require\nsubjective or complex judgments, form the basis for the accounting policies deemed to be most critical to us. These relate to revenue recognition, bad debts,\ninventory overhead application, inventory reserves, lease liabilities, right-of-use assets and share based compensation. We believe estimates and assumptions\nrelated to these critical accounting policies are appropriate under the circumstances; however, should future events or occurrences result in unanticipated\nconsequences, there could be a material impact on our future financial conditions or results of operations. We suggest that our significant accounting policies be\nread in conjunction with this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nMARKETS AND METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION\nThe majority of the Company’s revenues come from the sale of products it manufactures in the U.S. and Mexico, with certain raw materials sourced from Asia\nand other regions. The Company’s diagnostic business serves a diverse customer base that includes both domestic and international distributors, as well as\nhospitals, clinical laboratories, medical research institutions, pharmaceutical companies, drugstores, wholesalers, physicians’ offices, and e-commerce\ncustomers. A significant portion of the Company’s revenues are derived from international sales.\nThe Company employs a Director of Sales and Marketing for Europe and South America, based in Germany, who has over 20 years of experience in\ndiagnostics and life sciences. This individual’s international business experience and multilingual capabilities have facilitated strong relationships across\nEurope, Eastern Europe, Middle East, Latin America, Canada, and the U.S. The Company expects continued growth through the addition of new distributors\nand product lines in these regions.\nThe Company markets its diagnostic products through distributors, advertising in medical and trade journals, trade show exhibitions, direct mailings, and its\ninternal sales team. The two primary markets the Company targets are clinical laboratories and point-of-care testing, including physicians’ offices and over-the-\ncounter drug stores.\nLIQUIDITY AND GOING CONCERN\nThe Company has incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations and has an accumulated deficit of approximately $49.5 million as of August 31,\n2024. As of August 31, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2,820,000 and working capital of approximately $4,294,000.\nOn July 21, 2020, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) a Form S-3 shelf registration statement and base prospectus\nwhich was declared effective by the SEC on September 30, 2020. The 2020 Shelf Registration Statement registered common shares that could be issued by the\nCompany in a maximum aggregate amount of up to $90,000,000.\nOn January 22, 2021, the Company filed a prospectus supplement to the base prospectus included in a registration statement filed with the SEC on July 21,\n2020, and declared effective by the SEC on September 30, 2020, for purposes of selling up to $15,000,000 in “at-the-market” offerings, as defined in Rule 415\npromulgated under the Securities Act (the “2021 ATM Offering”).\nDuring the year ended May 31, 2023, the Company sold 573,889 shares of its common stock at prices ranging from $3.15 to $4.26 pursuant to the 2021 ATM\nOffering, which resulted in gross proceeds of approximately $2,014,000 and net proceeds to the Company of $1,961,000, after deducting commissions for each\nsale and legal, accounting, and other fees related to offering in the amount of $53,000.\nOn March 7, 2023, the Company sold 3,333,333 shares of common stock in a firm commitment public offering at a gross sales price of $2.40 per share, with\nnet total proceeds, after deducting issuance fees and expenses of $700,000, of approximately $7,300,000. As a result of this public offering, the Company\nterminated the 2021 ATM Offering.\nAs part of our financing plan, on September 28, 2023, we filed a “shelf” registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which was declared effective on\nSeptember 29, 2023, allowing the Company to issue up to $20,000,000 in common shares. Under this registration statement, shares of our common stock may\nbe sold from time to time for up to three years from the filing date. On May 10, 2024, the Company filed a prospectus supplement with the SEC to facilitate the\nsale of up to $5,500,000 in common stock through ATM offerings, as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act. As part of this transaction, the Company\nincurred $81,000 in deferred offering costs. The amount of capital that we can raise under the ATM offering is highly dependent upon the trading volume and\nthe trading price of our stock. The average trading volume of our stock over the last three full calendar months is 83,068 shares per day and the high and low\ntrading price of our stock during the same period of time was $0.59 and $0.28, respectively. If our stock continues to trade at low volumes and price, the\namount of capital that we can raise under the ATM offering will be constrained.\nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, sales and marketing activities,\nclinical studies and product development, acquisitions of assets, businesses, companies, or securities, capital expenditures, and working capital needs.\n6\nManagement assesses whether the Company has sufficient liquidity to fund its costs for the next twelve months from each financial statement issuance date to\ndetermine if there is a substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern over\nthe next twelve months is influenced by several factors, including:\n● Our need and ability to generate additional revenue from international opportunities and our new product launches;\n● Our need to access the capital and debt markets to meet current obligations and fund operations;\n● Our capacity to manage operating expenses and maintain gross margins as we grow; and\n● Our ability to retain key employees and maintain critical operations with a substantially reduced workforce.\nManagement has analyzed the Company’s cash flow requirements through November 2025 and beyond. Based on this analysis, we believe our current cash and\ncash equivalents are insufficient to meet our operating cash requirements and strategic growth objectives for the next twelve months.\nTo address our capital needs and sustain operations beyond the next year, we are actively pursuing strategies to increase sales, reduce expenses, sell non-core\nassets, seek additional financing through debt or equity, and seek other strategic alternatives. While we are committed to these plans, there is no assurance that\nthese efforts will be successful or sufficient to meet our capital requirements.\nAs part of our efforts to reduce costs, we have initiated significant cost-cutting measures to extend our cash runway and work towards increasing revenues to\ncover overhead costs. These measures include a workforce reduction of nearly 15% in July 2024 and a substantial reduction in other operating expenses.\nThese factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Our future viability depends on the successful execution of\nour strategic plans, securing additional financing, and achieving profitable operations.\nThe Company’s consolidated financial statements as of August 31, 2024 were prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets\nand the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.\nCONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK\nThe Company maintains cash balances at certain financial institutions in excess of amounts insured by federal agencies. From time to time, the Company has\nuninsured balances. The Company does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risks.\nThe Company provides credit in the normal course of business to customers throughout the United States and in foreign markets. The Company performs\nongoing credit evaluations of its customers and requires accelerated prepayment in some circumstances.\nConsolidated net sales were approximately $1,807,000 for the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to $1,713,000 for the same period in 2023. For\nthe three months ended August 31, 2024, the Company had two key customers located in North America and Asia, respectively, who collectively accounted for\n55% of net sales. For the three months ended August 31, 2023, the Company had one key customer located in a Asia, accounting for 59% of net sales.\nAs of August 31, 2024, and May 31, 2024, total gross receivables were approximately $1,582,000 and $966,000, respectively. On these dates, the Company\nhad two and four key customers, respectively, located in Asia and Europe. These customers accounted for 67% and 64% of the gross accounts receivable,\nrespectively.\nFor the three months ended August 31, 2024, and 2023, two and one key vendors accounted for 34% and 12% of the purchases of raw materials, respectively.\nAs of August 31, 2024, and May 31, 2024, one and two key vendors represented 24% and 69% of the Company’s accounts payable, respectively.\nCASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\nCash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and money market accounts with original maturities of less than three months.\nACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET\nThe Company extends unsecured credit to its customers on a regular basis. International accounts are usually required to prepay until they establish a history\nwith the Company and at that time, they are extended credit at levels. Initial credit levels for individual distributors are approved by designated officers and\nmanagers of the Company based on various criteria. All increases in credit limits are also approved by designated upper-level management.\nThe Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (codified as Accounting Standards\nCodification (“ASC”) 326) on June 1, 2023. ASC 326 adds to U.S. GAAP the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model, a measurement model based on\nexpected losses rather than incurred losses. Prior to the adoption of ASC 326, the Company evaluated receivables on a quarterly basis and adjusted the\nallowance for doubtful accounts accordingly. Balances over 90 days old were usually reserved unless collection was reasonably assured. Under the application\nof ASC 326, the Company’s historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, as well as current economic and\nbusiness conditions, and anticipated future economic events that may impact collectability. In developing its expected credit loss estimate, the Company\nevaluated the appropriate grouping of financial assets based upon its evaluation of risk characteristics, including consideration of the types of products and\nservices sold. Account balances are written off against the allowance for expected credit losses after all means of collection have been exhausted and the\npotential for recovery is considered remote.\nOccasionally, certain long-standing customers who routinely place large orders will have unusually large receivable balances relative to the total gross\nreceivables. Management monitors the payments for these large balances closely and very often requires payment of existing invoices before shipping new\nsales orders.\nAs of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, the Company has established a reserve of approximately $31,000 and $19,000 respectively, for credit losses.\nPREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER\nThe Company occasionally prepays for items such as inventory, insurance, and other items. These items are reported as prepaid expenses and other, until either\nthe inventory is physically received, or the insurance and other items are expensed.\nAs of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, the prepaids were approximately $132,000 and $238,000, respectively, comprised of prepayments to insurance and\nvarious other suppliers.\n7\nINVENTORIES, NET\nThe Company values inventory at the lower of cost (determined using a combination of specific lot identification and the first-in, first-out methods) or net\nrealizable value. Management periodically reviews inventory for excess quantities and obsolescence. Management evaluates quantities on hand, physical\ncondition, and technical functionality as these characteristics may be impacted by anticipated customer demand for current products and new product\nintroductions. The reserve is adjusted based on such evaluation, with a corresponding provision included in cost of sales. Abnormal amounts of idle facility\nexpenses, freight, handling costs and wasted material are recognized as current period charges and the allocation of fixed production overhead is based on the\nnormal capacity of the production facilities.\nNet inventories are approximately the following:\nAugust 31, 2024 May 31, 2024\nRaw materials $ 1,442,000 $ 1,519,000\nWork in progress 756,000 1,145,000\nFinished products 216,000 179,000\nTotal gross inventory 2,414,000 2,843,000\nInventory reserves (472,000) (467,000)\nNet inventory $ 1,942,000 $ 2,376,000\nReserves for inventory obsolescence are recorded as necessary to reduce obsolete inventory to estimated net realizable value or to specifically reserve for\nobsolete inventory. As of August 31, 2024, and May 31, 2024, inventory reserves were approximately $472,000 and $467,000, respectively.\nPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for additions and major improvements are capitalized. Repairs and maintenance costs are charged to\noperations as incurred. When property and equipment are sold, retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization\nare removed from the accounts, and gains or losses from sales, retirements and dispositions are credited or charged to income.\nDepreciation and amortization are provided over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, ranging from 5 to 10 years, using the straight-line method.\nLeasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the asset or the term of the lease. Depreciation and amortization expense\non property and equipment was approximately $17,000 and $16,000 for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nINTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET\nIntangible assets include trademarks, product rights, technology rights and patents, and are accounted for based on ASC 350 Intangibles – Goodwill and Other,\nIn that regard, intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment or more frequently if events or\nchanges in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.\nIntangible assets are being amortized using the straight-line method over the useful life, not to exceed 18 years for marketing and distribution rights, 10 years\nfor purchased technology use rights, and patents are based on their individual useful lives which average around 15 years. Amortization expense was\napproximately $4,000 and $5,000 for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe Company assesses the recoverability of these intangible assets by determining whether the amortization of the asset’s balance over its remaining life can be\nrecovered through projected undiscounted future cash flows. The Company uses a qualitative assessment to determine whether there is any impairment. During\nthe three months ended August 31, 2024, and 2023, there were no impairment adjustments.\nINVESTMENTS\nThe Company has made investments in a privately held Polish distributor, which is primarily engaged in distributing medical products and devices, including\nthe distribution of the products sold by the Company. The Company invested approximately $165,000 into the Polish distributor and owns approximately 6%\nof the investee.\nEquity holdings in nonmarketable unconsolidated entities in which the Company is not able to exercise significant influence (“Cost Method Holdings”) are\naccounted for at the Company’s initial cost, minus any impairment (if any), plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly\ntransactions for the identical or a similar holding or security of the same issuer. Dividends received are recorded as other income.\n8\nThe Company assesses its equity holdings for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an equity holding\nmay not be recoverable. Management reviewed the underlying net assets of the Company’s equity method holding as of August 31, 2024 and determined that\nthe Company’s proportionate economic interest in the entity indicates that the equity holding was not impaired. There were no observable price changes in\norderly transactions for identical or a similar holding or security of the Company’s Cost Method Holdings during the period ended August 31, 2024.\nSHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Company follows the guidance of ASC 718, Share-based Compensation, which requires the use of the fair-value based method to determine compensation\nfor all arrangements under which employees and others receive shares of stock or equity instruments (options). The fair value of each option award is estimated\non the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model that uses assumptions for expected volatility, expected dividends, expected forfeiture rate,\nexpected term, and the risk-free interest rate. The Company has not paid dividends historically and does not expect to pay them in the foreseeable future.\nExpected volatilities are based on weighted averages of the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock estimated over the expected term of the\noptions. The expected forfeiture rate is based on historical forfeitures experienced. The expected term of options granted is derived using the “simplified\nmethod” which computes expected term as the average of the sum of the vesting term plus the contract term as historically the Company had limited exercise\nactivity surrounding its options. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the period of the expected term.\nThe grant date fair value of the award is recognized under the straight-line attribution method.\nThe Company expensed approximately $77,000 and $170,000 of share-based compensation during the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.\nThe following summary presents the options granted, exercised, expired, canceled and outstanding for the three months ended August 31, 2024:\nWeighted Average\nOption Shares Exercise Price\nOptions Outstanding at May 31, 2024 3,479,616 $ 2.53\nGranted 67,000 0.44\nCancelled or expired (240,500) 2.03\nOptions Outstanding at August 31, 2024 3,306,116 $ 2.53\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nThe Company has various contracts with customers, and these contracts specify the recognition of revenue based on the nature of the transaction.\nRevenues from product sales are recognized at the time the product is shipped, customarily FOB shipping point, which is when the transfer of control of goods\nhas occurred and title passes. This applies to clinical lab products sold to domestic and international distributors, including hospitals, clinical laboratories,\nmedical research institutions, medical schools, and pharmaceutical companies. OTC products are sold directly to drug stores, e-commerce customers, and\ndistributors, while physicians’ office products are sold to physicians and distributors. The Company does not allow returns except in cases of defective\nmerchandise, and therefore, does not establish an allowance for returns. Additionally, the Company has contracts with customers that provide purchase\ndiscounts contingent on achieving specified sales volumes. These contracts are regularly evaluated, and the Company does not anticipate granting any\ndiscounts through the end of the contract period.\nFurthermore, the Company offers margin guarantees to certain retail drug store customers to ensure a minimum profit margin. Should pricing adjustments\ncause these margins to fall below the agreed-upon thresholds, the Company is committed to compensating for the shortfall. This arrangement introduces\nvariable consideration into our revenue recognition process. These considerations are estimated monthly based on actual sales and potential price reductions,\nensuring accurate and compliant revenue reporting.\nFor diagnostic testing services sold directly to patients or physician offices that require processing by a third-party CLIA-certified lab, we recognize revenue\nonce the lab has completed the test results.\nFor services related to contract manufacturing, revenue is recognized when the service has been performed. Services for some contract work are invoiced and\nrecognized as the project progresses.\nAs of August 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $85,000 in advances from domestic customers, which are prepayments on orders for future shipments.\n9\nDisaggregation of revenue:\nThe following is a breakdown of revenues according to markets to which the products are sold:\nThree Months Ended August 31,\n2024 2023\nClinical lab $ 1,278,000 $ 1,289,000\nOver-the-counter 187,000 303,000\nContract manufacturing 339,000 117,000\nPhysician’s office 3,000 4,000\nTotal $ 1,807,000 $ 1,713,000\nSee Note 4 for additional information regarding revenue concentrations.\nSHIPPING AND HANDLING FEES\nThe Company includes shipping and handling fees billed to customers in net sales.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. The Company expensed approximately $297,000 and $472,000 of research and development costs\nduring the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nINCOME TAXES\nThe Company had income tax expense for the three months ended August 31, 2024 of approximately $4,000, consisting of state minimum and foreign\nmiscellaneous taxes. During the three months ended August 31, 2024, the Company had a net operating loss (“NOL”) that generated deferred tax assets for\nNOL carryforwards. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statements and income tax\ncarrying values using tax rates in effect for the years such differences are expected to reverse. Due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to generate future\ntaxable income and consequently realize such deferred income tax assets, the Company has determined that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax\nassets will not be realized. Accordingly, the Company has established a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets as of August 31, 2024.\nThe Company’s policy is to recognize any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. For the three\nmonths ended August 31, 2024, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.\nADVERTISING COSTS\nThe Company reports the cost of advertising as expense in the period in which those costs are incurred. Advertising costs were approximately $14,000 and\n$30,000 for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION\nThe subsidiary located in Mexico operates primarily using the Mexican peso. The subsidiary located in Germany operates primarily using the U.S. dollar, with\nan immaterial amount of transactions occurring using the Euro. Accordingly, assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated using exchange rates in\neffect at the end of the period, and revenues and costs are translated using average exchange rates for the period. The resulting translation adjustments to assets\nand liabilities are presented as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. There are no foreign currency transactions that are included in\nthe condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023.\nRIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITY\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an accounting standard update which requires lessees to recognize most leases\non the balance sheet with a corresponding right-of-use asset. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and\nlease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease\ncommencement date based on the estimated present value of fixed lease payments over the lease term. Leases are classified as financing or operating which\nwill drive the expense recognition pattern. The Company has elected to exclude short-term leases. The Company leases office space and copy machines, all of\nwhich are operating leases. Most leases include the option to renew and the exercise of the renewal options is at the Company’s sole discretion. Options to\nextend or terminate a lease are considered in the lease term to the extent that the option is reasonably certain of exercise. The leases do not include the options\nto purchase the leased property. The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term.\n10\nNET LOSS PER SHARE\nBasic loss per share is computed as net loss divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted loss per share\nreflects the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through stock options, warrants and other convertible securities using the treasury\nstock method. The total amount of anti-dilutive stock options not included in the loss per share calculation at August 31, 2024 and 2023 was 3,306,116 and\n2,363,116, respectively.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRecent ASU’s issued by the FASB and guidance issued by the SEC did not, or are not believed by the management to, have a material effect on the Company’s\npresent or future consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2023-07, “Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.” The ASU\nincludes enhanced disclosure requirements, primarily related to significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to and used by the chief operating\ndecision maker (“CODM”). The amendments are to be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. ASU 2023-07 is\neffective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect of adopting this\npronouncement on our financial statements and disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures”. The ASU includes enhanced\ndisclosure requirements, primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. The amendments are to be applied prospectively in the\nfinancial statements. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating\nthe effect of adopting this pronouncement on our financial statements and disclosures.\nNOTE 3: SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nOn September 28, 2023, the Company filed a “shelf” registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which was declared effective on September 29, 2023,\nallowing the Company to issue up to $20,000,000 in common shares. Under this registration statement, shares of our common stock may be sold from time to\ntime for up to three years from the filing date. On May 10, 2024, the Company filed a prospectus supplement with the SEC to facilitate the sale of up to\n$5,500,000 in common stock through ATM offerings, as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act. No shares of common stock or other equity securities of\nthe Company were sold under the shelf registration statement during the three months ended August 31, 2024.\nNOTE 4: GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION\nThe Company operates as one segment. Geographic information regarding net sales is approximately as follows:\nThree Months Ended August 31,\n2024 2023\nRevenues from sales to unaffiliated customers:\nAsia $ 817,000 $ 1,026,000\nEurope 470,000 327,000\nNorth America 427,000 355,000\nMiddle East 90,000 -\nSouth America 3,000 5,000\nTotal $ 1,807,000 $ 1,713,000\nAs of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, approximately $575,000 and $537,000 of Biomerica’s gross inventory was located in Mexicali, Mexico, respectively.\nAs of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, approximately $13,000 and $14,000 of Biomerica’s property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation and\namortization, was located in Mexicali, Mexico, respectively.\n11\nNOTE 5: LEASES\nThe Company leases facilities in Irvine, California and Mexicali, Mexico.\nAs of August 31, 2024, the Company had approximately 22,000 square feet of floor space at its corporate headquarters at 17571 Von Karman Avenue in Irvine,\nCalifornia. The lease for its headquarters expires in August 2026. The Company has the option to extend the lease for an additional five-year term. The\nCompany made a security deposit of approximately $22,000.\nIn November 2016, the Company’s Mexican subsidiary, Biomerica de Mexico, entered into a 10-year lease for approximately 8,100 square feet of\nmanufacturing space. The Company has one 10-year option to renew at the end of the initial lease period. Biomerica de Mexico also leases a smaller unit on a\nmonth-to-month basis for use in the Company’s manufacturing process.\nIn addition, the Company leases a small office in Lindau, Germany on a month-to-month basis, as headquarters for BioEurope GmbH, its Germany subsidiary.\nFor purposes of determining straight-line rent expense, the lease term is calculated from the date the Company first takes possession of the facility, including\nany periods of free rent and any renewal options periods that the Company is reasonably certain of exercising. The Company’s office and equipment leases\ngenerally have contractually specified minimum rent and annual rent increases are included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and related lease\nliabilities. Additionally, under these lease arrangements, the Company may be required to pay directly, or reimburse the lessors, for some maintenance and\noperating costs. Such amounts are generally variable and therefore not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and related lease liabilities but are\ninstead recognized as variable lease expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss when they are incurred.\nThe following table presents information on our operating leases for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended August 31,\n2024 2023\nOperating lease cost $ 88,000 $ 88,000\nVariable lease cost 2,000 3,000\nShort-term lease cost 2,000 5,000\nTotal lease cost $ 92,000 $ 96,000\nThe approximate maturity of lease liabilities as of August 31, 2024 are as follows:\nYear Ending May 31:\nOperating Leases\n2025 (excluding the three months ended August 31, 2024) $ 368,000\n2026 378,000\n2027 7,000\nTotal minimum future lease payments 753,000\nLess: imputed interest 46,000\nTotal operating lease liabilities $ 707,000\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s other supplemental lease information for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended August 31,\n2024 2023\nCash paid for operating lease liabilities $ 90,000 $ 87,000\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years) 2.02 3.02\nWeighted-average discount rate 6.50% 6.50%\nThe Company also has various insignificant leases for office equipment.\nNOTE 6: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLITIGATION\nThe Company is, from time to time, involved in legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. While the amounts claimed\nmay be substantial, the ultimate liability cannot presently be determined because of considerable uncertainties that exist. Therefore, it is possible the outcome\nof such legal proceedings, claims, and litigation could have a material effect on quarterly or annual operating results or cash flows when resolved in a future\nperiod. However, based on facts currently available, management believes such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nThere were no legal proceedings pending as of August 31, 2024.\nNOTE 7: SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nNote noted.\n12\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying\nnotes thereto included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report and the audited consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year\nended May 31, 2024 (our 2024 Annual Report). This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that are based on our management’s current\nbeliefs and assumptions, which statements are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. Our actual results of operations may differ materially from those\nexpressed or implied by these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed in “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A\nof our 2024 Annual Report.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a global biomedical technology company that develops, patents, manufactures and markets advanced diagnostic and therapeutic products. Our\ndiagnostic test kits are used to analyze blood, urine, nasal or fecal material from patients in the diagnosis of various diseases, food intolerances and other\nmedical complications . They can also be used to measure or detect the presence and levels of specific bacteria, hormones, antibodies, antigens and other\nsubstances, which may exist in the human body in extremely small concentrations. Our products are designed to enhance the health and well-being of people,\nwhile reducing total healthcare costs.\nOur extensive range of medical diagnostic products is sold worldwide, primarily in two markets: clinical laboratories and point-of-care settings, including\nphysicians’ offices and over-the-counter sales at major retailers such as Walmart, CVS Pharmacy, and Amazon. Most of our products are Conformite\nEuropeenne (“CE”) marked and/or registered with regulatory agencies in various countries for diagnostic use, with several also cleared by the FDA for sale in\nthe United States.\nTechnological advances in medical diagnostics have enabled diagnostic tests to be performed not only in clinical laboratories but also at home and at the point-\nof-care in physicians’ offices. One of our key objectives has been to develop and market rapid diagnostic tests that are accurate, utilize easily obtained patient\nspecimens, and are simple to perform without the need for complex instrumentation. Our home use (over-the-counter) and professional use (physicians’ office,\nclinics, etc.) rapid diagnostic test products help manage existing medical conditions and may save lives through early detection and diagnosis of specific\ndiseases. Traditionally, such tests required the expertise of medical technologists and sophisticated equipment, with results often not available for days. We\nbelieve our rapid point-of-care tests, when properly used, can be as accurate as laboratory tests. Our products require limited to no instrumentation, deliver\nreliable results in minutes, and can be performed with confidence at home or in a physician’s office.\nWe invest resources in the research and development of new products designed to diagnose and, in some cases, treat several major medical diseases. These\nproducts are either internally developed or licensed from others. Our experienced and highly trained technical personnel, including Ph.D. holders and other\nscientists, are dedicated to developing new products and managing technology transfer activities. Our technical staff, many of whom have extensive experience\nfrom previous employment at large diagnostic manufacturing companies, bring a wealth of industry knowledge. Additionally, we rely on our Scientific\nAdvisory Board, comprised of leading medical doctors and clinicians, to guide our clinical studies and product development efforts.\nA key outcome from our recent research and development efforts is our patented diagnostic-guided therapy (“DGT”) product, developed on the inFoods®\ntechnology platform. This innovative product is designed to treat gastrointestinal conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (“IBS”) and other inflammatory\ndiseases. The DGT product targets chronic inflammatory illnesses that are widespread and prevalent in large markets. We have launched the inFoods® IBS\nproduct, which leverages this patented technology.\nThe inFoods® IBS product utilizes a simple blood test to identify patient-specific foods that, when eliminated from the diet, may alleviate IBS symptoms such\nas pain, bloating, diarrhea, cramping, and constipation. Unlike broad and difficult-to-manage dietary restrictions, the inFoods® IBS product pinpoints a\npatient’s heightened immunoreactivity to specific foods known to frequently trigger IBS symptoms. By removing the foods identified as problematic, patients\ncan achieve relief from their IBS symptoms.\n13\nWe launched our inFoods® product across numerous gastroenterology (“GI”) physician groups in various states and regions, including collaboration with one\nof the largest GI groups in the U.S. Feedback from GI specialty physicians have generally been positive, and we are actively expanding our network by\nonboarding additional physician practices. These GI practices are beginning to prescribe inFoods® IBS to their patients. Our dedicated sales team is deepening\nrelationships within the GI segment and strategically targeting opportunities to introduce inFoods® to other medical specialties. By leveraging their expertise\nand building strong partnerships, our sales team is now working to engage with key physician groups outside the GI field such as integrated health practices\nand primary-care general practitioners. These efforts aim to broaden our market reach and enhance the overall adoption of inFoods® across various healthcare\nsectors and to capitalize on the distinct advantages of inFoods® for a strong foundation of meaningful growth in the future. We are also continuing to evaluate\ndistribution, partnership and licensing opportunities with U.S. and multinational companies, which have the potential to significantly aid in the\ncommercialization and accelerated growth of inFoods® products both domestically and internationally.\nBeyond the inFoods® product line, the Company has achieved a significant milestone with the development of hp+detect™, a diagnostic test designed to\ndetect Helicobacter pylori (“H. pylori”) bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. H. pylori is a prevalent infection, affecting approximately 35% of the U.S.\npopulation and 45% of the population in Europe’s largest countries. This bacterium is the strongest known risk factor for gastric cancer, which remains one of\nthe leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide.\nThe hp+detect™ test offers physicians and medical centers a reliable tool for diagnosing H. pylori infections and monitoring treatment efficacy. The test is\nmarketed directly to laboratories, where patient samples are processed to provide timely and accurate diagnoses. To support the widespread adoption and\ndistribution of hp+detect™, the Company is actively engaging with large reference laboratories, aiming to improve patient outcomes through early detection\nand effective treatment of H. pylori infections.\nDue to the slower-than-expected launch of the Company’s key products, inFoods® IBS and hp+detect™, the Company has initiated significant cost-cutting\nmeasures to extend its cash runway and work towards increasing revenues to cover overhead costs. These measures include a workforce reduction of nearly\n15% during this fiscal quarter, which incurred one-time labor costs such as severance, impacting typical cost trends and margins. In addition, the Company is\nactively exploring strategic opportunities to enhance and create shareholder value.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales and Cost of Sales\nThe following is a breakdown of revenues according to markets to which the products are sold:\nThree Months Ended Increase (Decrease)\nAugust 31, 2024 August 31, 2023 $ %\nClinical lab $ 1,278,000 $ 1,289,000 $ (11,000) -1%\nOver-the-counter 187,000 303,000 (116,000) -38%\nContract manufacturing 339,000 117,000 222,000 190%\nPhysician’s office 3,000 4,000 (1,000) -25%\nNet Sales $ 1,807,000 $ 1,713,000 $ 94,000 5%\nFor the three months ended August 31, 2024, consolidated net sales reached approximately $1,807,000, compared to $1,713,000 for the same period in 2023,\nrepresenting an increase of $94,000, or 5%. This growth was largely driven by a $222,000 increase in higher demand from new and existing customers as well\nas new contract manufacturing agreements. However, over-the-counter (“OTC”) sales in the retail market declined by $116,000. In 2023, OTC sales benefited\nfrom the rollout of our products with CVS, which included large upfront orders. Additionally, this quarter’s performance was impacted by timing delays in\nclinical lab orders from our distributor in Asia.\nFor the three months ended August 31, 2024, consolidated cost of sales amounted to approximately $1,518,000, or 84% of net sales, compared to $1,301,000,\nor 76% of net sales, for the same period in 2023, representing an increase of $217,000, or 17%. A key driver of the cost increase was directly correlated to the\ngrowth in contract manufacturing sales. Additionally, direct labor costs were significantly impacted by one-time severance expenses related to the reduction in\nforce (“RIF”) executed in July, which elevated labor costs and negatively impacted gross margins. Gross margin was negatively impacted by 12% by the one-\ntime RIF expenses within the fiscal quarter. Excluding these RIF-related costs, gross margins are consistent with the prior period.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following is a summary of operating expenses:\nThree Months Ended August 31,\n2024 2023 Increase (Decrease)\nAs a % of As a % of\nOperating Expense Total Revenues Operating Expense Total Revenues $ %\nSelling, General and Administrative\nExpenses $ 1,360,000 75% $ 1,172,000 68% $ 188,000 16%\nResearch and Development $ 297,000 16% $ 472,000 28% $ (175,000) -37%\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nFor the three months ended August 31, 2024, consolidated selling, general, and administrative expenses were approximately $1,360,000, compared to\n$1,172,000 for the same period in 2023, reflecting an increase of $188,000, or 16%. This increase was primarily driven by one-time severance expenses related\nto the July RIF and introduction of a sales force, which did not exist in the prior year. The new sales team added $146,000 in additional costs compared to the\nprior period. Legal expenses also rose by $64,000, as the prior year benefited from a one-time discount on legal fees related to settlement work. Excluding this\ndiscount, legal spending would have been consistent with historical levels.\nResearch and Development\nFor the three months ended August 31, 2024, consolidated research and development (“R&D”) expenses totaled approximately $297,000, representing a\ndecrease of 37% from $472,000 in the same period of 2023. This $175,000 reduction was primarily driven by an $86,000 decline in R&D wages resulting from\nthe one-time severance expenses associated with the RIF executed in July. In line with the Company’s strategic initiatives for cost-cutting measures, several\nclinical trials were reduced, resulting in decreased expenditures. Additionally, with the commercialization of inFoods® IBS, there has been a deliberate\nreduction in R&D allocations to this area, contributing to an overall decrease of $80,000 in related expenses.\nInterest and Dividend Income\nFor the three months ended August 31, 2024, interest and dividend income totaled approximately $56,000, compared to $123,000 for the corresponding period\nin 2023, representing a decrease of $67,000, or 54%. This reduction was primarily attributable to lower market interest rates affecting our lower cash balances,\nwhich had decreased by August 31, 2024.\n14\nLIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND GOING CONCERN\nThe following are the principal sources of liquidity:\nAugust 31, 2024 May 31, 2024\nCash and cash equivalents $ 2,820,000 $ 4,170,000\nWorking capital including cash and cash equivalents $ 4,294,000 $ 5,527,000\nAs of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2,820,000 and $4,170,000, respectively. As of August\n31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, the Company had working capital of approximately $4,294,000 and $5,527,000, respectively.\nThe Company’s ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months is influenced by several factors, including:\n● Our need and ability to generate additional revenue from international opportunities and our new product launches;\n● Our need to access the capital and debt markets to meet current obligations and fund operations;\n● Our capacity to manage operating expenses and maintain gross margins as we grow; and\n● Our ability to retain key employees and maintain critical operations with a substantially reduced workforce.\nManagement has analyzed the Company’s cash flow requirements through November 2025 and beyond. Based on this analysis, we believe our current cash and\ncash equivalents are insufficient to meet our operating cash requirements and strategic growth objectives for the next twelve months.\nTo address our capital needs and sustain operations beyond the next year, we are actively pursuing strategies to increase sales, reduce expenses, sell non-core\nassets, seek additional financing through debt or equity, and seek other strategic alternatives. While we are committed to these plans, there is no assurance that\nthese efforts will be successful or sufficient to meet our capital requirements.\nAs part of our efforts to reduce costs, we have initiated significant cost-cutting measures to extend our cash runway and work towards increasing revenues to\ncover overhead costs. These measures include a workforce reduction of nearly 15% in July 2024 and a substantial reduction in other operating expenses.\nAs part of our financing plan, on September 28, 2023, we filed a “shelf” registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(“SEC”), which was declared effective on September 29, 2023, allowing us to issue up to $20,000,000 in common shares. Under this registration statement,\nshares of our common stock may be sold from time to time for up to three years from the filing date. On May 10, 2024, the we filed a prospectus supplement\nwith the SEC to facilitate the sale of up to $5,500,000 in common stock through at-the-market (“ATM”) offerings, as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities\nAct. As part of this transaction, we incurred $81,000 in deferred offering costs. The amount of capital that we can raise under the ATM offering is highly\ndependent upon the trading volume and the trading price of our stock. The average trading volume of our stock over the last three full calendar months is\napproximately 83,068 shares per day and the high and low trading price of our stock during the same period of time was $0.59 and $0.28, respectively. If our\nstock continues to trade at low volumes and price, the amount of capital that we can raise under the ATM offering will be constrained.\nWe intend to use the net proceeds from the ATM offering for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, sales and marketing activities, clinical\nstudies and product development, acquisitions of assets, businesses, companies, or securities, capital expenditures, and working capital needs.\nWhile we are committed to these plans, there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful or sufficient to meet our capital requirements.\nThese factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our future viability depends on the successful execution of our strategic\nplans, securing additional financing, and achieving profitable operations.\nOperating Activities\nDuring the three months ended August 31, 2024, cash used in operating activities was approximately $1,344,000. The primary factors that contributed to this\nwere a loss of approximately $1,316,000, an increase in accounts receivable of $616,000, and a decrease in lease liability of $78,000. These were partially\noffset by a decrease in inventories of $429,000, a decrease in prepaid expenses and other of $106,000, and non-cash expenses of approximately $191,000.\nDuring the three months ended August 31, 2023, cash used in operating activities was approximately $1,674,000. The primary factors that contributed to this\nwere a loss of approximately $1,132,000, non-cash expenses of $122,000, primarily associated with depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation,\ninventory reserves and amortization of right-of-use assets. This was partially offset by changes in asset and liability accounts of $664,000.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring the three months ended August 31, 2024, we did not acquire any new property, equipment, or patents.\nDuring the three months ended August 31, 2023, cash used in investing activities was approximately $63,000. During the three months ended August 31, 2023,\nwe purchased approximately $21,000 of property and equipment and had $42,000 in expenditures related to patents.\n15\nFinancing Activities\nDuring the three months ended August 31, 2024, and 2023, the Company did not have any cash provided by financing activities, with no net proceeds from the\nsale of common stock or stock option exercises.\nOFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nThere were no off-balance sheet arrangements as of August 31, 2024.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to\nmake a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the\ndate of the financial statements. Such estimates and assumptions may affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We\nevaluate and base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and various other factors and circumstances that we believe to be reasonable.\nDifferent assumptions or conditions may cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates. We continue to monitor significant estimates made\nduring the preparation of our financial statements. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the current conditions; however, actual\nresults may differ from these estimates under different future conditions.\nWe believe that the estimates and assumptions that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, in that they require\nsubjective or complex judgments, form the basis for the accounting policies deemed to be most critical to us. These relate to revenue recognition, bad debts,\ninventory overhead application, inventory reserves, lease liabilities and right-of-use assets. We believe estimates and assumptions related to these critical\naccounting policies are appropriate under the circumstances; however, should future events or occurrences result in unanticipated consequences, there could be\na material impact on our future financial conditions or results of operations. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies from\nthose disclosed in our 2024 Annual Report. We suggest that our significant accounting policies be read in conjunction with this Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Please refer to Note 2 for information on Significant Accounting Policies.\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and are not required\nto provide the information under this item.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nOur management evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Our management recognizes that any controls and\nprocedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving its objectives, and management is required to apply\nits judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to\nprovide reasonable assurance of achieving its objectives.\nBased on their evaluation as of August 31, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and\nprocedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective at the “reasonable assurance” level to ensure that the\ninformation required to be disclosed by us in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (our “Quarterly Report”) was (1) recorded, processed, summarized and\nreported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations; and (2) accumulated and communicated to the our management, including our\nChief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended August 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or that is\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n16\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, which may impact our financial\nresults.\nAs of August 31, 2024, there were no pending legal proceedings. However, the outcome of any future legal matters, claims, or litigation could potentially have\na material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual operating results or cash flows when resolved in subsequent periods. Nonetheless, based on current\ninformation, management believes these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash\nflows.\nITEM 1A. RISKS FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves certain risks. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider all the information within this\nQuarterly Report, including the information contained in Part I, Item 2, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations, as well as in our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained in Part I, Item 1 within this Quarterly Report. In\naddition, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of our 2024 Annual Report, as well as in our\nother public filings with the SEC. If any of the identified risks are realized, our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and prospects\ncould be materially and adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock may decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nIn addition, other risks of which we are currently unaware, or which we do not currently view as material, could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nresults of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nDuring the three months ended August 31, 2024, there were no material changes to the risks and uncertainties described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our\n2024 Annual Report.\nITEM 5.

(Nasdaq: BMRA), (the “Company”) a global provider of advanced medical diagnostic and therapeutic products today reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 ended August 31, 2024.\n\n**Key Highlights:**\n\n  1. **Saudi FDA Approval for At-Home PSA Screening Test** Biomerica's Fortel® Prostate (PSA) Screening Test has received approval from the SFDA. This at-home diagnostic tool enables men to detect early signs of prostate cancer using a simple finger-prick blood sample. Elevated PSA levels, a potential indicator of prostate conditions such as cancer, can be detected, with results available in just 10 minutes. This user-friendly test is poised to make early detection more accessible, contributing to improved prostate cancer outcomes globally.\n  2. **inFoods ® IBS Pilot with 1,100 Physician Group Completed**Biomerica’s pilot program for its groundbreaking inFoods® IBS product, conducted with a select number of physicians from a large physician group comprising of 1,100 members, has been completed. We anticipate this large physician group will utilize the results of this study to evaluate a possible system-wide launch of inFoods® IBS across all physicians in the group. inFoods® IBS aims to identify individual food triggers for IBS symptoms, offering a personalized approach to symptom relief that has shown strong success in clinical studies and demonstrated significant potential in improving patient outcomes.\n  3. **Potential Distribution Partnerships for inFoods ® IBS**Biomerica is actively engaging in discussions with several potential distribution partners, both within the United States and internationally, to expand the availability of inFoods® IBS.\n  4. **Progress on H. pylori Product Distribution** The Company is in active discussions with major clinical laboratories and distributors for its hp+detect™ product. This diagnostic test offers significant cost savings for clinical labs and provides superior performance in detecting Helicobacter pylori, a leading cause of stomach ulcers and a risk factor for stomach cancer.\n\n\n\n**First Quarter Fiscal 2025 Financial Results**\n\nBiomerica delivered a 6% year-over-year revenue increase in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, with net sales rising to $1.8 million from $1.7 million in the prior year’s quarter. This growth was primarily driven by a higher demand from new and existing customers as well as new contract manufacturing agreements.\n\nDuring the fiscal quarter, we implemented our previously announced cost-savings plan, which is expected to reduce expenses by 16% to 23% representing $1.0 million to $1.4 million in savings for the current fiscal year. As part of this plan, we incurred one-time reduction-in-force (RIF) costs aimed at streamlining operations for long-term profitability. These RIF-related expenses impacted both gross margins and operating expenses for the period. Gross margin for the quarter was 16%, compared to 24% in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Adjusting for the RIF costs, the gross margins were consistent with historical levels.\n\nOperating expenses for the quarter were $1.7 million, a slight increase from $1.6 million in the prior year. The rise was primarily due to one-time severance costs associated with the RIF, as well as expenses related to the introduction of our sales force, which was not in place during the previous year. Excluding these one-time RIF costs, operating expenses would have decreased by 2%, reaffirming our continued focus on operational efficiency and disciplined cost management.\n\nOperating loss for the quarter increased to $1.4 million, compared to $1.2 million in the prior-year quarter, largely driven by the one-time RIF costs mentioned earlier. While these strategic actions were necessary to streamline operations and position the Company for future profitability, they temporarily impacted our financial results. Net loss also rose to $1.3 million, compared to $1.1 million in the same period last year. Excluding the RIF-related expenses, both operating loss and net loss would have been favorable versus prior year, reflecting our ongoing efforts to invest in key growth initiatives while managing costs.\n\n**Selected Financial Results**| **Three Months Ended**| **Three Months Ended**  \n---|---|---  \n**August 31, 2024**| **August 31, 2023**  \n _**($ in millions, except percentages)**_  \n**Revenue**| **$****1.8**| **$****1.7**  \n**Gross margin**| **16****%**| **24****%**  \n**Operating expenses**| **$****1.7**| **$****1.6**  \n**Operating loss**| **($****1.4****)**| **($****1.2****)**  \n**Net Loss**| **($****1.3****)**| **($****1.1****)**  \n  \n**About Biomerica (NASDAQ:**[**BMRA**](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/bmra)**)**\n\nBiomerica, Inc. ([www.biomerica.com](http://www.biomerica.com)) is a global biomedical technology company that develops, patents, manufactures and markets advanced diagnostic and therapeutic products used at the point-of-care (in home and in physicians' offices) and in hospital/clinical laboratories for detection and/or treatment of medical conditions and diseases. The Company's products are designed to enhance the health and well-being of people, while reducing total healthcare costs. Biomerica primarily focuses on gastrointestinal and inflammatory diseases where the Company has multiple diagnostic and therapeutic products in development.\n\n**About inFoods ® **The inFoods IBS test involves a simple blood collection procedure and is designed to assess a patient’s above normal immunoreactivity to specific foods. Instead of difficult to manage broad dietary restrictions, physicians can now use the inFoods IBS information to make targeted, patient-specific recommendations about specific foods that, when removed from the diet, may alleviate IBS symptoms such as pain, bloating, diarrhea and constipation. Further information about Biomerica’s patented inFoods® Technology Platform can be found at: <https://biomerica.com/inFoods/our-technology/>. The inFoods IBS clinical study was performed at several prominent centers including Mayo Clinic, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Inc. - a Harvard Medical School Teaching Hospital, Houston Methodist Hospital, and the University of Michigan. The clinical results for improvement in the Abdominal Pain Intensity (API) responder endpoint of >30%, for IBS patients in the treatment diet arm had a statistically significant improvement over patients in the placebo diet arm (p-value of 0.0246). The improvement for patients in the treatment arm versus the placebo arm is considered clinically significant and is similar and, in some cases, better than the current drugs in the market.\n\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a \"safe harbor\" for forward-looking statements.
