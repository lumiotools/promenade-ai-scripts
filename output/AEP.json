WHY THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED THIS NOTICE\nYour rights may be affected by the settlement of the actions styled In re AEP Stockholder\nDerivative Litigation, Master File 2:21-cv-00163-SDM (the “Ohio Federal Action”) filed in this\nCourt and currently on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit; Jones v.\nAkins, et al., Case No. 21CV000853, pending in the Ohio Court of Common Pleas for Franklin\nCounty (the “Ohio State Action”); Speiser v. Akins, et al., Index No. 605225/2021, previously\npending in the New York Supreme Court for New York County (the “New York State Action,”\nand collectively with the Ohio Federal Action and the Ohio State Action, the “Derivative Actions”)\nand the April 26, 2023 Litigation Demand Under New York Law to the Board of Directors of\nAmerican Electric Power Company, Inc. (the “Litigation Demand”).\nThe nominal defendant in each of the Derivative Actions and the Litigation Demand is\nAEP. The plaintiffs in the Derivative Actions and the Litigation Demand (“Plaintiffs”) are Robert\nL. Reese, Darryl Jones, and David Speiser.2 The individual defendants in the Derivative Actions\nare Nicholas K. Akins, Brian X. Tierney, Joseph M. Buonaiuto, Thomas E. Hoaglin, David J.\nAnderson, J. Barnie Beasley, Jr., Ralph D. Crosby, Jr., Art A. Garcia, Linda A. Goodspeed, Sandra\nBeach Lin, Margaret M. McCarthy, Richard C. Notebaert, Lionel L. Nowell, III, Stephen S.\nRasmussen, Oliver G. Richard, III, and Sara Martinez Tucker (collectively the “Individual\nDefendants”). AEP, Plaintiffs, and the Individual Defendants (the “Settling Parties”) have agreed\nupon terms to settle the above-referenced litigation and have signed the Stipulation and Agreement\nof Settlement setting forth the terms of the Settlement.\n2 Ms. Esther Kogus, one of the two stockholders in the Ohio Federal Action, died during the\npendency of the litigation. Neither Ms. Kogus nor her estate appealed the Court’s order dismissing\nthe Ohio Federal Action with prejudice. Nonetheless, for the avoidance of doubt, all derivative\nclaims pursued by Ms. Kogus or her estate on behalf of AEP will be dismissed, released, and\nbarred pursuant to the terms of the Settlement.\n2\nOn October 3, 2024, at 10:30 a.m., the Court will hold a hearing (the “Settlement Hearing”)\nconcerning the Derivative Actions and the Litigation Demand at Joseph P. Kinneary U.S.\nCourthouse, Courtroom 132, 85 Marconi Boulevard, Columbus, Ohio 43215, before the Honorable\nSarah D. Morrison, or via Zoom or some other video platform or telephonically as the Court may\ndirect. The purpose of the Settlement Hearing is to determine whether: (i) the terms of the\nproposed Settlement should be approved as fair, reasonable, and adequate; (ii) the separately\nnegotiated and agreed upon Fee and Expense Amount should be approved as fair, reasonable, and\nadequate; (iii) service awards to each of the Plaintiffs to be paid out of the Fee and Expense\nAmount should be approved; (iv) a final judgment should be entered, and the Derivative Actions\nand Litigation Demand should be fully and forever resolved and dismissed with prejudice on the\nterms set forth in the Settlement, including releases of the Released Claims, including Unknown\nClaims, against any of the Released Defendants’ Persons or Released Plaintiffs’ Persons (as those\nterms are defined in the Settlement); and (v) such other matters as may be necessary and proper\nunder the circumstances.\nII. AEP DERIVATIVE LITIGATION\nThe Ohio Federal Action:\nOn August 25, 2020, Plaintiff Reese served a pre-suit document inspection demand on AEP\npursuant to N.Y. B.C.L. § 624, seeking to inspect certain AEP documents. After negotiation with\ncounsel for AEP and execution of a confidentiality agreement, an initial document production was\nmade to Plaintiff Reese that was further supplemented on March 25, 2021.\nOn January 15, 2021, Esther Kogus filed a verified derivative complaint in this Court\nalleging claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment.\n3\nPlaintiff Reese filed an action in this Court on April 7, 2021 alleging multiple claims for\nbreach of fiduciary duty and contribution for violation of Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934.\nOn June 3, 2021, the plaintiffs in the Ohio Federal Action agreed to consolidate the two\nactions pending in the Court and organize counsel. The Order consolidating the actions and\nappointing co-lead counsel was entered on June 9, 2021.\nOn March 22, 2022, the plaintiffs in the Ohio Federal Action filed a consolidated Amended\nVerified Shareholder Derivative Complaint (the “Amended Complaint”) alleging four claims,\nincluding breach of fiduciary duty, waste, unjust enrichment, and breach of fiduciary duty for\ninsider trading.\nOn May 3, 2022, the Individual Defendants and AEP filed a motion to dismiss the\nAmended Complaint, which was opposed by the plaintiffs on May 24, 2022. After a hearing\nconducted on March 17, 2023, the Court entered an order dismissing with prejudice the Ohio\nFederal Action on March 21, 2023, and entered judgment the same day.\nNeither Ms. Kogus nor her estate appealed the Court’s order dismissing the Ohio Federal\nAction with prejudice and the dismissal order is final as to her.\nOn April 21, 2023, Plaintiff Reese (“Appellant”) filed a Notice of Appeal of the Court’s order\ngranting the Individual Defendants’ and AEP’s Motion to Dismiss (the “Appeal”).\nThe Ohio State Action:\nOn February 9, 2021, Plaintiff Darryl Jones initiated the Ohio State Action alleging claims\nfor breach of fiduciary duty, waste, and unjust enrichment. On March 18, 2021, and again on\nFebruary 23, 2022, the parties stipulated to a temporary stay of the Ohio State Action. On June 2,\n4\n2022, Plaintiff Jones filed an Amended Complaint. The stay was extended—over Plaintiff Jones’\nobjection—by the Ohio State Court on June 15, 2022 and remains in effect.\nThe New York State Action And Litigation Demand\nOn November 9, 2020, Plaintiff Speiser served a pre-suit document demand on AEP\npursuant to N.Y. B.C.L. § 624. After negotiation with inspection counsel for AEP and execution\nof a confidentiality agreement, an initial document production was made to Plaintiff Speiser on\nDecember 16, 2020, which was supplemented several times over the next few months.\nOn April 27, 2021, Plaintiff Speiser commenced the New York State Action in New York\nstate court and filed a complaint on May 12, 2021 alleging claims for breach of fiduciary duty,\nunjust enrichment, and waste.\nOn September 13, 2022, the New York state court dismissed with prejudice the New York\nState Action under C.P.L.R. § 3211(a)(4), because Plaintiff Speiser’s claims arose out of the same\nsubject matter as the prior pending Ohio Federal Action. On January 20, 2023, Plaintiff Speiser\nsought to intervene in the Ohio Federal Action, which was denied by the Court on March 21, 2023.\nOn April 26, 2023, Plaintiff Speiser sent the Litigation Demand to the Board of Directors\nof AEP demanding, among other things, that the Board investigate and pursue potential claims as\ndescribed therein.\nOn May 2, 2023, the AEP Board of Directors appointed a committee of the Board, the\nDemand Review Committee (“DRC”), to investigate the Litigation Demand and exercise all such\nother powers delegated to the DRC by the AEP Board of Directors. On May 22, 2023, the AEP\nBoard of Directors sent a letter advising Plaintiff Speiser of the formation of the DRC and that the\nDRC was in the process of undertaking its work.\nThe DRC subsequently retained Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP (“DRC\nCounsel”) to advise the DRC in connection with its work, which included DRC Counsel advising\n5\nthe DRC in connection with its recommendation to the AEP Board of Directors concerning the\nSettlement.\nE. Settlement Negotiations\nOn May 8, 2023, the Appeal was referred to Catherine G. Geyer, Esq., Chief Circuit\nMediator of the Sixth Circuit Mediation Office (the “Mediator”), to consider whether a negotiated\nresolution of the Appeal could be agreed upon. Over the next six months, counsel for the Appellant\nand Appellee engaged in protracted negotiations, with the assistance of the Mediator.\nOn July 6, 2023, Plaintiffs made a global settlement demand to resolve the Derivative\nActions and the Litigation Demand. Thereafter, the Settling Parties exchanged multiple draft\nproposals and reached an agreement on November 14, 2023 on certain key terms to resolve the\nDerivative Actions and the Litigation Demand, which was subject to an agreement on final\ndocumentation and any necessary court approval.\nIn connection with discussions and negotiations leading to the Settlement, counsel for the\nSettling Parties did not discuss the amount of any application by Plaintiffs’ Counsel for an award\nof attorneys’ fees and expenses until the substantive terms of the Settlement were negotiated at\narm’s-length and agreed upon. Thereafter, with the assistance of the Mediator, the Settling Parties\nagreed on payment to Plaintiffs’ Counsel for attorneys’ fees and expenses in the amount of\n$450,000.00, subject to agreement on final documentation and any necessary court approval.\nIII. PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS AND BENEFITS OF SETTLEMENT\nPlaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ Counsel believe that the claims asserted in the Derivative Actions\nand the Litigation Demand have merit, and Plaintiffs’ entry into this Settlement is not intended to\nbe and shall not be construed as an admission or concession concerning the relative strength or\nmerit of the claims alleged in the Derivative Actions or the Litigation Demand. Plaintiffs and\n6\nPlaintiffs’ Counsel recognize and acknowledge the expense and length of continued proceedings\nnecessary to prosecute the Derivative Actions and the Litigation Demand against the Individual\nDefendants through trial(s) and/or potential appeal.\nPlaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ Counsel have also considered the uncertain outcome and the risk\nof any litigation, especially in complex matters such as the Derivative Actions and the Litigation\nDemand, as well as the difficulties and delays inherent in such litigation. Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’\nCounsel are also mindful of the inherent problems of proof of, and possible defenses to, the claims\nasserted in the Derivative Actions and the Litigation Demand, and are mindful that the Ohio\nFederal Action and New York State Action have been dismissed with prejudice. Plaintiffs’\nCounsel have conducted extensive investigation and analysis, including, inter alia: (i) review of\nAEP’s press releases, recorded public statements, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\n(“SEC”) filings, and securities analysts’ reports and advisories about the Company; (ii) review of\nrelevant business and media reports about the Company; (iii) review and analysis of the filings and\npleadings in the Securities Action3; (iv) factual and legal research and analysis conducted in\npreparing the derivative complaints; (v) compilation and analysis of data bearing on potential\ndamages and board and executive compensation potentially subject to disgorgement or clawback;\n(vi) additional factual and legal research and analysis performed in connection with the Plaintiffs’\nsettlement negotiation, including detailed assessments of each claim and potential defenses,\nresearch into corporate governance and oversight best practices generally and among AEP’s peer\ncorporations; and (vii) review and analysis of information and documents exchanged with AEP\nand the Individual Defendants during the course of settlement negotiations.\n3 Nickerson v. American Electric Power Company, Inc., et al., Case No. 2:20-cv-04243 filed on\nAugust 20, 2020 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which was\nsubsequently dismissed with prejudice.\n7\nBased on Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s thorough review and analysis of the relevant facts,\nallegations, defenses, and controlling legal principles, Plaintiffs’ Counsel believe that the\nSettlement is fair, reasonable and adequate; confers substantial benefits upon AEP; and would\nserve the best interests of AEP and its Current Stockholders.\nIV. THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ DENIALS OF WRONGDOING AND\nLIABILITY\nThe Individual Defendants have denied and continue to deny each of the claims and\ncontentions alleged by Plaintiffs in the Derivative Actions and the Litigation Demand. The\nIndividual Defendants expressly have denied and continue to deny all allegations of wrongdoing\nor liability against them arising out of, based upon, or related to, any of the conduct, statements,\nacts or omissions alleged, or that could have been alleged, in the Derivative Actions or Litigation\nDemand. Without limiting the foregoing, the Individual Defendants have denied and continue to\ndeny, among other things, that they breached their fiduciary duties or any other duty owed to AEP\nor otherwise engaged in unlawful conduct, or that Plaintiffs or AEP suffered any damage or were\nharmed as a result of any conduct alleged in the Derivative Actions or in the Litigation Demand.\nThe Individual Defendants have further asserted and continue to assert that at all relevant times\nthey acted in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in the best interests of\nAEP.\nNonetheless, the Individual Defendants also have taken into account the expense,\nuncertainty, and risks inherent in any litigation, especially in complex matters like the Derivative\nActions and the Litigation Demand, and recognize that the proposed Settlement would, among\nother things: (a) bring to an end the expenses, burdens, and uncertainties associated with the\ncontinued litigation of the claims asserted in the Derivative Actions or potential claims arising\nfrom the Litigation Demand; (b) finally put to rest the claims asserted in the Derivative Actions or\n8\npotential claims arising from the Litigation Demand; and (c) confer benefits upon them, including\nfurther avoidance of disruption of their duties due to the pendency and defense of the Derivative\nActions and the necessity of responding to the Litigation Demand or defending against potential\nclaims arising from it. The Individual Defendants were advised by their own separate counsel in\nconnection with this Settlement and have voluntarily entered into this Settlement.\nThe Company—consistent with the recommendation of the DRC—has determined that it\nis in the best interests of AEP for the Derivative Actions and the Litigation Demand, and all of the\nSettling Parties’ disputes related thereto, including all claims that were or could have been asserted\nin any court based on the facts alleged in the Derivative Actions and the Litigation Demand, to be\nfully and finally settled in the manner and upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Settlement.\nPursuant to the terms set forth below, the Settlement (including all of the Exhibits hereto)\nshall in no event be construed as or deemed to be evidence of an admission or concession by the\nCompany or the Individual Defendants with respect to any claim of fault, liability, wrongdoing, or\ndamage whatsoever.\nV. BOARD APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT\nAEP hereby acknowledges that: (a) Plaintiffs’ litigation and settlement efforts were a\nsubstantial and material cause of the Company’s decision to adopt, implement, and maintain the\nReforms; (b) the Reforms confer a substantial benefit upon the Company and its Current\nStockholders; and (c) the Settlement is fair, adequate, reasonable, and in the best interests of the\nCompany and its Current Stockholders.\nVI.

PLAINTIFFS’ COUNSEL’S SEPARATELY NEGOTIATED ATTORNEYS’ FEES\nAND LITIGATION EXPENSES\nAfter negotiating certain key terms of the Settlement, which terms were subject to\nagreement on final documentation, Plaintiffs’ Counsel, Defendants’ Counsel, and counsel for\nAEP’s insurers, with the assistance of the Mediator, separately negotiated the attorneys’ fees and\nexpenses to be paid to Plaintiffs’ Counsel. In light of the substantial benefits conferred by\nPlaintiffs’ Counsel’s efforts upon AEP and its Current Stockholders, AEP, acting by and through\nits Board, has agreed that AEP, through its Directors & Officers insurer, shall cause to be paid to\nPlaintiffs’ Counsel Four Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars ($450,000.00) in attorneys’ fees and\nexpenses (the “Fee and Expense Amount”), subject to this Court’s approval, dismissal with\nprejudice of the Ohio State Action, and Irrevocable Withdrawal of the Litigation Demand.\nAEP and/or AEP’s insurer shall cause the separately negotiated Fee and Expense Amount\nto be paid within thirty (30) days of the occurrence of the events described in paragraph 18(a)-(f)\nof the Settlement (defining the Effective Date), via either a paper check or a wire transfer, into an\naccount identified by Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP, subject to Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s timely\n12\ntransmission of wire instructions, check payee(s) information, and tax identification numbers.\nPlaintiffs’ Counsel may apply to the Court for service awards of up to two thousand five\nhundred dollars ($2,500.00) for each of the Plaintiffs, to be paid out of the Fee and Expense\nAmount. The Court’s decision regarding whether to approve any requested service award, in\nwhole or in part, shall have no effect on the Settlement.

B.C.L. § 624, seeking to inspect certain AEP documents. After negotiation with\ncounsel for AEP, and execution of a confidentiality agreement, an initial document production was\nmade to Plaintiff Reese that was further supplemented on March 25, 2021.\nOn January 15, 2021, Esther Kogus1 filed a verified derivative complaint in the Ohio\nFederal Court alleging claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment.\n1 Ms. Kogus, one of the two stockholders in the Ohio Federal Action, died during the\npendency of the litigation. Neither Ms. Kogus nor her estate appealed the Ohio Federal Court’s\norder dismissing the Ohio Federal Action with prejudice. Nonetheless, for the avoidance of doubt,\nall derivative claims pursued by Ms. Kogus or her estate on behalf of AEP will be dismissed,\nreleased, and barred pursuant to the terms of the Settlement.\n2\nCase: 2:21-cv-00163-SDM-EPD Doc #: 54-3 Filed: 05/01/24 Page: 3 of 91 PAGEID #: 1143\nPlaintiff Reese filed an action in Ohio Federal Court on April 7, 2021 alleging multiple claims for\nbreach of fiduciary duty and contribution for violation of Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934.\nOn June 3, 2021, the plaintiffs in the Ohio Federal Action agreed to consolidate the two\nactions pending in Ohio Federal Court and organize counsel. The Order consolidating the actions\nand appointing co-lead counsel was entered on June 9, 2021.\nOn March 22, 2022, the plaintiffs in the Ohio Federal Action filed a consolidated Amended\nVerified Shareholder Derivative Complaint (the “Amended Complaint”) alleging four claims,\nincluding breach of fiduciary duty, waste, unjust enrichment, and breach of fiduciary duty for\ninsider trading.\nOn May 3, 2022, the Individual Defendants and AEP filed a motion to dismiss the\nAmended Complaint, which was opposed by the plaintiffs on May 24, 2022. After a hearing\nconducted on March 17, 2023, the Ohio Federal Court entered an order dismissing with prejudice\nthe Ohio Federal Action on March 21, 2023 and entered judgment the same day.\nNeither Ms. Kogus nor her estate appealed the Ohio Federal Court’s order dismissing the\nOhio Federal Action with prejudice and the dismissal order is final as to her.\nOn April 21, 2023, Plaintiff Reese (“Appellant”) filed a Notice of Appeal of the Ohio\nFederal Court’s order granting the Individual Defendants’ and AEP’s Motion to Dismiss (the\n“Appeal”).\nThe Ohio State Action:\nOn February 9, 2021, Plaintiff Darryl Jones initiated the Ohio State Action alleging claims\nfor breach of fiduciary duty, waste, and unjust enrichment. On March 18, 2021 and again on\nFebruary 23, 2022, the parties stipulated to a temporary stay of the Ohio State Action. On June 2,\n3\nCase: 2:21-cv-00163-SDM-EPD Doc #: 54-3 Filed: 05/01/24 Page: 4 of 91 PAGEID #: 1144\n2022, Plaintiff Jones filed an Amended Complaint. The stay was extended—over Plaintiff Jones’\nobjection—by the Ohio State Court on June 15, 2022 and remains in effect.\nThe New York State Action And Litigation Demand\nOn November 9, 2020, Plaintiff Speiser served a pre-suit document demand on AEP\npursuant to N.Y. B.C.L. § 624. After negotiation with inspection counsel for AEP and execution\nof a confidentiality agreement, an initial document production was made to Plaintiff Speiser on\nDecember 16, 2020, which was supplemented several times over the next few months.\nOn April 27, 2021, Plaintiff Speiser commenced the New York State Action in New York\nstate court and filed a complaint on May 12, 2021 alleging claims for breach of fiduciary duty,\nunjust enrichment, and waste.\nOn September 13, 2022, the New York State court dismissed with prejudice the New York\nState Action under C.P.L.R. § 3211(a)(4) because the complaint’s claims arose out of the same\nsubject matter as the prior pending Ohio Federal Action. On January 20, 2023, Plaintiff Speiser\nsought to intervene in the Ohio Federal Action, which was denied by the Ohio Federal Court on\nMarch 21, 2023.\nOn April 26, 2023, Plaintiff Speiser sent the Litigation Demand to the Board of Directors\nof AEP demanding, among other things, that the Board investigate and pursue potential claims as\ndescribed therein.\nOn May 2, 2023, the AEP Board of Directors appointed a committee of the Board, the\nDemand Review Committee (“DRC”), to investigate the Litigation Demand and exercise all such\nother powers delegated to the DRC by the AEP Board of Directors. On May 22, 2023, the AEP\nBoard of Directors sent a letter advising Plaintiff Speiser of the formation of the DRC and that the\nDRC was in the process of undertaking its work.\n4\nCase: 2:21-cv-00163-SDM-EPD Doc #: 54-3 Filed: 05/01/24 Page: 5 of 91 PAGEID #: 1145\nThe DRC subsequently retained Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP (“DRC\nCounsel”) to advise the DRC in connection with its work, which included DRC Counsel advising\nthe DRC in connection with its recommendation to the AEP Board of Directors concerning this\nSettlement.\nThe Parties Conduct Arm’s-Length Negotiations to Resolve the Derivative Actions and the\nLitigation Demand:\nOn May 8, 2023, the Appeal was referred to Catherine G. Geyer, Esq., Chief Circuit\nMediator of the Sixth Circuit Mediation Office (the “Mediator”), to consider whether a negotiated\nresolution of the Appeal could be agreed upon. Over the next six months, counsel for the Appellant\nand Appellee engaged in protracted negotiations, with the assistance of the Mediator.\nOn July 6, 2023, Plaintiffs made a global settlement demand to resolve the Derivative\nActions and the Litigation Demand. Thereafter, the Settling Parties exchanged multiple draft\nproposals and reached an agreement on November 14, 2023 on certain key terms to resolve all\npending Derivative Actions and the Litigation Demand, which was subject to an agreement on\nfinal documentation and any necessary court approval.\nIn connection with discussions and negotiations leading to the proposed Settlement,\ncounsel for the Settling Parties did not discuss the amount of any application by Plaintiffs’ Counsel\nfor an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses until the substantive terms of the Settlement were\nnegotiated at arm’s-length and agreed upon. Thereafter, with the assistance of the Mediator, the\nSettling Parties agreed on payment to Plaintiffs’ Counsel for attorneys’ fees and expenses in the\namount of $450,000.00, subject to agreement on final documentation and any necessary court\napproval.\nThis Settlement (together with the Exhibits hereto) reflects the final and binding\nagreement among the Settling Parties.\n5\nCase: 2:21-cv-00163-SDM-EPD Doc #: 54-3 Filed: 05/01/24 Page: 6 of 91 PAGEID #: 1146\nPLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS AND BENEFITS OF SETTLEMENT\nPlaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ Counsel believe that the claims asserted in the Derivative Actions\nand the Litigation Demand have merit, and Plaintiffs’ entry into this Settlement is not intended to\nbe and shall not be construed as an admission or concession concerning the relative strength or\nmerit of the claims alleged in the Derivative Actions or the Litigation Demand. Plaintiffs and\nPlaintiffs’ Counsel recognize and acknowledge the expense and length of continued proceedings\nnecessary to prosecute the Derivative Actions and the Litigation Demand against the Individual\nDefendants through trial(s) and/or potential appeal.\nPlaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ Counsel have also considered the uncertain outcome and the risk\nof any litigation, especially in complex matters such as the Derivative Actions and the Litigation\nDemand, as well as the difficulties and delays inherent in such litigation. Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’\nCounsel are also mindful of the inherent problems of proof of, and possible defenses to, the claims\nasserted in the Derivative Actions and the Litigation Demand, and are mindful that the Ohio\nFederal and New York State Actions have been dismissed with prejudice. Plaintiffs’ Counsel have\nconducted extensive investigation and analysis, including, inter alia: (i) review of AEP’s press\nreleases, recorded public statements, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings,\nand securities analysts’ reports and advisories about the Company; (ii) review of relevant business\nand media reports about the Company; (iii) review and analysis of the filings and pleadings in the\nSecurities Action (defined below); (iv) factual and legal research and analysis conducted in\npreparing the derivative Complaints; (v) compilation and analysis of data bearing on potential\ndamages and board and executive compensation potentially subject to disgorgement or clawback;\n(vi) additional factual and legal research and analysis performed in connection with the Plaintiffs’\nsettlement negotiation, including detailed assessments of each claim and potential defenses,\n6\nCase: 2:21-cv-00163-SDM-EPD Doc #: 54-3 Filed: 05/01/24 Page: 7 of 91 PAGEID #: 1147\nresearch into corporate governance and oversight best practices generally and among AEP’s peer\ncorporations; and (vii) review and analysis of information and documents exchanged with AEP\nand the Individual Defendants during the course of settlement negotiations.\nBased on Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s thorough review and analysis of the relevant facts,\nallegations, defenses, and controlling legal principles, Plaintiffs’ Counsel believe that the\nSettlement is fair, reasonable and adequate; confers substantial benefits upon AEP; and would\nserve the best interests of AEP and its Current Stockholders.\nTHE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ DENIALS OF WRONGDOING AND LIABILITY\nThe Individual Defendants have denied and continue to deny each of the claims and\ncontentions alleged by Plaintiffs in the Derivative Actions and the Litigation Demand. The\nIndividual Defendants expressly have denied and continue to deny all allegations of wrongdoing\nor liability against them arising out of, based upon, or related to, any of the conduct, statements,\nacts or omissions alleged, or that could have been alleged, in the Derivative Actions or Litigation\nDemand. Without limiting the foregoing, the Individual Defendants have denied and continue to\ndeny, among other things, that they breached their fiduciary duties or any other duty owed to AEP\nor otherwise engaged in unlawful conduct, or that Plaintiffs or AEP suffered any damage or were\nharmed as a result of any conduct alleged in the Derivative Actions or in the Litigation Demand.\nThe Individual Defendants have further asserted and continue to assert that at all relevant times\nthey acted in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in the best interests of\nAEP.\nNonetheless, the Individual Defendants also have taken into account the expense,\nuncertainty, and risks inherent in any litigation, especially in complex matters like the Derivative\nActions and the Litigation Demand, and recognize that the proposed Settlement would, among\n7\nCase: 2:21-cv-00163-SDM-EPD Doc #: 54-3 Filed: 05/01/24 Page: 8 of 91 PAGEID #: 1148\nother things: (a) bring to an end the expenses, burdens, and uncertainties associated with the\ncontinued litigation of the claims asserted in the Derivative Actions or potential claims arising\nfrom the Litigation Demand; (b) finally put to rest the claims asserted in the Derivative Actions or\npotential claims arising from the Litigation Demand; and (c) confer benefits upon them, including\nfurther avoidance of disruption of their duties due to the pendency and defense of the Derivative\nActions and the necessity of responding to the Litigation Demand or defending against potential\nclaims arising from it. The Individual Defendants were advised by their own separate counsel in\nconnection with this Settlement and have voluntarily entered into this Settlement.\nThe Company—consistent with the recommendation of the DRC—has determined that it\nis in the best interests of AEP for the Derivative Actions and the Litigation Demand, and all of the\nSettling Parties’ disputes related thereto, including all claims that were or could have been asserted\nin any court based on the facts alleged in the Derivative Actions and the Litigation Demand, to be\nfully and finally settled in the manner and upon the terms and conditions set forth in this\nSettlement.\nPursuant to the terms set forth below, this Settlement (including all of the Exhibits hereto)\nshall in no event be construed as or deemed to be evidence of an admission or concession by the\nCompany or the Individual Defendants with respect to any claim of fault, liability, wrongdoing, or\ndamage whatsoever.\nEach of the Settling Parties recognizes and acknowledges that the Derivative Actions and\nLitigation Demand are being voluntarily settled after each has had the opportunity to obtain the\nadvice of counsel, and that the terms of the Settlement are fair, reasonable, and adequate.\nNOW THEREFORE, it is hereby STIPULATED AND AGREED, by and among the\nSettlings Parties through their respective undersigned attorneys and subject to the approval of the\n8\nCase: 2:21-cv-00163-SDM-EPD Doc #: 54-3 Filed: 05/01/24 Page: 9 of 91 PAGEID #: 1149\nOhio Federal Court, that, in consideration of the benefits flowing to the Settling Parties from the\nSettlement, all Released Plaintiffs’ Claims as against the Released Defendants’ Persons and all\nReleased Defendants’ Claims as against the Released Plaintiffs’ Persons shall be settled and\nreleased, upon and subject to the terms and conditions set forth below.\nCERTAIN DEFINITIONS\n1.

AEP DERIVATIVE LITIGATION\nThe Ohio Federal Action:\nOn August 25, 2020, Plaintiff Reese served a pre-suit document inspection demand on AEP\npursuant to N.Y. B.C.L. § 624, seeking to inspect certain AEP documents. After negotiation with\ncounsel for AEP and execution of a confidentiality agreement, an initial document production was\nmade to Plaintiff Reese that was further supplemented on March 25, 2021.\n4\nCase: 2:21-cv-00163-SDM-EPD Doc #: 54-3 Filed: 05/01/24 Page: 61 of 91 PAGEID #: 1201\nOn January 15, 2021, Esther Kogus filed a verified derivative complaint in this Court\nalleging claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment.\nPlaintiff Reese filed an action in this Court on April 7, 2021 alleging multiple claims for\nbreach of fiduciary duty and contribution for violation of Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934.\nOn June 3, 2021, the plaintiffs in the Ohio Federal Action agreed to consolidate the two\nactions pending in the Court and organize counsel. The Order consolidating the actions and\nappointing co-lead counsel was entered on June 9, 2021.\nOn March 22, 2022, the plaintiffs in the Ohio Federal Action filed a consolidated Amended\nVerified Shareholder Derivative Complaint (the “Amended Complaint”) alleging four claims,\nincluding breach of fiduciary duty, waste, unjust enrichment, and breach of fiduciary duty for\ninsider trading.\nOn May 3, 2022, the Individual Defendants and AEP filed a motion to dismiss the\nAmended Complaint, which was opposed by the plaintiffs on May 24, 2022. After a hearing\nconducted on March 17, 2023, the Court entered an order dismissing with prejudice the Ohio\nFederal Action on March 21, 2023, and entered judgment the same day.\nNeither Ms. Kogus nor her estate appealed the Court’s order dismissing the Ohio Federal\nAction with prejudice and the dismissal order is final as to her.\nOn April 21, 2023, Plaintiff Reese (“Appellant”) filed a Notice of Appeal of the Court’s order\ngranting the Individual Defendants’ and AEP’s Motion to Dismiss (the “Appeal”).\nThe Ohio State Action:\nOn February 9, 2021, Plaintiff Darryl Jones initiated the Ohio State Action alleging claims\nfor breach of fiduciary duty, waste, and unjust enrichment. On March 18, 2021, and again on\n5\nCase: 2:21-cv-00163-SDM-EPD Doc #: 54-3 Filed: 05/01/24 Page: 62 of 91 PAGEID #: 1202\nFebruary 23, 2022, the parties stipulated to a temporary stay of the Ohio State Action. On June 2,\n2022, Plaintiff Jones filed an Amended Complaint. The stay was extended—over Plaintiff Jones’\nobjection—by the Ohio State Court on June 15, 2022 and remains in effect.\nThe New York State Action And Litigation Demand\nOn November 9, 2020, Plaintiff Speiser served a pre-suit document demand on AEP\npursuant to N.Y. B.C.L. § 624. After negotiation with inspection counsel for AEP and execution\nof a confidentiality agreement, an initial document production was made to Plaintiff Speiser on\nDecember 16, 2020, which was supplemented several times over the next few months.\nOn April 27, 2021, Plaintiff Speiser commenced the New York State Action in New York\nstate court and filed a complaint on May 12, 2021 alleging claims for breach of fiduciary duty,\nunjust enrichment, and waste.\nOn September 13, 2022, the New York state court dismissed with prejudice the New York\nState Action under C.P.L.R. § 3211(a)(4), because Plaintiff Speiser’s claims arose out of the same\nsubject matter as the prior pending Ohio Federal Action. On January 20, 2023, Plaintiff Speiser\nsought to intervene in the Ohio Federal Action, which was denied by the Court on March 21, 2023.\nOn April 26, 2023, Plaintiff Speiser sent the Litigation Demand to the Board of Directors\nof AEP demanding, among other things, that the Board investigate and pursue potential claims as\ndescribed therein.\nOn May 2, 2023, the AEP Board of Directors appointed a committee of the Board, the\nDemand Review Committee (“DRC”), to investigate the Litigation Demand and exercise all such\nother powers delegated to the DRC by the AEP Board of Directors. On May 22, 2023, the AEP\nBoard of Directors sent a letter advising Plaintiff Speiser of the formation of the DRC and that the\nDRC was in the process of undertaking its work.\n6\nCase: 2:21-cv-00163-SDM-EPD Doc #: 54-3 Filed: 05/01/24 Page: 63 of 91 PAGEID #: 1203\nThe DRC subsequently retained Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP (“DRC\nCounsel”) to advise the DRC in connection with its work, which included DRC Counsel advising\nthe DRC in connection with its recommendation to the AEP Board of Directors concerning the\nSettlement.\nE. Settlement Negotiations\nOn May 8, 2023, the Appeal was referred to Catherine G. Geyer, Esq., Chief Circuit\nMediator of the Sixth Circuit Mediation Office (the “Mediator”), to consider whether a negotiated\nresolution of the Appeal could be agreed upon. Over the next six months, counsel for the Appellant\nand Appellee engaged in protracted negotiations, with the assistance of the Mediator.\nOn July 6, 2023, Plaintiffs made a global settlement demand to resolve the Derivative\nActions and the Litigation Demand. Thereafter, the Settling Parties exchanged multiple draft\nproposals and reached an agreement on November 14, 2023 on certain key terms to resolve the\nDerivative Actions and the Litigation Demand, which was subject to an agreement on final\ndocumentation and any necessary court approval.\nIn connection with discussions and negotiations leading to the Settlement, counsel for the\nSettling Parties did not discuss the amount of any application by Plaintiffs’ Counsel for an award\nof attorneys’ fees and expenses until the substantive terms of the Settlement were negotiated at\narm’s-length and agreed upon. Thereafter, with the assistance of the Mediator, the Settling Parties\nagreed on payment to Plaintiffs’ Counsel for attorneys’ fees and expenses in the amount of\n$450,000.00, subject to agreement on final documentation and any necessary court approval.\nIII. PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS AND BENEFITS OF SETTLEMENT\nPlaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ Counsel believe that the claims asserted in the Derivative Actions\nand the Litigation Demand have merit, and Plaintiffs’ entry into this Settlement is not intended to\n7\nCase: 2:21-cv-00163-SDM-EPD Doc #: 54-3 Filed: 05/01/24 Page: 64 of 91 PAGEID #: 1204\nbe and shall not be construed as an admission or concession concerning the relative strength or\nmerit of the claims alleged in the Derivative Actions or the Litigation Demand. Plaintiffs and\nPlaintiffs’ Counsel recognize and acknowledge the expense and length of continued proceedings\nnecessary to prosecute the Derivative Actions and the Litigation Demand against the Individual\nDefendants through trial(s) and/or potential appeal.\nPlaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ Counsel have also considered the uncertain outcome and the risk\nof any litigation, especially in complex matters such as the Derivative Actions and the Litigation\nDemand, as well as the difficulties and delays inherent in such litigation. Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’\nCounsel are also mindful of the inherent problems of proof of, and possible defenses to, the claims\nasserted in the Derivative Actions and the Litigation Demand, and are mindful that the Ohio\nFederal Action and New York State Action have been dismissed with prejudice. Plaintiffs’\nCounsel have conducted extensive investigation and analysis, including, inter alia: (i) review of\nAEP’s press releases, recorded public statements, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\n(“SEC”) filings, and securities analysts’ reports and advisories about the Company; (ii) review of\nrelevant business and media reports about the Company; (iii) review and analysis of the filings and\npleadings in the Securities Action3; (iv) factual and legal research and analysis conducted in\npreparing the derivative complaints; (v) compilation and analysis of data bearing on potential\ndamages and board and executive compensation potentially subject to disgorgement or clawback;\n(vi) additional factual and legal research and analysis performed in connection with the Plaintiffs’\nsettlement negotiation, including detailed assessments of each claim and potential defenses,\nresearch into corporate governance and oversight best practices generally and among AEP’s peer\n3 Nickerson v. American Electric Power Company, Inc., et al., Case No. 2:20-cv-04243 filed on\nAugust 20, 2020 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which was\nsubsequently dismissed with prejudice.\n8\nCase: 2:21-cv-00163-SDM-EPD Doc #: 54-3 Filed: 05/01/24 Page: 65 of 91 PAGEID #: 1205\ncorporations; and (vii) review and analysis of information and documents exchanged with AEP\nand the Individual Defendants during the course of settlement negotiations.\nBased on Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s thorough review and analysis of the relevant facts,\nallegations, defenses, and controlling legal principles, Plaintiffs’ Counsel believe that the\nSettlement is fair, reasonable and adequate; confers substantial benefits upon AEP; and would\nserve the best interests of AEP and its Current Stockholders.\nIV. THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ DENIALS OF WRONGDOING AND\nLIABILITY\nThe Individual Defendants have denied and continue to deny each of the claims and\ncontentions alleged by Plaintiffs in the Derivative Actions and the Litigation Demand. The\nIndividual Defendants expressly have denied and continue to deny all allegations of wrongdoing\nor liability against them arising out of, based upon, or related to, any of the conduct, statements,\nacts or omissions alleged, or that could have been alleged, in the Derivative Actions or Litigation\nDemand. Without limiting the foregoing, the Individual Defendants have denied and continue to\ndeny, among other things, that they breached their fiduciary duties or any other duty owed to AEP\nor otherwise engaged in unlawful conduct, or that Plaintiffs or AEP suffered any damage or were\nharmed as a result of any conduct alleged in the Derivative Actions or in the Litigation Demand.\nThe Individual Defendants have further asserted and continue to assert that at all relevant times\nthey acted in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in the best interests of\nAEP.\nNonetheless, the Individual Defendants also have taken into account the expense,\nuncertainty, and risks inherent in any litigation, especially in complex matters like the Derivative\nActions and the Litigation Demand, and recognize that the proposed Settlement would, among\nother things: (a) bring to an end the expenses, burdens, and uncertainties associated with the\n9\nCase: 2:21-cv-00163-SDM-EPD Doc #: 54-3 Filed: 05/01/24 Page: 66 of 91 PAGEID #: 1206\ncontinued litigation of the claims asserted in the Derivative Actions or potential claims arising\nfrom the Litigation Demand; (b) finally put to rest the claims asserted in the Derivative Actions or\npotential claims arising from the Litigation Demand; and (c) confer benefits upon them, including\nfurther avoidance of disruption of their duties due to the pendency and defense of the Derivative\nActions and the necessity of responding to the Litigation Demand or defending against potential\nclaims arising from it. The Individual Defendants were advised by their own separate counsel in\nconnection with this Settlement and have voluntarily entered into this Settlement.\nThe Company—consistent with the recommendation of the DRC—has determined that it\nis in the best interests of AEP for the Derivative Actions and the Litigation Demand, and all of the\nSettling Parties’ disputes related thereto, including all claims that were or could have been asserted\nin any court based on the facts alleged in the Derivative Actions and the Litigation Demand, to be\nfully and finally settled in the manner and upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Settlement.\nPursuant to the terms set forth below, the Settlement (including all of the Exhibits hereto)\nshall in no event be construed as or deemed to be evidence of an admission or concession by the\nCompany or the Individual Defendants with respect to any claim of fault, liability, wrongdoing, or\ndamage whatsoever.\nV.

This Final Order and Judgment incorporates by reference the definitions in the\nSettlement, and all capitalized terms used herein shall have the same meanings as set forth in the\nSettlement (in addition to those capitalized terms defined herein).\n2. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of the Ohio Federal Action,\nincluding all matters necessary to effectuate the Settlement, and over all parties to the Settlement,\nthe Derivative Actions, and the Litigation Demand, including, but not limited to, Plaintiffs,\nAmerican Electric Power Co., Inc.

The Court finds that the notice of the Settlement provided to AEP stockholders and\nall persons entitled to such notice was the best notice practicable under the circumstances of these\nproceedings and of the matters set forth therein. The notice fully satisfied the requirements of\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.1 and due process.\n4. This consolidated action and all claims contained herein, as well as all of the\nReleased Claims which could have been asserted in this consolidated action, are dismissed with\nprejudice. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement, all other Released Claims are released and\npermanently barred. Plaintiffs, AEP stockholders, the Individual Defendants, and AEP are all to\nbear their own costs, except as otherwise provided in the Settlement.\n5. The Court finds that the terms of the Settlement are fair, reasonable, and adequate as\nto each of the Settling Parties, and hereby finally approves the Settlement in all respects. The Court\norders the Settling Parties to perform the terms of the Settlement to the extent the Settling Parties\nhave not already done so.\n6.

BUSINESS\nGENERAL\nOverview and Description of Major Subsidiaries\nAEP was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York in 1906 and reorganized in 1925. It is a public utility holding\ncompany that owns, directly or indirectly, all of the outstanding common stock of its public utility subsidiaries and varying\npercentages of other subsidiaries.\nThe service areas of AEP’s public utility subsidiaries cover portions of the states of Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana,\nMichigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia. Transmission networks are interconnected with\nextensive distribution facilities in the territories served. The public utility subsidiaries of AEP have traditionally provided\nelectric service, consisting of generation, transmission and distribution, on an integrated basis to their retail customers.\nRestructuring laws in Michigan, Ohio and the ERCOT area of Texas have caused AEP public utility subsidiaries in those states\nto unbundle previously integrated regulated rates for their retail customers.\nThe member companies of AEP have contractual, financial and other business relationships with the other member companies,\nsuch as participation in AEP savings and retirement plans and tax returns, sales of electricity and transportation and handling of\nfuel. The member companies of AEP also obtain certain accounting, administrative, information systems, engineering,\nfinancial, legal, maintenance and other services at cost from a common provider, AEPSC.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the subsidiaries of AEP had a total of 17,250 employees. Because it is a holding company rather\nthan an operating company, AEP has no employees.\nInformation related to AEP subsidiary operating companies as of December 31, 2023 is shown in the table below:\nAEP Texas AEPTCo APCo I&M KGPCo (a) KPCo OPCo (b) PSO SWEPCo WPCo\nWest\nState of Delaware, Delaware, Virginia, Indiana, Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio, Oklahoma, Delaware, Virginia,\nIncorporation 1925 2006 1926 1907 1917 1919 1907 1913 1912 1883\nTransmission Transmission\nand AEP Vertically Vertically Vertically Vertically and Vertically Vertically Vertically\nAEP Reportable Distribution Transmission Integrated Integrated Integrated Integrated Distribution Integrated Integrated Integrated\nSegment Utilities Holdco Utilities Utilities Utilities Utilities Utilities Utilities Utilities Utilities\nRTO Affiliation ERCOT (c) PJM PJM PJM PJM PJM SPP SPP PJM\nApproximate\nNumber of\nRetail\nCustomers 1,111,000 (c) 967,000 613,000 49,000 163,000 1,527,000 578,000 548,000 41,000\nNumber of\nEmployees 1,646 (c) 1,679 2,110 56 284 1,752 1,062 1,344 230\nOverhead\nCircuit Miles of\nTransmission\nand Distribution\nLines 46,673 4,188 51,558 20,584 1,405 11,210 44,519 18,156 26,233 1,722\n(a) KGPCo does not own any generating facilities and purchases electric power from APCo for distribution to its customers.\n(b) OPCo purchases energy and capacity at auction to serve generation service customers who have not switched to a competitive generation supplier.\n(c) AEPTCo is a holding company for the State Transcos. Five State Transcos are members of PJM and two State Transcos are members of SPP. Neither\nAEPTCo nor its subsidiaries have any employees. Instead, AEPSC and certain AEP utility subsidiaries provide services to these entities.\nService Company Subsidiary\nAEPSC is a service company subsidiary that provides accounting, administrative, information systems, engineering, financial,\nlegal, maintenance and other services at cost to AEP subsidiaries. The executive officers of AEP and certain of the executive\nofficers of its public utility subsidiaries are employees of AEPSC. As of December 31, 2023, AEPSC had 6,736 employees.\n1\nPrincipal Industries Served\nThe following table illustrates the principal industries and wholesale electric markets served by AEP’s public utility\nsubsidiaries.\nAEP Texas APCo I&M KGPCo KPCo OPCo PSO SWEPCo WPCo\nPrincipal Industries Served:\nPetroleum and Coal Products Manufacturing X X X X X\nChemical Manufacturing X X X X X X X X\nOil and Gas Extraction X X X X\nPipeline Transportation X X X X X X\nPrimary Metal Manufacturing X X X X X X\nData Processing (a) X X\nCoal-Mining X X X\nPaper Manufacturing X X X X\nTransportation Equipment X X\nPlastics and Rubber Products X X X X\nFabricated Metals Product Manufacturing X\nFood Manufacturing X\nSupply and Market Electric Power at\nWholesale to:\nOther Electric Utility Companies X X X X X X\nRural Electric Cooperatives X X X\nMunicipalities X X X X X\nOther Market Participants X X X X X X\n(a) Primarily includes data centers and cryptocurrency operations.\nPublic Utility Subsidiaries by Jurisdiction\nThe following table illustrates certain regulatory information with respect to the jurisdictions in which the public utility\nsubsidiaries of AEP operate:\nAEP Utility Subsidiaries Operating in that Authorized Return on\nPrincipal Jurisdiction Jurisdiction Equity (a)\nArkansas SWEPCo 9.50 %\nFERC AEPTCo - PJM 10.35 % (b)\nAEPTCo - SPP 10.50 %\nIndiana I&M 9.70 %\nKentucky KPCo 9.75 % (c)\nLouisiana SWEPCo 9.50 %\nMichigan I&M 9.86 %\nOhio OPCo 9.70 %\nOklahoma PSO 9.30 %\nTennessee KGPCo 9.50 %\nTexas AEP Texas 9.40 %\nSWEPCo 9.25 % (d)\nVirginia APCo 9.50 %\nWest Virginia APCo 9.75 %\nWPCo 9.75 %\n(a) Identifies the predominant current authorized ROE, and may not include other, less significant, permitted\nrecovery.

See “2023 Kentucky Base Rate and\nSecuritization Case” section of Note 4 for additional information.\n(d) In February 2022, as part of the 2020 Texas Base Rate Case, SWEPCo filed a motion for rehearing with the\nPUCT alleging several errors in the final order, which included a challenge of the approved ROE. In April 2022,\nthe PUCT denied the motion for rehearing. In May 2022, SWEPCo filed a petition for review with the Texas\nDistrict Court seeking a judicial review of the several errors challenged in the PUCT’s final order. See “2020\nTexas Base Rate Case” section of Note 4 for additional information.\n2\nCLASSES OF SERVICE\nAEP and subsidiaries recognize revenues from customers for retail and wholesale electricity sales and electricity transmission\nand distribution delivery services. AEP’s subsidiaries within the Vertically Integrated Utilities, Transmission and Distribution\nUtilities, AEP Transmission Holdco and Generation & Marketing segments derive revenue from the following sources: Retail\nRevenues, Wholesale and Competitive Retail Revenues, Other Revenues from Contracts with Customers and Alternative\nRevenues. For further information relating to the sources of revenue for the Registrants, see Note 19 - Revenues from\nContracts with Customers for additional information.\nFINANCING\nGeneral\nAEP subsidiaries generally use short-term debt to finance working capital needs. Short-term debt may also be used to finance\nacquisitions, construction and redemption or repurchase of outstanding securities until such needs can be financed with long-\nterm debt. In recent history, short-term funding needs have been provided for by cash from operations, AEP’s commercial\npaper program and term loan issuances. Funds are made available to subsidiaries under the AEP corporate borrowing\nprogram. Certain public utility subsidiaries of AEP also sell accounts receivable to provide liquidity. See “Financial\nCondition” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the\n2023 Annual Report for additional information.\nAEP’s revolving credit agreements (which backstop the commercial paper program) include covenants and events of default\ntypical for these types of facilities, including a maximum debt/capital test. In addition, the acceleration of AEP’s payment\nobligations, or the obligations of certain of its major subsidiaries, prior to maturity under any other agreement or instrument\nrelating to debt outstanding in excess of $50 million, would cause an event of default under the credit agreements. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, AEP was in compliance with its debt covenants. With the exception of a voluntary bankruptcy or\ninsolvency, any event of default has either or both a cure period or notice requirement before termination of the applicable\nagreement. A voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency of AEP or one of its significant subsidiaries would be considered an\nimmediate termination event. See “Financial Condition” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations included in the 2023 Annual Report for additional information.\nAEP’s subsidiaries have also utilized, and expect to continue to utilize, additional financing arrangements, such as securitization\nfinancings and leasing arrangements.\nENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER MATTERS\nGeneral\nAEP subsidiaries are currently subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities with regard to air and water-quality\ncontrol, solid and hazardous waste disposal and other environmental matters, and are subject to zoning and other regulation by\nlocal authorities. The current and proposed environmental laws and regulations discussed below will have an impact on AEP’s\noperations. Management continues to monitor developments in these regulations and evaluate the economic feasibility and\nrefine cost estimates for compliance. For additional information on the laws and regulations discussed below, see\n“Environmental Issues” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nincluded in the 2023 Annual Report.\nClean Air Act Requirements (CAA)\nThe CAA establishes a comprehensive program to protect and improve the nation’s air quality and control sources of air\nemissions. The states implement and administer many of these programs and could impose additional or more stringent\nrequirements. The primary regulatory programs that continue to drive investments in AEP’s existing generating units include:\n(a) periodic revisions to NAAQS and the development of SIPs to achieve more stringent standards, (b) implementation of the\nregional haze program by the states and the Federal EPA, (c) regulation of hazardous air pollutant emissions under MATS, (d)\nimplementation and review of CSAPR and (e) the Federal EPA’s regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil generation\nunder Section 111 of the CAA.\n3\nClean Water Act Requirements\nThe Federal EPA’s ELG rule for generation facilities establishes limits for FGD wastewater, fly ash and bottom ash transport\nwater and flue gas mercury control wastewater, which are implemented through each facility’s wastewater discharge permit. In\nMarch 2023, the Federal EPA proposed further revisions to the ELG rule which, if finalized, would establish a zero discharge\nstandard for FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water, and more stringent discharge limits for combustion residual\nleachate. Management cannot predict whether the Federal EPA will actually finalize further revisions but will continue to\nmonitor this issue and its potential impact to operations.\nCoal Ash Regulation\nThe Federal EPA’s CCR rule regulates the disposal and beneficial re-use of CCR, including fly ash and bottom ash created\nfrom coal-fired generating units and FGD gypsum generated at some coal-fired plants. The rule applies to active and inactive\nCCR landfills and surface impoundments at facilities of active electric utility or independent power producers. In May 2023, the\nFederal EPA proposed revisions to the CCR Rule to expand the scope of the rule to include inactive impoundments at inactive\nfacilities (“legacy CCR surface impoundments”) as well as to establish requirements for currently exempt solid waste\nmanagement units that involve the direct placement of CCR on the land (“CCR management units”). The Federal EPA is\nproposing that owners and operators of legacy surface impoundments comply with all of the existing CCR Rule requirements\napplicable to inactive CCR surface impoundments at active facilities, except for the location restrictions and liner design\ncriteria. The proposal establishes accelerated compliance deadlines for legacy surface impoundments to meet regulatory\nrequirements, including a requirement to initiate closure within one year after the effective date of the final rule. The Federal\nEPA's proposal would require evaluations to be completed at both active facilities and inactive facilities with one or more\nlegacy surface impoundments. If finalized, AEP may incur material, additional costs complying with the Federal EPA’s\nproposal, including costs to upgrade or close and replace legacy CCR surface impoundments and to conduct any required\nremedial actions including removal of coal ash. In addition, AEP would need to seek cost recovery through regulated rates,\nincluding proposing new regulatory mechanisms for cost recovery, for which regulatory approval cannot be assured. The\nproposed rule, if finalized, could have a material adverse impact on net income, cash flows and financial condition if AEP\ncannot ultimately recover any additional costs of compliance.\nClimate Change, CO Regulation and Energy Policy\n2\nTo date, the Federal EPA has twice taken action to regulate CO emissions from new and existing fossil fueled electric\n2\ngenerating units under the existing provisions of the CAA and both attempts have been struck down by the courts. In May\n2023, the Federal EPA proposed greenhouse gas standards and guidelines for new and existing fossil-fuel fired sources. The\nproposal relies heavily on carbon capture and sequestration and natural gas co-firing as means to reduce CO emissions from\n2\ncoal fired plants and hydrogen co-firing and carbon capture and sequestration to reduce CO emissions from gas turbines.\n2\nManagement is evaluating the proposed rule.\nOther Environmental Issues and Matters\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 imposes costs for environmental\nremediation upon owners and previous owners of sites, as well as transporters and generators of hazardous material disposed of\nat such sites. See “The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (Superfund) and State\nRemediation” section of Note 6 included in the 2023 Annual Report for additional information.\nElectric Industry Transformation\nThe electric utility industry is in the midst of an historic transformation, driven by changing customer needs, evolving public\npolicies, stakeholder demands, demographics, competitive offerings, technologies and commodity prices. AEP is also\ntransforming to be more agile and customer-focused as a valued provider of energy solutions. AEP routinely submits IRPs in\nvarious regulatory jurisdictions to address future generation and capacity needs. These IRPs take into account economics,\ncustomer demand, grid reliability and resilience, regulations and RTO capacity requirements. The objective of the IRPs is to\nrecommend future generation and capacity resources that provide the most cost-efficient and reliable power to customers.\nBased on the results of the IRPs, management expects emissions to continue to decline over time as AEP diversifies generating\nsources and operates fewer coal units. The projected decline in coal-fired generation is due to a number of factors, including\nthe ongoing cost of operating older units, the relative cost of coal and natural gas as fuel sources, increasing environmental\nregulations requiring significant capital investments and changing commodity market fundamentals.\nAs of December 31, 2023, AEP’s generating capacity included owned and PPA capacity of approximately 23,300 MWs and\n5,200 MWs, respectively. In 2023, owned and PPA coal capacity represented 42% of AEP’s generating capacity compared\nwith 70% in 2005.\n4\nThe graph below summarizes AEP’s generating capacity by resource type for the years 1999, 2005 and 2023:\nyticapaC\n80%\n70%\n66%\n60%\n42%\n40%\n27%\n22% 21%\n19%\n20%\n7% 6% 8%\n4% 4%\n1% 1% 2%\n0%\nCoal Natural Gas Nuclear Hydro, Wind, Energy Efficiency/\nSolar & Storage Demand Response (a)\n1999 2005 2023\n(a) Energy Efficiency/Demand Response represents avoided capacity rather than physical assets.\nIn addition, certain states AEP subsidiaries serve have established mandatory or voluntary programs to increase the use of\nenergy efficiency, alternative energy or renewable energy sources. Management actively monitors AEP’s compliance position\nand is on pace to meet the relevant requirements or benchmarks in each applicable jurisdiction.\nAs of December 31, 2023, AEP’s regulated utilities had long-term contracts for 2,750 MWs of wind, 80 MWs of hydro and 65\nMWs of solar power. Additionally, as of December 31, 2023, AEP’s regulated utilities own and operate 1,639 MWs of wind,\n816 MWs of hydro and 41 MWs of solar power.\nEnd Use Energy Efficiency\nBeginning in 2008, AEP ramped up efforts to reduce energy consumption and peak demand through the introduction of\nadditional energy efficiency and demand response programs. These programs, commonly and collectively referred to as\ndemand side management, were implemented in jurisdictions where appropriate cost recovery was available. Since that time,\nAEP operating company programs have reduced annual consumption by over 10.5 million MWhs and peak demand by\napproximately 3,600 MWs. Management estimates that its operating companies spent approximately $1.7 billion since 2008 to\nachieve these levels.\nEnergy efficiency and demand reduction programs have received regulatory support in most of the states AEP serves, and\nappropriate cost recovery will be essential for AEP operating companies to continue and expand these consumer offerings.\nAppropriate recovery of program costs, lost revenues, and an opportunity to earn a reasonable return ensures that energy\nefficiency programs are considered equally with supply side investments. As AEP continues to transition to a cleaner, more\nefficient energy future, energy efficiency and demand response programs will continue to play an important role in how the\ncompany serves its customers.\nManagement believes its experience providing robust energy efficiency programs in several states positions AEP to be a cost-\neffective provider of these programs as states develop their implementation plans.\n5\nCorporate Governance\nIn response to environmental issues and in connection with its assessment of AEP’s strategic plan, the Board of Directors\ncontinually reviews the risks posed by new environmental rules and requirements that could alter the retirement date of coal-\nfired generation assets. The Board of Directors is informed of new environmental regulations and proposed environmental\nregulations or legislation that would significantly affect AEP. In addition, the Board holds extended meetings twice a year to\nprovide extra time for a more robust review of the Company’s strategy, including discussions about carbon and carbon risk.\nThe Board’s Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance oversees AEP’s annual Corporate Sustainability Report, which\nincludes information about AEP’s environmental, social, governance and financial performance. In 2023, AEP also established\na Climate Change Executive Group to ensure appropriate management and accountability concerning climate-related impacts,\nrisks and opportunities.\nAEP routinely submits IRPs in various regulatory jurisdictions to address future generation and capacity needs. These IRPs\ntake into account economics, customer demand, grid reliability and resilience, regulations and RTO capacity requirements. The\nobjective of the IRPs is to recommend future generation and capacity resources that provide the most cost-efficient and reliable\npower to customers. Based on the output of the company’s IRPs, in October 2022, AEP announced new intermediate and long-\nterm CO emission reduction goals. AEP adjusted its near-term CO emission reduction target from a 2000 baseline to a 2005\n2 2\nbaseline, upgraded its 80% reduction by 2030 target to include full Scope 1 emissions and accelerated its net-zero goal by five\nyears to 2045 for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. AEP’s total Scope 1 GHG estimated emissions in 2023 were approximately\n42.8 million metric tons, a 68% reduction according to the GHG Protocol, which excludes emission reductions that result from\nassets that have been sold, or a 72% reduction from AEP’s 2005 Scope 1 GHG emissions (inclusive of emission reductions that\nresult from plants that have been sold).\nAEP has made significant progress in reducing CO emissions from its power generation fleet and expects its emissions to\n2\ncontinue to decline over the long-term. AEP also expects Scope 1 GHG emissions to vary annually depending on the mix of its\nown generation and purchased power used to serve customers. AEP’s ability to achieve these goals is dependent upon a\nnumber of factors including the ability to execute on renewable resource plans, evolving RTO requirements, constructive\nregulatory support, the advancement of carbon-free generation technologies, customer demand for carbon-free energy, potential\ntariffs, carbon policy and regulation, operational performance of renewable generation and supply chain costs and constraints,\nall while continuing to provide the most cost-efficient and reliable power to customers.\nHUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nAttracting, developing and retaining high-performing employees with the skills and experience needed to serve our customers\nefficiently and effectively is crucial to AEP’s growth and competitiveness and is central to our long-term strategy. AEP invests\nin employees and continues to build a high performance and inclusive culture that inspires leadership, encourages innovative\nthinking and welcomes everyone.\nThe following table shows AEP’s number of employees by subsidiary as of December 31, 2023:\nNumber of\nSubsidiary Employees\nAEPSC 6,736\nAEP Texas 1,646\nAPCo 1,679\nI&M 2,110\nOPCo 1,752\nPSO 1,062\nSWEPCo 1,344\nOther 921\nTotal AEP 17,250\nOf AEP’s 17,250 employees, less than 0.1% are Traditionalists (born before 1946), approximately 17% are Baby Boomers\n(born 1946-1964), approximately 36% are Generation X (born 1965-1980), approximately 39% are Millennials (born\n1981-1996) and approximately 7% are Generation Z (born after 1996).\n6\nSafety\nSafety is deeply embedded in our culture and is one of AEP’s core values because we care that everyone goes home at the end\nof each work day. We have policies, procedures, programs, training and proactive initiatives in place to help ensure a safe\nmindset and work environment. Unfortunately, in 2023, we suffered three devastating losses as two employees and one\ncontractor lost their lives. The loss of a single life is unacceptable and we are determined to learn from each event,\nindependently, so we can take action to better protect our employees and all those who support us. These events reinforce the\nimportance of our endless commitment to a strong safety culture and the work it takes to operate safely. We are committed to\ntaking bold steps to fundamentally embed layers of protection in the work we do. This includes focusing our efforts to prevent\nserious injuries and fatalities, strengthening pre-job briefing effectiveness, learning from significant incidents, providing\nappropriate training and education and improving proactive safety initiatives and data analysis to identify and address potential\nperformance gaps. One common industry safety metric utilized by AEP to track incidents is the Days Away/Restricted or\nTransferred (DART) rate. A DART event is an event that results in one or more lost days, one or more restricted days, or results\nin an employee transferring to a different job within the company. The DART rate is a mathematical calculation (number of\nDART events multiplied by 200,000 and divided by total YTD hours worked) that describes the number of injuries per 100 full-\ntime employees. In 2023, AEP’s employee DART rate performance improved to 0.384 as compared to 0.424 in 2022.\nCulture and Inclusion\nCulture serves as the foundation for success at AEP. An engaged, collaborative, inclusive and appreciated workforce is an\nempowered workforce – one that is more likely to embrace change, drive continuous improvement, take ownership, and value\npersonal and professional growth. AEP views a culture of inclusion as a core business value that creates understanding, sparks\ninnovation and allows us to better serve our customers. We are committed to building a work culture that champions respect\nand belonging, that leverages our differences as a strength. Inclusion is important to ensuring that AEP has the best talent to\nmove our company forward and achieve business objectives. Our inclusion efforts are guided by four principles:\n• Establishing leadership accountability around culture and inclusion outcomes.\n• Building and maintaining a workforce that generally reflects the communities we serve.\n• Promoting an inclusive culture where all employees can thrive.\n• Supporting the communities we serve so they will prosper.\nWe believe our workforce generally should reflect the diversity of our customers and the communities we serve so that we may\nbetter understand how to tailor our services to meet their expectations. As of December 31, 2023, women comprised\napproximately 20% of AEP’s total workforce. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 21% of AEP’s total workforce was\nrepresented by racially or ethnically diverse employees.\nOur progress is tied to enterprise, business unit and operating company annual incentive compensation objectives, which is\nmeasured through our annual employee culture survey. 2023 marks our tenth consecutive year of formally surveying\nemployees about their experiences with culture at AEP. In 2023, 94% of our organization participated in the survey, and we\ncontinued to improve our performance remaining in the top decile compared to Gallup’s overall company database. The culture\nsurvey provides a process for leaders to share results with their teams, facilitate discussions to improve employee engagement\nand take actions toward that improvement throughout the year. AEP’s Human Resources Committee of the Board reviews the\nculture and employee engagement results annually, providing additional oversight. In addition, the Human Resources\nCommittee of the Board provides oversight of our compensation and human resources policies and practices, including an\nannual review of our culture and inclusion strategy, and compliance with equal opportunity laws. In 2023, AEP received the\nGallup Exceptional Workplace Award for the fourth consecutive year. This award recognizes organizations with engaged\nworkplace cultures.\nTo support a culture of inclusion, AEP launched the Culture and Inclusion Council, which consists of decision makers from\nacross the company to help lead our culture strategy. A key focus for the council will be prioritizing our Culture & Inclusion\nguiding principles. In addition, AEP launched the Access to Opportunity standards to enhance female and minority\nrepresentation within AEP’s leadership and conducted pay equity studies to identify and address pay variances for female and\nminority employees. We are also signatories of the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion pledge, Paradigm for Parity and\nseveral other local and industry initiatives to demonstrate our commitment to advancing a culture of inclusion within the\nworkplace.\nIn addition, we’re committed to working with the communities we serve to advance equity for our employees, customers and\nneighbors of color. The American Electric Power Foundation created the Delivering on the Dream grant program. This five-\nyear, $5 million initial investment supports nonprofit organizations that are working to dismantle systemic racism and injustices\nin our communities.\n7\nEmployee Resource Groups\nOne of the best ways for AEP to demonstrate our commitment to a trusting and inclusive work environment is to empower\nemployees to form and participate in Employee Resource Groups (ERG). The ERGs at AEP include Abled and Differently-\nAbled Partnering Together, the Black ERG, the Asian-American Employee Partnership ERG, the Hispanic Origin Latin\nAmerican ERG, the Military Veteran ERG, the Native American Tribes Interacting, Observing and Networking ERG, the Pride\nPartnership, the Women at Work ERG and the Empowered Parents and Caregivers ERG. Encouraging engagement through one\nof our nine ERGs creates meaningful connections through shared experiences and learning about different cultures and lived\nexperiences for deeper understanding and knowledge. Their strategic priorities include recruiting and retaining diverse\nemployees, identifying and participating in community volunteerism opportunities, building cultural competency among our\nemployees and positively impacting the business.\nTraining and Professional Development\nAt AEP, we are preparing our workforce for the future by providing opportunities to learn new skills and engaging higher\neducation institutions to better prepare the next generation with the skills that we will need. AEP has a growing co-op and\ninternship program for high school and college students. Our alliances with community colleges, universities and vocational\nand technical schools across our 11-state service territory support the development of our talent pipeline. We work with these\ninstitutions to develop academic programs that will prepare students for new jobs and career opportunities in our industry. AEP\nalso provides a broad range of training and assistance that supports lifelong learning and transition development. This is\nespecially important as we move closer toward a digital future that requires a more flexible, innovative and diverse workforce.\nAEP has robust processes to achieve this, including ongoing performance coaching, operational skills training, resources to\nsupport our commitment to environment, safety and health, job progression training, tuition assistance, and other forms of\ntraining that help employees improve their skills and become better leaders.\nIn 2023, AEP employees completed more than 806,000 hours of training in programs for which we track participation. In\naddition, AEP invested more than $2 million in employee education, supporting approximately 560 employees through our\ntuition reimbursement program.\nCompensation and Benefits\nAEP is committed to the well-being of our employees and we offer programs to foster employee financial security; physical and\nemotional health; and social connectedness. We provide market competitive compensation and benefits that support our\nemployees and their families to help them thrive at home and work. We ensure the pay we offer is competitive in the\nmarketplace by pricing many of our positions using robust compensation survey information. Nearly all AEP employees\nparticipate in an annual incentive program that rewards individual performance and achievement of business goals, which\nfosters a high-performance culture. AEP also offers paid time off in the form of vacation, holidays, sick time and parental\nleave. The company’s employee assistance plan, medical and dental coverage, life insurance and well-being program help\nemployees and their families stay healthy and feeling their best. Additionally, AEP’s retirement programs position our\nemployees for financial stability in retirement.\nLabor Relations\nNearly one fourth of AEP’s workforce is represented by labor unions. We value the relationships we have with our union\nrepresented employees and believe in a trusting, collaborative and respectful partnership. We continuously work to strengthen\nthese relationships to ensure we have a culture that attracts and supports employees who can adapt to the rapid changes\noccurring in our company and industry. Our relationship with labor unions is critical to meeting the growing expectations of our\ncustomers and adapting to the challenges of rapidly changing technologies.\n8\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\nAEP’s Reportable Segments\nAEP’s primary business is the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity. Within its Vertically Integrated Utilities\nsegment, AEP centrally dispatches generation assets and manages its overall utility operations on an integrated basis because of\nthe substantial impact of cost-based rates and regulatory oversight. Intersegment sales and transfers are generally based on\nunderlying contractual arrangements and agreements. AEP’s reportable segments are as follows:\n• Vertically Integrated Utilities\n• Transmission and Distribution Utilities\n• AEP Transmission Holdco\n• Generation & Marketing\nThe remainder of AEP’s activities is presented as Corporate and Other, which is not considered a reportable segment. See Note\n9 - Business Segments included in the 2023 Annual Report for additional information on AEP’s segments.\nSeasonality\nThe consumption and delivery of electric power is generally seasonal which impacts the results of operations of AEP’s\nreportable segments. In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices\nalso peaking at that time. In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter. The pattern of this fluctuation may change\ndue to the nature and location of AEP’s facilities and the terms of power sale contracts into which AEP enters. In addition,\nAEP has historically sold and delivered less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are milder.\nUnusually mild weather in the future could diminish AEP’s results of operations. In Texas, unusually mild weather in the\nfuture could diminish AEP’s results of operations. Conversely, unusually extreme weather conditions could increase AEP’s\nresults of operations.\nVERTICALLY INTEGRATED UTILITIES\nGENERAL\nAEP’s vertically integrated utility operations are engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity for sale\nto retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by AEGCo, APCo, I&M, KGPCo, KPCo, PSO, SWEPCo\nand WPCo. AEPSC, as agent for AEP’s public utility subsidiaries, performs marketing, generation dispatch, fuel procurement\nand power-related risk management and trading activities on behalf of each of these subsidiaries.\nELECTRIC GENERATION\nFacilities\nAs of December 31, 2023, AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries owned approximately 23,000 MWs of\ngeneration. See Item 2 – Properties for more information regarding the generation capacity of vertically integrated public utility\nsubsidiaries.\nFuel Supply\nThe following table shows the owned and leased generation sources by type (including wind purchase agreements), on an actual\nnet generation (MWhs) basis, used by the Vertically Integrated Utilities:\n2023 2022 2021\nCoal and Lignite 37% 43% 50%\nNuclear 22% 21% 22%\nNatural Gas 22% 19% 16%\nRenewables 19% 17% 12%\nAn increase/decrease in one or more generation types relative to previous years reflects the addition of renewable resources,\nretirement of traditional fossil fuel units and price changes in one or more fuel commodity sources relative to the pricing of\nother fuel commodity sources. AEP’s overall 2023 fossil fuel costs for the Vertically Integrated Utilities decreased 28.3% on a\ndollar per MMBtu basis from 2022.\n9\nCoal and Lignite\nAEP’s Vertically Integrated Utilities procure coal and lignite under a combination of purchasing arrangements including long-\nterm contracts, affiliate operations and spot agreements with various producers, marketers and coal trading firms. Coal and\nlignite consumption decreased 23.9% in 2023 (exclusive of fuel oil) from 2022 due to a combination of the retirement of the\nPirkey Power Plant in March 2023 and lower generation at the coal fired power plants due to a significant decline in natural gas\nprices. AEP’s Vertically Integrated Utilities operations no longer use lignite as a fuel source after the retirement of the Pirkey\nPower Plant.\nManagement projects that the Vertically Integrated Utilities will be able to secure and transport coal of adequate quality and\nquantities to operate their coal fired units. As of December 31, 2023, through subsidiaries, AEP owns, leases or controls 3,180\nrailcars, 319 barges, 4 towboats and a coal handling terminal with approximately 18 million tons of annual capacity to move\nand store coal for use in AEP generating facilities. AEP will procure additional railcar and barge/towboat capacity as needed\nbased on demand.\nThe market price for coal began 2023 elevated as compared to recent years, but declined and stabilized as the year progressed.\nAlthough the price of coal in 2023 was lower as compared to 2021 and 2022, the price of coal in 2023 is still higher than\nhistorical prices prior to 2021. Coal prices are currently projected to remain at these levels due to increased mining costs\nexperienced over the last few years. AEP’s strategy for purchasing coal includes layering in supplies over time to help with\nreducing price volatility. The price impact of this process is reflected in subsequent years when the coal is delivered. The price\npaid for coal and lignite delivered in 2023 increased approximately 14.5% from 2022 mainly due to the increase in coal prices\ncontracted in prior years. With the elevated prices for coal contracted in 2021 and 2022, management anticipates that delivered\ncoal prices will continue to be higher over the next few years.\nThe following table shows the amount of coal and lignite delivered to the Vertically Integrated Utilities’ plants during the past\nthree years and the average delivered price of coal and lignite purchased by the Vertically Integrated Utilities:\n2023 2022 2021\nTotal coal and lignite delivered to the plants (in millions of tons) 20.9 20.4 18.2\nAverage cost per ton of coal and lignite delivered $ 64.31 $ 56.16 $ 50.76\nThe coal supplies at the Vertically Integrated Utilities plants vary from time to time depending on various factors, including, but\nnot limited to, demand for electric power, unit outages, transportation infrastructure limitations, space limitations, coal\nconsumption rates, labor issues, supplier outages and issues and weather conditions, all of which may interrupt or slow\nproduction, consumption or deliveries. As of December 31, 2023, the Vertically Integrated Utilities’ coal inventory was\napproximately 82 days of full load burn. Inventory levels grew significantly in 2023 due to mild weather conditions, lower\ndemand for electric power and a decline in natural gas prices. Management expects inventory levels to remain elevated in 2024\ndue to many of these same factors. While inventory targets vary by plant and are changed as necessary, the current coal\ninventory target for the Vertically Integrated Utilities is approximately 34 days of full load burn.\nNatural Gas\nThe Vertically Integrated Utilities consumed approximately 146 billion cubic feet of natural gas during 2023 for generating\npower. This represents an increase of 15.8% from 2022. Several of AEP’s natural gas-fired power plants are connected to at\nleast two pipelines which allow greater access to competitive supplies and improve delivery reliability. From a natural gas\nsupply perspective, the Vertically Integrated Utilities utilize daily spot market purchases, as well as longer-term arrangements\nincluding monthly baseload, forward month baseload, seasonal baseload and long-term firm purchases. From a natural gas\ntransportation perspective, the Vertically Integrated Utilities utilize firm and interruptible transportation capacity. AEP’s\nnatural gas supply, transportation and storage transactions are competitively bid and are based on current market prices.\nThe following table shows the amount of natural gas delivered to the Vertically Integrated Utilities’ plants during the past three\nyears and the average delivered price of natural gas purchased by the Vertically Integrated Utilities:\n2023 2022 2021\nTotal natural gas delivered to the plants (in billions cubic feet) 146.0 126.0 108.0\nAverage delivered price per MMBtu of purchased natural gas $ 2.69 $ 6.94 $ 8.92\n10\nNuclear\nI&M has made commitments to meet the current nuclear fuel requirements of the Cook Plant. I&M has made and will make\npurchases of uranium in various forms in the spot, short-term and mid-term markets.\nFor purposes of the storage of high-level radioactive waste in the form of SNF, I&M completed modifications to its SNF\nstorage pool in the early 1990’s. I&M entered into an agreement to provide for onsite dry cask storage of SNF to permit normal\noperations to continue. I&M is scheduled to conduct further dry cask loading and storage projects on an ongoing periodic\nbasis. The year of expiration of each NRC Operating License is 2034 for Unit 1 and 2037 for Unit 2. Management is currently\nevaluating applying for license extensions for both units.\nNuclear Waste and Decommissioning\nAs the owner of the Cook Plant, I&M has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of SNF and decommission and\ndecontaminate the plant safely. The cost to decommission a nuclear plant is affected by NRC regulations and the SNF disposal\nprogram. The most recent decommissioning cost study was completed in 2021. The estimated cost of decommissioning and\ndisposal of low-level radioactive waste for the Cook Plant was $2.2 billion in 2021 non-discounted dollars, with additional\nongoing estimated costs of $7 million per year for post decommissioning storage of SNF and an eventual estimated cost of $33\nmillion for the subsequent decommissioning of the spent fuel storage facility, also in 2021 non-discounted dollars. As of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the total decommissioning trust fund balance for the Cook Plant was approximately $3.5 billion\nand $3 billion, respectively. The balance of funds available to eventually decommission Cook Plant will differ based on\ncontributions and investment returns. The ultimate cost of retiring the Cook Plant may be materially different from estimates\nand funding targets as a result of the:\n• Escalation of various cost elements (including, but not limited to, general inflation and the cost of energy).\n• Further development of regulatory requirements governing decommissioning.\n• Technology available at the time of decommissioning differing significantly from that assumed in studies.\n• Availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities.\n• Availability of a United States Department of Energy facility for permanent storage of SNF.\nAccordingly, management is unable to provide assurance that the ultimate cost of decommissioning the Cook Plant will not be\nsignificantly different than current projections. AEP will seek recovery from customers through regulated rates if actual\ndecommissioning costs exceed projections. See the “Nuclear Contingencies” section of Note 6 - Commitments, Guarantees and\nContingencies included in the 2023 Annual Report for additional information with respect to nuclear waste and\ndecommissioning.\nLow-Level Radioactive Waste\nThe Low-Level Waste Policy Act of 1980 mandates that the responsibility for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste rests\nwith the individual states. Low-level radioactive waste consists largely of ordinary refuse and other items that have come in\ncontact with radioactive materials. Michigan does not currently have a disposal site for such waste available. I&M cannot\npredict when such a site may be available. However, the states of Utah and Texas have licensed low-level radioactive waste\ndisposal sites which currently accept low-level radioactive waste from Michigan waste generators. There is currently no set\ndate limiting I&M’s access to either of these facilities. The Cook Plant has a facility onsite designed specifically for the storage\nof low-level radioactive waste. In the event that low-level radioactive waste disposal facility access becomes unavailable, it can\nbe stored onsite at this facility.\nCounterparty Risk Management\nThe Vertically Integrated Utilities segment also sells power and enters into related energy transactions with wholesale\ncustomers and other market participants. As a result, counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related\ninstruments to be deposited on transactions as margin against open positions. As of December 31, 2023, counterparties posted\napproximately $36 million in cash, cash equivalents or letters of credit with AEPSC for the benefit of AEP’s public utility\nsubsidiaries (while, as of that date, AEP’s public utility subsidiaries posted approximately $200 million with counterparties and\nexchanges). Since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities, exposures change\ndaily. See the “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” section of Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2023 Annual Report for additional information.\n11\nCertain Power Agreements\nI&M\nA UPA between AEGCo and I&M (the I&M Power Agreement) provides for the sale by AEGCo to I&M of all the power (and\nthe energy associated therewith) available to AEGCo at the Rockport Plant unless it is sold to another utility. I&M is obligated,\nwhether or not power is available from AEGCo, to pay as a demand charge for the right to receive such power (and as an\nenergy charge for any associated energy taken by I&M) net of amounts received by AEGCo from any other sources, sufficient\nto enable AEGCo to pay all of its operating and other expenses, including a rate of return on the common equity of AEGCo as\napproved by the FERC. The UPA will continue in effect until the debt obligations of AEGCo secured by the Rockport Plant\nhave been satisfied and discharged (currently expected to be December 2028).\nIn April 2021, AEGCo and I&M executed an agreement to purchase 100% of the interests in Rockport Plant, Unit 2 effective at\nthe end of the lease term on December 7, 2022. Prior to the termination of the lease, I&M assigned 30% of the power to\nKPCo. Beginning December 8, 2022, AEGCo billed 100% of its share of the Rockport Plant to I&M and ceased billing to\nKPCo. KPCo reached an agreement with I&M, from the end of the lease through May 2024, to buy capacity from Rockport\nPlant, Unit 2 through the PCA at a rate equal to PJM’s RPM clearing price. See the “Unit Power Agreements” section of Note\n16 - Related Party Transactions for additional information.\nOVEC\nAEP and several nonaffiliated utility companies jointly own OVEC. The aggregate equity participation of AEP in OVEC is\n43.47%. Parent owns 39.17% and OPCo owns 4.3%. Under the Inter-Company Power Agreement (ICPA), which defines the\nrights of the owners and sets the power participation ratio of each, the sponsoring companies are entitled to receive and are\nobligated to pay for all OVEC capacity (approximately 2,400 MWs) in proportion to their respective power participation ratios.\nThe aggregate power participation ratio of APCo, I&M and OPCo is 43.47%. The ICPA terminates in June 2040. The\nproceeds from charges by OVEC to sponsoring companies under the ICPA based on their power participation ratios are\ndesigned to be sufficient for OVEC to meet its operating expenses and fixed costs. OVEC’s Board of Directors, as elected by\nAEP and nonaffiliated owners, has authorized environmental investments related to their ownership interests, with resulting\nexpenses (including for related debt and interest thereon) included in charges under the ICPA. OVEC financed capital\nexpenditures in excess of $1 billion in connection with flue gas desulfurization projects and the associated scrubber waste\ndisposal landfills at its two generation plants through debt issuances, including tax-advantaged debt issuances. Both OVEC\ngeneration plants are operating with the environmental controls in-service. See Note 17 - Variable Interest Entities and Equity\nMethod Investments for additional information.\nELECTRIC DELIVERY\nGeneral\nOther than AEGCo, AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries own and operate transmission and distribution lines\nand other facilities to deliver electric power. See Item 2 – Properties for more information regarding the transmission and\ndistribution lines. Most of the transmission and distribution services are sold to retail customers of AEP’s vertically integrated\npublic utility subsidiaries in their service territories. These sales are made at rates approved by the state utility commissions of\nthe states in which they operate, and in some instances, approved by the FERC. See Item 1. Business – Vertically Integrated\nUtilities – Regulation – Rates. The FERC regulates and approves the rates for both wholesale transmission transactions and\nwholesale generation contracts. The use and the recovery of costs associated with the transmission assets of the AEP vertically\nintegrated public utility subsidiaries are subject to the rules, principles, protocols and agreements in place with PJM and SPP,\nand as approved by the FERC. See Item 1. Business – Vertically Integrated Utilities – Regulation – FERC. As discussed\nbelow, some transmission services also are separately sold to nonaffiliated companies.\nOther than AEGCo, AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights to provide electric\nservice in various municipalities and regions in their service areas. In some cases, these franchises provide the utility with the\nexclusive right to provide electric service within a specific territory. These franchises have varying provisions and expiration\ndates. In general, the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business. For a\ndiscussion of competition in the sale of power, see Item 1. Business – Vertically Integrated Utilities – Competition.\n12\nTransmission Agreement\nAPCo, I&M, KGPCo, KPCo and WPCo own and operate transmission facilities that are used to provide transmission service\nunder the PJM OATT and are parties to the TA. OPCo, which is a subsidiary in AEP’s Transmission and Distribution Utilities\nsegment that provides transmission service under the PJM OATT, is also a party to the TA. The TA defines how the parties to\nthe agreement share the revenues associated with their transmission facilities and the costs of transmission service provided by\nPJM. The TA has been approved by the FERC.\nTransmission Coordination Agreement and Open Access Transmission Tariff\nPSO, SWEPCo and AEPSC are parties to the TCA. Under the TCA, a coordinating committee is charged with the\nresponsibility of: (a) overseeing the coordinated planning of the transmission facilities of the parties to the agreement, including\nthe performance of transmission planning studies, (b) the interaction of such subsidiaries with independent system operators\nand other regional bodies interested in transmission planning and (c) compliance with the terms of the OATT filed with the\nFERC and the rules of the FERC relating to such tariff. Pursuant to the TCA, AEPSC has responsibility for monitoring the\nreliability of their transmission systems and administering the OATT on behalf of the other parties to the agreement. The TCA\nalso provides for the allocation among the parties of revenues collected for transmission and ancillary services provided under\nthe OATT. These allocations have been determined by the FERC-approved OATT for the SPP.\nRegional Transmission Organizations\nAEGCo, APCo, I&M, KGPCo, KPCo and WPCo are members of PJM, and PSO and SWEPCo are members of SPP (both\nFERC-approved RTOs). RTOs operate, plan and control utility transmission assets in a manner designed to provide open\naccess to such assets in a way that prevents discrimination between participants owning transmission assets and those that do\nnot.\nREGULATION\nGeneral\nAEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries’ retail rates and certain other matters are subject to traditional cost-based\nregulation by the state utility commissions. AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also subject to regulation\nby the FERC under the Federal Power Act with respect to wholesale power and transmission service transactions. I&M is\nsubject to regulation by the NRC under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, with respect to the operation of the Cook\nPlant. AEP and its vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also subject to the regulatory provisions of, much of the\nEnergy Policy Act of 2005, which is administered by the FERC.\nRates\nHistorically, state utility commissions have established electric service rates on a cost-of-service basis, which is designed to\nallow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in\nproviding that service. A utility’s cost-of-service generally reflects its operating expenses, including operation and maintenance\nexpense, depreciation expense and taxes. State utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of: (a) a\nutility’s adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and (b) such utility’s level of investment. Absent a legal\nlimitation, such as a law limiting the frequency of rate changes or capping rates for a period of time, a state utility commission\ncan review and change rates on its own initiative. Some states may initiate reviews at the request of a utility, customer,\ngovernmental or other representative of a group of customers. Such parties may, however, agree with one another not to\nrequest reviews of or changes to rates for a specified period of time.\nPublic utilities have traditionally financed capital investments until the new asset is placed in-service. Provided the asset was\nfound to be a prudent investment, it was then added to rate base and entitled to a return through rate recovery. Given long lead\ntimes in construction, the high costs of plant and equipment and volatile capital markets, management actively pursues\nstrategies to accelerate rate recognition of investments and cash flow. AEP representatives continue to engage state\ncommissioners and legislators on alternative rate-making options to reduce regulatory lag and enhance certainty in the\nprocess. These options include pre-approvals, a return on construction work in progress, rider/trackers, formula rates and the\ninclusion of future test-year projections into rates.\n13\nThe rates of AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are generally based on the cost of providing traditional\nbundled electric service (i.e., generation, transmission and distribution service). Historically, the state regulatory frameworks in\nthe service area of the AEP vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries reflected specified fuel costs as part of bundled (or,\nmore recently, unbundled) rates or incorporated fuel adjustment clauses in a utility’s rates and tariffs. Fuel adjustment clauses\npermit periodic adjustments to fuel cost recovery from customers and therefore provide protection against exposure to fuel cost\nchanges.\nThe following state-by-state analysis summarizes the regulatory environment of certain major jurisdictions in which AEP’s\nvertically integrated public utility subsidiaries operate. Several public utility subsidiaries operate in more than one\njurisdiction. See Note 4 - Rate Matters included in the 2023 Annual Report for more information regarding pending rate\nmatters.\nIndiana\nI&M provides retail electric service in Indiana at bundled rates approved by the IURC, with rates set on a forecasted cost-of-\nservice basis. Indiana provides for timely fuel and purchased power cost recovery through respective fuel and purchased power\nrecovery mechanisms.\nOklahoma\nPSO provides retail electric service in Oklahoma at bundled rates approved by the OCC. PSO’s rates are set on a cost-of-\nservice basis. Fuel and purchased energy costs are recovered or refunded through a fuel adjustment clause.\nVirginia\nAPCo currently provides retail electric service in Virginia at unbundled generation and distribution rates approved by the\nVirginia SCC. Virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through a fuel cost recovery mechanism. In addition\nto base rates and fuel cost recovery, APCo is permitted to recover a variety of costs through rate adjustment clauses including\ntransmission services provided at OATT rates based on rates established by the FERC.\nWest Virginia\nAPCo and WPCo provide retail electric service at bundled rates approved by the WVPSC, with rates set on a combined cost-of-\nservice basis. West Virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs, purchased power costs and transmission\nexpenses through the ENEC which trues-up to actual expenses. See “ENEC Filings” section of Note 4 - Rate Matters included\nin the 2023 Annual Report for additional information. In addition to base rates and fuel cost recovery, APCo and WPCo are\npermitted to recover a variety of costs through surcharges.\nFERC\nThe FERC regulates rates for interstate power sales at wholesale, transmission of electric power, accounting and other matters,\nincluding construction and operation of hydroelectric projects. The FERC regulations require AEP’s vertically integrated\npublic utility subsidiaries to provide open access transmission service at FERC-approved rates, and AEP has approved cost-\nbased formula transmission rates on file at the FERC. The FERC also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail\ncustomers. In addition, the FERC regulates the sale of power for resale in interstate commerce by: (a) approving contracts for\nwholesale sales to municipal and cooperative utilities at cost-based rates and (b) granting authority to public utilities to sell\npower at wholesale at market-based rates upon a showing that the seller lacks the ability to improperly influence market prices.\nAEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries have market-based rate authority from the FERC, under which much of\ntheir wholesale marketing activity takes place. The FERC requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate\ntransmission facilities, directly or through an RTO, to file an open access network and point-to-point transmission tariff that\noffers services comparable to the utility’s own uses of its transmission system. The FERC also requires all transmitting\nutilities, directly or through an RTO, to establish an Open Access Same-time Information System, which electronically posts\ntransmission information such as available capacity and prices, and requires utilities to comply with Standards of Conduct that\nprohibit utilities’ transmission employees from providing non-public transmission information to the utility’s marketing\nemployees. Additionally, the vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are subject to mandatory reliability standards\npromulgated by the NERC, with the approval of the FERC, which standards protect the nation’s bulk power system against\npotential disruptions from cyber and physical security breaches.\nThe FERC oversees RTOs, entities created to operate, plan and control utility transmission assets. AEGCo, APCo, I&M,\nKGPCo, KPCo and WPCo are members of PJM. PSO and SWEPCo are members of SPP.\nThe FERC has jurisdiction over certain issuances of securities of most of AEP’s public utility subsidiaries, the acquisition of\nsecurities of utilities, the acquisition or sale of certain utility assets and mergers with another electric utility or holding\n14\ncompany. In addition, both the FERC and state regulators are permitted to review the books and records of any company\nwithin a holding company system.\nCOMPETITION\nAEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries primarily generate, transmit and distribute electricity to retail customers of\nAEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries in their service territories. These sales are made at rates approved by the\nstate utility commissions of the states in which they operate, and in some instances, approved by the FERC, and are not subject\nto competition from other vertically integrated public utilities. Other than AEGCo, AEP’s vertically integrated public utility\nsubsidiaries hold franchises or other rights that effectively grant the exclusive ability to provide electric service in various\nmunicipalities and regions in their service areas.\nAEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries compete with self-generation and with distributors of other energy\nsources, such as natural gas, fuel oil, renewables and coal, within their service areas. The primary factors in such competition\nare price, reliability of service and the capability of customers to utilize alternative sources of energy other than electric power.\nWith respect to competing generators and self-generation, the public utility subsidiaries of AEP believe that they currently\nmaintain a competitive position.\nChanges in regulatory policies and advances in newer technologies for batteries or energy storage, fuel cells, microturbines,\nwind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with\nsome central station electricity production. The costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular have continued to become\nincreasingly competitive. The ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable operations and to provide cost-\neffective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of AEP’s competitiveness.\nTRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION UTILITIES\nGENERAL\nThis segment consists of the transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets\nowned and operated by AEP Texas and OPCo.\nAEP’s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities\nto deliver electric power. See Item 2 – Properties, for more information regarding the transmission and distribution\nlines. Transmission and distribution services are sold to retail customers of AEP’s transmission and distribution utility\nsubsidiaries in their service territories. These sales are made at rates approved by the PUCT for AEP Texas and by the PUCO\nand the FERC for OPCo. The FERC regulates and approves the rates for wholesale transmission transactions. As discussed\nbelow, some transmission services also are separately sold to nonaffiliated companies.\nAEP’s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in various\nmunicipalities and regions in their service areas. In some cases, these franchises provide the utility with the exclusive right to\nprovide electric service. These franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates. In general, the operating companies\nconsider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business.\nThe use and the recovery of costs associated with the transmission assets of the AEP transmission and distribution utility\nsubsidiaries are subject to the rules, protocols and agreements in place with PJM and ERCOT, and as approved by the\nFERC. In addition to providing transmission services in connection with power sales in their service areas, AEP’s transmission\nand distribution utility subsidiaries also provide transmission services for nonaffiliated companies through RTOs.\nTransmission Agreement\nOPCo owns and operates transmission facilities that are used to provide transmission service under the PJM OATT; OPCo is a\nparty to the TA with other utility subsidiary affiliates. The TA defines how the parties to the agreement share the revenues\nassociated with their transmission facilities and the costs of transmission service provided by PJM. The TA has been approved\nby the FERC.\nRegional Transmission Organizations\nOPCo is a member of PJM, a FERC-approved RTO. RTOs operate, plan and control utility transmission assets to provide open\naccess to such assets in a way that prevents discrimination between participants owning transmission assets and those that do\nnot. AEP Texas is a member of ERCOT.\n15\nREGULATION\nOPCo provides distribution and transmission services to retail customers within its service territory at cost-based rates approved\nby the PUCO or by the FERC. AEP Texas sets its rates through a combination of base rate cases and interim Transmission\nCost of Services (TCOS) and Distribution Cost Recovery Factor (DCRF) filings. AEP Texas may file interim TCOS and\nDCRF filings semi-annually to update its rates to reflect changes in its net invested capital. Transmission and distribution rates\nare established on a cost-of-service basis, which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing\nservice and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service. The cost-of-service generally reflects\noperating expenses, including operation and maintenance expense, depreciation expense and taxes. Utility commissions\nperiodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of: (a) a utility’s adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and\n(b) such utility’s level of investment.\nFERC\nThe FERC regulates rates for transmission of electric power, accounting and other matters. The FERC regulations require AEP\nto provide open access transmission service at FERC-approved rates, and it has approved cost-based formula transmission rates\non file at the FERC. The FERC also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers. The FERC requires each\npublic utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to, directly or through an RTO, file an open access network\nand point-to-point transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utility’s own uses of its transmission system. The\nFERC also requires all transmitting utilities, directly or through an RTO, to establish an Open Access Same-time Information\nSystem, which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices, and requires utilities to\ncomply with Standards of Conduct that prohibit utilities’ transmission employees from providing non-public transmission\ninformation to the utility’s marketing employees. In addition, both the FERC and state regulators are permitted to review the\nbooks and records of any company within a holding company system. Additionally, the transmission and distribution utility\nsubsidiaries are subject to mandatory reliability standards as set forth by the NERC, with the approval of the FERC, which\nstandards protect the nation’s bulk power system against potential disruptions from cyber and physical security breaches.\nAEP TRANSMISSION HOLDCO\nGENERAL\nAEPTHCo is a holding company for (a) AEPTCo, which is the direct holding company for the State Transcos and (b) AEP’s\nTransmission Joint Ventures.\nAEPTCo\nAEPTCo wholly owns the State Transcos which are independent of, but respectively overlay, the following AEP electric utility\noperating companies: APCo, I&M, KPCo, OPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and WPCo. The State Transcos develop, own, operate and\nmaintain their respective transmission assets. Individual State Transcos (a) have obtained the approvals necessary to operate in\nIndiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia, subject to any applicable siting requirements, (b) are\nauthorized to submit projects for commission approval in Virginia and (c) have been granted consent to enter into a joint license\nagreement that will support investment in Tennessee. Assets of the State Transcos interconnect to transmission facilities owned\nby the aforementioned operating companies and nonaffiliated transmission owners within the footprints of PJM, MISO and\nSPP. APTCo, IMTCo, KTCo, OHTCo and WVTCo are located within PJM. IMTCo also owns portions of the Greentown\nstation assets located in MISO. OKTCo and SWTCo are located within SPP. SWTCo does not currently own or operate\ntransmission assets.\nThe State Transcos own, operate, maintain and invest in transmission infrastructure in order to maintain and enhance system\nintegrity and grid reliability, grid security, safety, reduce transmission constraints and facilitate interconnections of new\ngenerating resources and new wholesale customers, as well as enhance competitive wholesale electricity markets. A key part of\nAEP’s business is replacing and upgrading transmission facilities, assets and components of the existing AEP System as needed\nto maintain reliability. As of December 31, 2023, the State Transcos had $14.2 billion of transmission and other assets in-\nservice, excluding CWIP, with plans to construct approximately $3.4 billion of additional transmission assets through 2026.\n16\nAEPTHCO JOINT VENTURE INITIATIVES\nAEP has established joint ventures with non-affiliated electric utility companies for the purpose of developing, building and\nowning transmission assets that seek to improve reliability and market efficiency and provide transmission access to remote\ngeneration sources in North America (Transmission Joint Ventures). The Transmission Joint Ventures currently include:\nJoint Venture Projected or Actual Owners Total Estimated/Actual Project Approved Return\nName Location Completion Date (Ownership %) Costs at Completion on Equity\n(in millions)\nETT Texas (a) BHE (50%) $ 5,000.0 (a) 9.6 %\n(ERCOT) AEP (50%)\nPrairie Wind Kansas 2014 Evergy, Inc.

ETT’s investment in completed and active projects in\nERCOT is expected to be $5.0 billion by 2030. Future projects will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\n(b) In May 2020, Pioneer received FERC approval authorizing an ROE of 10.02% (10.52% inclusive of the RTO incentive adder of 0.5%).\n(c) The ROE represents the weighted-average approved ROE based on the costs of two projects developed by Transource Missouri; the $64 million\nIatan-Nashua project (10.3%) and the $247 million Sibley-Nebraska City project (11.3%).\n(d) AEP owns 86.5% of Transource Missouri, Transource West Virginia, Transource Maryland, Transource Pennsylvania and Transource Oklahoma\nthrough its ownership interest in Transource Energy, LLC (Transource). Transource is a joint venture with AEPTHCo and Evergy, Inc. formed to\npursue competitive transmission projects. AEPTHCo and Evergy, Inc. own 86.5% and 13.5% of Transource, respectively.\n(e) See “Independence Energy Connection Project” section of Note 4 for additional information.\n(f) In 2016, Transource Kansas received approval from the FERC authorizing an ROE of 9.8% (10.3% inclusive of the RTO incentive adder of 0.5%)\nfor future competitive transmission projects in SPP. In October 2020, Transource was awarded the Sooner-Wekiwa project by SPP and the\nproject was assigned to Transource Kansas. In November 2020, Transource Kansas was renamed Transource Oklahoma. The project is expected\nto go in-service in 2026.\n(g) In October 2022, Transource Energy’s North Delta A proposal was awarded by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities. In December 2023, the\nNorth Delta project was expanded with additional scope and approved by the PJM Board of Managers. The project is expected to go in-service in\n2027. The project was originally expected to go in-service in 2029.\nIn April 2023, AEP initiated a strategic evaluation for its ownership in Pioneer Transmission, LLC, Prairie Wind Transmission,\nLLC and Transource Energy. In July 2023, AEP made a decision to initiate a sales process for its investment in Pioneer\nTransmission, LLC and Prairie Wind Transmission, LLC. In February 2024, AEP management determined it would retain its\nownership of its investment in Pioneer Transmission, LLC and Prairie Wind Transmission, LLC.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the net book value of Transource Energy was $289 million inclusive of $39 million related to\nnoncontrolling interest on AEP’s balance sheet. AEP management recently completed its strategic review and determined it\nwould retain this business due to its fit within the goals and objectives of AEP and its overall leadership role in the U.S. electric\ntransmission space.\nTransource Energy, and its subsidiaries Transource Missouri, Transource West Virginia, Transource Maryland, Transource\nPennsylvania and Transource Oklahoma are consolidated joint ventures by AEP. All other joint ventures in the table above are\nnot consolidated by AEP. AEP’s joint ventures do not have employees. Business services for the joint ventures are provided\nby AEPSC and other AEP subsidiaries and the joint venture partners. In 2023, approximately 494 AEPSC employees and 317\noperating company employees provided service to one or more joint ventures.\n17\nREGULATION\nThe State Transcos and the Transmission Joint Ventures located outside of ERCOT establish transmission rates annually\nthrough forward-looking formula rate filings with the FERC pursuant to FERC-approved implementation protocols. The\nprotocols include a transparent, formal review process to ensure the updated transmission rates are prudently-incurred and\nreasonably calculated.\nThe State Transcos’ and the Transmission Joint Ventures’ (where applicable) rates are included in the respective OATT for\nPJM and SPP. An OATT is the FERC rate schedule that provides the terms and conditions for transmission and related services\non a transmission provider’s transmission system. The FERC requires transmission providers such as PJM and SPP to offer\ntransmission service to all eligible customers (for example, load-serving entities, power marketers, generators and customers)\non a non-discriminatory basis.\nThe FERC-approved formula rates establish the annual transmission revenue requirement (ATRR) and transmission service\nrates for transmission owners in annual rate base filings with the FERC. The formula rates establish rates for a one-year period\nbased on the current projects in-service and proposed projects for a defined timeframe. The formula rates also include a true-up\ncalculation for the previous year’s billings, allowing for over/under-recovery of the transmission owner’s ATRR. PJM and SPP\npay the transmission owners their ATRR for use of their facilities and bill transmission customers taking service under the PJM\nand SPP OATTs, based on the terms and conditions in the respective OATT for the service taken. Additionally, the State\nTranscos are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the NERC, with the approval of the FERC, which\nstandards protect the nation’s bulk power system against potential disruptions from cyber and physical security breaches.\nManagement monitors pending matters before the FERC, including inquiries and challenges related to ROEs and transmission\nformula rates, that have the potential to reduce AEP’s future transmission formula rates and/or the transmission ROE\nmethodology.\nIn the annual rate base filings described above, the State Transcos in aggregate filed rate base totals of $10.7 billion, $9.9 billion\nand $8.4 billion for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The total filed transmission revenue requirements, including prior year\nover/under-recovery of revenue and associated carrying charges were $1.8 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion for 2023, 2022\nand 2021, respectively.\nThe rates of ETT, which is located in ERCOT, are determined by the PUCT. ETT sets its rates through a combination of base\nrate cases and interim Transmission Cost of Services (TCOS) filings. ETT may file interim TCOS filings semi-annually to\nupdate its rates to reflect changes in its net invested capital.\nGENERATION & MARKETING\nGENERAL\nThe AEP Generation & Marketing segment subsidiaries consist of a wholesale energy trading and marketing business, a retail\nsupply and energy management business and competitive generating assets.\nAEP Energy Supply, LLC is a holding company with several divisions, including AEP Energy, AEP OnSite Partners, AEPEP\nand AGR. AEP Energy Supply, LLC also included AEP Renewables prior to its sale in August 2023. For more information on\nthe sale of AEP Renewables, see the “Contracted Renewable Generation Facilities” section of Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis.\nAEP OnSite Partners works directly with wholesale and large retail customers to provide tailored solutions to reduce their\nenergy costs based upon market knowledge, innovative applications of technology and deal structuring capabilities. AEP\nOnSite Partners targets opportunities in distributed solar, combined heat and power, energy storage, waste heat recovery, energy\nefficiency, peaking generation and other energy solutions that create value for customers. AEP OnSite Partners pursues and\ndevelops behind the meter projects with creditworthy customers. As of December 31, 2023, AEP OnSite Partners owned\nprojects located in 22 states, including approximately 195 MWs of installed solar capacity, and approximately 4 MWs of solar\nprojects under construction.\nAEP Energy is a retail energy supplier and energy management business that supplies electricity and/or natural gas to\nresidential, commercial and industrial customers. AEP Energy provides various energy solutions in Illinois, Pennsylvania,\nDelaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio and Washington, D.C. AEP Energy had approximately 929,000 customer accounts as\nof December 31, 2023.\n18\nIn April 2023, AEP announced the initiation of a sales process for its ownership in AEP Onsite Partners and AEP Energy. The\ntiming of the completion of the sales process is dependent upon a number of factors, but AEP is targeting the completion of the\nsales process in the first half of 2024. For more information, see the “2023 Significant Developments and Transactions” section\nof Management’s Discussion and Analysis.\nAEP Energy Partners enters into short-term and long-term transactions to buy or sell capacity, energy and ancillary services in\nERCOT, SPP, MISO and PJM. In addition, AEP Energy Partners sells power into the market and engages in power, natural gas\nand emissions allowances risk management and trading activities. These activities primarily involve the purchase-and-sale of\nelectricity (and to a lesser extent, natural gas and emissions allowances) under forward contracts at fixed and variable\nprices. These contracts include physical transactions, exchange-traded futures, and to a lesser extent, OTC swaps and\noptions. The majority of forward contracts are typically settled by entering into offsetting contracts. These transactions are\nexecuted with numerous counterparties or on exchanges.\nThe Generation & Marketing segment also includes AGR which holds the rights to Cardinal Plant Unit 1’s power and capacity\nthrough 2028 through a PPA with a nonaffiliated electric cooperative.\nCOMPETITION\nThe AEP Generation & Marketing segment subsidiaries face competition for the sale of available power, capacity and ancillary\nservices. The principal factors of impact are electricity and fuel prices, new market entrants, construction or retirement of\ngenerating assets by others and technological advances in power generation. Other factors impacting competitiveness include\nenvironmental regulation, transmission congestion or transportation constraints at or near generation facilities, inoperability or\ninefficiencies, outages and deactivations and retirements at generation facilities. Technology advancements, increased demand\nfor clean energy, changing consumer behaviors, low-priced and abundant natural gas, and regulatory and public policy reforms\nare among the catalysts for transformation within the industry that impact competition for AEP’s Generation & Marketing\nsegment.\nChanges in regulatory policies and advances in newer technologies for batteries or energy storage, fuel cells, microturbines,\nwind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with\nsome central station electricity production. The ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable operations and to\nprovide cost-effective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of AEP Onsite Partner’s\ncompetitiveness. The costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular have continued to become increasingly competitive.\nAEP Energy provides competitive electricity and natural gas in deregulated retail energy markets in six states and Washington,\nD.C. Each such retail choice jurisdiction establishes its own laws and regulations governing its competitive market, and public\nutility commission communications and utility default service pricing can affect customer participation in retail competition.\nSustained low natural gas and power prices, low market volatility and maturing competitive environments can adversely affect\nthis business.\nCounterparty Risk Management\nCounterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on these transactions as margin\nagainst open positions. As of December 31, 2023, counterparties posted approximately $117 million in cash, cash equivalents\nor letters of credit with AEP for the benefit of AEP’s Generation & Marketing segment subsidiaries (while, as of that date,\nAEP’s Generation & Marketing segment subsidiaries posted approximately $155 million with counterparties and\nexchanges). Since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities, exposures change\ndaily. See the “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” section of Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2023 Annual Report for additional information.\n19\nINFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\nThe following persons are executive officers of AEP.

RISK FACTORS\nGENERAL RISKS OF REGULATED OPERATIONS\nAEP may not be able to recover the costs of substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions. (Applies\nto all Registrants)\nAEP’s business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions, including the construction of\nadditional transmission and renewable generation facilities, modernizing existing infrastructure, installation of environmental\nupgrades and retrofits as well as other initiatives. AEP’s public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved\nby one or more regulatory commissions. If these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates charged,\naffected AEP subsidiaries would not be able to recover the costs associated with their investments. This would cause financial\nresults to be diminished.\nRegulated electric revenues and earnings are dependent on federal and state regulation that may limit AEP’s ability to\nrecover costs and other amounts. (Applies to all Registrants)\nThe rates customers pay to AEP regulated utility businesses are subject to approval by the FERC and the respective state utility\ncommissions of Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West\nVirginia. In certain instances, AEP’s applicable regulated utility businesses may agree to negotiated settlements related to\nvarious rate matters that are subject to regulatory approval. AEP cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of any settlements or the\nactions by the FERC or the respective state commissions in establishing rates.\nIf regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the relevant commissions, retail electric rates may be subject to\nreview and possible reduction by the commissions, which may decrease future earnings. Additionally, if regulatory bodies do\nnot allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and\nnegatively impact financial condition. Similarly, if recovery or other rate relief authorized in the past is overturned or reversed\non appeal, future earnings could be negatively impacted. Any regulatory action or litigation outcome that triggers a reversal of\na regulatory asset or deferred cost generally results in an impairment to the balance sheet and a charge to the income statement\nof the company involved.\nIn addition, regulators have initiated and may initiate additional proceedings to investigate the prudence of costs in the AEP\nregulated utility businesses and in base rates and examine, among other things, the reasonableness or prudence of operation and\nmaintenance practices, level of expenditures (including storm costs and costs associated with capital projects), allowed rates of\nreturn and rate base, proposed resource acquisitions, and previously incurred capital expenditures that the regulated utility\nbusinesses seek to place in rates. The regulators may disallow costs subject to their jurisdiction found not to have been\nprudently incurred or found not to have been incurred in compliance with applicable tariffs, creating some risk to the ultimate\nrecovery of those costs. Regulatory proceedings relating to rates and other matters typically involve multiple parties seeking to\nlimit or reduce rates. Traditional base rate proceedings, as opposed to formula rate plans, generally have long timelines, are\nprimarily based on historical costs, and may or may not be limited in scope or duration by statute. The length of these base rate\nproceedings can cause the regulated utility businesses to experience regulatory lag in recovering costs through rates, such that\nthey may not fully recover all costs during the rate effective period and may, therefore, earn less than their allowed returns.\nDecisions are typically subject to appeal, further exacerbating the regulatory lag and leading to additional uncertainty associated\nwith rate case proceedings.\nThe AEP regulated utility businesses have large customer and stakeholder bases and, as a result, could be the subject of public\ncriticism or adverse publicity focused on issues including the operation and maintenance of their assets and infrastructure, their\npreparedness for major storms or other extreme weather events and/or the time it takes to restore service after such events, or\nthe quality of their service or the reasonableness of the cost of their service. Criticism or adverse publicity of this nature could\nrender legislatures and other governing bodies, public service commissions and other regulatory authorities, and government\nofficials less likely to view the applicable operating company in a favorable light and could potentially negatively affect\nlegislative or regulatory processes or outcomes, as well as lead to increased regulatory oversight or more stringent legislative or\nregulatory requirements or other legislation or regulatory actions that adversely affect the regulated utility businesses.\nThe regulated utility businesses, and the energy industry as a whole, have experienced a period of rising costs and investments\nand an upward trend in spending, especially with respect to infrastructure investments, which is likely to continue in the\nforeseeable future and could result in more frequent rate cases and requests for, and the continuation of, cost recovery\nmechanisms, all of which could face resistance from customers and other stakeholders especially in a rising cost environment,\nwhether due to inflation or high fuel prices or otherwise, and/or in periods of economic decline or hardship. Significant\nincreases in costs could increase financing needs and otherwise adversely affect AEP’s business, financial position, results of\noperation, or cash flows. See Note 4 – Rate Matters included in the 2023 Annual Report for additional information.\n21\nAEP’s transmission investment strategy and execution are dependent on federal and state regulatory policy. (Applies to all\nRegistrants)\nA significant portion of AEP’s earnings is derived from transmission investments and activities. FERC policy currently favors\nthe expansion and updating of the transmission infrastructure within its jurisdiction. If the FERC were to adopt a different\npolicy, if states were to limit or restrict such policies, or if transmission needs do not continue or develop as projected, AEP’s\nstrategy of investing in transmission could be impacted. Management believes AEP’s experience with transmission facilities\nconstruction and operation gives AEP an advantage over other competitors in securing authorization to install, construct and\noperate new transmission lines and facilities. However, there can be no assurance that PJM, SPP, ERCOT or other RTOs will\nauthorize new transmission projects or will award such projects to AEP.\nCertain elements of AEP’s transmission formula rates have been challenged, which could result in lowered rates and/or\nrefunds of amounts previously collected and thus have an adverse effect on AEP’s business, financial condition, results of\noperations and cash flows. (Applies to all Registrants other than AEP Texas)\nAEP provides transmission service under rates regulated by the FERC. The FERC has approved the cost-based formula rate\ntemplates used by AEP to calculate its respective annual revenue requirements, but it has not expressly approved the amount of\nactual capital and operating expenditures to be used in the formula rates. All aspects of AEP’s rates accepted or approved by\nthe FERC, including the formula rate templates, the rates of return on the actual equity portion of its respective capital\nstructures and the approved targeted capital structures, are subject to challenge by interested parties at the FERC, or by the\nFERC on its own initiative. In addition, interested parties may challenge the annual implementation and calculation by AEP of\nits projected rates and formula rate true-up pursuant to its approved formula rate templates under AEP’s formula rate\nimplementation protocols. If a challenger can establish that any of these aspects are unjust, unreasonable, unduly\ndiscriminatory or preferential, then the FERC can make appropriate prospective adjustments to them and/or disallow any of\nAEP’s inclusion of those aspects in the rate setting formula.\nInquiries related to rates of return, as well as challenges to the formula rates of other utilities, are ongoing in other proceedings\nat the FERC. The results of these proceedings could potentially negatively impact AEP in any future challenges to AEP’s\nformula rates. If the FERC orders revenue reductions, including refunds, in any future cases related to its formula rates, it could\nreduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nEnd-use consumers and entities supplying electricity to end-use consumers may also attempt to influence government and/or\nregulators to change the rate setting methodologies that apply to AEP, particularly if rates for delivered electricity increase\nsubstantially.\nAEP faces risks related to project siting, financing, construction, permitting, governmental approvals and the negotiation of\nproject development agreements that may impede their development and operating activities. (Applies to all Registrants)\nAEP owns, develops, constructs, manages and operates electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities. A key\ncomponent of AEP's growth is its ability to construct and operate these facilities. As part of these operations AEP must\nperiodically apply for licenses and permits from various local, state, federal and other regulatory authorities and abide by their\nrespective conditions. Should AEP be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses or permits on acceptable terms or resolving\nthird-party challenges to such licenses or permits, should there be a delay in obtaining or renewing necessary licenses or permits\nor should regulatory authorities initiate any associated investigations or enforcement actions or impose related penalties or\ndisallowances, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. Any failure to negotiate\nsuccessful project development agreements for new facilities with third-parties could have similar results.\nChanges in technology and regulatory policies may lower the value of electric utility facilities and franchises. (Applies to all\nRegistrants)\nAEP primarily generates electricity at large central facilities and delivers that electricity to customers over its transmission and\ndistribution facilities to customers usually situated within an exclusive franchise. This method results in economies of scale and\ngenerally lower costs than newer technologies such as fuel cells and microturbines, and distributed generation using either new\nor existing technology. Other technologies, such as light emitting diodes (LEDs), increase the efficiency of electricity and, as a\nresult, lower the demand for it. Changes in regulatory policies and advances in batteries or energy storage, wind turbines,\nsmall modular reactors and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them\ncompetitive with some central station electricity production and delivery. These developments can challenge AEP’s\ncompetitive ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable operations, to establish fair regulatory mechanisms and\n22\nto provide cost-effective programs and services to customers. Further, in the event that alternative generation resources are\nmandated, subsidized or encouraged through legislation or regulation or otherwise are economically competitive and added to\nthe available generation supply, such resources could displace a higher marginal cost generating units, which could reduce the\nprice at which market participants sell their electricity.\nAEP may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled. (Applies to all Registrants)\nAEP’s business plan for the construction of new projects, including providing service to new large load customers, involves a\nnumber of risks, including incomplete or inaccurate forecasting, planning and procurement, construction delays, non-\nperformance by equipment and other third-party suppliers and increases in equipment and labor costs. To limit the risks of\nthese construction projects, AEP’s subsidiaries enter into interconnection and service agreements, equipment purchase orders\nand construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory\napprovals, cost recovery and/or siting or environmental permits. If any of these projects are canceled for any reason, including\nshifts in large customer needs, preferences or financial stability, failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals, cost recovery\nand/or siting or environmental permits, significant unrecoverable costs or cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase\norders and construction contracts could occur. In addition, if any construction work or investments have been recorded as an\nasset, an impairment may need to be recorded in the event the project is canceled.\nAEP is exposed to nuclear generation risk. (Applies to AEP and I&M)\nI&M owns the Cook Plant, which consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2,296 MWs, or about a tenth\nof the regulated generating capacity in the AEP System as of December 31, 2023. AEP and I&M are, therefore, subject to the\nrisks of nuclear generation, which include the following:\n• The potential harmful effects on the environment and human health due to an adverse incident/event resulting from the\noperation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials such as SNF.\n• Limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in\nconnection with nuclear operations.\n• Uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessment amounts triggered by a loss event (federal law requires\nowners of nuclear units to purchase the maximum available amount of nuclear liability insurance unless the NRC\nspecifies a lesser amount and potentially contribute to the coverage for losses of others).\n• Uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of\ntheir licensed lives.\nThere can be no assurance that I&M’s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if these risks are triggered.\nThe NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear\ngeneration facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both,\ndepending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. Revised safety requirements\npromulgated by the NRC could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants. In addition, although management\nhas no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at the Cook Plant, if an incident did occur, it could harm results of\noperations or financial condition. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or\nprohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit. Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S.\ncould require AEP or I&M to make material contributory payments.\nCosts associated with the operation (including fuel), maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more\nsignificant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation, in large part due to changing regulatory\nrequirements and safety standards, availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of\nnuclear facilities. Costs also may include replacement power, any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the\nCook Plant (whether scheduled or premature), the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs. The ability to obtain\nadequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the Cook Plant is not assured.\nAEP subsidiaries are exposed to risks through participation in the market and transmission structures in various regional\npower markets that are beyond their control. (Applies to all Registrants)\nResults are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission structures in various regional power\nmarkets. The rules governing the various RTOs, including SPP and PJM, may also change from time to time which could\naffect costs or revenues. Existing, new or changed rules of these RTOs could result in significant additional fees and increased\n23\ncosts to participate in those structures, including the cost of transmission facilities built by others due to changes in transmission\nrate design. In addition, these RTOs may assess costs resulting from improved transmission reliability, reduced transmission\ncongestion and firm transmission rights. As members of these RTOs, AEP’s subsidiaries are subject to certain additional risks,\nincluding the allocation among existing members, of losses caused by unreimbursed defaults of other participants in these\nmarkets and resolution of complaint cases that may seek refunds of revenues previously earned by members of these markets.\nAEP could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards. (Applies to all Registrants)\nOwners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the\nNERC and enforced by the FERC. The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power\nsystem operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles. Compliance with new reliability\nstandards may subject AEP to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures. While management expects to\nrecover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates, there can be no assurance that the applicable\ncommissions will approve full recovery in a timely manner. If AEP were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory\nreliability standards, AEP could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, which likely would not be\nrecoverable from customers through regulated rates.\nA substantial portion of the receivables of AEP Texas is concentrated in a small number of REPs, and any delay or default\nin payment could adversely affect its cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. (Applies to AEP and AEP\nTexas)\nAEP Texas collects receivables from the distribution of electricity from REPs that supply the electricity it distributes to its\ncustomers. As of December 31, 2023, AEP Texas did business with approximately 124 REPs. Adverse economic conditions,\nstructural problems in the market served by ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of\nthese REPs to pay for these services or could cause them to delay such payments. AEP Texas depends on these REPs to remit\npayments on a timely basis. Applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another REP or a provider of\nlast resort if a REP cannot make timely payments. Applicable PUCT regulations significantly limit the extent to which AEP\nTexas can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric\nservice in its service territory, and AEP Texas thus remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to\nanother REP or the provider of last resort. In 2023, AEP Texas’ two largest REPs accounted for 41% of its operating revenue.\nAny delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. If a\nREP were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in\nwhich event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations, and claims might be made by creditors involving payments\nAEP Texas had received from such REP.\nOhio House Bill 6 (HB 6), which provides for beneficial cost recovery for OPCo and for plants owned by OVEC, has come\nunder public scrutiny. (Applies to AEP and OPCo)\nIn 2019, Ohio adopted and implemented HB 6 which benefits OPCo by authorizing rate recovery for certain costs including\nrenewable energy contracts, OVEC’s coal-fired generating units and energy efficiency measures. AEP and OPCo engaged in\nlobbying efforts and provided testimony during the legislative process in connection with HB 6. In July 2020, an investigation\nled by the U.S. Attorney’s Office resulted in a federal grand jury indictment of an Ohio legislator and associates and Generation\nNow, an entity registered as a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization, in connection with an alleged racketeering conspiracy\ninvolving the adoption of HB 6. Certain defendants in that case had previously plead guilty and, in March 2023, a federal jury\nconvicted the Ohio legislator and another individual of participating in the racketeering conspiracy. If certain provisions of HB\n6 were to be eliminated, it is unclear whether new legislation addressing similar issues would be adopted. To the extent that\nOPCo is unable to recover the costs currently authorized by HB 6, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact\nfinancial condition. In addition, the impact of continued public scrutiny of HB 6 is not known and may have an adverse impact\non AEP and OPCo, including their relationship with regulatory and legislative authorities, customers and other stakeholders.\nAEP is a defendant in current litigation relating to HB 6 and AEP or OPCo may be involved in future litigation.\n24\nRISKS RELATED TO MARKET, ECONOMIC OR FINANCIAL VOLATILITY AND OTHER RISKS\nAEP’s financial performance may be adversely affected if AEP is unable to successfully operate facilities or perform certain\ncorporate functions. (Applies to all Registrants)\nPerformance is highly dependent on the successful operation of generation, transmission and/or distribution\nfacilities. Operating these facilities involves many risks, including:\n• Operator error and breakdown or failure of equipment or processes.\n• Operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements.\n• Labor disputes.\n• Compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cybersecurity standards.\n• Information technology failure that impairs AEP’s information technology infrastructure or disrupts normal business\noperations.\n• Information technology failure that affects AEP’s ability to access customer information or causes loss of confidential\nor proprietary data that materially and adversely affects AEP’s reputation or exposes AEP to legal claims.\n• Supply chain disruptions and inflation.\n• Fuel or water supply interruptions caused by transportation constraints, adverse weather such as drought, non-\nperformance by suppliers and other factors.\n• Catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, hurricanes, tornadoes, ice storms, terrorism (including\ncyber-terrorism), floods or other similar occurrences.\n• Fuel costs and related requirements triggered by financial stress in the coal industry.\nPhysical attacks or hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair operations, lead to the disclosure of\nconfidential information and damage AEP’s reputation. (Applies to all Registrants)\nAEP and its regulated utility businesses face physical security and cybersecurity risks as the owner-operators of generation,\ntransmission and/or distribution facilities and as participants in commodities trading. AEP and its regulated utility businesses\nown assets deemed as critical infrastructure, the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems. Further,\nthe computer systems that run these facilities are not completely isolated from external networks. Parties that wish to disrupt\nthe U.S. bulk power system or AEP operations could view these computer systems, software or networks as targets for cyber-\nattack. The Federal government has notified the owners and operators of critical infrastructure, such as AEP, that the conflict\nbetween Russia and Ukraine has increased the likelihood of a cyber-attack on such systems. In addition, the electric utility\nbusiness requires the collection of sensitive customer data, as well as confidential employee and shareholder information, which\nis subject to electronic theft or loss.\nA security breach of AEP or its regulated utility businesses’ physical assets or information systems, interconnected entities in\nRTOs, or regulators could impact the operation of the generation fleet and/or reliability of the transmission and distribution\nsystem. AEP and its regulated utility businesses could be subject to financial harm associated with ransomware theft or\ninappropriate release of certain types of information, including sensitive customer, vendor, employee, trading or other\nconfidential data. A successful cyber-attack on the systems that control generation, transmission, distribution or other assets\ncould severely disrupt business operations, preventing service to customers or collection of revenues. The breach of certain\nbusiness systems could affect the ability to correctly record, process and report financial information. A major cyber incident\ncould result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation,\nfines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to AEP’s reputation. In addition, the misappropriation,\ncorruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breach notification\nexpenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring.\nAEP and its third-party vendors have been subject, and will likely continue to be subject, to attempts to gain unauthorized\naccess to their technology systems and confidential data or to attempts to disrupt utility and related business operations. While\nthere have been immaterial incidents of phishing, unauthorized access to technology systems, financial fraud, and disruption of\nremote access across the AEP subsidiaries, there has been no material impact on business or operations from these attacks to\ndate. Similarly, some of AEP’s third-party vendors have experienced cybersecurity incidents, though such incidents have not,\nto AEP’s knowledge, resulted in a material impact to AEP to date. However, AEP cannot guarantee that security efforts will\ndetect or prevent future breaches, operational incidents, or other breakdowns of technology systems and network infrastructure\nand cannot provide any assurance that such incidents will not have a material adverse effect in the future. While AEP maintains\ninsurance relating to cybersecurity events, such insurance is subject to a number of exclusions and may be insufficient to offset\nany losses, costs or damages experienced. Also, the market for cybersecurity insurance is relatively new and coverage available\nfor cybersecurity events is evolving as the industry matures.\n25\nAEP is subject to standards enacted by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and enforced by FERC regarding\nprotection of critical infrastructure assets required for operating North America's bulk electric system. While AEP believes it is\nin compliance with such standards and regulations, AEP has been, and may in the future be, found to be in violation of such\nstandards and regulations. To date, such violations have not resulted in material financial penalties; however, management can\ngive no assurance that compliance efforts will not result in material penalties in the future. In addition, compliance with or\nchanges in the applicable standards and regulations may subject AEP to higher operating costs and/or increased capital\nexpenditures as well as substantial fines for non-compliance.\nThe failure of AEP or third-party vendor information technology systems, or the failure to enhance existing information\ntechnology systems and implement new technology, could adversely affect AEP. (Applies to all Registrants)\nAEP’s operations are dependent upon the proper functioning of its internal systems, including the information technology\nsystems that support our underlying business processes. Any significant failure or malfunction of such information technology\nsystems may result in disruptions of our operations. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on information technology\nsystems, including the internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of business processes and activities and to\nstore sensitive data, including (i) intellectual property, (ii) proprietary business information, (iii) personally identifiable\ninformation of our customers, employees, retirees and shareholders and (iv) data with respect to invoicing and the collection of\npayments, accounting, procurement, and supply chain activities. Our information technology systems are dependent upon\nglobal communications and cloud service providers, as well as their respective vendors, many of whom have at some point\nexperienced significant system failures and outages in the past and may experience such failures and outages in the future.\nThese providers’ systems are susceptible to cybersecurity and data breaches, outages from fire, floods, power loss,\ntelecommunications failures, break-ins and similar events. Failure to prevent or mitigate data loss from system failures or\noutages could materially affect AEP’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe amount of taxes imposed on AEP could change. (Applies to all Registrants)\nAEP is subject to income taxation at the federal level and by certain states and municipalities. In determining AEP’s income\ntax liability for these jurisdictions, management monitors changes to the applicable tax laws and related regulations, including\ntax incentives and credits designed to support the sale of energy from utility scale renewable energy facilities. While\nmanagement believes AEP complies with current prevailing laws, one or more taxing jurisdictions could seek to impose\nincremental or new taxes on the company. In addition, any adverse developments in tax laws, incentives, credits or regulations,\nincluding legislative changes, judicial holdings or administrative interpretations, could have a material and adverse effect on\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nIf AEP is unable to access capital markets or insurance markets on reasonable terms, it could reduce future net income and\ncash flows and negatively impact financial condition. (Applies to all Registrants)\nAEP relies on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating\ncash flows or proceeds from the strategic sale of assets and investments, including subsidiaries or portions thereof, and\ninsurance markets to assist in managing its risk and liability profile. Volatility, increased interest rates and reduced liquidity in\nthe financial markets could affect AEP’s ability to raise capital on reasonable terms to fund capital needs, including\nconstruction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness. In addition, AEP has exposure to international banks, including\nthose in Europe, Canada, and Asia. Disruptions in these markets could reduce or restrict the AEP’s ability to secure sufficient\nliquidity or secure liquidity at reasonable terms. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 10%, 17%, and 16% of the\nRegistrants’ available credit facilities were with European, Canadian, and Asian banks, respectively.\nCertain sources of insurance and debt and equity capital have expressed increasing unwillingness to procure insurance for or to\ninvest in companies, such as AEP, that rely on fossil fuels. The public holds diverse and often conflicting views on the use of\nfossil fuels. AEP has multiple stakeholders, including our shareholders, customers, associates, federal and state regulatory\nauthorities, and the communities in which AEP operates, and these stakeholders will often have differing priorities and\nexpectations regarding issues related to the use of fossil fuels. Any adverse publicity in connection with AEP’s use of fossil\nfuels could curtail availability from certain sources of capital. If sources of capital for AEP are reduced and/or expected sale\nproceeds do not become available, capital costs could increase materially. Restricted access to capital or insurance markets\nand/or increased borrowing costs or insurance premiums could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact\nfinancial condition. If AEP is not able to access debt or equity at competitive rates or at all, the ability to finance its operations\nand implement its strategy and business plan as scheduled could be adversely affected. An inability to access debt and equity\nmay limit AEP’s ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions that it may otherwise rely on for future growth.\n26\nOur financial position may be adversely impacted if announced dispositions do not occur as planned or if assets under\nstrategic evaluation lose value. (Applies to AEP)\nIn April 2023, AEP initiated a sales process for its ownership in AEP Energy and AEP Onsite Partners. AEP Onsite Partners\nalso owns a 50% interest in NM Renewable Development, LLC, (NMRD). Separate from the remainder of AEP Onsite\nPartners, AEP and the joint owner have signed an agreement in December 2023 to sell NMRD to a non-affiliated third-party.\nAny planned sale of assets and investments, including subsidiaries, may not occur for any number of reasons beyond our\ncontrol, including regulatory approval. If AEP is unable to recover the net book value or carrying value of these assets as part\nof the sale process, it could reduce future net income and impact financial condition.\nShareholder activism could cause AEP to incur significant expense, hinder execution of AEP’s business strategy and impact\nAEP’s stock price. (Applies to all Registrants)\nShareholder activism, which can take many forms and arise in a variety of situations, could result in substantial costs and divert\nmanagement’s and AEP’s board’s attention and resources from AEP’s business. Additionally, such shareholder activism could\ngive rise to perceived uncertainties as to AEP’s future, adversely affect AEP’s relationships with its employees, customers or\nservice providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Also, AEP may be required to incur\nsignificant fees and other expenses related to activist shareholder matters, including for third-party advisors. AEP’s stock price\ncould be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any\nshareholder activism.\nDowngrades in AEP’s credit ratings could negatively affect its ability to access capital. (Applies to all Registrants)\nThe credit ratings agencies periodically review AEP’s capital structure and the quality and stability of earnings and cash flows.\nAny negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to AEP and could limit access to funding for operations.\nAEP’s business is capital intensive, and AEP is dependent upon the ability to access capital at rates and on terms management\ndetermines to be attractive. If AEP’s ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained, AEP’s interest costs will likely\nincrease and that could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.\nAEP and AEPTCo have no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other payments due from their subsidiaries.\n(Applies to AEP and AEPTCo)\nAEP and AEPTCo are holding companies and have no operations of their own. Their ability to meet their financial obligations\nassociated with their indebtedness and to pay dividends is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of their operating\nsubsidiaries, primarily their regulated utilities, and the ability of their subsidiaries to pay dividends to them or repay loans from\nthem. Their subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation (apart from loans from AEP or AEPTCo)\nto provide them with funds for their payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions or other payments. Payments to\nAEP or AEPTCo by their subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations. AEP and AEPTCo\nindebtedness and dividends are structurally subordinated to all subsidiary indebtedness.\nAEP’s operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis and with general economic and weather conditions.\n(Applies to all Registrants)\nElectric power consumption is generally seasonal. In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot\nsummer months, with market prices also peaking at that time. In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter. As a\nresult, overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. In addition, AEP has historically\nsold less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are milder. Unusually mild weather in the\nfuture could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. In addition, unusually extreme\nweather conditions could impact AEP’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable.\nFurther, deteriorating economic conditions triggered by any cause, including international tariffs, generally result in reduced\nconsumption by customers, particularly industrial customers who may curtail operations or cease production entirely, while an\nexpanding economic environment generally results in increased revenues. As a result, prevailing economic conditions may\nreduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.\n27\nVolatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase defined benefit pension and\nother postretirement plan costs and the costs of nuclear decommissioning. (Applies to all Registrants and to AEP and I&M\nwith respect to the costs of nuclear decommissioning)\nThe costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent on a number of factors, such as the rates of\nreturn on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plan,\nchanges in actuarial assumptions, future government regulation, changes in life expectancy and the frequency and amount of\nAEP’s required or voluntary contributions made to the plans. Changes in actuarial assumptions and differences between the\nassumptions and actual values, as well as a significant decline in the value of investments that fund the pension and other\npostretirement plans, if not offset or mitigated by a decline in plan liabilities, could increase pension and other postretirement\nexpense, and AEP could be required from time to time to fund the pension plan with significant amounts of cash. Such cash\nfunding obligations could have a material impact on liquidity by reducing cash flows and could negatively affect results of\noperations.\nAdditionally, I&M holds a significant amount of assets in its nuclear decommissioning trusts to satisfy obligations to\ndecommission its nuclear plant. The rate of return on assets held in those trusts can significantly impact both the costs of\ndecommissioning and the funding requirements for the trusts.\nSupply chain disruptions and inflation could negatively impact our operations and corporate strategy. (Applies to all\nRegistrants)\nAEP’s operations and business plans depend on the global supply chain to procure the equipment, materials and other resources\nnecessary to build and provide services in a safe and reliable manner. The delivery of components, materials, equipment and\nother resources that are critical to AEP’s business operations and corporate strategy has been restricted by domestic and global\nsupply chain upheaval. This has resulted in the shortage of critical items. International tensions, including the ramifications of\nregional conflict, could further exacerbate the global supply chain upheaval. These disruptions and shortages could adversely\nimpact business operations and corporate strategy. The constraints in the supply chain could restrict the availability and delay\nthe construction, maintenance or repair of items that are needed to support normal operations or are required to execute on\nAEP’s corporate strategy for continued capital investment in utility equipment and impact AEP’s strategy to transition its\ngeneration fleet. These disruptions and constraints could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm AEP’s\nfinancial condition.\nSupply chain disruptions have contributed to higher prices of components, materials, equipment and other needed commodities\nand these inflationary increases may continue in the future. The economy in the United States has encountered a material level\nof inflation compared to the recent past and that has contributed to increased uncertainty in the outlook of near-term economic\nactivity, including the level of future inflation and the possibility of a recession. AEP typically recovers increases in capital\nexpenses from customers through rates in regulated jurisdictions. Failure to recover increased capital costs could reduce future\nnet income and cash flows and possibly harm AEP’s financial condition. Increases in inflation raises our costs for labor,\nmaterials and services, and failure to secure these on reasonable terms may adversely impact our financial condition.\nAEP’s results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth in the number of\ncustomers, a decline in customer demand or a recession. (Applies to all Registrants)\nGrowth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and the need for\nadditional power generation and delivery facilities. Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors\noutside the control of AEP, such as mandated energy efficiency measures, demand-side management goals, distributed\ngeneration resources and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing\nstarts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity, including changes due to public health considerations.\nCertain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to further reduce\nenergy consumption. Additionally, technological advances or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead\nto declines in per capita energy consumption. Some or all of these factors, could impact the demand for electricity.\nFailure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm results of operations. (Applies to all\nRegistrants)\nCertain events, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, mismatch of skillset or complement to future\nneeds, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. The challenges include\n28\npotential higher rates of existing employee departures, lack of resources, loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period\nassociated with skill development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs\nand safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant\ninternal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may\nadversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business. If AEP is unable to successfully attract and retain an\nappropriately qualified workforce, future net income and cash flows may be reduced.\nChanges in the price of purchased power and commodities, the cost of procuring fuel, emission allowances for criteria\npollutants and the costs of transport may increase AEP’s cost of purchasing and producing power, impacting financial\nperformance. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)\nAEP is exposed to changes in the price and availability of purchased power and fuel (including the cost to procure coal and gas)\nand the price and availability to transport fuel. AEP has existing contracts of varying durations for the supply of fuel, but as\nthese contracts end or if they are not honored, AEP may not be able to purchase fuel on terms as favorable as the current\ncontracts. AEP typically recovers increases in fuel expenses and purchased power from customers in regulated jurisdictions.\nFailure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm AEP’s financial condition. The\ninability to procure fuel at costs that are economical could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its useful\nlife, and while AEP typically recovers expenditures for undepreciated plant balances, there can be no assurance in the future\nthat AEP will recover such costs. Similarly, AEP is exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission\nallowances. AEP uses emission allowances based on the amount of fuel used and reductions achieved through emission\ncontrols and other measures. Based on current environmental programs remaining in effect, AEP has sufficient emission\nallowances available through either EPA original issuance or market purchases to cover projected needs for the next two years\nand beyond. Additional costs may be incurred either to acquire additional allowances or to achieve further reductions in\nemissions. If AEP needs to obtain allowances, those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those under the current\nenvironmental programs. AEP’s risks relative to the price and availability to transport coal include the volatility of the price of\ndiesel which is the primary fuel used in transporting coal by barge.\nPrices for coal, natural gas and emission allowances have shown material swings in the past. Changes in the cost of purchased\npower, fuel or emission allowances and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power could\nreduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. In addition, actual power prices and fuel\ncosts will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value trading and marketing transactions, and those\ndifferences may be material. As a result, as those transactions are marked-to-market, they may impact future results of\noperations and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nAEP is subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change. (Applies to all Registrants)\nClimate change creates physical and financial risk. Physical risks from climate change may include an increase in sea level and\nchanges in weather conditions, such as changes in precipitation and extreme weather events, such as fires. Customers’ energy\nneeds vary with weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity. For residential customers, heating and cooling\nrepresent their largest energy use. To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, customers’ energy use\ncould increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes.\nIncreased energy use due to weather changes may require AEP to invest in additional generating assets, transmission and other\ninfrastructure to serve increased load. Decreased energy use due to weather changes may affect financial condition through\ndecreased revenues. Extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup, adding to costs, and can contribute to\nincreased system stress, including service interruptions. Weather conditions outside of the AEP service territory could also\nhave an impact on revenues. AEP buys and sells electricity depending upon system needs and market opportunities. Extreme\nweather conditions creating high energy demand on AEP’s own and/or other systems may raise electricity prices as AEP buys\nshort-term energy to serve AEP’s own system, which would increase the cost of energy AEP provides to customers.\nSevere weather and weather-related events impact AEP’s service territories, primarily when thunderstorms, tornadoes,\nhurricanes, fires, floods and snow or ice storms occur. To the extent the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and\nstorms increase, AEP’s cost of providing service will increase, including the costs and the availability of procuring insurance\nrelated to such impacts, and these costs may not be recoverable. Changes in wind patterns or in precipitation resulting in\ndroughts, water shortages or floods could adversely affect operations, principally wind generation facilities for changes in wind\npatterns and the fossil fuel generating units for changes in precipitation. A change in wind patterns or a negative impact to\nwater supplies due to long-term drought conditions or severe flooding could adversely impact AEP’s ability to provide\nelectricity to customers, as well as increase the price they pay for energy. AEP may not recover all costs related to mitigating\nthese physical and financial risks.\n29\nTo the extent climate change impacts a region’s economic health, it may also impact revenues. AEP’s financial performance is\ntied to the health of the regional economies AEP serves. The price of energy, as a factor in a region’s cost of living as well as\nan important input into the cost of goods and services, has an impact on the economic health of the communities within AEP’s\nservice territories. Climate change may impact the economy, which could impact our sales and revenues. The cost of\nadditional regulatory requirements, such as regulation of carbon dioxide emissions, could impact the availability of goods and\nprices charged by AEP’s suppliers which would normally be borne by consumers through higher prices for energy and\npurchased goods. To the extent financial markets view climate change and carbon dioxide emissions as a financial risk, this\ncould negatively affect AEP’s ability to access capital markets or cause AEP to receive less than ideal terms and conditions in\ncapital markets.\nThe generation, transmission and distribution of electricity are dangerous and involve inherent risks of damage to private\nproperty and injury to AEP’s workforce and the general public. (Applies to all Registrants)\nElectricity poses hazards for AEP’s workforce and the general public in the event that either comes in contact with electrical\ncurrent or equipment, including through energized downed power lines or through equipment malfunctions. In addition, the\nrisks associated with the operation of transmission and distribution assets and power generation and storage facilities include\npublic and workforce safety issues and the risk of utility assets causing or contributing to wildfires. Deaths, injuries and\nproperty damage caused by such events can subject AEP to liability that, despite the existence of insurance coverage, can be\nsignificant. In addition, AEP may be held responsible for the actions of its contractors. No assurance can be given that future\nlosses will not exceed the limits of AEP’s or its contractors’ insurance coverage.\nManagement cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings relating to AEP’s business activities. (Applies to all\nRegistrants)\nAEP is involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising out of its business operations, the most significant of which\nare summarized in Note 6 - Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies included in the 2023 Annual Report. Adverse\noutcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures that could reduce future net income and cash flows and\nnegatively impact financial condition.\nDisruptions at power generation facilities owned by third-parties could interrupt the sales of transmission and distribution\nservices. (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas)\nAEP Texas transmits and distributes electric power that the REPs obtain from power generation facilities owned by third-\nparties. If power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate, sales of transmission and distribution\nservices may be diminished or interrupted, and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely\naffected.\nManagement is unable to predict the course, results or impact, if any, of current or future litigation or investigations\nrelating to the severe winter weather in Texas in February 2021. (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas)\nAs a result of the February 2021 severe winter weather in Texas which caused a shortage of electric generation, ERCOT\ninstructed AEP Texas and other Texas electric utilities to initiate power outages to avoid a sustained large-scale outage and\nprevent long-term damage to the electric system. At its peak, approximately 468,000 (44%) AEP Texas customers were\nwithout power. In February 2021, AEP Texas received a Civil Investigative Demand from the Office of the Attorney General\nof Texas requesting, among other data, information about its communications to and from ERCOT, PUCT, retail electric\nproviders, utilities, or power generation companies, concerning power outages related to the February 2021 winter storm. The\ncompany responded to the Civil Investigative Demand in March 2021.\nAEP Parent and AEP Texas are named in approximately 100 lawsuits alleging multiple claims of wrongful death, personal\ninjury, property damage and other injuries and damages. Certain wind farms formerly owned by AEP have also been named as\ndefendants in up to approximately 125 lawsuits, along with other Texas energy companies and transmission and distribution\nutilities. Most of the lawsuits contain hundreds of plaintiffs and one of the suits is a purported class action on behalf of all\ncustomers in ERCOT. The complaints seek monetary damages among other forms of relief.\nThe litigation has been consolidated into a multi-district litigation (MDL) proceeding in Texas state court. The judge\noverseeing the MDL issued an initial case management order and stayed all proceedings and discovery. Management is unable\nto predict the course or outcome of these or any future litigation or investigations or their impact, if any, on future results of\noperations, financial condition and cash flows.\n30\nHazards associated with high-voltage electricity transmission may result in suspension of AEP’s operations or the\nimposition of civil or criminal penalties. (Applies to all Registrants)\nAEP operations are subject to the usual hazards associated with high-voltage electricity transmission, including explosions,\nfires, inclement weather, natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, equipment interruptions, remediation,\nchemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other environmental risks. The hazards\ncan cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental\ndamage, and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. AEP maintains property\nand casualty insurance, but AEP is not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to AEP’s business, such as damage to\npoles, towers and lines or losses caused by outages.\nAEPTCo depends on AEP affiliates for a substantial portion of its revenues. (Applies to AEPTCo)\nAEPTCo’s principal transmission service customers are AEP affiliates. Management expects that these affiliates will continue\nto be AEPTCo’s principal transmission service customers for the foreseeable future. For the year ended December 31, 2023,\nAEP affiliates were responsible for approximately 79% of the consolidated transmission revenues of AEPTCo.\nMost of the real property rights on which the assets of AEPTCo are situated result from affiliate license agreements and are\ndependent on the terms of the underlying easements and other rights of its affiliates. (Applies to AEPTCo)\nAEPTCo does not hold title to the majority of real property on which its electric transmission assets are located. Instead, under\nthe provisions of certain affiliate contracts, it is permitted to occupy and maintain its facilities upon real property held by the\nrespective AEP subsidiary utility affiliate that overlay its operations. The ability of AEPTCo to continue to occupy such real\nproperty is dependent upon the terms of such affiliate contracts and upon the underlying real property rights of these utility\naffiliates, which may be encumbered by easements, mineral rights and other similar encumbrances that may affect the use of\nsuch real property. AEP can give no assurance that (a) the relevant AEP subsidiary utility affiliates will continue to be affiliates\nof AEPTCo, (b) suitable replacement arrangements can be obtained in the event that the relevant AEP subsidiary utility\naffiliates are not its affiliates and (c) the underlying easements and other rights are sufficient to permit AEPTCo to operate its\nassets in a manner free from interruption.\nCompliance with legislative and regulatory requirements may lead to increased costs and result in penalties. (Applies to all\nRegistrants)\nBusiness activities of electric utilities and related companies are heavily regulated, primarily through national and state laws\nand regulations of general applicability, including laws and regulations related to working conditions, health and safety, equal\nemployment opportunity, employee benefit and other labor and employment matters, laws and regulations related to\ncompetition and antitrust matters. Many agencies employ mandatory civil penalty structures for regulatory violations.\nRegistrants are subject to the jurisdiction of many federal and state agencies, including the FERC, NERC, Commodities Futures\nTrading Commission, Federal EPA, NRC, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the SEC and the United States\nDepartment of Justice which may impose significant civil and criminal penalties to enforce compliance requirements relative to\nAEP’s business, which could have a material adverse effect on financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and\nliquidity.\nThe impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations, as well as changes in enforcement practices or\nregulatory scrutiny generally cannot be predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related\ninterpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement,\nincrease AEP’s operating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the\nproducts or services AEP offers, or result in adverse publicity and harm AEP’s reputation.\n31\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNING AND OPERATING GENERATION ASSETS AND SELLING POWER\nCosts of compliance with existing and evolving environmental laws are significant. (Applies to all Registrants except\nAEPTCo)\nOperations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality,\nwater quality, waste management, natural resources and health and safety. A majority of the electricity generated by AEP\nsubsidiaries is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels. Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury and particulates\nand the discharge and disposal of solid waste (including coal-combustion residuals or CCR) resulting from fossil fueled\ngeneration plants are subject to increased regulations, controls and mitigation expenses. Compliance with these legal\nrequirements (including any new and more stringent application of existing CCR regulations) requires AEP to commit\nsignificant capital toward environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, emission fees, disposal,\nremediation and permits at AEP facilities and could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated\nuseful life. Costs of compliance with environmental statutes and regulations could reduce future net income and negatively\nimpact financial condition, especially if emission limits, CCR waste discharge and/or discharge disposal obligations are\ntightened, more extensive operating and/or permitting requirements are imposed or additional substances or facilities become\nregulated. Although AEP typically recovers expenditures for pollution control technologies, replacement generation,\nundepreciated plant balances and associated operating costs from customers, there can be no assurance in the future that AEP\nwill recover the remaining costs associated with such plants. Failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and\ncash flows and possibly harm financial condition.\nRegulation of greenhouse gas emissions and/or voluntary climate goals could materially increase costs to AEP and its\ncustomers or cause some electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain. (Applies to all Registrants\nexcept AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)\nFederal or state laws or regulations may be adopted that would impose new or additional limits on the emissions of greenhouse\ngases, including, but not limited to, carbon dioxide and methane, from electric generation units using fossil fuels like coal. The\npotential effects of greenhouse gas emission limits on AEP's electric generation units are subject to significant uncertainties\nbased on, among other things, the timing of the implementation of any new requirements, the required levels of emission\nreductions, the nature of any market-based or tax-based mechanisms adopted to facilitate reductions, the relative availability of\ngreenhouse gas emission reduction offsets, the development of cost-effective, commercial-scale carbon capture and storage\ntechnology and supporting regulations and liability mitigation measures, and the range of available compliance alternatives.\nAEP routinely submits IRPs in various regulatory jurisdictions to address future generation and capacity needs. These IRPs\ntake into account economics, customer demand, grid reliability and resilience, regulations and RTO capacity requirements. The\nobjective of the IRPs is to recommend future generation and capacity resources that provide the most cost-efficient and reliable\npower to customers. Based on the output of the company’s IRPs, in October 2022, AEP announced new intermediate and long-\nterm CO emission reduction goals. AEP adjusted its near-term CO emission reduction target from a 2000 baseline to a 2005\n2 2\nbaseline, upgraded its 80% reduction by 2030 target to include full Scope 1 emissions and accelerated its net-zero goal by five\nyears to 2045 for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Risks to achieving these goals include, among other things, the ability to\nexecute on renewable resource plans, evolving RTO requirements, regulatory approvals, customer demand for carbon-free\nenergy, potential tariffs, carbon policy and regulation, operational performance of renewable generation and supply chain costs\nand constraints, all while continuing to provide the most cost-efficient and reliable power to customers. Technology research\nand development, innovation, and advancements in carbon-free generation are also critical to AEP’s ability to achieve its 2045\ngoal.\nAEP’s results of operations could be materially adversely affected to the extent that new federal or state laws or regulations or\nvoluntary climate goals impose any new greenhouse gas emission limits. Any future limits on greenhouse gas emissions could\ncreate substantial additional costs in the form of taxes or emissions allowances, require significant capital investment in carbon\ncapture and storage technology, fuel switching, or the replacement of high-emitting generation facilities with lower-emitting\ngeneration facilities and/or could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life. Although\nAEP typically recovers environmental expenditures, there can be no assurance in the future that AEP can recover such costs\nwhich could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition. Further, real or alleged violations\nof environmental regulations, including those related to climate change, or an inability to meet AEP’s voluntary climate goals,\ncould adversely impact AEP’s reputation.\nAEP may be constrained by the ability to procure resources or labor needed to build new generation at a reasonable price as\nwell as to construct projects on time. In addition, new technologies that are not yet commercially available or are unproven at\nutility scale will likely be needed including new resources such as advanced nuclear, hydrogen and long-duration storage. If\nthese technologies are not developed or are not available at reasonable prices, or if AEP invests in early-stage technologies that\nare then supplanted by technological breakthroughs, AEP’s ability to achieve a net-zero target by 2045 at a cost-effective price\ncould be at risk. Achieving our carbon reduction goals will require continued operation of our existing carbon-free technologies\n32\nincluding nuclear and renewables. The rapid transition to and expansion of certain low-carbon resources, such as renewables\nwithout cost-effective storage, may challenge our ability to meet customer expectations of reliability in a carbon constrained\nenvironment. AEP cannot predict the ultimate impact of achieving these objectives, or the various implementation aspects, on\nits system reliability, or its results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\nAEP may be unable to procure or construct generation capacity when needed or to recover the costs of such generation\ncapacity. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)\nAEP’s capacity obligations are subject to a number of factors including load growth, requirements that can be imposed by the\nstates, RTOs and other jurisdictions in which it operates or participates as a member and the retirement of existing generating\nfacilities. AEP must obtain new and replacement generation to comply with prevailing capacity needs and reserve obligations.\nAEP’s ability to acquire, retrofit and/or construct power generation facilities in a timely manner and within budget is contingent\nupon many variables and subject to substantial risks. These variables include, but are not limited to, project management\nexpertise, escalating costs for capital, materials, labor, and environmental compliance, reliance on suppliers for timely and\nsatisfactory performance, continued pandemic-related delays and cost increases, and supply chains and material constraints,\nincluding those that may result from major storm events. Delays in obtaining permits, challenges in securing suitable land for\nthe siting, shortages in materials and qualified labor, levels of public support or opposition, suppliers and contractors not\nperforming as expected or required under their contracts and/or experiencing financial problems that inhibit their ability to\nfulfill their obligations under contracts, changes in the scope and timing of projects, poor quality initial cost estimates from\ncontractors, the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, changes in commodity prices affecting revenue, fuel costs, or\nmaterials costs, downward changes in the economy, changes in law or regulation, including environmental compliance\nrequirements, further direct and indirect trade and tariff issues, supply chain delays or disruptions, and other events beyond\nAEP’s control may occur that may materially affect the schedule, cost, and performance of needed acquisitions or construction\nprojects. If these projects or other capital improvements are significantly delayed or become subject to cost overruns or\ncancellation, AEP could incur additional costs and termination payments or face increased risk of potential write-off of the\ninvestment in the project. In addition, AEP could be exposed to higher costs, penalties and market volatility, which could affect\ncash flow and cost recovery, should one or more applicable regulator decline to approve the acquisition or construction of the\nproject or new generation needed to meet the reliability needs of customers at the lowest reasonable cost.\nCourts adjudicating nuisance and other similar claims in the future may order AEP to pay damages or to limit or reduce\nemissions. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas and AEPTCo)\nIn the past, there have been several cases seeking damages based on allegations of federal and state common law nuisance in\nwhich AEP, among others, were defendants. In general, the actions allege that emissions from the defendants’ power plants\nconstitute a public nuisance. The plaintiffs in these actions generally seek recovery of damages and other relief. If future\nactions are resolved against AEP, substantial modifications or retirement of AEP’s existing coal-fired power plants could be\nrequired, and AEP might be required to purchase power from third-parties to fulfill AEP’s commitments to supply power to\nAEP customers. This could have a material impact on revenues. In addition, AEP could be required to invest significantly in\nadditional emission control equipment, accelerate the timing of capital expenditures, pay damages or penalties and/or halt\noperations. Unless recovered, those costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and harm financial\ncondition. Moreover, results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these\ninvestments and the expense of ongoing litigation.\nCommodity trading and marketing activities are subject to inherent risks which can be reduced and controlled but not\neliminated. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)\nAEP routinely has open trading positions in the market, within guidelines set by AEP, resulting from the management of AEP’s\ntrading portfolio. To the extent open trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish financial\nresults and financial position. AEP’s power trading activities also expose AEP to risks of commodity price movements. To the\nextent that AEP’s power trading does not hedge the price risk associated with the generation it owns, or controls, AEP would be\nexposed to the risk of rising and falling spot market prices. In connection with these trading activities, AEP routinely enters\ninto financial contracts, including futures and options, OTC options, financially-settled swaps and other derivative\ncontracts. These activities expose AEP to risks from price movements. If the values of the financial contracts change in a\nmanner AEP does not anticipate, it could harm financial position or reduce the financial contribution of trading operations.\nParties with whom AEP has contracts may fail to perform their obligations, which could harm AEP’s results of operations.\n(Applies to all Registrants)\nAEP sells power from its generation facilities into the spot market and other competitive power markets on a contractual basis.\nAEP also enters into contracts to purchase and sell electricity, natural gas, emission allowances, renewable energy credits and\ncoal as part of its power marketing and energy trading operations. AEP is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe AEP\n33\nmoney or the delivery of a commodity, including power, could breach their obligations. Should the counterparties to these\narrangements fail to perform, AEP may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying\ncommitments at then-current market prices that may exceed AEP’s contractual prices, which would cause financial results to be\ndiminished and AEP might incur losses. Although estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a\ncounterparty, actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict.\nAEP relies on electric transmission facilities that AEP does not own or control. If these facilities do not provide AEP with\nadequate transmission capacity, AEP may not be able to deliver wholesale electric power to the purchasers of AEP’s power.\n(Applies to all Registrants)\nAEP depends on transmission facilities owned and operated by other nonaffiliated power companies to deliver the power AEP\nsells at wholesale. This dependence exposes AEP to a variety of risks. If transmission is disrupted, or transmission capacity is\ninadequate, AEP may not be able to sell and deliver AEP wholesale power. If a region’s power transmission infrastructure is\ninadequate, AEP’s recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited. If restrictive transmission price regulation is\nimposed, the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure.\nThe FERC has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from\ncommodity sales. Although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions, access to transmission\nsystems may not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is\ncontractually unavailable. Management also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets\nto accommodate competitive access to those markets.\nOVEC may require additional liquidity and other capital support. (Applies to AEP, APCo, I&M and OPCo)\nAEP and several nonaffiliated utility companies own OVEC. The Inter-Company Power Agreement (ICPA) defines the rights\nand obligations and sets the power participation ratio of the parties to it. Under the ICPA, parties are entitled to receive and are\nobligated to pay for all OVEC capacity (approximately 2,400 MWs) in proportion to their respective power participation ratios.\nThe aggregate power participation ratio of APCo, I&M and OPCo is 43.47%. If a party fails to make payments owed by it\nunder the ICPA, OVEC may not have sufficient funds to honor its payment obligations, including its ongoing operating\nexpenses as well as its indebtedness. As of December 31, 2023, OVEC has outstanding indebtedness of approximately $1.1\nbillion, of which APCo, I&M, and OPCo are collectively responsible for $465 million through the ICPA. Although they are not\nan obligor or guarantor, APCo, I&M, and OPCo are responsible for their respective ratio of OVEC’s outstanding debt through\nthe ICPA and if OVEC’s indebtedness is accelerated for any reason, there is risk that APCo, I&M and/or OPCo may be\nrequired to pay some or all of such accelerated indebtedness in amounts equal to their aggregate power participation ratio of\n43.47%.\nNew climate disclosure rules proposed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission may increase our costs of\ncompliance and adversely impact our business. (Applies to all Registrants)\nOn March 21, 2022, the SEC proposed new rules relating to the disclosure of a range of climate-related risks. AEP is currently\nassessing the proposed rule, but at this time AEP cannot predict the costs of implementation or any potential adverse impacts\nresulting from the rule. To the extent this rule is finalized as proposed, AEP could incur increased costs relating to the\nassessment and disclosure of climate-related risks. AEP may also face increased litigation risks related to disclosures made\npursuant to the rule if finalized as proposed. In addition, enhanced climate disclosure requirements could accelerate the trend of\ncertain stakeholders and lenders restricting or seeking more stringent conditions with respect to their investments in certain\ncarbon-intensive sectors.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nThe electric utility industry is an identified critical infrastructure function with mandatory cybersecurity requirements under the\nauthority of FERC. The NERC, which FERC certified as the nation’s Electric Reliability Organization, developed mandatory\ncritical infrastructure protection cybersecurity reliability standards. AEP’s service territory covers multiple NERC regions and\nis audited at least annually by one or more of the regions. AEP has participated in the NERC grid security and emergency\nresponse exercises, GridEx, for the past ten years and continues to participate in the bi-yearly exercises. These NERC-led\nefforts test and further develop the coordination, threat sharing and interaction between utilities and various government\n34\nagencies relative to potential cyber and physical threats against the nation’s electric grid. AEP also conducts internal exercises\nto test and further refine AEP’s cyber response plans. These internal scenarios are chosen based on real world events and often\ninclude coordination with and communication to AEP’s Chief Executive Officer and executive team.\nThe operations of AEP’s electric utility subsidiaries are subject to extensive and rigorous mandatory cyber and physical security\nrequirements that are developed and enforced by NERC to protect grid security and reliability. AEP’s enterprise-wide security\nprogram includes cyber and physical security and incorporates many of the guidelines set forth in the National Institute of\nStandards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework. AEP has a primary and a back-up NERC Critical Infrastructure\nProtection Senior Manager, who is responsible for ensuring alignment of compliance with the enterprise-wide security program.\nCritical cyber assets, such as data centers, power plants, transmission operations centers and business networks are protected\nusing multiple layers of cybersecurity controls and authentication. Cyber hackers and other malicious actors have caused\nmaterial disruption by successfully breaching a number of very secure facilities of entities across the spectrum of industries,\nincluding federal agencies and financial institutions. As understanding of these events develop, AEP has adopted a defense in\ndepth approach to cybersecurity and continually assesses its cybersecurity tools and processes to determine where to strengthen\nits defenses. These strategies include monitoring, alerting and emergency response, forensic analysis, disaster recovery, threat\nsharing and criminal activity reporting. This approach has allowed AEP to deal with cyber and related threats, intrusions and\nattempted breaches in real-time and to limit their impact to levels that would be expected in the ordinary course of business in\nthe absence of such malicious activity. AEP is not aware of any occurrence from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of\nany previous cybersecurity incidents, that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect AEP’s business\nstrategy, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nAEP has undertaken a variety of actions to monitor and address cyber-related risks. Cybersecurity and the effectiveness of\nAEP’s cybersecurity processes are reviewed annually with the Board of Directors and at several meetings throughout the year\nwith the Technology Committee of the Board, the principal committee that exercises oversight with respect to these matters.\nAEP’s Chief Executive Officer and executive team participate in interactive threat briefings from AEP’s Chief Security Officer\nand/or Chief Information & Technology Officer on a regular basis. AEP’s strategy and procedure for managing cyber-related\nrisks is integrated within its enterprise risk management processes. These procedures are designed to ensure that any material\ninformation regarding potentially relevant cyber incidents is elevated in a timely manner both to the appropriate leadership and,\nwhere applicable, to our external financial reporting and disclosure team. AEP’s enterprise-wide security program continually\nadjusts staff and resources in response to the evolving threat landscape. The costs for such investments are material and have\nremained generally consistent over time, a pattern that is expected to continue. In addition, AEP maintains cyber liability\ninsurance to cover certain damages caused by cyber incidents.\nAEP maintains dedicated cybersecurity and physical security teams which are responsible for the design, implementation and\nexecution of AEP’s security risk management strategy, which includes cybersecurity. AEP’s cybersecurity team operates a 24/7\nCybersecurity Intelligence and Response Center responsible for monitoring the AEP System for cyber risks and threats. The\ncybersecurity team constantly scans the AEP System for cyber risks and threats. In addition, the cybersecurity team actively\nmonitors best practices, performs penetration testing, leads response exercises and internal awareness campaigns and provides\ntraining and communication across the organization. AEP’s security awareness training is mandatory for all employees and\nincludes regular phish email testing to train employees to identify malicious emails that could put AEP at risk.\nAEP also continually reviews its business continuity plan to develop an effective recovery strategy that seeks to decrease\nresponse times, limit financial impacts and maintain customer confidence during any business interruption. AEP administers a\nthird-party risk governance program that identifies potential risks introduced through third-party relationships, such as vendors,\nsoftware and hardware manufacturers or professional service providers. As warranted, AEP obtains certain contractual security\nguarantees and assurances with these third-party relationships to help ensure the security and safety of its information. The\ncyber security team works closely with a broad range of departments, including legal, regulatory, corporate communications,\ninternal audit services, information technology and operational technology functions critical to the power grid.\nThe cybersecurity team collaborates with partners from both industry and government, and routinely participates in industry-\nwide programs that exchange knowledge of threats with utility peers, industry and federal agencies. AEP is an active member\nof a number of industry-specific threat and information sharing communities including the Department of Homeland Security’s\nJoint Cyber Defense Collaborative, the Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center and the National Defense\nInformation Sharing and Analysis Center. AEP participates in classified briefings to maintain an awareness of current\ncybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities. AEP continues to work with nonaffiliated entities to do penetration testing and to\ndesign and implement appropriate remediation strategies. There can be no assurance, however, that these efforts will be\neffective to prevent material interruption of services or other damages to AEP's business or operations in connection with any\ncyber-related incident. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Market, Economic or Financial Volatility and Other Risks -\nPhysical attacks or hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair operations, lead to the disclosure of confidential information\nand damage AEP’s reputation”.\n35\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nGENERATION FACILITIES\nThe tables below summarize the net maximum capacity of AEP's owned generation plants as of December 31, 2023. AEP\nsubsidiaries serve customer electricity needs from these facilities and from purchased power in the PJM and SPP markets based\non demand and other economic conditions.

See Item 1 for additional information\nrelating to the total overhead circuit miles of transmission and distribution lines by operating company.\nTITLE TO PROPERTY\nThe AEP System’s generating facilities are generally located on lands owned in fee simple. The greater portion of the\ntransmission and distribution lines of the AEP System has been constructed over lands of private owners pursuant to easements\nor along public highways and streets pursuant to appropriate statutory authority. The rights of AEP’s public utility subsidiaries\nin the realty on which their facilities are located are considered adequate for use in the conduct of their business. Minor defects\nand irregularities customarily found in title to properties of like size and character may exist, but such defects and irregularities\ndo not materially impair the use of the properties. AEP’s public utility subsidiaries generally have the right of eminent domain\nwhich permits them, if necessary, to acquire, perfect or secure titles to or easements on privately held lands used or to be used\nin their utility operations.\nSYSTEM TRANSMISSION LINES AND FACILITY SITING\nLaws in the states of Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia\nrequire prior approval of sites of generating facilities and/or routes of high-voltage transmission lines. AEP has experienced\ndelays and additional costs in constructing facilities as a result of proceedings conducted pursuant to such statutes and in\nproceedings in which AEP’s operating companies have sought to acquire rights-of-way through condemnation. These\nproceedings may result in additional delays and costs in future years.\nCONSTRUCTION PROGRAM\nWith input from its state utility commissions, AEP subsidiaries continuously assess the adequacy of their transmission,\ndistribution, generation and other facilities to plan and provide for the reliable supply of electric power and energy to its\ncustomers. In this assessment process, assumptions are continually being reviewed as new information becomes available and\nassessments and plans are modified, as appropriate. AEP forecasts approximately $7.5 billion of construction expenditures for\n2024. Estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing\neffects of regulatory constraints, environmental regulations, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, supply\nchain issues, weather, legal reviews, inflation and the ability to access capital. See the “Budgeted Capital Expenditures” section\nof Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2023 Annual\nReport for additional information.\n38\nPOTENTIAL UNINSURED LOSSES\nSome potential losses or liabilities may not be insurable or the amount of insurance carried may not be sufficient to meet\npotential losses and liabilities, including liabilities relating to damage to AEP’s generation plants and costs of replacement\npower. Unless allowed to be recovered through rates, future losses or liabilities which are not completely insured could reduce\nnet income and impact the financial conditions of AEP and subsidiaries. For risks related to owning a nuclear generating unit,\nsee the “Nuclear Contingencies” section of Note 6 - Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies included in the 2023 Annual\nReport for additional information.\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFor a discussion of material legal proceedings, see Note 6 - Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies included in the 2023\nAnnual Report for additional information.\nITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURE\nThe Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act) imposes stringent health and safety standards on various mining\noperations. The Mine Act and its related regulations affect numerous aspects of mining operations, including training of mine\npersonnel, mining procedures, equipment used in mine emergency procedures, mine plans and other matters. Prior to October\n1, 2023, SWEPCo, through its ownership of DHLC, a wholly-owned lignite mining subsidiary of SWEPCo, was subject to the\nprovisions of the Mine Act. Effective as of October 1, 2023, the U.S. Department of Labor’s Mine Safety and Health\nAdministration put DHLC in Abandoned Mine Status. As a result of this designation, DHLC is no longer subject to the Mine\nAct or Section 1503 of The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.\n39\nPART II\nITEM 5.

AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES MANAGEMENT’S\nDISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nCompany Overview\nAEP is one of the largest investor-owned electric public utility holding companies in the United States. AEP’s electric utility\noperating companies provide generation, transmission and distribution services to more than five million retail customers in\nArkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.\nAEP’s subsidiaries operate an extensive portfolio of assets including:\n• Approximately 225,000 circuit miles of distribution lines that deliver electricity to 5.6 million customers.\n• Approximately 40,000 circuit miles of transmission lines, including approximately 2,200 circuit miles of 765 kV lines,\nthe backbone of the electric interconnection grid in the eastern United States.\n• Approximately 23,000 MWs of regulated owned generating capacity as of December 31, 2023, one of the largest\ncomplements of generation in the United States.\nAEP CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n2023 Compared to 2022\nEarnings Attributable to AEP Common Shareholders decreased from $2.3 billion in 2022 to $2.2 billion in 2023 primarily due\nto:\n• A decrease in weather-related sales volumes.\n• An increase in interest expense due to higher interest rates and debt balances.\n• Unfavorable mark-to-market economic hedge activity driven by a decrease in commodity prices.\n• A loss on the sale of the competitive contracted renewables portfolio in 2023.\n• Unfavorable regulatory decisions in Texas, West Virginia and at FERC.\n• A gain on the sale of mineral rights in 2022.\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\n• Favorable rate proceedings in AEP’s various jurisdictions.\n• Investment in transmission assets, which resulted in higher revenues and income.\n• A loss related to the expected sale of the Kentucky Operations in 2022. The expected sale was terminated in April\n2023.\n• An impairment of AEP’s equity investment in Flat Ridge 2 in 2022.\nSee “Results of Operations” section for additional information by operating segment.\nCustomer Demand\nAEP’s weather-normalized retail sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by 2.5% from the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. Weather-normalized residential sales decreased 0.9% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to\nthe year ended December 31, 2022. Weather-normalized commercial sales increased by 7.8% in 2023 compared to 2022. The\nincrease in commercial sales was primarily due to new data center loads and economic development. AEP’s 2023 industrial\nsales volumes increased 1.6% compared to 2022. The growth in industrial sales was spread across many industries.\nIn 2024, AEP anticipates weather-normalized retail sales volumes will increase by 1.5%. Weather-normalized residential sales\nvolumes are projected to decrease by 0.4% in 2024, while weather-normalized commercial sales volumes are projected to\nincrease by 4.5%. The projected increase in commercial sales volumes is driven by new loads associated with data centers and\ncryptocurrency operations. Finally, AEP projects the industrial sales volumes to increase by 0.6% in 2024.\n44\negnahC\ntnecreP\nPercentage Change in Sales Volume\n2023(a) 2024 Forecast (b)\n7.8%\n8.0%\n7.0%\n6.0%\n4.5%\n5.0%\n4.0%\n2.5%\n3.0%\n1.5% 1.6%\n2.0%\n0.6%\n1.0%\n0.0%\n-1.0%\n-0.4%\n-0.9%\n-2.0%\nWeather-Normalized Weather-Normalized Weather-Normalized Industrial Sales\nRetail Residential Commercial\n(a) Percentage change for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.\n(b) Forecasted percentage change for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.\nSupply Chain Disruption and Inflation\nThe Registrants have experienced certain supply chain disruptions driven by several factors including international tensions and\nthe ramifications of regional conflict, increased demand due to the economic recovery from the pandemic, inflation, labor\nshortages in certain trades and shortages in the availability of certain raw materials. These supply chain disruptions have not\nhad a material impact on the Registrants’ net income, cash flows and financial condition, but have extended lead times for\ncertain goods and services and have contributed to higher prices for fuel, materials, labor, equipment and other needed\ncommodities. Management has implemented risk mitigation strategies in an attempt to mitigate the impacts of these supply\nchain disruptions.\nThe United States economy has experienced a significant level of inflation that has contributed to increased uncertainty in the\noutlook of near-term economic activity, including whether the pace of inflation will continue to moderate. A prolonged\ncontinuation or a further increase in the severity of supply chain and inflationary disruptions could result in additional increases\nin the cost of certain goods, services and cost of capital and further extend lead times which could reduce future net income and\ncash flows and impact financial condition.\n2023 SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS\nDisposition of the Competitive Contracted Renewables Portfolio\nIn February 2022, AEP management announced the initiation of a process to sell all or a portion of AEP Renewables’\ncompetitive contracted renewables portfolio (the portfolio) within the Generation & Marketing segment. In late January 2023,\nAEP received final bids from interested parties. In February 2023, AEP’s Board of Directors approved management’s plan to\nsell the portfolio and AEP signed an agreement with a nonaffiliated party.\nIn August 2023, AEP completed the sale of the entire portfolio to the nonaffiliated party and received cash proceeds of\napproximately $1.2 billion, net of taxes and transaction costs. AEP recorded a pretax loss of approximately $93 million ($73\nmillion after-tax) for the year ended December 31, 2023 related to the sale. See the \"Disposition of the Competitive Contracted\nRenewables Portfolio\" section of Note 7 for additional information.\nPlanned Sale of AEP Energy and AEP Onsite Partners\nAEP management has continued a strategic evaluation of AEP’s portfolio of businesses with a focus on core regulated utility\noperations, risk mitigation and simplification. As a result of these efforts, the following decisions have been made with respect\nto AEP Energy and AEP Onsite Partners.\n45\nAEP Energy\nIn October 2022, AEP initiated a strategic evaluation for its ownership in AEP Energy, a wholly-owned retail energy supplier\nthat supplies electricity and/or natural gas on a price risk managed basis to residential, commercial and industrial customers.\nAEP Energy provides various energy solutions in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio and\nWashington, D.C. AEP Energy had approximately 929,000 customer accounts as of December 31, 2023. In April 2023, AEP\nmanagement completed the strategic evaluation of AEP Energy and initiated a sales process. The timing of the completion of\nthe sales process is dependent upon a number of factors. AEP is currently targeting the sales process to be completed in the\nfirst half of 2024. Depending on the outcome of the sales process, it could reduce future net income and impact financial\ncondition.\nAEP Onsite Partners\nIn April 2023, AEP also made a decision to include AEP Onsite Partners in a sales process. AEP OnSite Partners targets\nopportunities in distributed solar, combined heat and power, energy storage, waste heat recovery, energy efficiency, peaking\ngeneration and other energy solutions. As of December 31, 2023, AEP OnSite Partners owned projects located in 22 states,\nincluding approximately 195 MWs of installed solar capacity and two solar projects under construction totaling approximately\n4 MWs. As of December 31, 2023, the net book value of these assets was $352 million. The timing of the completion of the\nsales process is dependent upon a number of factors. AEP is currently targeting the sales process to be completed in the first\nhalf of 2024. If AEP is unable to recover the net book value of these assets as part of the sale process, it could reduce future net\nincome and impact financial condition.\nAEP Onsite Partners also owns a 50% interest in NMRD totaling $101 million accounted for as an equity method investment.\nThe NMRD portfolio consists of 9 operating solar projects totaling 185 MWs and 6 projects totaling 440 MWs in development.\nSeparate from the remainder of AEP Onsite Partners, AEP and the joint owner agreed to a joint sales process for their\nrespective interests in NMRD.\nIn December 2023, AEP and the joint owner signed an agreement to sell NMRD to a nonaffiliated third party for $230 million.\nAEP expects to receive cash proceeds of $104 million, net of taxes, transaction fees and other customary closing adjustments.\nAEP recorded a pretax loss of $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 as a result of entering into the sales agreement. The\ntransaction has received all required regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2024. See the “NMRD”\nsection of Note 7 for additional information.\nPlanned Sale and Strategic Evaluation of Certain Transmission Joint Ventures\nIn April 2023, AEP also initiated a strategic evaluation for its ownership in certain transmission joint ventures in the AEP\nTransmission Holdco segment including Pioneer Transmission, LLC, Prairie Wind Transmission, LLC and Transource Energy.\nIn July 2023, AEP made a decision to initiate a sales process for its investment in Pioneer Transmission, LLC and Prairie Wind\nTransmission, LLC. In February 2024, AEP management determined it would retain its ownership of its investment in Pioneer\nTransmission, LLC and Prairie Wind Transmission, LLC. As of December 31, 2023, AEP’s investment in Pioneer\nTransmission, LLC and Prairie Wind Transmission, LLC was $46 million and $19 million, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the net book value of Transource Energy was $289 million inclusive of $39 million related to\nnoncontrolling interest on AEP’s balance sheet. AEP management recently completed its strategic review and determined it\nwould retain this business due to its fit within the goals and objectives of AEP and its overall leadership role in the U.S. electric\ntransmission space.\n46\nTermination of Planned Disposition of KPCo and KTCo\nIn October 2021, AEP entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (SPA) to sell KPCo and KTCo to Liberty Utilities Co., a\nsubsidiary of Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. (Liberty), for approximately a $2.85 billion enterprise value. The SPA was\nsubsequently amended in September 2022 to reduce the purchase price to approximately $2.646 billion. An impairment of\n$363 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2022. The sale required approval from the KPSC and from the\nFERC under Section 203 of the Federal Power Act. The SPA contained certain termination rights if the closing of the sale did\nnot occur by April 26, 2023.\nIn May 2022, the KPSC approved the sale of KPCo to Liberty subject to certain conditions contingent upon the closing of the\nsale. In December 2022, the FERC issued an order denying, without prejudice, authorization of the proposed sale stating the\napplicants failed to demonstrate the proposed transaction will not have an adverse effect on rates. In February 2023, a new\nfiling for approval under Section 203 of the Federal Power Act was submitted. In March 2023, the KPSC and other intervenors\nmade filings recommending the FERC reject AEP and Liberty’s new Section 203 application seeking approval of the sale.\nAs a result of delays in the anticipated timing of the closing of the transaction and other factors, AEP recorded a $363 million\npretax loss on the expected sale of the Kentucky Operations for the year ended December 31, 2022. In April 2023, AEP,\nAEPTCo and Liberty entered into a Mutual Termination Agreement (Termination Agreement) terminating the SPA. The\nparties entered into the Termination Agreement as all of the conditions precedent to closing the sale could not be satisfied prior\nto April 26, 2023. Upon termination of the sale and reverting to a held and used model, in the first quarter of 2023, AEP\nreversed $28 million of expected transaction costs included in the $363 million pretax loss and was required to present its\ninvestment in the Kentucky Operations at the lower of fair value or historical carrying value which resulted in a $335 million\nreduction recorded in Property, Plant and Equipment. The reduced investment in KPCo’s assets is being amortized over the 30-\nyear average useful life of the KPCo assets.\nRenewable Generation\nThe growth of AEP’s regulated renewable generation portfolio reflects the company’s strategy to diversify generation resources\nto provide clean energy to customers that meet both their energy and capacity needs.\nSignificant Renewable Generation Placed Into Service\nIn 2023, AEP acquired and placed into service 159 MWs of owned renewable generation facilities totaling approximately $155\nmillion.\nSignificant Approved Renewable Generation Filings\nAEP has received regulatory approvals from various state regulatory commissions to acquire approximately 2,811 MWs of\nowned renewable generation facilities, totaling approximately $6.6 billion, in addition to 377 MWs of renewable purchase\npower agreements, as included in the following table:\nGeneration Generating\nCompany Type Expected Commercial Operation Owned/PPA Capacity\n(in MWs)\nAPCo Solar Year End 2024 through Year End 2026 PPA 204\nAPCo Wind Year End 2025 through Year End 2026 Owned 347\nI&M Solar Year End 2025 PPA 100\nI&M Solar Year End 2026 Owned 469\nPSO Solar Year End 2025 Owned 443\nPSO Wind Year End 2025 through Year End 2026 Owned 553\nSWEPCo (a) Solar Year End 2025 through Year End 2027 Owned/PPA 273\nSWEPCo (a) Wind Year End 2024 through Year End 2025 Owned 799\nTotal Approved Renewable Projects 3,188\n(a) Includes approvals by the APSC and LPSC for 999 MWs of owned projects. Additionally, the LPSC approved the\nflex-up option, allowing SWEPCo to provide additional service to Louisiana customers and recover the portion of\nthe projects denied by the PUCT.\n47\nSignificant Renewable Generation Requests for Proposal (RFP)\nAs part of AEP’s transition to diversify the company’s regulated generation resources and build its renewable generation\nportfolio, RFPs have been issued in order to satisfy the need for additional capacity resources. The table below includes RFPs\nrecently issued for both owned and purchased power generation. Unless otherwise noted, RFPs issued are all-source\nsolicitations for accredited capacity with consideration made for renewable projects. Projects selected will be subject to\nregulatory approval.\nProjected\nCompany Issuance Date In-Service Dates Generating Capacity\n(in MWs)\nI&M (a) March 2023 Year End 2027 2,505\nAPCo (b) April 2023 Year End 2026 800\nKPCo (c) September 2023 Year End 2026/2027 1,300\nPSO November 2023 Year End 2027/2028 1,500\nSWEPCo January 2024 Year End 2028 2,100\nTotal Significant RFPs 8,205\n(a) RFP is seeking nameplate capacity proposals from various types of generation.

Depending on the outcomes,\nthese rate cases and proceedings can have a material impact on results of operations, cash flows and possibly financial\ncondition. AEP is currently involved in the following key proceedings.\nThe following tables show the Registrants’ completed and pending base rate case proceedings in 2023. See Note 4 - Rate\nMatters for additional information.\nCompleted Base Rate Case Proceedings\nAnnual\nBase Revenue Approved New Rates\nCompany Jurisdiction Increase ROE Effective\n(in millions)\nSWEPCo Louisiana $ 21.0 (a) 9.5% February 2023\nPSO Oklahoma 131.0 9.3% January 2024\nAPCo Virginia 127.0 9.5% January 2024\nKPCo Kentucky 60.0 9.75% January 2024\n(a) See “2020 Louisiana Base Rate Case” section of Note 4 for additional information.\nPending Base Rate Case Proceedings\nAnnual\nFiling Base Revenue Requested\nCompany Jurisdiction Date Increase Request ROE\n(in millions)\nI&M Indiana August 2023 $ 116.0 10.5%\nI&M Michigan September 2023 34.0 10.5%\nPSO Oklahoma January 2024 218.0 10.8%\n48\nOther Significant Regulatory Matters\n2012 Texas Base Rate Case\nIn 2012, SWEPCo filed a request with the PUCT to increase annual base rates primarily due to the completion of the Turk\nPlant. In 2013, the PUCT issued an order affirming the prudence of the Turk Plant but determined that the Turk Plant’s Texas\njurisdictional capital cost cap established in a previous Certificate of Convenience and Necessity case also limited SWEPCo’s\nrecovery of AFUDC in addition to limits on its recovery of cash construction costs. Upon rehearing in 2014, the PUCT\nreversed its initial ruling and determined that AFUDC was excluded from the Turk Plant’s Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap.\nIn 2017, the Texas District Court upheld the PUCT’s 2014 order and intervenors filed appeals with the Texas Third Court of\nAppeals. In August 2021, the Texas Third Court of Appeals reversed the Texas District Court judgment affirming the PUCT’s\norder on AFUDC, concluding that the language of the PUCT’s original 2008 order intended to include AFUDC in the Texas\njurisdictional capital cost cap, and remanded the case to the PUCT for future proceedings. In November 2021, SWEPCo and\nthe PUCT submitted Petitions for Review with the Texas Supreme Court. In October 2022, the Texas Supreme Court denied\nthe Petitions for Review submitted by SWEPCo and the PUCT. In December 2022, SWEPCo and the PUCT filed requests for\nrehearing with the Texas Supreme Court. In June 2023, the Texas Supreme Court denied SWEPCo’s request for rehearing and\nthe case was remanded to the PUCT for future proceedings. In October 2023, SWEPCo filed testimony with the PUCT in the\nremanded proceeding recommending no refund or disallowance.\nOn December 14, 2023, the PUCT approved a preliminary order stating the PUCT will not address SWEPCo’s request that\nwould allow the PUCT to find cause to allow SWEPCo to exceed the Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap in the current remand\nproceeding. As a result of the PUCT’s approval of the preliminary order, SWEPCo believes it is probable the PUCT will\ndisallow capitalized AFUDC in excess of the Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap and recorded a pretax, non-cash disallowance\nof $86 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Such determination may reduce SWEPCo’s future revenues by approximately\n$15 million on an annual basis. On December 21, 2023, SWEPCo filed a motion with the PUCT for reconsideration of the\npreliminary order. In January 2024, the PUCT denied the motion for reconsideration of the preliminary order.\nThe PUCT’s December 2023 approval of the preliminary order determined that it will address, in the ongoing PUCT remand\nproceeding, any potential revenue refunds to customers that may be required by future PUCT orders. In January 2024, the\nPUCT established a procedural schedule for the remand proceeding. Supplemental testimony from SWEPCo is due in March\n2024, intervenor and staff testimony is due in April 2024 and a hearing is scheduled for May 2024. Although SWEPCo does\nnot currently believe any refunds are probable of occurring, SWEPCo estimates it could be required to make customer refunds,\nincluding interest, ranging from $0 to $200 million related to revenues collected from February 2013 through December 2023.\nFERC 2021 PJM and SPP Transmission Formula Rate Challenge\nThe Registrants transitioned to stand-alone treatment of NOLCs in its PJM and SPP transmission formula rates beginning with\nthe 2022 projected transmission revenue requirements and 2021 true-up to actual transmission revenue requirements and\nprovided notice of this change in informational filings made with the FERC. Stand-alone treatment of the NOLCs for\ntransmission formula rates increased the annual revenue requirements for years 2023, 2022 and 2021 by $60 million,\n$69 million and $78 million, respectively.\nIn March 2023 and May 2023, certain joint customers submitted a complaint and a formal challenge at the FERC related to the\n2022 Annual Update of the 2021 Transmission Formula Rates of the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within PJM and\nSPP, respectively. These challenges primarily relate to stand-alone treatment of NOLCs in the transmission formula rates of the\nAEP transmission owning subsidiaries. AEPSC, on behalf of the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within PJM and SPP,\nfiled answers to the joint formal challenge and complaint with the FERC in the second quarter of 2023.\nIn January 2024, the FERC issued two orders, granting the joint customers’ challenges related to stand-alone treatment of\nNOLCs in the 2021 Transmission Formula Rates of the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within PJM and SPP. The FERC\ndirected the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within PJM and SPP to provide refunds with interest on all amounts\ncollected for the 2021 rate year, and for such refunds to be reflected in the annual update for the next rate year. In February\n2024, AEPSC on behalf of the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within PJM and SPP filed requests with the FERC that it\ngrant rehearing and reverse findings in its January 2024 orders or establish hearing procedures to address outstanding factual\nissues.\nAs a result of the January 2024 FERC orders, the Registrants’ 2022 and 2023 income statements cumulatively reflect a\nprovision for refund for the probable refund of all NOLC revenues included in transmission formula rates for years 2023, 2022\nand 2021. The probable refunds to affiliated and nonaffiliated customers are reflected as Deferred Credits and Other\nNoncurrent Liabilities on the balance sheets. Refunds probable to be received by affiliated companies, resulting in a reduction\nto affiliated transmission expense, were deferred as an increase to Regulatory Liabilities or a reduction to Regulatory Assets on\n49\nthe balance sheets where management expects that refunds would be returned to retail customers through authorized retail\njurisdiction rider mechanisms. The FERC directed cash refunds with interest related to the 2021 rate year to occur through the\nannual update for the next rate year, which will be invoiced by PJM and SPP primarily in 2025. The Registrants have not yet\nbeen directed to make cash refunds related to the 2022 or 2023 rate years.\nThe FERC's January 2024 orders reduced AEP and AEPTCo's 2023 pretax net income by approximately $76 million and\n$74 million, respectively. The impact of the FERC's orders on the pretax net income of AEP's remaining Registrant\nSubsidiaries was not material.\nKentucky Securitization Case\nIn conjunction with KPCo’s June 2023 base rate case filing, KPCo requested to finance, through the issuance of securitization\nbonds, approximately $471 million of regulatory assets recorded as of June 2023 including: (a) $289 million of plant retirement\ncosts, (b) $79 million of deferred storm costs related to 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 major storms, (c) $52 million of deferred\npurchased power expenses and (d) $51 million of under-recovered purchased power rider costs.\nIn January 2024, the KPSC issued a financing order approving KPCo’s securitization request and concluding that costs\nrequested for recovery were prudently incurred. The KPSC’s financing order includes certain additional requirements related to\nsecuritization bond structuring, marketing, placement, and issuance that were not reflected in KPCo’s proposal. As a result, in\nJanuary 2024, KPCo filed a request for rehearing with the KPSC to clarify certain aspects of these additional requirements. In\nFebruary 2024, the KPSC denied KPCo’s rehearing requests. In accordance with Kentucky statutory requirements and the\nfinancing order, the issuance of the securitized bonds is subject to final review by the KPSC after bond pricing. KPCo expects\nto proceed with the securitized bond issuance process and to complete the securitization process in the second half of 2024,\nsubject to market conditions. If any of these costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and\nimpact financial condition.\nDeferred Fuel Costs\nIncreases in fuel and purchased power costs in excess of amounts included in fuel-related revenues has led to an increase in the\nunder collection of fuel costs from customers in several jurisdictions in recent years. To help ease the burden on customers,\ncertain state commissions have issued orders allowing recovery of these costs over periods exceeding the traditional\njurisdictional FAC terms. The table below illustrates the current and noncurrent under-recovered fuel regulatory asset balances,\nby jurisdiction, impacted by these orders. If any of these deferred fuel costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net\nincome and cash flows and impact financial condition. See Note 4 - Rate Matters and Note 5 - Effects of Regulation for\nadditional information.\nExpected/Authorized As of As of Increase/\nCompany Jurisdiction Recovery Period December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 (Decrease)\n(in millions)\nAPCo Virginia 2025 $ 254.4 (a) $ 407.9 $ (153.5)\nAPCo West Virginia 2034 162.2 (b) 288.5 (126.3)\nPSO Oklahoma 2024 118.3 (c) 431.5 (313.2)\nSWEPCo Texas 2035 80.9 (d) 80.7 0.2\nWPCo West Virginia 2034 181.3 (b) 231.1 (49.8)\nTotal $ 797.1 $ 1,439.7 $ (642.6)\n(a) In September 2023, APCo submitted a filing with the Virginia SCC requesting to extend the previously authorized recovery period\nthrough October 2024 to October 2025. Interim Virginia FAC rates were implemented in November 2023. An order from the\nVirginia SCC is expected in the first quarter of 2024.\n(b) In January 2024, the WVPSC issued a final order which resulted in a December 2023 write-off of $222 million ($127 million\nattributable to APCo and $95 million attributable to WPCo) of under-recovered ENEC regulatory assets as of February 28, 2023.\nThe order approved the recovery of $321 million ($174 million attributable to APCo and $147 million attributable to WPCo) of\nunder-recovered ENEC regulatory assets as of February 28, 2023 over 10 years beginning September 1, 2024. The recovery of the\nremaining under-recovered ENEC regulatory assets as of December 31, 2023 will be addressed in APCo and WPCo’s 2024 ENEC\nfiling. In February 2024, the Companies filed briefs with the West Virginia Supreme Court to initiate an appeal of this order.\n(c) In September 2022, the Director of the Public Utility Division of the OCC approved a Fuel Cost Adjustment rate designed to\ncollect a $402 million deferred fuel balance through December 2024. PSO’s fuel and purchased power expenses are subject to an\nannual prudency review by the OCC.\n(d) In September 2023, the PUCT issued an order approving an unopposed settlement agreement that provides recovery of $81 million\nof Oxbow mine and Sabine related fuel costs through 2035.\n50\nMerchant Portion of Turk Plant\nSWEPCo constructed the Turk Plant, a base load 600 MW (650 MW net maximum capacity) pulverized coal ultra-supercritical\ngenerating unit in Arkansas, which was placed in-service in December 2012 and is included in the Vertically Integrated Utilities\nsegment. SWEPCo owns 73% (440 MWs/477 MWs) of the Turk Plant and operates the facility.\nApproximately 20% of SWEPCo’s portion of the Turk Plant output is currently not subject to cost-based rate recovery in\nArkansas. This portion of the plant’s output is being sold into the wholesale market. Approximately 80% of the Turk Plant\ninvestment is recovered under retail cost-based rate recovery in Texas, Louisiana and through SWEPCo’s wholesale customers\nunder FERC-approved rates. In November 2022, SWEPCo filed a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity with the\nAPSC for approval to operate the Turk plant to serve Arkansas customers and recover the associated costs through a cost\nrecovery rider. Cost-based recovery of the Turk Plant would aid SWEPCo’s near-term capacity needs and support compliance\nwith SPP’s 2023 increased capacity planning reserve margin requirements. In April 2023, intervenors filed testimony\nrecommending the APSC deny the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity on the basis that the Turk Plant is not the\nleast cost alternative. In June 2023, SWEPCo filed rebuttal testimony with the APSC. In July 2023, additional intervenor\ntestimony was filed with the APSC by the Attorney General of Arkansas and the APSC staff with recommendations consistent\nwith the previously filed April 2023 intervenor testimony. A hearing was held in October 2023 and an order is expected in the\nfirst quarter of 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the net book value of the Turk Plant was $1.4 billion, before cost of removal\nincluding CWIP and inventory. If SWEPCo cannot ultimately recover its investment and expenses related to the Arkansas\nretail portion of the Turk Plant, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nLitigation Related to Ohio House Bill 6 (HB 6)\nIn July 2019, HB 6, which offered incentives for power-generating facilities with zero or reduced carbon emissions, was signed\ninto law by the Ohio Governor. HB 6 terminated energy efficiency programs as of December 31, 2020, including OPCo’s\nshared savings revenues of $26 million annually and phased out renewable mandates after 2026. HB 6 also provided for\ncontinued recovery of existing renewable energy contracts on a bypassable basis through 2032 and included a provision for\ncontinued recovery of OVEC costs through 2030 which is allocated to all electric distribution utility customers in Ohio on a\nnon-bypassable basis. OPCo’s Inter-Company Power Agreement for OVEC terminates in June 2040. In July 2020, an\ninvestigation led by the U.S. Attorney’s Office resulted in a federal grand jury indictment of the Speaker of the Ohio House of\nRepresentatives, Larry Householder, four other individuals, and Generation Now, an entity registered as a 501(c)(4) social\nwelfare organization, in connection with an alleged racketeering conspiracy involving the adoption of HB 6. Certain defendants\nin that case had previously plead guilty and, in March 2023, a federal jury convicted Larry Householder and another individual\nof participating in the racketeering conspiracy. In 2021, four AEP shareholders filed derivative actions purporting to assert\nclaims on behalf of AEP against certain AEP officers and directors. See “Litigation Related to Ohio House Bill 6” section of\nLitigation below for additional information.\nIn March 2021, the Governor of Ohio signed legislation that, among other things, repealed the payments to the nonaffiliated\nowner of Ohio’s nuclear power plants that were previously authorized under HB 6. The new legislation, House Bill 128, went\ninto effect in May 2021 and leaves unchanged other provisions of HB 6 regarding energy efficiency programs, recovery of\nrenewable energy costs and recovery of OVEC costs. To the extent that the law changes or OPCo is unable to recover the costs\nof renewable energy contracts on a bypassable basis by the end of 2032, recover costs of OVEC after 2030 or incurs significant\ncosts associated with the derivative actions, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\n51\nLITIGATION\nIn the ordinary course of business, AEP is involved in employment, commercial, environmental and regulatory litigation. Since\nit is difficult to predict the outcome of these proceedings, management cannot predict the eventual resolution, timing or amount\nof any loss, fine or penalty. Management assesses the probability of loss for each contingency and accrues a liability for cases\nthat have a probable likelihood of loss if the loss can be estimated. Adverse results in these proceedings have the potential to\nreduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. See Note 4 – Rate Matters and Note 6 –\nCommitments, Guarantees and Contingencies for additional information.\nLitigation Related to Ohio House Bill 6 (HB 6)\nIn 2019, Ohio adopted and implemented HB 6 which benefits OPCo by authorizing rate recovery for certain costs including\nrenewable energy contracts and OVEC’s coal-fired generating units. OPCo engaged in lobbying efforts and provided testimony\nduring the legislative process in connection with HB 6. In July 2020, an investigation led by the U.S. Attorney’s Office\nresulted in a federal grand jury indictment of an Ohio legislator and associates in connection with an alleged racketeering\nconspiracy involving the adoption of HB 6. After AEP learned of the criminal allegations against the Ohio legislator and others\nrelating to HB 6, AEP, with assistance from outside advisors, conducted a review of the circumstances surrounding the passage\nof the bill. Management does not believe that AEP was involved in any wrongful conduct in connection with the passage of\nHB 6.\nIn August 2020, an AEP shareholder filed a putative class action lawsuit in the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of\nOhio against AEP and certain of its officers for alleged violations of securities laws. In December 2021, the district court\nissued an opinion and order dismissing the securities litigation complaint with prejudice, determining that the complaint failed\nto plead any actionable misrepresentations or omissions. The plaintiffs did not appeal the ruling.\nIn January 2021, an AEP shareholder filed a derivative action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio\npurporting to assert claims on behalf of AEP against certain AEP officers and directors. In February 2021, a second AEP\nshareholder filed a similar derivative action in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, Ohio. In April 2021, a third\nAEP shareholder filed a similar derivative action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio and a fourth AEP\nshareholder filed a similar derivative action in the Supreme Court for the State of New York, Nassau County. These derivative\ncomplaints allege the officers and directors made misrepresentations and omissions similar to those alleged in the putative\nsecurities class action lawsuit filed against AEP. The derivative complaints together assert claims for: (a) breach of fiduciary\nduty, (b) waste of corporate assets, (c) unjust enrichment, (d) breach of duty for insider trading and (e) contribution for\nviolations of sections 10(b) and 21D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and seek monetary damages and changes to\nAEP’s corporate governance and internal policies among other forms of relief. The court entered a scheduling order in the New\nYork state court derivative action staying the case other than with respect to briefing the motion to dismiss. AEP filed\nsubstantive and forum-based motions to dismiss in April 2022. In June 2022, the Ohio state court entered an order continuing\nthe stays of that case until the final resolution of the consolidated derivative actions pending in Ohio federal district court. In\nSeptember 2022, the New York state court granted the forum-based motion to dismiss with prejudice and the plaintiff\nsubsequently filed a notice of appeal with the New York appellate court. In January 2023, the New York plaintiff filed a\nmotion to intervene in the pending Ohio federal court action and withdrew his appeal in New York. The two derivative actions\npending in federal district court in Ohio have been consolidated and the plaintiffs in the consolidated action filed an amended\ncomplaint. AEP filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint and subsequently filed a brief in opposition to the New York\nplaintiffs’ motion to intervene in the consolidated action in Ohio. In March 2023, the federal district court issued an order\ngranting the motion to dismiss with prejudice and denying the New York plaintiffs’ motion to intervene. In April 2023, one of\nthe plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit of the Ohio federal district court order\ndismissing the consolidated action and denying the intervention. The defendants will continue to defend against the claims.\nManagement is unable to determine a range of potential losses that is reasonably possible of occurring.\nIn March 2021, AEP received a litigation demand letter from counsel representing a purported AEP shareholder. The litigation\ndemand letter was directed to the Board of Directors of AEP (AEP Board) and contained factual allegations involving HB 6 that\nwere generally consistent with those in the derivative litigation filed in state and federal court. The shareholder that sent the\nletter has since withdrawn the litigation demand, which is now terminated and of no further effect. In April 2023, AEP received\na litigation demand from counsel representing the purported AEP shareholder who filed the dismissed derivative action in New\nYork state court and unsuccessfully tried to intervene in the consolidated derivative actions in Ohio federal court. The litigation\ndemand letter is directed to the AEP Board and contains factual allegations involving HB 6 that are generally consistent with\nthose in the derivative litigation filed in state and federal court. The letter demands, among other things, that the AEP Board\nundertake an independent investigation into alleged legal violations by certain current and former directors and officers, and\nthat AEP commence a civil action for breaches of fiduciary duty and related claims against any individuals who allegedly\n52\nharmed AEP. The AEP Board considered the 2023 litigation demand letter and formed a committee of the Board (the “Demand\nReview Committee”) to investigate, review, monitor and analyze the allegations in the letter and make a recommendation to the\nAEP Board regarding a reasonable and appropriate response to the same. The AEP Board will act in response to the letter as\nappropriate. Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that is reasonably possible of occurring.\nIn May 2021, AEP received a subpoena from the SEC’s Division of Enforcement seeking various documents, including\ndocuments relating to the passage of HB 6 and documents relating to AEP’s policies and financial processes and controls. In\nAugust 2022, AEP received a second subpoena from the SEC seeking various additional documents relating to its ongoing\ninvestigation. AEP is cooperating fully with the SEC’s investigation, which has included taking testimony from certain\nindividuals and inquiries regarding Empowering Ohio’s Economy, Inc., which is a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization, and\nrelated disclosures. The SEC staff has advanced its discussions with certain parties involved in the investigation, including\nAEP, concerning the staff’s intentions regarding potential claims under the securities laws. AEP and the SEC are engaged in\ndiscussions about a possible resolution of the SEC’s investigation and potential claims under the securities laws. Any\nresolution or filed claims, the outcome of which cannot be predicted, may subject AEP to civil penalties and other remedial\nmeasures. Discussions are continuing and management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that is reasonably\npossible of occurring, but management does not believe the results of this investigation or a possible resolution thereof will\nhave a material impact on results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nClaims for Indemnification Made by Owners of the Gavin Power Station\nIn November 2022, the Federal EPA issued a final decision denying Gavin Power LLC’s requested extension to allow a CCR\nsurface impoundment at the Gavin Power Station to continue to receive CCR and non-CCR waste streams after April 11, 2021\nuntil May 4, 2023 (the Gavin Denial). As part of the Gavin Denial, the Federal EPA made several assertions related to the CCR\nRule (see “CCR Rule” section below for additional information), including an assertion that the closure of the 300 acre unlined\nfly ash reservoir (FAR) is noncompliant with the CCR Rule in multiple respects. The Gavin Power Station was formerly\nowned and operated by AEP and was sold to Gavin Power LLC and Lightstone Generation LLC in 2017. Pursuant to the PSA,\nAEP maintained responsibility to complete closure of the FAR in accordance with the closure plan approved by the Ohio EPA\nwhich was completed in July 2021. The PSA contains indemnification provisions, pursuant to which the owners of the Gavin\nPower Station have notified AEP they believe they are entitled to indemnification for any damages that may result from these\nclaims, including any future enforcement or litigation resulting from any determinations of noncompliance by the Federal EPA\nwith various aspects of the CCR Rule consistent with the Gavin Denial. The owners of the Gavin Power Station have also\nsought indemnification for landowner claims for property damage allegedly caused by modifications to the FAR. Management\ndoes not believe that the owners of the Gavin Power Station have any valid claim for indemnity or otherwise against AEP under\nthe PSA. In addition, Gavin Power LLC, several AEP subsidiaries, and other parties have filed Petitions for Review of the\nGavin Denial with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Management is unable to determine a range\nof potential losses that is reasonably possible of occurring. Gavin Power LLC has also filed a complaint with the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of Ohio, alleging various violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and asserting\nthat the Federal EPA, through its prior inaction, has waived and is estopped from raising certain objections raised in the Gavin\nDenial. Management cannot predict the outcome of that litigation.\nENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES\nAEP has a substantial capital investment program and incurs additional operational costs to comply with environmental control\nrequirements. Additional investments and operational changes will be made in response to existing and anticipated\nrequirements to reduce emissions from fossil generation and in response to rules governing the beneficial use and disposal of\ncoal combustion by-products, clean water and renewal permits for certain water discharges.\nAEP is engaged in litigation about environmental issues, was notified of potential responsibility for the clean-up of\ncontaminated sites and incurred costs for disposal of SNF and future decommissioning of the nuclear units. Management is\nengaged in the development of possible future requirements including the items discussed below.\nAEP will seek recovery of expenditures for pollution control technologies and associated costs from customers through rates in\nregulated jurisdictions. Environmental rules could result in accelerated depreciation, impairment of assets or regulatory\ndisallowances. If AEP cannot recover the costs of environmental compliance, it would reduce future net income and cash flows\nand impact financial condition.\nEnvironmental Controls Impact on the Generating Fleet\nThe rules and proposed environmental controls discussed below will have a material impact on AEP’s operations. Management\ncontinues to evaluate the impact of these rules, project scope and technology available to achieve compliance. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, AEP owned generating capacity of approximately 23,300 MWs, of which approximately 10,700 MWs\nwere coal-fired. Management continues to evaluate the economic feasibility of environmental investments on AEP’s fossil\n53\ngeneration fleet and to refine the cost estimates of complying with these rules and evaluate other impacts of the environmental\nproposals on fossil generation.\nThe cost estimates will change depending on the timing of implementation and whether the Federal EPA provides flexibility in\nfinalizing proposed rules or revising certain existing requirements. The cost estimates will also change based on: (a) potential\nstate rules that impose more stringent standards, (b) additional rulemaking activities in response to court decisions, (c) actual\nperformance of the pollution control technologies installed, (d) changes in costs for new pollution controls, (e) new generating\ntechnology developments, (f) total MWs of capacity retired and replaced, including the type and amount of such replacement\ncapacity, (g) compliance with the Federal EPA’s revised coal combustion residual rules and (h) other factors.\nClean Air Act Requirements\nThe CAA establishes a comprehensive program to protect and improve the nation’s air quality and control sources of air\nemissions. The states implement and administer many of these programs and could impose additional or more stringent\nrequirements. The primary regulatory programs that continue to drive investments in AEP’s existing generating units include:\n(a) periodic revisions to NAAQS and the development of SIPs to achieve more stringent standards, (b) implementation of the\nregional haze program by the states and the Federal EPA, (c) regulation of hazardous air pollutant emissions under MATS, (d)\nimplementation and review of CSAPR and (e) the Federal EPA’s regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil generation\nunder Section 111 of the CAA. Notable developments in significant CAA regulatory requirements affecting AEP’s operations\nare discussed in the following sections.\nNational Ambient Air Quality Standards\nThe Federal EPA periodically reviews and revises the NAAQS for criteria pollutants under the CAA. Revisions tend to\nincrease the stringency of the standards, which in turn may require AEP to make investments in pollution control equipment at\nexisting generating units, or, since most units are already well controlled, to make changes in how units are dispatched and\noperated. In February 2024, the Federal EPA finalized a new more stringent annual primary PM2.5 standard.\nAreas with air quality that does not meet the new standard will be designated by the Federal EPA as “nonattainment,” which\nwill trigger an obligation for states to revise their SIPs to obtain further emission reductions to ensure that the new standard will\nbe met. Areas around some of AEP’s generating facilities may be deemed nonattainment, which may subject those facilities to\nadditional pollution controls or operational constraints. The nonattainment designations by the Federal EPA and the subsequent\nSIP revisions by the affected states will take some time to complete, therefore, it is too soon to predict how SIP requirements\nmay impact AEP’s operations. Management will continue to monitor the issue.\nRegional Haze\nThe Federal EPA issued a Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) in 2005, which could require power plants and other facilities to\ninstall best available retrofit technology to address regional haze in federal parks and other protected areas. CAVR is\nimplemented by the states, through SIPs, or by the Federal EPA, through FIPs. In 2017, the Federal EPA revised the rules\ngoverning submission of SIPs to implement the visibility programs. Petitions for review of the final rule revisions have been\nfiled in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\nIn Texas, the Federal EPA disapproved portions of the Texas regional haze SIP and finalized a FIP that allows participation in\nthe CSAPR ozone season program to satisfy the NO regional haze obligations for electric generating units in Texas.\nX\nAdditionally, the Federal EPA finalized an intrastate SO emissions trading program based on CSAPR allowance allocations.\n2\nLegal challenges to these various rulemakings are pending in both the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and the U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Management cannot predict the outcome of that litigation, although\nmanagement supports the intrastate trading program as a compliance alternative to source-specific controls and has intervened\nin the litigation in support of the Federal EPA.\nCross-State Air Pollution Rule\nCSAPR is a regional trading program that the Federal EPA began implementing in 2015, which was designed to address\ninterstate transport of emissions that contribute significantly to non-attainment and interfere with maintenance of the 1997\nozone NAAQS and the 1997 and 2006 PM NAAQS in downwind states. CSAPR relies on SO and NO allowances and\n2 X\nindividual state budgets to compel further emission reductions from electric utility generating units. Interstate trading of\nallowances is allowed on a restricted basis. The Federal EPA has revised, or updated, the CSAPR trading programs several\ntimes since they were established.\nIn January 2021, the Federal EPA finalized a revised CSAPR, which substantially reduced the ozone season NO budgets for\nX\nseveral states, including states where AEP operates, beginning in ozone season 2021. Management believes it can meet the\n54\nrequirements of the rule in the near term, and is evaluating its compliance options for later years, when the budgets are further\nreduced.\nIn addition, in February 2023, the Federal EPA Administrator finalized the disapproval of interstate transport SIPs submitted by\n19 states addressing the 2015 Ozone NAAQS. Disapproval of the SIPs provides the Federal EPA with authority to impose a\nFIP for those states, replacing the SIPs that were disapproved. In August 2023, a FIP went into effect that further revises the\nozone season NO budgets under the existing CSAPR program in states to which the FIP applies. The disapproval of SIPs and\nX\nimplementation of FIPs continues to be subject to extensive litigation. Management will continue to monitor the outcome of\nthis litigation and any potential impact to operations.\nClimate Change, CO Regulation and Energy Policy\n2\nIn May 2023, the Federal EPA proposed greenhouse gas standards and guidelines for new and existing fossil-fuel fired sources.\nThe proposal relies heavily on carbon capture and sequestration and natural gas co-firing as means to reduce CO emissions\n2\nfrom coal fired plants and hydrogen co-firing and carbon capture and sequestration to reduce CO emissions from gas turbines.\n2\nManagement is evaluating the proposed rule.\nWhile no federal regulatory requirements to reduce CO emissions are in place, AEP has taken action to reduce and offset CO\n2 2\nemissions from its generating fleet. AEP expects CO emissions from its operations to continue to decline due to the retirement\n2\nof some of its coal-fired generation units, and actions taken to diversify the generation fleet and increase energy efficiency\nwhere there is regulatory support for such activities. The majority of the states where AEP has generating facilities passed\nlegislation establishing renewable energy, alternative energy and/or energy efficiency requirements that can assist in reducing\ncarbon emissions.\nAEP routinely submits IRPs in various regulatory jurisdictions to address future generation and capacity needs. These IRPs\ntake into account economics, customer demand, grid reliability and resilience, regulations and RTO capacity requirements. The\nobjective of the IRPs is to recommend future generation and capacity resources that provide the most cost-efficient and reliable\npower to customers. Based on the output of the company’s IRPs, in October 2022, AEP announced new intermediate and long-\nterm CO emission reduction goals. AEP adjusted its near-term CO emission reduction target from a 2000 baseline to a 2005\n2 2\nbaseline, upgraded its 80% reduction by 2030 target to include full Scope 1 emissions and accelerated its net-zero goal by five\nyears to 2045 for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. AEP’s total Scope 1 GHG estimated emissions in 2023 were approximately\n42.8 million metric tons, a 68% reduction according to the GHG Protocol, which excludes emission reductions that result from\nassets that have been sold, or a 72% reduction from AEP’s 2005 Scope 1 GHG emissions (inclusive of emission reductions that\nresult from plants that have been sold).\nAEP has made significant progress in reducing CO emissions from its power generation fleet and expects its emissions to\n2\ncontinue to decline over the long-term. AEP also expects Scope 1 GHG emissions to vary annually depending on the mix of its\nown generation and purchased power used to serve customers. AEP’s ability to achieve these goals is dependent upon a\nnumber of factors including the ability to execute on renewable resource plans, evolving RTO requirements, constructive\nregulatory support, the advancement of carbon-free generation technologies, customer demand for carbon-free energy, potential\ntariffs, carbon policy and regulation, operational performance of renewable generation and supply chain costs and constraints,\nall while continuing to provide the most cost-efficient and reliable power to customers.\nExcessive costs to comply with future legislation or regulations have led to the announcement of early plant closures and could\nforce AEP to close additional coal-fired generation facilities earlier than their estimated useful life. If AEP is unable to recover\nthe costs of its investments, it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nMATS Rule\nIn April 2023, the Federal EPA issued a proposed rule that would revise the MATS for power plants. The proposed rule\nincludes a more stringent standard for emissions of filterable PM for coal-fired electric generating units, as well as a new\nmercury standard for lignite-fired electric generating units. The proposed rule also requires the installation and operation of\ncontinuous emissions monitors for PM. Management is evaluating the impacts of the rule as proposed and will continue to\nmonitor the rulemaking.\nCCR Rule\nThe Federal EPA’s CCR rule regulates the disposal and beneficial re-use of CCR, including fly ash and bottom ash created\nfrom coal-fired generating units and FGD gypsum generated at some coal-fired plants. The rule applies to active and inactive\nCCR landfills and surface impoundments at facilities of active electric utility or independent power producers.\n55\nIn 2020, the Federal EPA revised the CCR rule to include a requirement that unlined CCR storage ponds cease operations and\ninitiate closure by April 11, 2021. The revised rule provides two options that allow facilities to extend the date by which they\nmust cease receipt of coal ash and close the ponds.\nThe first option provides an extension to cease receipt of CCR no later than October 15, 2023 for most units, and October 15,\n2024 for a narrow subset of units; however, the Federal EPA’s grant of such an extension requires a satisfactory demonstration\nof the need for additional time to develop alternative ash disposal capacity and will be limited to the soonest timeframe\ntechnically feasible to cease receipt of CCR. Additionally, each request must undergo formal review, including public\ncomments, and be approved by the Federal EPA. AEP filed applications for additional time to develop alternative disposal\ncapacity at the various plants.\nIn January 2022, the Federal EPA proposed to deny several extension requests filed by the other utilities based on allegations\nthat those utilities are not in compliance with the CCR Rule (the January Actions). In November 2022, the Federal EPA\nfinalized one of these denials (the Gavin Denial, discussed above). The Federal EPA’s allegations of noncompliance rely on\nnew interpretations of the CCR Rule requirements. The January Actions of the Federal EPA and the Gavin Denial have been\nchallenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit as unlawful rulemaking that revises the existing\nCCR Rule requirements without proper notice and without opportunity for comment. Management is unable to predict the\noutcome of that litigation or how it may impact the Federal EPA’s interpretation of the CCR Rule.\nIn July 2022, the Federal EPA proposed conditional approval of the pending extension request for APCo’s Mountaineer Plant.\nThe Federal EPA alleged that the Mountaineer Plant was not fully compliant with the CCR Rule. In December 2022, AEP\nwithdrew the pending extension request for the Mountaineer Plant as work to construct new CCR disposal facilities was\ncompleted and the extension was no longer needed. In addition, AEP ceased receiving ash in the other ponds subject to the\nextension requests, completed construction of new, CCR Rule compliant facilities and withdrew all of the remaining\napplications for additional time to develop alternative disposal capacity.\nUnder the second option for obtaining an extension of the April 11, 2021 deadline to cease operation of unlined impoundments,\na generating facility may continue operating its existing impoundments without developing alternative CCR disposal, provided\nthe facility commits to cease combustion of coal by a date certain. Under this option, a generating facility had until October 17,\n2023 to cease coal-fired operations and to close CCR storage ponds 40 acres or less in size, or through October 17, 2028 for\nfacilities with CCR storage ponds greater than 40 acres in size. Pursuant to this option, AEP informed the Federal EPA of its\nintent to retire the Pirkey Plant and cease using coal at the Welsh Plant. In March 2023, the Pirkey Plant was retired. To date,\nthe Federal EPA has not taken any action on the pending extension request for the Welsh Plant.\nClosure and post-closure estimated costs have been included in ARO in accordance with the requirements in the Federal EPA’s\nfinal CCR rule. Additional ARO revisions will occur on a site-by-site basis if groundwater monitoring activities conclude that\ncorrective actions are required to mitigate groundwater impacts. AEP may incur significant additional costs complying with the\nFederal EPA’s CCR Rule, including costs to upgrade or close and replace surface impoundments and landfills used to manage\nCCR and to conduct any required remedial actions including removal of coal ash. If additional costs are incurred and AEP is\nunable to obtain cost recovery, it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. Management\nwill continue to participate in rulemaking activities and make adjustments based on new federal and state requirements affecting\nits ash disposal units.\nIn May 2023, the Federal EPA proposed revisions to the CCR Rule to expand the scope of the rule to include inactive\nimpoundments at inactive facilities (“legacy CCR surface impoundments”) as well as to establish requirements for currently\nexempt solid waste management units that involve the direct placement of CCR on the land (“CCR management units”). The\nFederal EPA is proposing that owners and operators of legacy surface impoundments comply with all of the existing CCR Rule\nrequirements applicable to inactive CCR surface impoundments at active facilities, except for the location restrictions and liner\ndesign criteria. The proposal establishes accelerated compliance deadlines for legacy surface impoundments to meet regulatory\nrequirements, including a requirement to initiate closure within one year after the effective date of the final rule. The Federal\nEPA's proposal would require evaluations to be completed at both active facilities and inactive facilities with one or more\nlegacy surface impoundments. If finalized, AEP may incur material, additional costs complying with the Federal EPA’s\nproposal, including costs to upgrade or close and replace legacy CCR surface impoundments and to conduct any required\nremedial actions including removal of coal ash. In addition, AEP would need to seek cost recovery through regulated rates,\nincluding proposing new regulatory mechanisms for cost recovery, for which regulatory approval cannot be assured. The\nproposed rule, if finalized, could have a material adverse impact on net income, cash flows and financial condition if AEP\ncannot ultimately recover any additional costs of compliance.\n56\nClean Water Act Regulations\nThe Federal EPA’s ELG rule for generating facilities establishes limits for FGD wastewater, fly ash and bottom ash transport\nwater and flue gas mercury control wastewater, which are to be implemented through each facility’s wastewater discharge\npermit. A revision to the ELG rule, published in October 2020, established additional options for reusing and discharging small\nvolumes of bottom ash transport water, provided an exception for retiring units and extended the compliance deadline to a date\nas soon as possible beginning one year after the rule was published but no later than December 2025. Management has\nassessed technology additions and retrofits to comply with the rule and the impacts of the Federal EPA’s actions on facilities’\nwastewater discharge permitting for FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water. For affected facilities that must install\nadditional technologies to meet the ELG rule limits, permit modifications were filed in January 2021 that reflect the outcome of\nthat assessment. AEP continues to work with state agencies to finalize permit terms and conditions. Other facilities opted to\nfile Notices of Planned Participation (NOPP), pursuant to which the facilities are not required to install additional controls to\nmeet ELG limits provided they make commitments to cease coal combustion by a date certain. In March 2023, the Federal\nEPA proposed further revisions to the ELG rule which, if finalized, would establish a zero discharge standard for FGD\nwastewater and bottom ash transport water, and more stringent discharge limits for combustion residual leachate. Management\nis evaluating the impacts of the proposed rule to operations. Management cannot predict whether the Federal EPA will actually\nfinalize further revisions, but will continue to monitor this issue and will participate in further rulemaking activities as they\narise.\nThe definition of “waters of the United States” has been subject to rule making and litigation which has led to inconsistent\nscope among the states. Management will continue to monitor developments in rule making and litigation for any potential\nimpact to operations.\nImpact of Environmental Regulation on Coal-Fired Generation\nCompliance with extensive environmental regulations requires significant capital investment in environmental monitoring,\ninstallation of pollution control equipment, emission fees, disposal, remediation and permits. Management continuously\nevaluates cost estimates of complying with these regulations which may result in a decision to retire coal-fired generating\nfacilities earlier than their currently estimated useful lives.\nThe table below summarizes the net book value, as of December 31, 2023, of generating facilities retired or planned for early\nretirement in advance of the retirement date currently authorized for ratemaking purposes:\nCurrent\nAccelerated Actual/Projected Authorized\nNet Depreciation Retirement Recovery Annual\nCompany Plant Investment (a) Regulatory Asset Date Period Depreciation (b)\n(in millions) (in millions)\nPSO Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 $ 104.5 $ 164.2 2026 (c) $ 15.0\nSWEPCo Pirkey Plant — 114.4 (d) 2023 (e) —\nSWEPCo Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3 352.0 125.6 2028 (f) (g) 38.6\n(a) Net book value including CWIP excluding cost of removal and materials and supplies.\n(b) These amounts represent the amount of annual depreciation that has been collected from customers over the prior 12-month period.\n(c) Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 is currently being recovered through 2040.\n(d) Represents Arkansas and Texas jurisdictional share.\n(e) As part of the 2021 Arkansas Base Rate Case, the APSC granted SWEPCo regulatory asset treatment. SWEPCo will request recovery including a\nweighted average cost of capital carrying charge through a future proceeding. The Texas share of the Pirkey Plant will be addressed in SWEPCo’s\nnext base rate case. See the “Coal-Fired Generation Plants” section of Note 5 for additional information.\n(f) In November 2020, management announced it will cease using coal at the Welsh Plant in 2028. Management is evaluating a potential conversion to\nnatural gas after 2028 for both units.\n(g) Welsh Plant, Unit 1 is being recovered through 2027 in the Louisiana jurisdiction and through 2037 in the Arkansas and Texas jurisdictions. Welsh\nPlant, Unit 3 is being recovered through 2032 in the Louisiana jurisdiction and through 2042 in the Arkansas and Texas jurisdictions.\nManagement is seeking or will seek regulatory recovery, as necessary, for any net book value remaining when the plants are\nretired. To the extent the net book value of these generation assets is not deemed recoverable, it could materially reduce future\nnet income, cash flows and impact financial condition.\n57\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAEP’s Reportable Segments\nAEP’s primary business is the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity. Within its Vertically Integrated Utilities\nsegment, AEP centrally dispatches generation assets and manages its overall utility operations on an integrated basis because of\nthe substantial impact of cost-based rates and regulatory oversight. Intersegment sales and transfers are generally based on\nunderlying contractual arrangements and agreements. AEP’s reportable segments are as follows:\n• Vertically Integrated Utilities\n• Transmission and Distribution Utilities\n• AEP Transmission Holdco\n• Generation & Marketing\nThe remainder of AEP’s activities are presented as Corporate and Other, which is not considered a reportable segment. See\nNote 9 - Business Segments for additional information on AEP’s segments.\nThe following discussion of AEP’s results of operations by operating segment provides a comparison of Earnings Attributable\nto AEP Common Shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. For\nAEP’s Vertically Integrated Utilities and Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment and subsidiary registrants within\nthese segments, the results include revenues from rate rider mechanisms designed to recover fuel, purchased power and other\nrecoverable expenses such that the revenues and expenses associated with these items generally offset and do not affect\nEarnings Attributable to AEP Common Shareholders. For additional information regarding the financial results for the years\nended December 31, 2023 and 2022 see the discussions of Results of Operations by Subsidiary Registrant.\nA detailed discussion of AEP’s 2022 results of operations by operating segment can be found in Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation section included in the 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with\nthe SEC on February 23, 2023.\nThe following tables present Earnings (Loss) Attributable to AEP Common Shareholders by segment:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022

its balance sheet and the liquidity provided by its cash flows.\nSIGNIFICANT CASH REQUIREMENTS\nAEP’s contractual cash obligations include amounts reported on the balance sheets and other obligations disclosed in the\nfootnotes. It is anticipated that these obligations will be satisfied through a combination of cash flows from operations, long-\nterm debt issuances, short-term debt through AEP’s Commercial Paper Program or bank term loans, proceeds from the sale of\ncompetitive contracted renewables and the use of the ATM Program or other equity issuances.\nCapital Expenditures\nContinued capital investments reflect AEP’s commitment to enhance service and deliver reliable, clean energy and advanced\ntechnologies that exceed customer expectations. See “Budgeted Capital Expenditures” herein, for additional information.\nLong-term Debt\nLong-term debt maturities, including interest, represent a significant cash requirement for AEP and the Registrant Subsidiaries.\nSee Note 14 - Financing Activities for additional information relating to the Registrant Subsidiaries’ long-term debt outstanding\nas of December 31, 2023, the weighted-average interest rate applicable to each debt category and a schedule of debt maturities\nover the next five years.\n70\nOther Significant Cash Requirements\nOperating and finance leases represent a significant component of funding requirements for AEP and the Registrant\nSubsidiaries. See Note 13 - Leases for additional information.\nAEP subsidiaries have substantial commitments for fuel, energy and capacity contracts as part of the normal course of business.\nSee Note 6 - Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies for additional information.\nAs of December 31, 2023, AEP expected to make contributions to the pension plans totaling $7 million in 2024. Estimated\ncontributions of $110 million in 2025 and $6 million in 2026 may vary significantly based on market returns, changes in\nactuarial assumptions and other factors. Based upon the projected benefit obligation and fair value of assets available to pay\npension benefits, the pension plans were 99% funded as of December 31, 2023. See “Estimated Future Benefit Payments and\nContributions” section of Note 8 for additional information.\nStandby letters of credit are entered into with third-parties. These letters of credit are issued in the ordinary course of business\nand cover items such as natural gas and electricity risk management contracts, construction contracts, insurance programs,\nsecurity deposits and debt security reserves. There is no collateral held in relation to any guarantees in excess of the ownership\npercentages. In the event any letters of credit are drawn, there is no recourse to third-parties. See “Letters of Credit” section of\nNote 6 for additional information.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nDebt and Equity Capitalization\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\n(dollars in millions)\nLong-term Debt, including amounts due within one year $ 40,143.2 58.8 % $ 36,801.0 56.6 %\nShort-term Debt 2,830.2 4.2 4,112.2 6.3\nTotal Debt 42,973.4 63.0 40,913.2 62.9\nAEP Common Equity 25,246.7 37.0 23,893.4 36.7\nNoncontrolling Interests 39.2 — 229.0 0.4\nTotal Debt and Equity Capitalization $ 68,259.3 100.0 % $ 65,035.6 100.0 %\nAEP’s ratio of debt-to-total capital increased slightly from 62.9% to 63.0% as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively, primarily due to an increase in Long-term Debt to support distribution, transmission and renewable investment\ngrowth in addition to working capital needs. This was partially offset by the issuance of common equity in connection with the\nsettlement of the forward equity purchase contracts related to the 2020 Equity Units and the utilization of cash proceeds\nreceived from the sale of the competitive contracted renewables portfolio to reduce Short-term Debt.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity, or access to cash, is an important factor in determining AEP’s financial stability. Management believes AEP has\nadequate liquidity under its existing credit facilities. As of December 31, 2023, AEP had $5 billion in revolving credit facilities\nto support its commercial paper program. Additional liquidity is available from cash from operations and a receivables\nsecuritization agreement. Management is committed to maintaining adequate liquidity. AEP generally uses short-term\nborrowings to fund working capital needs, property acquisitions and construction until long-term funding is arranged. Sources\nof long-term funding include issuance of long-term debt, leasing agreements, hybrid securities or common stock. AEP and its\nutilities finance its operations with commercial paper and other variable rate instruments that are subject to fluctuations in\ninterest rates. To the extent that there is an increase in interest rates, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and\nimpact financial condition.\nMarket volatility and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect AEP’s ability to raise capital on reasonable terms to\nfund capital needs, including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness. AEP is also monitoring the current\nbank environment and any impacts thereof. AEP was not materially impacted by these conditions during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\nIn August 2023, AEP completed the sale of the entire Competitive Contracted Renewables Portfolio to a nonaffiliated party and\nreceived cash proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion, net of taxes and transaction costs. The proceeds were used to pay down\ndebt balances and support AEP’s overall capital expenditure plans. See the “Dispositions” section of Note 7 for additional\ninformation.\n71\nAEP continues to address the cash flow implications of increased fuel and purchased power costs, see “Deferred Fuel Costs”\nsection of Executive Overview for additional information. In January 2024, AEP made a capital contribution to APCo and\nWPCo, totaling $100 million and $75 million, respectively. These contributions were made to help address the impact of the\nJanuary 2024 WVPSC order that resulted in the December write-off of $222 million ($127 million attributable to APCo and\n$95 million attributable to WPCo) of under-recovered ENEC regulatory assets. See “ENEC (Expanded Net Energy Cost)\nFilings” of Note 4 for additional information.\nNet Available Liquidity\nAEP manages liquidity by maintaining adequate external financing commitments. As of December 31, 2023, available\nliquidity was approximately $3.4 billion as illustrated in the table below:\nAmount Maturity\n(in millions)\nCommercial Paper Backup:\nRevolving Credit Facility $ 4,000.0 March 2027\nRevolving Credit Facility 1,000.0 March 2025\nCash and Cash Equivalents 330.1\nTotal Liquidity Sources 5,330.1\nLess: AEP Commercial Paper Outstanding 1,937.9\nNet Available Liquidity $ 3,392.2\nAEP uses its commercial paper program to meet the short-term borrowing needs of its subsidiaries. The program funds a\nUtility Money Pool, which funds AEP’s utility subsidiaries; a Nonutility Money Pool, which funds certain AEP nonutility\nsubsidiaries; and the short-term debt requirements of subsidiaries that are not participating in either money pool for regulatory\nor operational reasons, as direct borrowers. The maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during 2023 was\n$3.2 billion. The weighted-average interest rate for AEP’s commercial paper during 2023 was 5.38%.\nOther Credit Facilities\nAn uncommitted facility gives the issuer of the facility the right to accept or decline each request made under the facility. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, AEP issued letters of credit on behalf of subsidiaries under six uncommitted facilities with a total capacity\nof $450 million. The Registrants’ maximum future payments for letters of credit issued under the uncommitted facilities, as of\nDecember 31, 2023, was $257 million with maturities ranging from January 2024 to November 2024.\nFinancing Plan\nAs of December 31, 2023, AEP had $2.5 billion of long-term debt due within one year. This included $510 million of Pollution\nControl Bonds with mandatory tender dates and credit support for variable interest rates that requires the debt be classified as\ncurrent and $205 million of securitization bonds and DCC Fuel notes. Management plans to refinance the majority of the\nmaturities due within one year on a long-term basis.\nSecuritized Accounts Receivables\nAEP Credit’s receivables securitization agreement provides a commitment of $900 million from bank conduits to purchase\nreceivables. The agreement was amended in August 2023 to increase the commitment from $750 million and expires in\nSeptember 2025. As of December 31, 2023, the affiliated utility subsidiaries were in compliance with all requirements under\nthe agreement.\nDebt Covenants and Borrowing Limitations\nAEP’s credit agreements contain certain covenants and require it to maintain a percentage of debt-to-total capitalization at a\nlevel that does not exceed 67.5%. The method for calculating outstanding debt and capitalization is contractually-defined in\nAEP’s credit agreements. Debt as defined in the revolving credit agreement excludes securitization bonds and debt of AEP\nCredit. As of December 31, 2023, this contractually-defined percentage was 59.9%. Non-performance under these covenants\ncould result in an event of default under these credit agreements. In addition, the acceleration of AEP’s payment obligations, or\nthe obligations of certain of AEP’s major subsidiaries, prior to maturity under any other agreement or instrument relating to\ndebt outstanding in excess of $50 million, would cause an event of default under these credit agreements. This condition also\napplies in a majority of AEP’s non-exchange-traded commodity contracts and would similarly allow lenders and counterparties\nto declare the outstanding amounts payable. However, a default under AEP’s non-exchange-traded commodity contracts would\nnot cause an event of default under its credit agreements.\n72\nThe revolving credit facilities do not permit the lenders to refuse a draw on any facility if a material adverse change occurs.\nUtility Money Pool borrowings and external borrowings may not exceed amounts authorized by regulatory orders and AEP\nmanages its borrowings to stay within those authorized limits.\nATM Program\nAEP participates in an ATM offering program that allows AEP to issue, from time to time, up to an aggregate of $1.7 billion of\nits common stock, including shares of common stock that may be sold pursuant to an equity forward sales agreement. There\nwere no issuances under the ATM program for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, approximately\n$1.7 billion of equity is available for issuance under the ATM offering program. See Note 14 - Financing Activities for\nadditional information.\nEquity Units\nIn August 2020, AEP issued 17 million Equity Units initially in the form of corporate units, at a stated amount of $50 per unit,\nfor a total stated amount of $850 million. Net proceeds from the issuance were approximately $833 million. Each corporate\nunit represents a 1/20 undivided beneficial ownership interest in $1,000 principal amount of AEP’s 1.30% Junior Subordinated\nNotes due in 2025 and a forward equity purchase contract which settled after three years in August 2023. The proceeds were\nused to support AEP’s overall capital expenditure plans.\nIn June 2023, AEP successfully remarketed the Junior Subordinated Notes on behalf of holders of the corporate units. AEP did\nnot receive any proceeds from the remarketing which were used to purchase a portfolio of treasury securities that matured on\nAugust 14, 2023. On August 15, 2023, the proceeds from the treasury portfolio were used to settle the forward equity purchase\ncontract with AEP. The interest rate on the Junior Subordinated Notes was reset to 5.699% with the maturity remaining in\n2025. In August 2023, AEP issued 10,048,668 shares of AEP common stock and received proceeds totaling $850 million under\nthe settlement of the forward equity purchase contracts. AEP common stock held in treasury was used to settle the forward\nequity purchase contracts. The proceeds were used to pay down debt balances and support AEP’s overall capital expenditure\nplans. See Note 14 - Financing Activities for additional information.\nDividend Policy and Restrictions\nThe Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.88 per share in January 2024. Future dividends may vary depending\nupon AEP’s profit levels, operating cash flow levels and capital requirements, as well as financial and other business conditions\nexisting at the time. Parent’s income primarily derives from common stock equity in the earnings of its utility subsidiaries.\nVarious financing arrangements and regulatory requirements may impose certain restrictions on the ability of the subsidiaries to\ntransfer funds to Parent in the form of dividends. Management does not believe these restrictions will have any significant\nimpact on its ability to access cash to meet the payment of dividends on its common stock. See “Dividend Restrictions” section\nof Note 14 for additional information.\nCredit Ratings\nAEP and its utility subsidiaries do not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules\nor terminations as a result of a credit downgrade, but its access to the commercial paper market may depend on its credit\nratings. In addition, downgrades in AEP’s credit ratings by one of the rating agencies could increase its borrowing\ncosts. Counterparty concerns about the credit quality of AEP or its utility subsidiaries could subject AEP to additional\ncollateral demands under adequate assurance clauses under its derivative and non-derivative energy contracts.\n73\nCASH FLOW\nAEP relies primarily on cash flows from operations, debt issuances and its existing cash and cash equivalents to fund its\nliquidity and investing activities. AEP’s investing and capital requirements are primarily capital expenditures, repaying of\nlong-term debt and paying dividends to shareholders. AEP uses short-term debt, including commercial paper, as a bridge to\nlong-term debt financing. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly due to the timing of long-term debt financings and\nthe impact of fluctuations in cash flows.\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in millions)\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash at Beginning of Period $ 556.5 $ 451.4 $ 438.3\nNet Cash Flows from Operating Activities 5,012.2 5,288.0 3,839.9\nNet Cash Flows Used for Investing Activities (6,266.7) (7,751.8) (6,433.9)\nNet Cash Flows from Financing Activities 1,077.0 2,568.9 2,607.1\nNet Increase (Decrease) in Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash (177.5) 105.1 13.1\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash at End of Period $ 379.0 $ 556.5 $ 451.4\nOperating Activities\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in millions)\nNet Income $ 2,212.6 $ 2,305.6 $ 2,488.1\nNon-Cash Adjustments to Net Income (a) 3,394.5 3,461.6 3,025.9\nMark-to-Market of Risk Management Contracts 8.8 15.5 112.3\nProperty Taxes (41.1) (41.2) (68.0)\nDeferred Fuel Over/Under Recovery, Net 892.8 (319.2) (1,647.9)\nChange in Other Noncurrent Assets (b) (780.9) (234.4) (365.5)\nChange in Other Noncurrent Liabilities 29.0 337.8 206.4\nChange in Certain Components of Working Capital (703.5) (237.7) 88.6\nNet Cash Flows from Operating Activities $ 5,012.2 $ 5,288.0 $ 3,839.9\n(a) Includes Depreciation and Amortization, Rockport Plant, Unit 2 Lease Amortization, Deferred Income Taxes, Loss on the Expected\nSale of the Kentucky Operations, Loss on the Sale of the Competitive Contracted Renewables Portfolio, Asset Impairments and Other\nRelated Charges, Impairment of Equity Method Investment, Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction, Amortization of\nNuclear Fuel, Gain on Sale of Mineral Rights and Establishment of 2017-2019 Virginia Triennial Review Regulatory Asset.\n(b) Includes Change in Regulatory Assets.\n2023 Compared to 2022\nNet Cash Flows from Operating Activities decreased by $276 million primarily due to the following:\n• A $547 million decrease in cash from Change in Other Noncurrent Assets primarily due to incremental other operation\nand maintenance storm restoration expenses incurred in several jurisdictions in addition to timing differences in\ncollections from customers under rate rider mechanisms. See Note 4 - Rate Matters and Note 5 - Effects of Regulation\nfor additional information.\n• A $466 million decrease in cash from the Change in Certain Components of Working Capital. The decrease is\nprimarily due to fuel, material and supplies driven by current year increases in coal inventory, the return of margin\ndeposits from PJM in 2022 and the timing of accounts payable. These decreases were partially offset by the timing of\naccounts receivable.\n• A $309 million decrease in cash from Changes in Other Noncurrent Liabilities. The decrease is primarily due to\nchanges in provisions for refunds and regulatory liabilities driven by timing differences in refunds to customers under\nrate rider mechanisms in addition to an increase in ARO settlements in 2023.

See Note 14 - Financing Activities for additional\ninformation.\n• A $115 million decrease due to an increase in dividends paid on common stock.\nThese decreases in cash were partially offset by:\n• An $813 million increase in issuances of long-term debt. See Note 14 - Financing Activities for additional\ninformation.\n• A $241 million increase due to a decrease in Principal Payments for Finance Lease Obligations primarily driven by\nRockport Plant, Unit 2 final lease payments in 2022.\n• A $173 million increase in issuances of common stock primarily due to the settlement of the 2020 equity units. See\n“Equity Units” section of Note 14 for additional information.\n• A $149 million increase due to decreased retirements of long-term debt. See Note 14 - Financing Activities for\nadditional information.\nThe following financing activities occurred during 2023:\nAEP Common Stock:\n• During 2023, AEP issued 2.3 million shares of common stock under the incentive compensation, employee saving and\ndividend reinvestment plans. Additionally in 2023, AEP reissued 10 million shares of treasury stock to fulfill share\ncommitments related to AEP’s Equity Units. See “Common Stock” and “Equity Units” section of Note 14 for\nadditional information. AEP received net proceeds of $1 billion related to these issuances.\n75\nDebt:\n• During 2023, AEP issued approximately $5.5 billion of long-term debt, including $5.1 billion of senior unsecured\nnotes at interest rates ranging from 5% to 7%, $296 million of other debt at various interest rates and $125 million of\npollution control bonds at interest rates ranging from 4.25% to 4.7%. The proceeds from these issuances were\nprimarily used to fund long-term debt maturities, construction programs and to help address working capital needs.\n• During 2023, AEP entered into interest rate derivatives with notional amounts totaling $1.9 billion that were\ndesignated as cash flow hedges. During 2023, settlements of AEP’s interest rate derivatives resulted in net cash paid\nof $44 million for derivatives designated as fair value hedges and net cash received of $20 million designated as cash\nflow hedges. As of December 31, 2023, AEP had a total notional amount of $950 million of outstanding interest rate\nderivatives designated as fair value hedges and $350 million designated as cash flow hedges.\nSee “Long-term Debt Subsequent Events” section of Note 14 for Long-term debt and other securities issued, retired and\nprincipal payments made after December 31, 2023 through February 26, 2024, the date that the 10-K was issued.\nBUDGETED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES\nManagement forecasts approximately $7.5 billion of capital expenditures in 2024. For the four year period, 2025 through 2028,\nmanagement forecasts capital expenditures of $35 billion. The expenditures are generally for transmission, generation,\ndistribution, regulated renewables and required environmental investment to comply with the Federal EPA rules. Estimated\ncapital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory\nconstraints, environmental regulations, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, supply chain issues, weather,\nlegal reviews, inflation and the ability to access capital. Management expects to fund these capital expenditures through cash\nflows from operations, proceeds from the strategic sale of assets and financing activities. Generally, the Registrant Subsidiaries\nuse cash or short-term borrowings under the money pool to fund these expenditures until long-term funding is arranged. The\nestimated capital expenditures by Business Segment are as follows:\n2024 Budgeted Capital Expenditures 2025-2028\nSegment Environmental Generation Renewables Transmission Distribution Other (a) Total Total\n(in millions)\nVertically\nIntegrated\nUtilities $ 49 $ 367 $ 531 $ 990 $ 1,311 $ 332 $ 3,580 $ 20,407\nTransmission and\nDistribution\nUtilities — — — 1,272 1,087 208 2,567 9,201\nAEP\nTransmission\nHoldco — — — 1,313 — 25 1,338 4,902\nGeneration &\nMarketing (b) — — — — — — — —\nCorporate and\nOther — — — — — 59 59 501\nTotal $ 49 $ 367 $ 531 $ 3,575 $ 2,398 $ 624 $ 7,544 $ 35,011\n(a) Amount primarily consists of facilities, software and telecommunications.\n(b) No capital expenditures expected based on the anticipated sale of AEP Energy and AEP Onsite Partners in 2024.\nThe 2024 estimated capital expenditures by Registrant Subsidiary are as follows:\n2024 Budgeted Capital Expenditures\nCompany Environmental Generation Renewables Transmission Distribution Other (a) Total\n(in millions)\nAEP Texas $ — $ — $ — $ 897 $ 549 $ 87 $ 1,533\nAEPTCo — — — 1,313 — 25 1,338\nAPCo 22 104 8 324 375 130 963\nI&M — 91 15 76 327 70 579\nOPCo — — — 375 538 121 1,034\nPSO — 61 36 133 289 50 569\nSWEPCo 3 77 473 349 214 60 1,176\n(a) Amount primarily consists of facilities, software and telecommunications.\n76\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES AND ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect reported amounts and related disclosures, including amounts related to legal matters and contingencies. Management\nconsiders an accounting estimate to be critical if:\n• It requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and\n• Changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material effect on net income\nor financial condition.\nManagement discusses the development and selection of critical accounting estimates as presented below with the Audit\nCommittee of AEP’s Board of Directors and the Audit Committee reviews the disclosures relating to them.\nManagement believes that the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in the financial\nstatements are appropriate. However, actual results can differ significantly from those estimates.\nThe sections that follow present information about critical accounting estimates, as well as the effects of hypothetical changes\nin the material assumptions used to develop each estimate.\nRegulatory Accounting\nNature of Estimates Required\nThe Registrants’ financial statements reflect the actions of regulators that can result in the recognition of revenues and expenses\nin different time periods than enterprises that are not rate-regulated.\nThe Registrants recognize regulatory assets (deferred expenses to be recovered in the future) and regulatory liabilities (deferred\nfuture revenue reductions or refunds) for the economic effects of regulation. Specifically, the timing of expense and income\nrecognition is matched with regulated revenues. Liabilities are also recorded for refunds, or probable refunds, to customers that\nhave not been made.\nAssumptions and Approach Used\nWhen incurred costs are probable of recovery through regulated rates, regulatory assets are recorded on the balance\nsheets. Management reviews the probability of recovery at each balance sheet date and whenever new events occur. Similarly,\nregulatory liabilities are recorded when a determination is made that a refund is probable or when ordered by a\ncommission. Examples of new events that affect probability include changes in the regulatory environment, issuance of a\nregulatory commission order or passage of new legislation. The assumptions and judgments used by regulatory authorities\ncontinue to have an impact on the recovery of costs as well as the return of revenues, rate of return earned on invested capital\nand timing and amount of assets to be recovered through regulated rates. If recovery of a regulatory asset is no longer probable,\nthat regulatory asset is written-off as a charge against earnings. A write-off of regulatory assets or establishment of a regulatory\nliability may also reduce future cash flows since there will be no recovery through regulated rates.\nEffect if Different Assumptions Used\nA change in the above assumptions may result in a material impact on net income. See Note 5 - Effects of Regulation for\nadditional information related to regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities.\nRevenue Recognition – Unbilled Revenues\nNature of Estimates Required\nAEP recognizes revenues from customers as the performance obligations of delivering energy to customers are satisfied. The\ndetermination of sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis\nthroughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter\nreading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue accrual is recorded. This estimate is reversed in the following\nmonth and actual revenue is recorded based on meter readings. PSO and SWEPCo do not include the fuel portion in unbilled\nrevenue in accordance with the applicable state commission regulatory treatment in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas.\n77\nAccrued unbilled revenues for the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment were $288 million and $354 million as of December\n31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The changes in unbilled electric utility revenues for AEP’s Vertically Integrated Utilities\nsegment were $(66) million, $108 million and $(42) million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. The changes in unbilled electric revenues are primarily due to changes in weather and rates.\nAccrued unbilled revenues for the Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment were $191 million and $221 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The changes in unbilled electric utility revenues for AEP’s Transmission and\nDistribution Utilities segment were $(30) million, $49 million and $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and\n2021, respectively. The changes in unbilled electric revenues are primarily due to changes in weather and rates.\nAccrued unbilled revenues for the Generation & Marketing segment were $111 million and $109 million as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively. The changes in unbilled electric utility revenues for AEP’s Generation & Marketing segment\nwere $2 million, $(1) million and $24 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAssumptions and Approach Used\nFor each Registrant except AEPTCo, the monthly estimate for unbilled revenues is based upon a primary computation of net\ngeneration (generation plus purchases less sales) less the current month’s billed KWhs and estimated line losses, plus the prior\nmonth’s unbilled KWhs. However, due to the potential for meter reading issues, meter drift and other anomalies, a secondary\ncomputation is made, based upon an allocation of billed KWhs to the current month and previous month, on a billing cycle-by-\ncycle basis, and by dividing the current month aggregated result by the billed KWhs. The two methodologies are evaluated to\nconfirm that they are not statistically different.\nFor AEP’s Generation & Marketing segment, management calculates unbilled revenues based on a primary computation of load\nas provided by PJM less the current month’s billed KWhs and estimated line losses, plus the prior month’s unbilled KWhs.\nHowever, due to the potential for meter reading issues, meter drift and other anomalies, a secondary computation is made, based\nupon using the most recent historic daily activity on a per contract basis. The two methodologies are evaluated to confirm that\nthey are not statistically different.\nEffect if Different Assumptions Used\nIf the two methodologies used to estimate unbilled revenue are statistically different, a limiter adjustment is made to bring the\nprimary computation within one standard deviation of the secondary computation. Additionally, significant fluctuations in\nenergy demand for the unbilled period, weather, line losses or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the\nestimate of unbilled revenue.\nAccounting for Derivative Instruments\nNature of Estimates Required\nManagement considers fair value techniques, valuation adjustments related to credit and liquidity and judgments related to the\nprobability of forecasted transactions occurring within the specified time period to be critical accounting estimates. These\nestimates are considered significant because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period and are dependent on\nmany subjective factors.\nAssumptions and Approach Used\nThe Registrants measure the fair values of derivative instruments and hedge instruments accounted for using MTM accounting\nbased primarily on exchange prices and broker quotes. If a quoted market price is not available, the fair value is estimated\nbased on the best market information available including valuation models that estimate future energy prices based on existing\nmarket and broker quotes and other assumptions. Fair value estimates, based upon the best market information available,\ninvolve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment. These uncertainties include forward market price assumptions.\nThe Registrants reduce fair values by estimated valuation adjustments for items such as discounting, liquidity and credit\nquality. Liquidity adjustments are calculated by utilizing bid/ask spreads to estimate the potential fair value impact of\nliquidating open positions over a reasonable period of time. Credit adjustments on risk management contracts are calculated\nusing estimated default probabilities and recovery rates relative to the counterparties or counterparties with similar credit\nprofiles and contractual netting agreements.\n78\nWith respect to hedge accounting, management assesses hedge effectiveness and evaluates a forecasted transaction’s probability\nof occurrence within the specified time period as provided in the original hedge documentation.\nEffect if Different Assumptions Used\nThere is inherent risk in valuation modeling given the complexity and volatility of energy markets. Therefore, it is possible that\nresults in future periods may be materially different as contracts settle.\nThe probability that hedged forecasted transactions will not occur by the end of the specified time period could change\noperating results by requiring amounts currently classified in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) to be classified\ninto Operating Income.\nFor additional information see Note 10 - Derivatives and Hedging and Note 11 - Fair Value Measurements. See “Fair Value\nMeasurements of Assets and Liabilities” section of Note 1 for AEP’s fair value calculation policy.\nLong-Lived Assets\nNature of Estimates Required\nIn accordance with the requirements of “Property, Plant and Equipment” accounting guidance and “Regulated Operations”\naccounting guidance, the Registrants evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the carrying amount of any such assets may not be recoverable. Such events or changes in circumstance include\nplanned abandonments, probable disallowances for rate-making purposes of assets determined to be recently completed plant\nand assets that meet the held-for-sale criteria. The Registrants utilize a group composite method of depreciation to estimate the\nuseful lives of long-lived assets.\nAn impairment evaluation of a long-lived, held and used asset may result from an abandonment, significant decreases in the\nmarket price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used or in its physical\ncondition, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset, as well\nas other economic or operations analyses. If the book value of the asset is not recoverable through estimated, future\nundiscounted cash flows, the Registrants record an impairment to the extent that the fair value of the asset is less than its book\nvalue. Performing an impairment evaluation involves a significant degree of estimation and judgment in areas such as\nidentifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets and developing the\nnon-discounted and discounted future cash flows (used to estimate fair value in the absence of market-based value, in some\ninstances) associated with the asset. Assets held for sale must be measured at the lower of the book value or fair value less cost\nto sell. An impairment is recognized if an asset’s fair value less costs to sell is less than its book value. Any impairment charge\nis recorded as a reduction to earnings.\nAssumptions and Approach Used\nThe fair value of an asset is the amount at which that asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing\nparties other than in a forced or liquidation sale. Quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and\nare used as the basis for the measurement, if available. In the absence of quoted prices for identical or similar assets in active\nmarkets, the Registrants estimate fair value using various internal and external valuation methods including cash flow\nprojections or other market indicators of fair value such as bids received, comparable sales or independent appraisals. Cash\nflow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made. Estimates of future cash flows\nare, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. Also, when measuring fair value, management\nevaluates the characteristics of the asset or liability to determine if market participants would take those characteristics into\naccount when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Such characteristics include, for example, the condition and\nlocation of the asset or restrictions on the use of the asset. The Registrants perform depreciation studies that include a review of\nany external factors that may affect the useful life to determine composite depreciation rates and related lives which are subject\nto periodic review by state regulatory commissions for regulated assets. The fair value of the asset could be different using\ndifferent estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques.\nEffect if Different Assumptions Used\nIn connection with the evaluation of long-lived assets in accordance with the requirements of “Property, Plant and Equipment”\naccounting guidance, the fair value of the asset can vary if different estimates and assumptions are used in the applied valuation\n79\ntechniques. Estimates for depreciation rates contemplate the history of interim capital replacements and the amount of salvage\nexpected. In cases of impairment, the best estimate of fair value was made using valuation methods based on the most current\ninformation at that time. Differences in realized sales proceeds versus the estimated fair value of the asset are generally due to a\nvariety of factors including, but not limited to, differences in subsequent market conditions, the level of bidder interest, the\ntiming and terms of the transactions and management’s analysis of the benefits of the transaction.\nPension and OPEB\nAEPSC maintains a qualified, defined benefit pension plan (Qualified Plan), which covers substantially all nonunion and\ncertain union employees, and unfunded, non-qualified supplemental plans (Nonqualified Plans) to provide benefits in excess of\namounts permitted under the provisions of the tax law for participants in the Qualified Plan (collectively the Pension\nPlans). AEPSC also sponsors OPEB plans to provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees. The Pension\nPlans and OPEB plans are collectively referred to as the Plans.\nFor a discussion of investment strategy, investment limitations, target asset allocations and the classification of investments\nwithin the fair value hierarchy, see “Investments Held in Trust for Future Liabilities” and “Fair Value Measurements of Assets\nand Liabilities” sections of Note 1. See Note 8 - Benefit Plans for information regarding costs and assumptions for the Plans.\nThe following table shows the net periodic cost (credit) of the Plans:\nYears Ended December 31,\nNet Periodic Cost (Credit) 2023 2022 2021\n(in millions)\nPension Plans $ (24.3) $ 80.9 $ 138.2\nOPEB (107.1) (144.8) (122.0)\nThe net periodic benefit cost is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including expected long-term rates of\nreturn on the Plans’ assets. In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption for 2024, management evaluated\ninput from actuaries and investment consultants, including their reviews of asset class return expectations as well as long-term\ninflation assumptions. Management also considered historical returns of the investment markets and tax rates which affect a\nportion of the OPEB plans’ assets. Management anticipates that the investment managers employed for the Plans will invest\nthe assets to generate future returns averaging 7.25% for the Qualified Plan and 6.75% for the OPEB plans.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on the Plans’ assets is based on management’s targeted asset allocation and expected\ninvestment returns for each investment category. Assumptions for the Plans are summarized in the following table:\nPension Plans OPEB\nAssumed/Expected Assumed/Expected\n2024 Target Long-Term 2024 Target Long-Term\nAsset Allocation Rate of Return Asset Allocation Rate of Return\nEquity 30 % 8.77 % 58 % 7.76 %\nFixed Income 54 % 6.02 % 41 % 5.77 %\nOther Investments 15 % 9.39 % — —\nCash and Cash Equivalents 1 % 3.79 % 1 % 3.79 %\nTotal 100 % 100 %\nManagement regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the investments to the targeted\nallocation. Management believes that 7.25% for the Qualified Plan and 6.75% for the OPEB plans are reasonable estimates of\nthe long-term rate of return on the Plans’ assets. The Pension Plans’ assets had an actual gain of 9.50% and a loss of 16.88%\nfor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The OPEB plans’ assets had an actual gain of 15.48% and a\nloss of 19.53% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Management will continue to evaluate the\nactuarial assumptions, including the expected rate of return, at least annually, and will adjust the assumptions as necessary.\nAEP bases the determination of pension expense or income on a market-related valuation of assets, which reduces year-to-year\nvolatility. This market-related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which\nthey occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the\nmarket-related value of assets and the actual return based on the market-related value of assets. Since the market-related value\nof assets recognizes gains or losses over a five-year period, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred\ngains or losses are recorded. As of December 31, 2023, AEP had cumulative gains of approximately $526 million for the\nQualified Plan that remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market-related value of assets. These unrecognized\n80\nmarket-related net actuarial gains may result in decreases in the future pension costs depending on several factors, including\nwhether such gains at each measurement date exceed the corridor in accordance with “Compensation – Retirement Benefits”\naccounting guidance.\nThe method used to determine the discount rate that AEP utilizes for determining future obligations is a duration-based method\nin which a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds is constructed with cash flows matching the benefit plan\nliability. The composite yield on the hypothetical bond portfolio is used as the discount rate for the plan. The discount rate as\nof December 31, 2023 under this method was 5.15% for the Qualified Plan, 5.2% for the Nonqualified Plans and 5.15% for the\nOPEB plans. Due to the effect of the unrecognized net actuarial losses and based on an expected rate of return, discount rates\nand various other assumptions, management estimates costs (credits) for the Pension Plans will approximate $(6) million, $39\nmillion and $77 million in 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. Based on an expected rate of return discount rate and various\nother assumptions, management estimates OPEB plan credits will approximate $72 million, $60 million and $66 million in\n2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. Future actual costs will depend on future investment performance, changes in future\ndiscount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in the Plans. The actuarial assumptions used\nmay differ materially from actual results. The effects of a 50 basis point change to selective actuarial assumptions are included\nin the “Effect if Different Assumptions Used” section below.\nThe value of AEP’s Pension Plans’ assets is $4.1 billion as of December 31, 2023 and $4.1 billion as of December 31,\n2022. During 2023, the Qualified Plan paid $361 million and the Nonqualified Plans paid $8 million in benefits to plan\nparticipants. The value of AEP’s OPEB plans’ assets increased to $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2023 from $1.5 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2022 primarily due to positive investment returns. During 2023, the OPEB plans paid $138 million in benefits to\nplan participants.\nNature of Estimates Required\nAEPSC sponsors pension and OPEB plans in various forms covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements. These\nbenefits are accounted for under “Compensation” and “Plan Accounting” accounting guidance. The measurement of pension\nand OPEB obligations, costs and liabilities is dependent on a variety of assumptions.\nAssumptions and Approach Used\nThe critical assumptions used in developing the required estimates includes discount rate, compensation increase rate, cash\nbalance crediting rate, health care cost trend rate and expected return on plan assets. Other assumptions, such as retirement,\nmortality and turnover, are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect actual experience.\nEffect if Different Assumptions Used\nThe actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions,\nhigher or lower withdrawal rates, longer or shorter life spans of participants or higher or lower lump sum versus annuity payout\nelections by plan participants. These differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension and OPEB expense\nrecorded. If a 50 basis point change were to occur for the following assumptions, the approximate effect on the financial\nstatements would be as follows:\nPension Plans OPEB\n+0.5% -0.5% +0.5% -0.5%\n(in millions)\nEffect on December 31, 2023 Benefit Obligations\nDiscount Rate $ (177.9) $ 193.7 $ (36.2) $ 39.3\nCompensation Increase Rate 226.0 (21.1) NA NA\nCash Balance Crediting Rate 60.2 (56.9) NA NA\nHealth Care Cost Trend Rate NA NA 5.1 (4.4)\nEffect on 2023 Periodic Cost\nDiscount Rate $ (9.3) $ 10.1 $ 1.6 $ (1.7)\nCompensation Increase Rate 4.9 (4.5) NA NA\nCash Balance Crediting Rate 11.1 (10.5) NA NA\nHealth Care Cost Trend Rate NA NA 0.5 (0.3)\nExpected Return on Plan Assets (22.6) 22.6 (7.6) 7.6\nNA Not applicable.\n81\nSIGNIFICANT TAX LEGISLATION\nIn August 2022, President Biden signed H.R. 5376 into law, commonly known as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA.\nMost notably this budget reconciliation legislation creates a 15% minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income\n(Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax or CAMT), extends and increases the value of PTCs and ITCs, adds a nuclear and clean\nhydrogen PTC, an energy storage ITC and allows the sale or transfer of tax credits to third parties for cash.\nIn June 2023, the IRS issued temporary regulations related to the transfer of tax credits. In the third and fourth quarter of 2023,\nAEP, on behalf of PSO, SWEPCo and AEP Energy Supply, LLC, entered into transferability agreements with nonaffiliated\nparties to sell 2023 generated PTCs resulting in cash proceeds of approximately $102 million received in the fourth quarter of\n2023 and an additional $76 million expected in early 2024. AEP expects to continue to explore the ability to efficiently\nmonetize its tax credits through third party transferability agreements. See Note 12 - Income Taxes for additional information.\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nSee Note 2 - New Accounting Standards for information related to accounting standards.\n82\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket Risks\nThe Vertically Integrated Utilities segment is exposed to certain market risks as a major power producer and through\ntransactions in power, coal, natural gas and marketing contracts. These risks include commodity price risks which may be\nsubject to capacity risk, credit risk as well as interest rate risk. These risks represent the risk of loss that may impact this\nsegment due to changes in the underlying market prices or rates.\nThe Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment is exposed to energy procurement risk and interest rate risk.\nThe Generation & Marketing segment conducts marketing, risk management and retail activities in ERCOT, PJM, SPP and\nMISO. This segment is exposed to certain market risks as a marketer of wholesale and retail electricity. These risks include\ncommodity price risks which may be subject to capacity risk, credit risk as well as interest rate risk. These risks represent the\nrisk of loss that may impact this segment due to changes in the underlying market prices or rates. In addition, the Generation &\nMarketing segment is also exposed to certain market risks as a power producer and through transactions in wholesale\nelectricity, natural gas and marketing contracts.\nManagement employs risk management contracts including physical forward and financial forward purchase-and-sale\ncontracts. Management engages in risk management of power, capacity, coal, natural gas and, to a lesser extent, heating oil,\ngasoline and other commodity contracts to manage the risk associated with the energy business. As a result, AEP is subject to\nprice risk. The amount of risk taken is determined by the Commercial Operations, Energy Supply and Finance groups in\naccordance with established risk management policies as approved by the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors.\nAEPSC’s market risk oversight staff independently monitors risk policies, procedures and risk levels and provides members of\nthe Regulated Risk Committee and the Energy Supply Risk Committee (Competitive Risk Committee) various reports\nregarding compliance with policies, limits and procedures. The Regulated Risk Committee consists of AEPSC’s Chief\nFinancial Officer, Chief Commercial Officer, Executive Vice President Utilities, Senior Vice President of Regulated\nCommercial Operations, Senior Vice President of Treasury and Risk and Chief Risk Officer. The Competitive Risk Committee\nconsists of AEPSC’s Chief Financial Officer, Chief Commercial Officer, Senior Vice President of Treasury and Risk, Senior\nVice President of Competitive Commercial Operations and Chief Risk Officer. When commercial activities exceed\npredetermined limits, positions are modified to reduce the risk to be within the limits unless specifically approved by the\nrespective committee.\nThe following table summarizes the reasons for changes in total MTM value as compared to December 31, 2022:\nMTM Risk Management Contract Net Assets (Liabilities)\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nTransmission\nVertically and Generation\nIntegrated Distribution &\nUtilities Utilities Marketing Total\n(in millions)\nTotal MTM Risk Management Contract Net Assets (Liabilities)\nas of December 31, 2022 $ 134.7 $ (40.0) $ 360.5 $ 455.2\n(Gain)/Loss from Contracts Realized/Settled During the Period and\nEntered in a Prior Period (158.8) 2.0 (170.1) (326.9)\nFair Value of New Contracts at Inception When Entered During\nthe Period (a) — — 3.9 3.9\nChanges in Fair Value Due to Market Fluctuations During the\nPeriod (b) 24.5 — (101.9) (77.4)\nChanges in Fair Value Allocated to Regulated Jurisdictions (c) 16.5 (13.0) — 3.5\nTotal MTM Risk Management Contract Net Assets (Liabilities)\nas of December 31, 2023 $ 16.9 $ (51.0) $ 92.4 $ 58.3\nCommodity Cash Flow Hedge Contracts 133.1\nInterest Rate Cash Flow Hedge Contracts (9.0)\nFair Value Hedge Contracts (98.4)\nCollateral Deposits (16.7)\nTotal MTM Derivative Contract Net Assets as of December 31,\n2023 $ 67.3\n83\n(a) Reflects fair value on primarily long-term structured contracts which are typically with customers that seek fixed pricing to limit their\nrisk against fluctuating energy prices. The contract prices are valued against market curves associated with the delivery location and\ndelivery term.

These net gains (losses) are\nrecorded as regulatory liabilities/assets or accounts payable on the balance sheet.\nSee Note 10 – Derivatives and Hedging and Note 11 – Fair Value Measurements for additional information related to risk\nmanagement contracts. The following tables and discussion provide information on credit risk and market volatility risk.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is mitigated in wholesale marketing and trading activities by assessing the creditworthiness of potential\ncounterparties before entering into transactions with them and continuing to evaluate their creditworthiness on an ongoing\nbasis. Management uses credit agency ratings and current market-based qualitative and quantitative data as well as financial\nstatements to assess the financial health of counterparties on an ongoing basis.\nAEP has risk management contracts (includes non-derivative contracts) with numerous counterparties. Since open risk\nmanagement contracts are valued based on changes in market prices of the related commodities, exposures change daily. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, credit exposure net of collateral to sub investment grade counterparties was approximately 7.2%, expressed\nin terms of net MTM assets, net receivables and the net open positions for contracts not subject to MTM (representing\neconomic risk even though there may not be risk of accounting loss).\nAs of December 31, 2023, the following table approximates AEP’s counterparty credit quality and exposure based on netting\nacross commodities, instruments and legal entities where applicable:\nExposure Number of Net Exposure\nBefore Counterparties of\nCredit Credit Net >10% of Counterparties\nCounterparty Credit Quality Collateral Collateral Exposure Net Exposure >10%\n(in millions, except number of counterparties)\nInvestment Grade $ 395.4 $ 48.7 $ 346.7 2 $ 126.9\nSplit Rating 25.1 — 25.1 1 25.1\nNoninvestment Grade 0.2 0.2 — — —\nNo External Ratings:\nInternal Investment Grade 34.9 — 34.9 4 23.4\nInternal Noninvestment Grade 80.4 48.7 31.7 2 27.4\nTotal as of December 31, 2023 $ 536.0 $ 97.6 $ 438.4\nAll exposure in the table above relates to AEPSC and AEPEP as AEPSC is agent for and transacts on behalf of certain AEP\nsubsidiaries, including the Registrant Subsidiaries and AEPEP is agent for and transacts on behalf of other AEP subsidiaries.\nIn addition, AEP is exposed to credit risk related to participation in RTOs. For each of the RTOs in which AEP participates,\nthis risk is generally determined based on the proportionate share of member gross activity over a specified period of time.\nValue at Risk (VaR) Associated with Risk Management Contracts\nManagement uses a risk measurement model, which calculates VaR, to measure AEP’s commodity price risk in the risk\nmanagement portfolio. The VaR is based on the variance-covariance method using historical prices to estimate volatilities and\ncorrelations and assumes a 95% confidence level and a one-day holding period. Based on this VaR analysis, as of\nDecember 31, 2023, a near term typical change in commodity prices is not expected to materially impact net income, cash flows\nor financial condition.\nManagement calculates the VaR for both a trading and non-trading portfolio. The trading portfolio consists primarily of\ncontracts related to energy trading and marketing activities. The non-trading portfolio consists primarily of economic hedges of\ngeneration and retail supply activities.\n84\nThe following tables show the end, high, average and low market risk as measured by VaR for the periods indicated:\nVaR Model\nTrading Portfolio\nTwelve Months Ended Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nEnd High Average Low End High Average Low\n(in millions) (in millions)\n$ 0.2 $ 0.9 $ 0.2 $ 0.1 $ 0.5 $ 4.5 $ 0.7 $ 0.1\nVaR Model\nNon-Trading Portfolio\nTwelve Months Ended Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nEnd High Average Low End High Average Low\n(in millions) (in millions)\n$ 17.7 $ 32.7 $ 16.4 $ 6.1 $ 17.7 $ 76.9 $ 24.7 $ 6.7\nManagement back-tests VaR results against performance due to actual price movements. Based on the assumed 95%\nconfidence interval, the performance due to actual price movements would be expected to exceed the VaR at least once every\n20 trading days.\nAs the VaR calculation captures recent price movements, management also performs regular stress testing of the trading\nportfolio to understand AEP’s exposure to extreme price movements. A historical-based method is employed whereby the\ncurrent trading portfolio is subjected to actual, observed price movements from the last several years in order to ascertain which\nhistorical price movements translated into the largest potential MTM loss. Management then researches the underlying\npositions, price movements and market events that created the most significant exposure and reports the findings to the Risk\nExecutive Committee, Regulated Risk Committee or Competitive Risk Committee as appropriate.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAEP is exposed to interest rate market fluctuations in the normal course of business operations. Prior to 2022, interest rates\nremained at low levels and the Federal Reserve maintained the federal funds target range at 0.0% to 0.25% for much of 2021.\nHowever, during 2022, the Federal Reserve approved several rate increases for a cumulative total of 4.25% increase. During\n2023, the Federal Reserve approved another four rate increases for a cumulative total of 1.0% rate increase. AEP has\noutstanding short and long-term debt which is subject to variable rates. AEP manages interest rate risk by limiting variable-rate\nexposures to a percentage of total debt, by entering into interest rate derivative instruments and by monitoring the effects of\nmarket changes in interest rates. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, a 100 basis point change in\nthe benchmark rate on AEP’s variable rate debt would impact pretax interest expense annually by $40 million, $47 million and\n$33 million, respectively.\n85\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of\nAmerican Electric Power Company, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of American Electric Power Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries\n(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive\nincome (loss), of changes in equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023,\nincluding the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively\nreferred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by\nthe Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial\nposition of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the\nthree years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included\nin the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express\nopinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting\nbased on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities\nlaws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material\nrespects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement\nof the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.\nSuch procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated\nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the\nrisk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based\non the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the\ncircumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures\nthat (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the\ncompany; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n86\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial\nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or\ncomplex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate\nopinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAccounting for the Effects of Cost-Based Regulation\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's consolidated financial statements reflect\nthe actions of regulators that result in the recognition of certain revenues and expenses in different time periods than enterprises\nthat are not rate-regulated. As of December 31, 2023, there were $5.6 billion of deferred costs included in regulatory assets,\n$0.8 billion of which were pending final regulatory approval, and $8.2 billion of regulatory liabilities awaiting potential refund\nor future rate reduction, $0.2 billion of which were pending final regulatory determination. Regulatory assets (deferred\nexpenses) and regulatory liabilities (deferred future revenue reductions or refunds) are recorded to reflect the economic effects\nof regulation in the same accounting period by matching expenses with their recovery through regulated revenues and matching\nincome with its passage to customers in cost-based regulated rates. Management reviews the probability of recovery of\nregulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities at each balance sheet date and whenever new events occur, such as changes\nin the regulatory environment, issuance of regulatory commission orders, or passage of new legislation.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the accounting for the effects of cost-\nbased regulation is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in the ongoing evaluation of the recovery\nof regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities, and in applying guidance contained in rate orders and other relevant\nevidence; this in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating\naudit evidence related to the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall\nopinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to\nmanagement's evaluation of new events, such as changes in the regulatory environment, issuance of regulatory commission\norders, or passage of new legislation, including the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory\nliabilities. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating the reasonableness of management's assessment of\nprobability of future recovery for regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities. Testing of regulatory assets and\nliabilities involved evaluating the provisions and formulas outlined in rate orders, other regulatory correspondence, application\nof relevant regulatory precedents, and other relevant evidence.\nValuation of Level 3 Risk Management Commodity Contracts\nAs described in Notes 1, 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company employs risk management\ncommodity contracts including physical and financial forward purchase and sale contracts and, to a lesser extent, over-the-\ncounter swaps and options to accomplish its risk management strategies. Certain over-the-counter and bilaterally executed\nderivative instruments are executed in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information. As disclosed by\nmanagement, the fair value of these risk management commodity contracts is estimated based on the best market information\navailable, including valuation models that estimate future energy prices based on existing market and broker quotes, and other\nassumptions. Fair value estimates, based upon the best market information available, involve uncertainties and matters of\nsignificant judgment including forward market price assumptions. The main driver of contracts being classified as Level 3 is the\ninability to substantiate energy price curves in the market. Management utilized such unobservable pricing inputs to value its\nLevel 3 risk management commodity contract assets and liabilities, which totaled $294 million and $155 million, as of\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively.\n87\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of Level 3 risk\nmanagement commodity contracts is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing the\nfair value of the commodity contracts; this in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing\nprocedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the forward market price assumptions used in management's valuation\nmodels. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall\nopinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to\nmanagement's valuation of the risk management commodity contracts, including controls over the assumptions used to value\nthe Level 3 risk management commodity contracts. These procedures also included, among others, testing management's\nprocess for developing the fair value of the Level 3 risk management commodity contracts, evaluating the appropriateness of\nthe valuation models, evaluating the reasonableness of the forward market price assumptions, and testing the data used by\nmanagement in the valuation models. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the\nreasonableness of the forward market price assumptions.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nColumbus, Ohio\nFebruary 26, 2024\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2017.\n88\nMANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThe management of American Electric Power Company, Inc. and Subsidiary Companies (AEP) is responsible for establishing\nand maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. AEP’s internal control is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of AEP’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making\nthis assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (COSO) in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial\nstatements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and\nthe results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express\nan opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered\nwith the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those\nstandards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial\nstatements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we\nengaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness\nof the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a\ntest basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or\ncomplex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate\nopinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAccounting for the Effects of Cost-Based Regulation\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's consolidated financial statements reflect\nthe actions of regulators that result in the recognition of certain revenues and expenses in different time periods than enterprises\nthat are not rate-regulated. As of December 31, 2023, there were $315 million of deferred costs included in regulatory assets,\n$64 million of which were pending final regulatory approval, and $1,261 million of regulatory liabilities awaiting potential\nrefund or future rate reduction, $15 million of which were pending final regulatory determination. Regulatory assets (deferred\nexpenses) and regulatory liabilities (deferred future revenue reductions or refunds) are recorded to reflect the economic effects\nof regulation in the same accounting period by matching expenses with their recovery through regulated revenues and matching\nincome with its passage to customers in cost-based regulated rates.

These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to\nmanagement's evaluation of new events, such as changes in the regulatory environment, issuance of regulatory commission\norders, or passage of new legislation, including the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory\nliabilities. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating the reasonableness of management's assessment of\nprobability of future recovery for regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities.

Affiliated increased $5 million primarily due to higher advances to affiliates and interest rates.\n• Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction increased $13 million primarily due to higher CWIP balances\nthroughout 2023.\n• Interest Expense increased $32 million primarily due to higher long-term debt balances and interest rates.\n• Income Tax Expense decreased $22 million primarily due to a decrease in state taxes primarily driven by tax adjustments\nand deferred state tax remeasurements.\n107\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Member of\nAEP Transmission Company, LLC\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AEP Transmission Company, LLC and its subsidiaries (the\n“Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and the related consolidated statements of income, of changes in member's\nequity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, including the related notes and\nfinancial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated\nfinancial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial\nposition of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the\nthree years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express\nan opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered\nwith the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those\nstandards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial\nstatements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we\nengaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness\nof the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a\ntest basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial\nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or\ncomplex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate\nopinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAccounting for the Effects of Cost-Based Regulation\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's consolidated financial statements reflect\nthe actions of regulators that result in the recognition of certain revenues and expenses in different time periods than enterprises\nthat are not rate-regulated. As of December 31, 2023, there were $3 million of deferred costs included in regulatory assets and\n$784 million of regulatory liabilities awaiting potential refund or future rate reduction, $9 million of which were pending final\nregulatory determination. Regulatory assets (deferred expenses) and regulatory liabilities (deferred future revenue reductions or\nrefunds) are recorded to reflect the economic effects of regulation in the same accounting period by matching expenses with\ntheir recovery through regulated revenues and matching income with its passage to customers in cost-based regulated rates.\nManagement reviews the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities at each balance sheet\ndate and whenever new events occur, such as changes in the regulatory environment, issuance of regulatory commission orders,\nor passage of new legislation.\n108\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the accounting for the effects of cost-\nbased regulation is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in the ongoing evaluation of the recovery\nof regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities, and in applying guidance contained in rate orders and other relevant\nevidence; this in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating\naudit evidence related to the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall\nopinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to\nmanagement's evaluation of new events, such as changes in the regulatory environment, issuance of regulatory commission\norders, or passage of new legislation, including the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory\nliabilities. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating the reasonableness of management's assessment of\nprobability of future recovery for regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities. Testing of regulatory assets and\nliabilities involved evaluating the provisions and formulas outlined in rate orders, other regulatory correspondence, application\nof relevant regulatory precedents, and other relevant evidence.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nColumbus, Ohio\nFebruary 26, 2024\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2017.\n109\nMANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThe management of AEP Transmission Company, LLC and Subsidiaries (AEPTCo) is responsible for establishing and\nmaintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Revenues were as follows:\n• Retail Revenues increased $236 million primarily due to the following:\n• A $199 million increase in fuel revenue primarily due to authorized fuel rate increases in Virginia.\n• A $65 million increase in rider revenues in Virginia and West Virginia.\n• A $34 million increase due to lower customer refunds related to Tax Reform.\n• A $20 million increase due to a base rate increase in Virginia implemented in October 2022 following the Virginia\nSupreme Court remand.\nThese increases were partially offset by:\n• A $77 million decrease in weather-related usage driven by a 30% decrease in heating degree days and a 13%\ndecrease in cooling degree days.\n• A $10 million decrease in weather-normalized margins primarily due to decreases in the industrial class.\n• Other Revenues decreased $26 million primarily due to the following:\n• A $16 million decrease in refundable sales of renewable energy credits.\n• A $10 million decrease in pole attachment revenue.\nExpenses and Other and Income Tax Expense changed between years as follows:\n• Purchased Electricity, Fuel and Other Consumables Used for Electric Generation expenses increased $261\nmillion primarily due to the following:\n• A $153 million increase due to the current year recovery of prior period under-recovered fuel expenses as a result\nof authorized fuel rate increases in Virginia.\n• A $127 million increase due to a disallowance of under-recovered ENEC regulatory assets in West Virginia.\n• Other Operation and Maintenance expenses decreased $2 million primarily due to the following:\n• A $19 million decrease in employee-related expenses.\n• A $13 million decrease in distribution expenses primarily due to vegetation management costs.\n• A $13 million decrease due to a charitable contribution to the AEP Foundation in 2022.\n117\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\n• A $21 million increase due to the amortization of the regulatory asset established in accordance with the August\n2022 Virginia Supreme Court opinion related to under-earnings during the 2017-2019 Triennial Review.\n• A $14 million increase due to gains from the sale of land in 2022.\n• An $8 million increase in accounts receivable factoring expense as a result of increased interest rates.\n• Asset Impairments and Other Related Charges - Coal Fired Generation decreased $25 million due to a prior year\nwrite-off of a regulatory asset in accordance with the August 2022 Virginia Supreme Court opinion related to the\n2017-2019 Virginia Triennial Review.\n• Establishment of 2017-2019 Virginia Triennial Review Regulatory Asset decreased $37 million due to a prior year\nestablishment of a regulatory asset in accordance with the August 2022 Virginia Supreme Court opinion related to\nunder-earning during the 2017-2019 Triennial Review.\n• Depreciation and Amortization Expense decreased $4 million primarily due to the following:\n• A $28 million decrease due to the implementation of updated Virginia depreciation rates in 2023.\nThis decrease was partially offset by:\n• A $23 million increase due to a higher depreciable base.\n• Interest Expense increased $36 million primarily due to higher long-term debt balances and interest rates.\n• Income Tax Expense decreased $4 million primarily due to a $22 million decrease as a result of lower pretax book\nincome partially offset by a $15 million increase in state taxes.\n118\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholder of\nAppalachian Power Company\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Appalachian Power Company and its subsidiaries (the\n“Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income\n(loss), of changes in common shareholder’s equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December\n31, 2023, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the\nconsolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December\n31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December\n31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express\nan opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered\nwith the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those\nstandards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial\nstatements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we\nengaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness\nof the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a\ntest basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or\ncomplex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate\nopinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAccounting for the Effects of Cost-Based Regulation\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's consolidated financial statements reflect\nthe actions of regulators that result in the recognition of certain revenues and expenses in different time periods than enterprises\nthat are not rate-regulated. As of December 31, 2023, there were $1,311 million of deferred costs included in regulatory assets,\n$126 million of which were pending final regulatory approval, and $1,082 million of regulatory liabilities awaiting potential\nrefund or future rate reduction, $28 million of which were pending final regulatory determination. Regulatory assets (deferred\nexpenses) and regulatory liabilities (deferred future revenue reductions or refunds) are recorded to reflect the economic effects\nof regulation in the same accounting period by matching expenses with their recovery through regulated revenues and matching\nincome with its passage to customers in cost-based regulated rates. Management reviews the probability of recovery of\nregulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities at each balance sheet date and whenever new events occur, such as changes\nin the regulatory environment, issuance of regulatory commission orders, or passage of new legislation.\n119\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the accounting for the effects of cost-\nbased regulation is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in the ongoing evaluation of the recovery\nof regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities, and in applying guidance contained in rate orders and other relevant\nevidence; this in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating\naudit evidence related to the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall\nopinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to\nmanagement's evaluation of new events, such as changes in the regulatory environment, issuance of regulatory commission\norders, or passage of new legislation, including the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory\nliabilities. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating the reasonableness of management's assessment of\nprobability of future recovery for regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities. Testing of regulatory assets and\nliabilities involved evaluating the provisions and formulas outlined in rate orders, other regulatory correspondence, application\nof relevant regulatory precedents, and other relevant evidence.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nColumbus, Ohio\nFebruary 26, 2024\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2017.\n120\nMANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThe management of Appalachian Power Company and Subsidiaries (APCo) is responsible for establishing and maintaining\nadequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended. APCo’s internal control is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding\nthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of APCo’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In\nmaking this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (COSO) in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013). Based on management’s assessment, management\nconcluded APCo’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nThis annual report does not include an audit report from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, APCo’s registered public accounting\nfirm regarding internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission rules that permit\nAPCo to provide only management’s report in this annual report.\n121\nAPPALACHIAN POWER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2023, 2022

Expenses and Other 199.3\nIncome Tax Expense (54.4)\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 $ 335.9\nThe major components of the decrease in Revenues were as follows:\n• Retail Revenues decreased $197 million primarily due to the following:\n• A $178 million decrease in fuel revenues primarily due to lower spot market energy prices.\n• A $54 million decrease in rider revenues.\n• A $45 million decrease in weather-related usage due to a 23% decrease in heating degree days and a 20% decrease in\ncooling degree days.\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\n• A $64 million increase in weather-normalized margins in all retail classes, partially offset by the wholesale class.\n• A $17 million increase due to a reduction in provision for refund, partially offset by lower wholesale true-ups.\n• Off-system Sales increased $73 million primarily due to economic hedging activity and Rockport Plant, Unit 2 merchant\nsales.\n• Transmission Revenues decreased $19 million primarily due to the following:\n• An $11 million decrease due to transmission formula rate true-up activity.\n• A $2 million decrease due to lower PJM rates for certain point-to-point transmission service resulting from a\nDecember 2022 FERC approved settlement agreement.\n• Other Revenues increased $11 million primarily due to an increase in sales of renewable energy credits.\nExpenses and Other and Income Tax Expense changed between years as follows:\n• Purchased Electricity, Fuel and Other Consumables Used for Electric Generation expenses decreased $124 million\nprimarily due to lower spot market energy prices and a decrease in generation, partially offset by an increase in average\ncost of fuel.\n• Purchased Electricity from AEP Affiliates decreased $61 million primarily due to a decrease in purchases from AEGCo\ndriven by a decrease in demand for power from the Rockport Plant.\n129\n• Other Operation and Maintenance expenses increased $53 million primarily due to the following:\n• A $34 million increase in Demand Side Management expenses.\n• A $10 million increase in River Transportation Division and merchant operation expenses.\n• A $9 million increase due to a decreased Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited distribution in 2023.\n• An $8 million increase in nuclear expenses at Cook Plant primarily due to refueling outage expenses.\n• An $8 million increase in vegetation management expenses.\n• A $7 million increase in transmission expenses primarily due to an increase in recoverable PJM expenses.\nThese increases were partially offset by:\n• A $15 million decrease in employee-related expenses.\n• An $11 million decrease due to a charitable contribution to the AEP Foundation in 2022.\n• Depreciation and Amortization expenses decreased $57 million primarily due to the expiration of the Rockport Plant,\nUnit 2 lease in December 2022, partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense due to the acquisition of Rockport\nPlant, Unit 2 at the end of the lease and a higher depreciable base.\n• Taxes Other Than Income Taxes decreased $13 million primarily due to the repeal of the Indiana Utility Receipts Tax\nin July 2022.\n• Non-Service Cost Components of Net Periodic Benefit Cost decreased $6 million primarily due to the change in loss\namortization for the plans and an increase in the expected return on asset assumption, partially offset by higher interest\ncosts due to increased discount rates.\n• Interest Expense increased $12 million primarily due to higher long-term debt balances and interest rates.\n• Income Tax Expense increased $54 million primarily due to the following:\n• A $24 million increase due to a decrease in amortization of Excess ADIT.\n• A $14 million increase due to an increase in pretax book income.\n• An $8 million increase due to an increase in state taxes.\n130\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholder of\nIndiana Michigan Power Company\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Indiana Michigan Power Company and its subsidiaries (the\n“Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income\n(loss), of changes in common shareholder’s equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December\n31, 2023, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the\nconsolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December\n31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December\n31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express\nan opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered\nwith the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those\nstandards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial\nstatements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we\nengaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness\nof the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a\ntest basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or\ncomplex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate\nopinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAccounting for the Effects of Cost-Based Regulation\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's consolidated financial statements reflect\nthe actions of regulators that result in the recognition of certain revenues and expenses in different time periods than enterprises\nthat are not rate-regulated. As of December 31, 2023, there were $421 million of deferred costs included in regulatory assets,\n$136 million of which were pending final regulatory approval, and $2,076 million of net regulatory liabilities awaiting potential\nrefund or future rate reduction, $23 million of which were pending final regulatory determination. Regulatory assets (deferred\nexpenses) and regulatory liabilities (deferred future revenue reductions or refunds) are recorded to reflect the economic effects\nof regulation in the same accounting period by matching expenses with their recovery through regulated revenues and matching\nincome with its passage to customers in cost-based regulated rates. Management reviews the probability of recovery of\nregulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities at each balance sheet date and whenever new events occur, such as changes\nin the regulatory environment, issuance of regulatory commission orders, or passage of new legislation.\n131\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the accounting for the effects of cost-\nbased regulation is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in the ongoing evaluation of the recovery\nof regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities, and in applying guidance contained in rate orders and other relevant\nevidence; this in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating\naudit evidence related to the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall\nopinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to\nmanagement's evaluation of new events, such as changes in the regulatory environment, issuance of regulatory commission\norders, or passage of new legislation, including the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory\nliabilities. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating the reasonableness of management's assessment of\nprobability of future recovery for regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities. Testing of regulatory assets and\nliabilities involved evaluating the provisions and formulas outlined in rate orders, other regulatory correspondence, application\nof relevant regulatory precedents, and other relevant evidence.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nColumbus, Ohio\nFebruary 26, 2024\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2017.\n132\nMANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThe management of Indiana Michigan Power Company and Subsidiaries (I&M) is responsible for establishing and maintaining\nadequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended. I&M’s internal control is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of I&M’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making\nthis assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (COSO) in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013). Based on management’s assessment, management\nconcluded I&M’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nThis annual report does not include an audit report from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, I&M’s registered public accounting\nfirm regarding internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission rules that permit\nI&M to provide only management’s report in this annual report.\n133\nINDIANA MICHIGAN POWER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and

increase in Revenues were as follows:\n• Retail Revenues increased $186 million primarily due to a $225 million increase in rider revenues, partially offset by a\n$49 million decrease in weather-related usage driven by a 24% decrease in heating degree days and a 25% decrease in\ncooling degree days.\n• Off-system Sales decreased $86 million due to decreased sales at OVEC driven by lower market prices and volume.\n• Other Revenue increased $45 million due to refundable sales of renewable energy credits.\nExpenses and Other and Income Tax Expense changed between years as follows:\n• Purchased Electricity for Resale expenses decreased $149 million primarily due to the following:\n• A $129 million increase in deferrals of OVEC costs.\n• A $69 million decrease due to lower auction volumes driven by decreased load, partially offset by higher prices.\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\n• A $36 million increase in recoverable expenses due to creation, consumption and liquidation of renewable energy\ncredits and recoverable renewable energy purchase agreement expenses.\n• Purchased Electricity from AEP Affiliates expenses increased $77 million due to increased affiliated auction volumes\ndriven by AEP Energy auctions won in June 2023.\n• Other Operation and Maintenance expenses increased $136 million primarily due to the following:\n• A $96 million increase related to an energy assistance program for qualified Ohio customers.\n• A $34 million increase in transmission expenses due to an increase in recoverable PJM expenses driven by additional\ntransmission investment.\n• A $23 million increase in recoverable distribution expenses primarily related to vegetation management.\nThese increases were partially offset by:\n• A $10 million decrease in employee-related expenses.\n• Depreciation and Amortization expenses increased $22 million primarily due to a higher depreciable base, partially\noffset by a decrease in recoverable rider depreciable expenses.\n• Interest Expense increased $11 million primarily due to an increase of $20 million driven by higher debt balances and\ninterest rates, partially offset by a decrease of $7 million due to increased AFUDC base and rates.\n• Income Tax Expense increased $10 million primarily due to an increase in pretax book income.\n141\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholder of\nOhio Power Company\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ohio Power Company and its subsidiaries (the “Company”)\nas of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and the related consolidated statements of income, of changes in common shareholder’s\nequity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, including the related notes\n(collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present\nfairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express\nan opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered\nwith the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those\nstandards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial\nstatements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we\nengaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness\nof the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a\ntest basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial\nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or\ncomplex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate\nopinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAccounting for the Effects of Cost-Based Regulation\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's consolidated financial statements reflect\nthe actions of regulators that result in the recognition of certain revenues and expenses in different time periods than enterprises\nthat are not rate-regulated. As of December 31, 2023, there were $455 million of deferred costs included in regulatory assets,\n$24 million of which were pending final regulatory approval, and $1,004 million of regulatory liabilities awaiting potential\nrefund or future rate reduction, $57 million of which were pending final regulatory determination. Regulatory assets (deferred\nexpenses) and regulatory liabilities (deferred future revenue reductions or refunds) are recorded to reflect the economic effects\nof regulation in the same accounting period by matching expenses with their recovery through regulated revenues and matching\nincome with its passage to customers in cost-based regulated rates. Management reviews the probability of recovery of\nregulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities at each balance sheet date and whenever new events occur, such as changes\nin the regulatory environment, issuance of regulatory commission orders, or passage of new legislation.\n142\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the accounting for the effects of cost-\nbased regulation is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in the ongoing evaluation of the recovery\nof regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities, and in applying guidance contained in rate orders and other relevant\nevidence; this in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating\naudit evidence related to the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall\nopinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to\nmanagement's evaluation of new events, such as changes in the regulatory environment, issuance of regulatory commission\norders, or passage of new legislation, including the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory\nliabilities. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating the reasonableness of management's assessment of\nprobability of future recovery for regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities. Testing of regulatory assets and\nliabilities involved evaluating the provisions and formulas outlined in rate orders, other regulatory correspondence, application\nof relevant regulatory precedents, and other relevant evidence.\nValuation of Level 3 Risk Management Commodity Contracts\nAs described in Notes 1, 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company employs risk management\ncommodity contracts including physical and financial forward purchase and sale contracts and, to a lesser extent, over-the-\ncounter swaps and options to accomplish its risk management strategies. Certain over-the-counter and bilaterally executed\nderivative instruments are executed in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information. As disclosed by\nmanagement, the fair value of these risk management commodity contracts is estimated based on the best market information\navailable, including valuation models that estimate future energy prices based on existing market and broker quotes, and other\nassumptions. Fair value estimates, based upon the best market information available, involve uncertainties and matters of\nsignificant judgment including forward market price assumptions. The main driver of contracts being classified as Level 3 is the\ninability to substantiate energy price curves in the market. Management utilized such unobservable pricing inputs to value its\nLevel 3 risk management commodity contract liabilities, which totaled $51 million, as of December 31, 2023.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of Level 3 risk\nmanagement commodity contracts is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing the\nfair value of the commodity contracts; this in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing\nprocedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the forward market price assumptions used in management’s valuation\nmodels. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall\nopinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to\nmanagement’s valuation of the risk management commodity contracts, including controls over the assumptions used to value\nthe Level 3 risk management commodity contracts. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s\nprocess for developing the fair value of the Level 3 risk management commodity contracts, evaluating the appropriateness of\nthe valuation models, evaluating the reasonableness of the forward market price assumptions, and testing the data used by\nmanagement in the valuation models. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the\nreasonableness of the forward market price assumptions.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nColumbus, Ohio\nFebruary 26, 2024\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2017.\n143\nMANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThe management of Ohio Power Company and Subsidiaries (OPCo) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate\ninternal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange\nAct of 1934, as amended. OPCo’s internal control is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of OPCo’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In\nmaking this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (COSO) in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013). Based on management’s assessment, management\nconcluded OPCo’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nThis annual report does not include an audit report from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, OPCo’s registered public accounting\nfirm regarding internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission rules that permit\nOPCo to provide only management’s report in this annual report.\n144\nOHIO POWER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and

Tax Benefit 4.4\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 $ 208.8\n(a) Includes firm wholesale sales to municipals and cooperatives.\nThe major components of the increase in Revenues were as follows:\n• Retail Revenues increased $109 million primarily due to the following:\n• A $71 million increase in base rate revenues.\n• A $71 million increase in fuel revenue primarily due to authorized fuel rate increases in Oklahoma.\nThese increases were partially offset by:\n• A $19 million decrease in weather-related usage due to a 26% decrease in heating degree days and a 9% decrease in\ncooling degree days.\n• A $10 million decrease in weather-normalized margins primarily in the residential class.\nExpenses and Other and Income Tax Benefit changed between years as follows:\n• Purchased Electricity, Fuel and Other Consumables Used for Electric Generation expenses increased $64 million\nprimarily due to the current year amortization of under-recovered fuel regulatory assets due to authorized fuel rate\nincreases in Oklahoma.\n• Other Operation and Maintenance expenses decreased $47 million primarily due to the following:\n• A $26 million decrease in transmission expenses primarily due to an $11 million decrease in recoverable SPP\nexpenses and a $14 million decrease due to a FERC order which denied stand-alone treatment of NOLCs in\ntransmission formula rates.\n• A $10 million decrease in employee-related expenses.\n• A $6 million decrease due to a charitable contribution to the AEP Foundation in 2022.\n• A $6 million decrease due to the pre-construction costs associated with various renewable projects.\n• Depreciation and Amortization expenses increased $25 million primarily due to a higher depreciable base,\nimplementation of new rates and the timing of refunds to customers under rate rider mechanisms.\n• Taxes Other Than Income Taxes increased $7 million primarily due to increased property taxes driven by the\ninvestment in NCWF and a new infrastructure fee implemented by the City of Tulsa in March 2022.\n• Interest Income decreased $6 million primarily due to decreased carrying charges on regulatory assets resulting from the\nFebruary 2021 severe winter weather event.\n151\n• Allowance for Funds Used During Construction increased $7 million primarily due to an increase in AFUDC base and\nequity rates.\n• Interest Expense increased $20 million primarily due to higher long-term debt balances and interest rates.\n• Income Tax Benefit increased $4 million primarily due to the following:\n• A $17 million increase in PTCs.\nThis increase was partially offset by:\n• An $8 million decrease due to an increase in pretax book income.\n• A $2 million decrease due to a decrease in amortization of Excess ADIT.\n152\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholder of\nPublic Service Company of Oklahoma\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Public Service Company of Oklahoma (the “Company”) as of December\n31, 2023 and 2022 and the related statements of income, of comprehensive income (loss), of changes in common shareholder’s\nequity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, including the related notes\n(collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material\nrespects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash\nflows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require\nthat we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of\nits internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control\nover financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control\nover financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due\nto error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that\nwas communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are\nmaterial to the financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The\ncommunication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and\nwe are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAccounting for the Effects of Cost-Based Regulation\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the financial statements, the Company's financial statements reflect the actions of regulators\nthat result in the recognition of certain revenues and expenses in different time periods than enterprises that are not rate-\nregulated. As of December 31, 2023, there were $641 million of deferred costs included in regulatory assets, $89 million of\nwhich were pending final regulatory approval, and $766 million of regulatory liabilities awaiting potential refund or future rate\nreduction, $1 million of which were pending final regulatory determination. Regulatory assets (deferred expenses) and\nregulatory liabilities (deferred future revenue reductions or refunds) are recorded to reflect the economic effects of regulation in\nthe same accounting period by matching expenses with their recovery through regulated revenues and matching income with its\npassage to customers in cost-based regulated rates. Management reviews the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and\nrefund of regulatory liabilities at each balance sheet date and whenever new events occur, such as changes in the regulatory\nenvironment, issuance of regulatory commission orders, or passage of new legislation.\n153\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the accounting for the effects of cost-\nbased regulation is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in the ongoing evaluation of the recovery\nof regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities, and in applying guidance contained in rate orders and other relevant\nevidence; this in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating\naudit evidence related to the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall\nopinion on the financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's\nevaluation of new events, such as changes in the regulatory environment, issuance of regulatory commission orders, or passage\nof new legislation, including the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities. These\nprocedures also included, among others, evaluating the reasonableness of management's assessment of probability of future\nrecovery for regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities. Testing of regulatory assets and liabilities involved evaluating\nthe provisions and formulas outlined in rate orders, other regulatory correspondence, application of relevant regulatory\nprecedents, and other relevant evidence.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nColumbus, Ohio\nFebruary 26, 2024\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2017.\n154\nMANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThe management of Public Service Company of Oklahoma (PSO) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate\ninternal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange\nAct of 1934, as amended. PSO’s internal control is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability\nof financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of PSO’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making\nthis assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (COSO) in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013). Based on management’s assessment, management\nconcluded PSO’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nThis annual report does not include an audit report from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, PSO’s registered public accounting firm\nregarding internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission rules that permit PSO\nto provide only management’s report in this annual report.\n155\nPUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY OF OKLAHOMA\nSTATEMENTS OF INCOME\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021\n(in millions)\nYears Ended

$125 million decrease in fuel revenue primarily due to lower natural gas and spot market energy prices,\npartially offset by authorized fuel rate increases in Arkansas and Texas designed to recover previously under-\nrecovered fuel regulatory asset balances.\n• A $20 million decrease in weather-related usage due to a 37% decrease in heating degree days.\n• An $11 million decrease in weather-normalized margins primarily in the residential class.\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\n• A $70 million increase primarily due to base rate revenue increases in Louisiana and Arkansas and rider increases\nin all retail jurisdictions.\n• Off-system Sales decreased $14 million primarily due to reduced Turk Plant merchant sales.\n• Transmission Revenues decreased $7 million primarily due to the following:\n• A $13 million decrease due to a FERC order which denied stand-alone treatment of NOLCs in transmission\nformula rates.\n• An $8 million decrease in transmission formula rate true-up activity.\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\n• A $12 million increase in transmission investment.\n163\nExpenses and Other and Income Tax Benefit changed between years as follows:\n• Purchased Electricity, Fuel and Other Consumables Used for Electric Generation expenses decreased $82 million\nprimarily due to lower natural gas and spot market energy prices, partially offset by the current year amortization of\nunder-recovered fuel regulatory assets due to authorized fuel rate increases in Arkansas and Texas.\n• Other Operation and Maintenance expenses decreased $53 million primarily due to the following:\n• A $19 million decrease in transmission expenses primarily due to the following:\n• A $13 million decrease in transmission formula rate true-up activity and decreased third-party expenses.\n• A $7 million decrease due to a FERC order which denied stand-alone treatment of NOLCs in transmission\nformula rates.\n• An $11 million decrease due to pre-construction costs associated with various renewable projects.\n• A $10 million decrease in administrative and general expenses primarily due to regulatory fees and employee-\nrelated expenses.\n• A $9 million decrease due to a prior year charitable contribution to the AEP Foundation.\n• Asset Impairments and Other Related Charges increased $86 million due to the probable disallowance of Turk\nPlant capitalized AFUDC in excess of the Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap as a result of the PUCT’s December\n2023 preliminary order in the 2012 Texas Base Rate Case.\n• Depreciation and Amortization expenses increased $18 million primarily due to an increase in amortization of\nregulatory assets.\n• Taxes Other Than Income Taxes increased $8 million primarily due to increased property taxes driven by the\ninvestment in the NCWF.\n• Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction increased $7 million primarily due to higher AFUDC\nequity rates and CWIP.\n• Interest Expense increased $10 million primarily due to higher long-term debt balances and interest rates.\n• Income Tax Benefit increased $8 million primarily due to the following:\n• A $17 million increase due to a decrease in pretax book income.\n• A $10 million increase in PTCs.\nThese increases were partially offset by:\n• A $12 million decrease due to the probable disallowance of Turk Plant capitalized AFUDC in excess of the Texas\njurisdictional capital cost cap.\n• A $3 million decrease in depletion benefit.\n• A $2 million decrease due to a decrease in amortization of Excess ADIT.\n164\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholder of\nSouthwestern Electric Power Company\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Southwestern Electric Power Company and its subsidiaries\n(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive\nincome (loss), of changes in equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023,\nincluding the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated\nfinancial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and\n2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express\nan opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered\nwith the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those\nstandards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial\nstatements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we\nengaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness\nof the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a\ntest basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or\ncomplex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate\nopinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAccounting for the Effects of Cost-Based Regulation\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's consolidated financial statements reflect\nthe actions of regulators that result in the recognition of certain revenues and expenses in different time periods than enterprises\nthat are not rate-regulated. As of December 31, 2023, there were $1,303 million of deferred costs included in regulatory assets,\n$408 million of which were pending final regulatory approval, and $759 million of regulatory liabilities awaiting potential\nrefund or future rate reduction, $7 million of which were pending final regulatory determination. Regulatory assets (deferred\nexpenses) and regulatory liabilities (deferred future revenue reductions or refunds) are recorded to reflect the economic effects\nof regulation in the same accounting period by matching expenses with their recovery through regulated revenues and matching\nincome with its passage to customers in cost-based regulated rates. Management reviews the probability of recovery of\nregulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities at each balance sheet date and whenever new events occur, such as changes\nin the regulatory environment, issuance of regulatory commission orders, or passage of new legislation.\n165\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the accounting for the effects of cost-\nbased regulation is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in the ongoing evaluation of the recovery\nof regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities, and in applying guidance contained in rate orders and other relevant\nevidence; this in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating\naudit evidence related to the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall\nopinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to\nmanagement's evaluation of new events, such as changes in the regulatory environment, issuance of regulatory commission\norders, or passage of new legislation, including the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory\nliabilities. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating the reasonableness of management's assessment of\nprobability of future recovery for regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities. Testing of regulatory assets and\nliabilities involved evaluating the provisions and formulas outlined in rate orders, other regulatory correspondence, application\nof relevant regulatory precedents, and other relevant evidence.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nColumbus, Ohio\nFebruary 26, 2024\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2017.\n166\nMANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThe management of Southwestern Electric Power Company Consolidated (SWEPCo) is responsible for establishing and\nmaintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. SWEPCo’s internal control is a process designed to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of SWEPCo’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In\nmaking this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (COSO) in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013). Based on management’s assessment, management\nconcluded SWEPCo’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nThis annual report does not include an audit report from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, SWEPCo’s registered public accounting\nfirm regarding internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission rules that permit\nSWEPCo to provide only management’s report in this annual report.\n167\nSOUTHWESTERN ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY CONSOLIDATED\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\nFor the Years Ended December 31,

ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.\nORGANIZATION\nThe Registrants engage in the generation, transmission and distribution of electric power. The Registrant Subsidiaries that\nconduct most of these activities are regulated by the FERC under the Federal Power Act and the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and\nmaintain accounts in accordance with the FERC and other regulatory guidelines. Most of these companies are subject to further\nregulation with regard to rates and other matters by state regulatory commissions.\nAEP provides competitive electric and gas supply for residential, commercial and industrial customers in deregulated electricity\nmarkets and also provides energy management solutions throughout the United States, including energy efficiency services\nthrough its independent retail electric supplier.\nThe Registrants also engage in wholesale electricity, natural gas and other commodity marketing and risk management\nactivities in the United States and provide various energy-related services. In addition, AEP operated competitive wind and\nsolar farms prior to the sale of AEP Renewables’ competitive contracted renewables portfolio in August 2023. I&M provides\nbarging services to both affiliated and nonaffiliated companies.\nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nRates and Service Regulation\nAEP’s public utility subsidiaries’ rates are regulated by the FERC and state regulatory commissions in the eleven state\noperating territories in which they operate. The FERC also regulates the Registrants’ affiliated transactions, including AEPSC\nintercompany service billings which are generally at cost, under the 2005 Public Utility Holding Company Act and the Federal\nPower Act. The FERC also has jurisdiction over certain issuances and acquisitions of securities of the public utility\nsubsidiaries, the acquisition or sale of certain utility assets and mergers with another electric utility or holding company. The\nstate regulatory commissions also regulate certain intercompany transactions under various orders and affiliate statutes. Both\nthe FERC and state regulatory commissions are permitted to review and audit the relevant books and records of companies\nwithin a public utility holding company system.\nThe FERC regulates wholesale power markets and wholesale power transactions. The Registrants’ wholesale power\ntransactions are generally market-based. Wholesale power transactions are cost-based regulated when a cost-based contract is\nnegotiated and filed with the FERC or the FERC determines that the Registrants have “market power” in the region where the\ntransaction occurs. Wholesale power supply contracts have been entered into with various municipalities and cooperatives that\nare FERC-regulated, cost-based contracts. These contracts are generally formula rate mechanisms, which are trued-up to actual\ncosts annually.\nThe state regulatory commissions regulate all of the retail distribution operations and rates of the Registrants’ retail public\nutility subsidiaries on a cost basis. The state regulatory commissions also regulate the retail generation/power supply operations\nand rates except in Ohio and the ERCOT region of Texas. For generation in Ohio, customers who have not switched to a CRES\nprovider for generation pay market-based auction rates. In addition, all OPCo distribution customers continue to pay for certain\nlegacy deferred generation-related costs through PUCO approved riders. In the ERCOT region of Texas, the generation/supply\nbusiness is under customer choice and market pricing is conducted by REPs. AEP has one active REP in ERCOT. AEP’s\nnonregulated subsidiaries enter into short and long-term wholesale transactions to buy or sell capacity, energy and ancillary\nservices in the ERCOT market.\nThe FERC also regulates the Registrants’ wholesale transmission operations and rates. Retail transmission rates are based upon\nthe FERC OATT rate when retail rates are unbundled in connection with restructuring. Retail transmission rates are based on\nformula rates included in the PJM OATT that are cost-based and are unbundled in Ohio for OPCo, in Virginia for APCo and in\nMichigan for I&M. AEP Texas’ retail transmission rates in Texas are unbundled but the retail transmission rates are regulated,\non a cost basis, by the PUCT. Bundled retail transmission rates are regulated, on a cost basis, by the state commissions.\nTransmission rates for AEPTCo’s seven wholly-owned transmission subsidiaries within the AEP Transmission Holdco segment\nare based on formula rates included in the applicable RTO’s OATT that are cost-based.\nIn West Virginia, APCo and WPCo provide retail electric service at bundled rates approved by the WVPSC, with rates set on a\ncombined cost-of-service basis.\n175\nIn addition, the FERC regulates the Operating Agreement, TA and TCA, all of which allocate shared system costs and revenues\namong the utility subsidiaries that are parties to each agreement. The FERC also regulates the PCA. See Note 16 - Related\nParty Transactions for additional information.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nAEP’s consolidated financial statements include its wholly-owned subsidiaries and VIEs, of which AEP is the primary\nbeneficiary. The consolidated financial statements for AEP Texas include the Registrant Subsidiary, its wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries, Transition Funding (a consolidated VIE) and Restoration Funding (a consolidated VIE). The consolidated\nfinancial statements for APCo include the Registrant Subsidiary, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and Appalachian Consumer\nRate Relief Funding (a consolidated VIE). The consolidated financial statements for I&M include the Registrant Subsidiary, its\nwholly-owned subsidiaries and DCC Fuel (consolidated VIEs). The consolidated financial statements for SWEPCo include the\nRegistrant Subsidiary, its wholly-owned subsidiary and Sabine (a consolidated VIE). Intercompany items are eliminated in\nconsolidation.\nThe equity method of accounting is used for equity investments where the Registrants exercise significant influence but do not\nhold a controlling financial interest. Such investments are initially recorded at cost in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent\nAssets on the balance sheets. The proportionate share of the investee’s equity earnings or losses is included in Equity Earnings\nof Unconsolidated Subsidiaries on the statements of income.\nAEP, I&M, PSO and SWEPCo have undivided ownership interests in generating units that are jointly-owned. The\nproportionate share of the operating costs associated with such facilities is included on the income statements and the assets and\nliabilities are reflected on the balance sheets. See Note 17 - Variable Interest Entities and Equity Method Investments and Note\n18 - Property, Plant and Equipment for additional information.\nAccounting for the Effects of Cost-Based Regulation\nThe Registrants’ financial statements reflect the actions of regulators that result in the recognition of certain revenues and\nexpenses in different time periods than enterprises that are not rate-regulated. In accordance with accounting guidance for\n“Regulated Operations,” regulatory assets (deferred expenses) and regulatory liabilities (deferred revenue reductions or refunds)\nare recorded to reflect the economic effects of regulation in the same accounting period by matching expenses with their\nrecovery through regulated revenues and by matching income with its passage to customers in cost-based regulated rates.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates include, but\nare not limited to, inventory valuation, allowance for doubtful accounts, goodwill, intangible and long-lived asset impairment,\nunbilled electricity revenue, valuation of long-term energy contracts, the effects of regulation, long-lived asset recovery, storm\ncosts, the effects of contingencies and certain assumptions made in accounting for pension and postretirement benefits. The\nestimates and assumptions used are based upon management’s evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances as of the date\nof the financial statements. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and Cash Equivalents include temporary cash investments with original maturities of three months or less.\nRestricted Cash (Applies to AEP, AEP Texas and APCo)\nRestricted Cash primarily includes funds held by trustees for the payment of securitization bonds.\n176\nReconciliation of Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash reported within the balance sheets\nthat sum to the total of the same amounts shown on the statement of cash flows:\nDecember 31, 2023\nAEP AEP Texas APCo\n(in millions)\nCash and Cash Equivalents $ 330.1 $ 0.1 $ 5.0\nRestricted Cash 48.9 34.0 14.9\nTotal Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash $ 379.0 $ 34.1 $ 19.9\nDecember 31, 2022\nAEP AEP Texas APCo\n(in millions)\nCash and Cash Equivalents $ 509.4 $ 0.1 $ 7.5\nRestricted Cash 47.1 32.7 14.4\nTotal Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash $ 556.5 $ 32.8 $ 21.9\nOther Temporary Investments (Applies to AEP)\nOther Temporary Investments primarily include marketable securities and investments by its protected cell of EIS. These\nsecurities have readily determinable fair values and are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net\nincome. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification or weighted-average cost method. See “Fair Value\nMeasurements of Other Temporary Investments” section of Note 11 for additional information.\nInventory\nFossil fuel inventories are carried at average cost with the exception of AGR, which carries these inventories at the lower of\naverage cost or net realizable value. Materials and supplies inventories are carried at average cost.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts\nCustomer accounts receivable primarily include receivables from wholesale and retail energy customers, receivables from\nenergy contract counterparties related to risk management activities and customer receivables primarily related to other\nrevenue-generating activities.\nRevenue is recognized over time as the performance obligations of delivering energy to customers are satisfied. To the extent\nthat deliveries have occurred but a bill has not been issued, the Registrants accrue and recognize, as Accrued Unbilled Revenues\non the balance sheets, an estimate of the revenues for energy delivered since the last billing.\nAEP Credit factors accounts receivable on a daily basis, excluding receivables from risk management activities, through\npurchase agreements with I&M, KGPCo, KPCo, OPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and a portion of APCo. Since APCo does not have\nregulatory authority to sell accounts receivable in its West Virginia regulatory jurisdiction, only a portion of APCo’s accounts\nreceivable are sold to AEP Credit. AEP Credit has a receivables securitization agreement with bank conduits. Under the\nsecuritization agreement, AEP Credit receives financing from bank conduits for a portion of its interests in the billed and\nunbilled receivables acquired from the affiliated utility subsidiaries. See “Securitized Accounts Receivable – AEP Credit”\nsection of Note 14 for additional information.\nGenerally, AEP Credit recognizes bad debt expense based upon a 12-month rolling average of bad debt write-offs in proportion\nto gross accounts receivable purchased from participating AEP subsidiaries. The assessment is performed separately for each\nparticipating AEP subsidiary, which inherently contemplates any differences in geographical risk characteristics for the\nallowance for uncollectible accounts. From January 2022 through August 2023, KPCo ceased selling accounts receivable to\nAEP Credit due to the planned sale of KPCo to Liberty. During this time period, KPCo recognized an allowance for\nuncollectible accounts on its balance sheet for its accounts receivables using the same assessment methodology used for AEP\nCredit’s receivables. In September 2023, KPCo resumed selling accounts receivable to AEP Credit, due to the termination of\nthe sale to Liberty. For receivables related to APCo’s West Virginia operations, the allowance for uncollectible accounts is\ncalculated based on a rolling two-year average write-off in proportion to gross accounts receivable.\n177\nFor customer accounts receivables relating to risk management activities, accounts receivable are reviewed for potential credit\nlosses at a specific counterparty level basis. For AEP Texas, allowances for uncollectible accounts are calculated using the\nspecific identification of receivable balances greater than 120 days delinquent, and for those balances less than 120 days where\nthe collection is doubtful. For miscellaneous accounts receivable, bad debt expense is recognized based upon a 12-month\nrolling average of bad debt write-offs in proportion to gross accounts receivable, unless specifically identified.\nIn addition to these processes, management contemplates available current information, as well as any reasonable and\nsupportable forecast information, to determine if allowances for uncollectible accounts should be further adjusted in accordance\nwith the accounting guidance for “Credit Losses.” Management’s assessments contemplate expected losses over the life of the\naccounts receivable.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers (Applies to Registrant Subsidiaries)\nAPCo, I&M, OPCo, PSO and SWEPCo do not have any significant customers that comprise 10% or more of their operating\nrevenues. AEP Texas had significant customers which account for the following percentages of Total Revenues for the years\nended December 31 and Accounts Receivable – Customers as of December 31:\nSignificant Customers of AEP Texas:\nNRG Energy and TXU Energy 2023 2022 2021\nPercentage of Total Revenues 41 % 45 % 43 %\nPercentage of Accounts Receivable – Customers 34 % 42 % 41 %\nAEPTCo had significant transactions with AEP Subsidiaries which on a combined basis account for the following percentages\nof Total Revenues for the years ended December 31 and Total Accounts Receivable as of December 31:\nSignificant Customers of AEPTCo:\nAEP Subsidiaries 2023 2022 2021\nPercentage of Total Revenues 79 % 79 % 79 %\nPercentage of Total Accounts Receivable 60 % 72 % 81 %\nThe Registrant Subsidiaries monitor credit levels and the financial condition of their customers on a continuous basis to\nminimize credit risk. The regulatory commissions allow recovery in rates for a reasonable level of bad debt\ncosts. Management believes adequate provisions for credit loss have been made in the accompanying Registrant Subsidiary\nfinancial statements.\nRenewable Energy Credits (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas and AEPTCo)\nIn regulated jurisdictions, the Registrants record renewable energy credits (RECs) at cost. For AEP’s competitive generation\nbusiness, management records RECs at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Registrants follow the inventory model\nfor these RECs. RECs expected to be consumed within one year are reported in Materials and Supplies on the balance\nsheets. RECs with expected consumption beyond one year are included in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets on\nthe balance sheets. The purchases and sales of RECs are reported in the Operating Activities section of the statements of cash\nflows. RECs that are consumed to meet applicable state renewable portfolio standards are recorded in Fuel and Other\nConsumables Used for Electric Generation at an average cost on the statements of income. The net margin on sales of RECs\naffects the determination of deferred fuel and REC costs.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nRegulated\nElectric utility property, plant and equipment for rate-regulated operations are stated at original cost. Additions, major\nreplacements and betterments are added to the plant accounts. Under the group composite method of depreciation, continuous\ninterim routine replacements of items such as boiler tubes, pumps, motors, etc. result in original cost retirements, less salvage,\nbeing charged to accumulated depreciation. The group composite method of depreciation assumes that on average, asset\ncomponents are retired at the end of their useful lives and thus there is no gain or loss. The equipment in each primary electric\nplant account is identified as a separate group. The depreciation rates that are established take into account the past history of\ninterim capital replacements and the amount of removal cost incurred and salvage received. These rates and the related lives\nare subject to periodic review. Removal costs accrued are typically recorded as regulatory liabilities when the revenue received\nfor removal costs accrued exceeds actual removal costs incurred. The asset removal costs liability is relieved as removal costs\nare incurred. A regulatory asset balance will occur if actual removal costs incurred exceed accumulated removal costs accrued.\n178\nThe costs of labor, materials and overhead incurred to operate and maintain plant and equipment are included in operating\nexpenses.\nNuclear fuel, including nuclear fuel in the fabrication phase, is included in Other Property, Plant and Equipment on the balance\nsheets.\nLong-lived assets are required to be tested for impairment when it is determined that the carrying value of the assets may no\nlonger be recoverable or when the assets meet the held-for-sale criteria under the accounting guidance for “Impairment or\nDisposal of Long-Lived Assets.” When it becomes probable that an asset in-service or an asset under construction will be\nabandoned and regulatory cost recovery has been disallowed or is not probable, the cost of that asset shall be written down to its\nthen current estimated fair value, with the change charged to expense, and the asset is removed from plant-in-service or CWIP.\nThe fair value of an asset is the amount at which that asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing\nparties, as opposed to a forced or liquidation sale. Quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value\nand are used as the basis for the measurement, if available. In the absence of quoted prices for identical or similar assets in\nactive markets, fair value is estimated using various internal and external valuation methods including cash flow analysis and\nappraisals.\nNonregulated\nNonregulated operations generally follow the policies of rate-regulated operations listed above but with the following\nexceptions. Property, plant and equipment of nonregulated operations are stated at original cost (or as adjusted for any\napplicable impairments) plus the original cost of property acquired or constructed since the acquisition, less disposals. Normal\nand routine retirements from the plant accounts, net of salvage, are charged to accumulated depreciation for most nonregulated\noperations under the group composite method of depreciation. A gain or loss would be recorded if the retirement is not\nconsidered an interim routine replacement. Removal costs are charged to expense.\nAllowance for Funds Used During Construction and Interest Capitalization\nFor regulated operations, AFUDC represents the estimated cost of borrowed and equity funds used to finance construction\nprojects that is capitalized and recovered through depreciation over the service life of regulated electric utility plant. The\nRegistrants record the equity component of AFUDC in Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction and the debt\ncomponent of AFUDC as a reduction to Interest Expense on the statements of income. For nonregulated operations, including\ncertain generating assets, interest is capitalized during construction in accordance with the accounting guidance for\n“Capitalization of Interest.”\nAsset Retirement Obligations (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo)\nThe Registrants record ARO in accordance with the accounting guidance for “Asset Retirement and Environmental\nObligations” for legal obligations for asbestos removal and for the retirement of certain ash disposal facilities, wind farms, solar\nfarms and certain coal-mining facilities. I&M records ARO for the decommissioning of the Cook Plant. AROs are computed\nas the present value of the estimated costs associated with the future retirement of an asset and are recorded in the period in\nwhich the liability is incurred. Estimates of the timing and amounts of future cash outlays are based on projections of when and\nhow the assets will be decommissioned, inflation, and discount rate, which may change significantly over time. The estimated\ncosts are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. The Registrants have\nidentified, but not recognized, ARO liabilities related to electric transmission and distribution assets as a result of certain\neasements on property on which assets are owned. Generally, such easements are perpetual and require only the retirement and\nremoval of assets upon the cessation of the property’s use. The retirement obligation is not estimable for such easements since\nthe Registrants plan to use their facilities indefinitely. The retirement obligation would only be recognized if and when the\nRegistrants abandon or cease the use of specific easements, which is not expected.\nValuation of Nonderivative Financial Instruments\nThe book values of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Advances to/from Affiliates, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable and\nShort-term Debt approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.\n179\nFair Value Measurements of Assets and Liabilities (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo)\nThe accounting guidance for “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the\ninputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for\nidentical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3\nmeasurement). Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is\ncategorized in Level 2. When quoted market prices are not available, pricing may be completed using comparable securities,\ndealer values, operating data and general market conditions to determine fair value. Valuation models utilize various inputs\nsuch as commodity, interest rate and, to a lesser degree, volatility and credit that include quoted prices for similar assets or\nliabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, market corroborated\ninputs (i.e. inputs derived principally from, or correlated to, observable market data) and other observable inputs for the asset or\nliability.\nFor commercial activities, exchange-traded derivatives, namely futures contracts, are generally fair valued based on unadjusted\nquoted prices in active markets and are classified as Level 1. Level 2 inputs primarily consist of OTC broker quotes in\nmoderately active or less active markets, as well as exchange-traded derivatives where there is insufficient market liquidity to\nwarrant inclusion in Level 1. Management verifies price curves using these broker quotes and classifies these fair values within\nLevel 2 when substantially all of the fair value can be corroborated. Management typically obtains multiple broker quotes,\nwhich are nonbinding in nature but are based on recent trades in the marketplace. When multiple broker quotes are obtained,\nthe quoted bid and ask prices are averaged. In certain circumstances, a broker quote may be discarded if it is a clear\noutlier. Management uses a historical correlation analysis between the broker quoted location and the illiquid locations. If the\npoints are highly correlated, these locations are included within Level 2 as well. Certain OTC and bilaterally executed\nderivative instruments are executed in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information. Illiquid transactions,\ncomplex structured transactions, FTRs and counterparty credit risk may require nonmarket-based inputs. Some of these inputs\nmay be internally developed or extrapolated and utilized to estimate fair value. When such inputs have a significant impact on\nthe measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized as Level 3. The main driver of contracts being classified as Level 3\nis the inability to substantiate energy price curves in the market. A portion of the Level 3 instruments have been economically\nhedged which limits potential earnings volatility.\nAEP utilizes its trustee’s external pricing service to estimate the fair value of the underlying investments held in the benefit plan\nand nuclear trusts. AEP’s investment managers review and validate the prices utilized by the trustee to determine fair\nvalue. AEP’s management performs its own valuation testing to verify the fair values of the securities. AEP receives audit\nreports of the trustee’s operating controls and valuation processes.\nAssets in the benefits and nuclear trusts, cash and cash equivalents, other temporary investments and restricted cash for\nsecuritized funding are classified using the following methods. Equities are classified as Level 1 holdings if they are actively\ntraded on exchanges. Items classified as Level 1 are investments in money market funds, fixed income and equity mutual funds\nand equity securities. They are valued based on observable inputs, primarily unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for\nidentical assets. Items classified as Level 2 are primarily investments in individual fixed income securities. Fixed income\nsecurities generally do not trade on exchanges and do not have an official closing price but their valuation inputs are based on\nobservable market data. Pricing vendors calculate bond valuations using financial models and matrices. The models use\nobservable inputs including yields on benchmark securities, quotes by securities brokers, rating agency actions, discounts or\npremiums on securities compared to par prices, changes in yields for U.S. Treasury securities, corporate actions by bond\nissuers, prepayment schedules and histories, economic events and, for certain securities, adjustments to yields to reflect changes\nin the rate of inflation. Other securities with model-derived valuation inputs that are observable are also classified as Level 2\ninvestments. Investments with unobservable valuation inputs are classified as Level 3 investments. Investments classified as\nOther are valued using Net Asset Value as a practical expedient. Items classified as Other are primarily cash equivalent funds,\ncommon collective trusts, commingled funds, structured products, private equity, real estate, infrastructure and alternative credit\ninvestments. These investments do not have a readily determinable fair value or they contain redemption restrictions which\nmay include the right to suspend redemptions under certain circumstances. Redemption restrictions may also prevent certain\ninvestments from being redeemed at the reporting date for the underlying value.\nDeferred Fuel Costs (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)\nThe cost of purchased electricity, fuel and related emission allowances and emission control chemicals/consumables is charged\nto Purchased Electricity, Fuel and Other Consumables Used for Electric Generation expense when the fuel is burned or the\nallowance or consumable is utilized. The cost of fuel also includes the cost of nuclear fuel burned which is computed primarily\nusing the units-of-production method. In regulated jurisdictions with an active FAC, fuel cost over-recoveries (the excess of\n180\nfuel-related revenues over applicable fuel costs incurred) are generally deferred as current regulatory liabilities and under-\nrecoveries (the excess of applicable fuel costs incurred over fuel-related revenues) are generally deferred as current regulatory\nassets. Fuel cost over-recovery and under-recovery balances are classified as noncurrent when there is an expectation that\nrefunds or recoveries will extend beyond a one year period, based on a company’s filing with a commission or a commission\ndirective. These deferrals are incorporated into the development of future fuel rates billed to or refunded to customers. The\namount of an over-recovery or under-recovery can also be affected by actions of the state regulatory commissions. On a routine\nbasis, state regulatory commissions review and/or audit the Registrants’ fuel procurement policies and practices, the fuel cost\ncalculations and FAC deferrals. FAC deferrals are adjusted when costs are no longer probable of recovery or when refunds of\nfuel reserves are probable. The Registrants share the majority of their Off-system Sales margins to customers either through an\nactive FAC or other rate mechanisms. Where the FAC or Off-system Sales sharing mechanism is capped, frozen, non-existent\nor applicable to merchant operations, changes in fuel costs or sharing of Off-system Sales impact earnings.\nRevenue Recognition\nRegulatory Accounting\nThe Registrants’ financial statements reflect the actions of regulators that can result in the recognition of revenues and expenses\nin different time periods than enterprises that are not rate-regulated. Regulatory assets (deferred expenses or alternative\nrevenues recognized in accordance with the guidance for “Regulated Operations”) and regulatory liabilities (deferred revenue\nreductions or refunds) are recorded to reflect the economic effects of regulation in the same accounting period by matching\nexpenses with their recovery through regulated revenues and by matching revenue with its passage to customers in cost-based\nregulated rates.\nWhen regulatory assets are probable of recovery through regulated rates, assets are recorded on the balance sheets. Regulatory\nassets are reviewed for probability of recovery at each balance sheet date or whenever new events occur. Examples of new\nevents include the issuance of a regulatory commission order or passage of new legislation. If it is determined that recovery of\na regulatory asset is no longer probable, the regulatory asset is derecognized as a charge against income.\nRetail and Wholesale Supply and Delivery of Electricity\nThe Registrants recognize revenues from customers for retail and wholesale electricity sales and electricity transmission and\ndistribution delivery services. The Registrants recognize such revenues on the statements of income as the performance\nobligations of delivering energy to customers are satisfied. Recognized revenues include both billed and unbilled amounts. In\naccordance with the applicable state commission’s regulatory treatment, PSO and SWEPCo do not include the fuel portion in\nunbilled revenue, but rather recognize such revenues when billed to customers.\nWholesale transmission revenue is based on FERC-approved formula rate filings made for each calendar year using estimated\ncosts. Revenues initially recognized per the annual rate filing are compared to actual costs, resulting in the subsequent\nrecognition of an over or under-recovered amount, with interest, that is refunded or recovered, respectively, in a future year’s\nrates. These annual true-ups meet the definition of alternative revenues in accordance with the accounting guidance for\n“Regulated Operations”. An estimated annual true-up is recorded by the Registrants in the fourth quarter of each calendar year\nand a final annual true-up is recognized by the Registrants in the second quarter of each calendar year following the filing of\nannual FERC reports. Any portion of the true-ups applicable to an affiliated company is recorded as Accounts Receivable -\nAffiliated Companies or Accounts Payable - Affiliated Companies on the balance sheets. Any portion of the true-ups\napplicable to third-parties is recorded as Regulatory Assets or Regulatory Liabilities on the balance sheets. See Note 19 -\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers for additional information.\nGross versus Net Presentation of Certain Electricity Supply and Delivery Activities\nMost of the power produced at the generation plants is sold to PJM or SPP. The Registrants also purchase power from PJM and\nSPP to supply power to customers. Generally, these power sales and purchases are reported on a net basis as revenues on the\nstatements of income. However, purchases of power in excess of sales to PJM or SPP, on an hourly net basis, used to serve\nretail load are recorded gross as Purchased Electricity on the statements of income. With the exception of certain dedicated\nload bilateral power supply contracts, the transactions of AEP’s nonregulated subsidiaries are reported as gross purchases or\nsales.\n181\nPhysical energy purchases arising from non-derivative contracts are accounted for on a gross basis in Purchased Electricity for\nResale on the statements of income. Energy purchases arising from non-trading derivative contracts are recorded based on the\ntransaction’s facts and circumstances. Certain derivatives that economically hedge future commodity risk are recorded in the\nsame line item on the statements of income as that of the associated risk being hedged. Realized gains and losses on cash flow\nhedges are recorded in Total Revenues or Purchased Electricity depending on the nature of the risk being hedged. Derivative\npurchases elected normal used to serve accrual based obligations are recorded in Purchased Electricity on the statements of\nincome. All other non-trading derivative purchases are recorded net in revenues.\nIn general, the Registrants record expenses when purchased electricity is received and when expenses are incurred, with the\nexception of certain power purchase contracts that are derivatives and accounted for using MTM accounting where generation/\nsupply rates are not cost-based regulated. In jurisdictions where the generation/supply business is subject to cost-based\nregulation, the unrealized MTM amounts are deferred as regulatory assets (for losses) and regulatory liabilities (for gains).\nEnergy Marketing and Risk Management Activities (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo)\nThe Registrants engage in power, capacity and, to a lesser extent, natural gas marketing as major power producers and\nparticipants in electricity and natural gas markets. The Registrants also engage in power, capacity, coal, natural gas and, to a\nlesser extent, heating oil, gasoline and other commodity risk management activities focused on markets where the AEP System\nowns assets and on adjacent markets. These activities include the purchase-and-sale of energy under forward contracts at fixed\nand variable prices. These contracts include physical transactions, exchange-traded futures, and to a lesser extent, OTC swaps\nand options. Certain energy marketing and risk management transactions are with RTOs.\nThe Registrants recognize revenues from marketing and risk management transactions that are not derivatives as the\nperformance obligation of delivering the commodity is satisfied. Expenses from marketing and risk management transactions\nthat are not derivatives are also recognized upon delivery of the commodity.\nThe Registrants use MTM accounting for marketing and risk management transactions that are derivatives unless the derivative\nis designated in a qualifying cash flow hedge relationship or elected normal under the normal purchase normal sale election.\nUnrealized MTM gains and losses are included on the balance sheets as Risk Management Assets or Liabilities, as appropriate,\nand on the statements of income in Total Revenues. Realized gains and losses on marketing and risk management transactions\nare included in revenues or expenses based on the transaction’s facts and circumstances. However, in regulated jurisdictions\nsubject to cost-based regulation, unrealized MTM amounts and some realized gains and losses are deferred as regulatory assets\n(for losses) and regulatory liabilities (for gains).\nCertain qualifying marketing and risk management derivatives transactions are designated as hedges of variability in future cash\nflows as a result of forecasted transactions (cash flow hedge). In the event the Registrants designate a cash flow hedge, the cash\nflow hedge’s gain or loss is initially recorded as a component of AOCI. When the forecasted transaction is realized and affects\nnet income, the Registrants subsequently reclassify the gain or loss on the hedge from AOCI into revenues or expenses within\nthe same financial statement line item as the forecasted transaction on their statements of income. See “Accounting for Cash\nFlow Hedging Strategies” section of Note 10 for additional information.\nLevelization of Nuclear Refueling Outage Costs (Applies to AEP and I&M)\nIn accordance with regulatory orders, I&M defers incremental operation and maintenance costs associated with periodic\nrefueling outages at its Cook Plant and amortizes the costs over approximately 18 months, beginning with the month following\nthe start of each unit’s refueling outage and lasting until the end of the month in which the same unit’s next scheduled refueling\noutage begins.\nMaintenance\nThe Registrants expense maintenance costs as incurred. If it becomes probable that the Registrants will recover specifically-\nincurred costs through future rates, a regulatory asset is established to match the expensing of those maintenance costs with\ntheir recovery in cost-based regulated revenues. In certain regulated jurisdictions, the Registrants defer costs above the level\nincluded in base rates and amortize those deferrals commensurate with recovery through rate riders.\n182\nIncome Taxes and Investment and Production Tax Credits\nThe Registrants use the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred income taxes are\nprovided for all temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities which will result in a future tax\nconsequence. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the\nyears in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.\nWhen the flow-through method of accounting for temporary differences is required by a regulator to be reflected in regulated\nrevenues (that is, when deferred taxes are not included in the cost-of-service for determining regulated rates for electricity),\ndeferred income taxes are recorded and related regulatory assets and liabilities are established to match the regulated revenues\nand tax expense.\nAEP and subsidiaries apply the deferral methodology for the recognition of ITCs. Deferred ITCs are amortized to income tax\nexpense over the life of the asset that generated the credit. Amortization of deferred ITCs begins when the asset is placed in-\nservice, except where regulatory commissions reflect ITCs in the rate-making process, then amortization begins when the utility\nis able to utilize the ITC on a stand-alone basis. Alternatively, PTCs reduce income tax expense as they are earned. PTCs are\nearned when electricity is produced.\nTransferable tax credits established by the IRA are accounted for in accordance with the accounting guidance for “Income\nTaxes” by the Registrants. Proceeds from sales of transferable tax credits are included as a component of Operating Activities\non the statement of cash flows and presented as gross within the Supplementary Cash Flow Information.\nThe Registrants account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the accounting guidance for “Income Taxes.” The\nRegistrants classify interest expense or income related to uncertain tax positions as interest expense or income as appropriate\nand classify penalties as Other Operation expense on the statements of income.\nAEP and subsidiaries join in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return. The benefit of current tax loss of the parent\ncompany (Parent Company Loss Benefit) to the AEP System subsidiaries is accounted for as an allocation through equity. The\nconsolidated NOL of the AEP System is allocated to each company in the consolidated group with taxable loss. With the\nexception of the allocation of the consolidated AEP System NOL, the loss of the Parent and tax credits, the method of\nallocation reflects a separate return result for each company in the consolidated group.\nExcise Taxes (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo)\nAs agents for some state and local governments, the Registrants collect from customers certain excise taxes levied by those\nstate or local governments on customers. The Registrants do not record these taxes as revenue or expense.\nDebt\nGains and losses from the reacquisition of debt used to finance regulated electric utility plants are deferred and amortized over\nthe remaining term of the reacquired debt in accordance with their rate-making treatment unless the debt is refinanced. If the\nreacquired debt associated with the regulated business is refinanced, the reacquisition costs attributable to the portions of the\nbusiness that are subject to cost-based regulatory accounting are generally deferred and amortized over the term of the\nreplacement debt consistent with its recovery in rates. Operations not subject to cost-based rate regulation report gains and\nlosses on the reacquisition of debt in Interest Expense on the statements of income upon reacquisition.\nDebt discounts, premiums and debt issuance expenses are deferred and amortized generally utilizing the straight-line method\nover the term of the related debt. The straight-line method approximates the effective interest method and is consistent with the\ntreatment in rates for regulated operations. The net amortization expense is included in Interest Expense on the statements of\nincome.\nPension and OPEB Plans (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo)\nAEPSC sponsors a qualified pension plan and two unfunded non-qualified pension plans. Substantially all AEP subsidiary\nemployees are covered by the qualified plan or both the qualified and a non-qualified pension plan. AEPSC also sponsors\nOPEB plans to provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees. The Registrant Subsidiaries account for their\nparticipation in the AEPSC sponsored pension and OPEB plans using multiple-employer accounting. See Note 8 - Benefit\nPlans for additional information including significant accounting policies associated with the plans.\n183\nInvestments Held in Trust for Future Liabilities (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo)\nAEP has several trust funds with significant investments intended to provide for future payments of pension and OPEB\nbenefits, nuclear decommissioning and SNF disposal. All of the trust funds’ investments are diversified and managed in\ncompliance with all laws and regulations. The investment strategy for the trust funds is to use a diversified portfolio of\ninvestments to achieve an acceptable rate of return while managing the investment risk of the assets relative to the associated\nliabilities. To minimize investment risk, the trust funds are broadly diversified among classes of assets, investment strategies\nand investment managers. Management regularly reviews the actual asset allocations and periodically rebalances the\ninvestments to targeted allocations when appropriate. Investment policies and guidelines allow investment managers in\napproved strategies to use financial derivatives to obtain or manage market exposures and to hedge assets and liabilities. The\ninvestments are reported at fair value under the “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” accounting guidance.\nBenefit Plans\nAll benefit plan assets are invested in accordance with each plan’s investment policy. The investment policy outlines the\ninvestment objectives, strategies and target asset allocations by plan.\nThe investment philosophies for AEP’s benefit plans support the allocation of assets to minimize risks and optimize net\nreturns. Strategies used include:\n• Maintaining a long-term investment horizon.\n• Diversifying assets to help control volatility of returns at acceptable levels.\n• Managing fees, transaction costs and tax liabilities to maximize investment earnings.\n• Using active management of investments where appropriate risk/return opportunities exist.\n• Keeping portfolio structure style-neutral to limit volatility compared to applicable benchmarks.\n• Using alternative asset classes such as real estate and private equity to maximize return and provide additional\nportfolio diversification.\nThe objective of the investment policy for the pension fund is to maintain the funded status of the plan while providing for\ngrowth in the plan assets to offset the growth in the plan liabilities. The current target asset allocations are as follows:\nPension Plan Assets Target\nEquity 30 %\nFixed Income 54 %\nOther Investments 15 %\nCash and Cash Equivalents 1 %\nOPEB Plans Assets Target\nEquity 58 %\nFixed Income 41 %\nCash and Cash Equivalents 1 %\nThe investment policy for each benefit plan contains various investment limitations. The investment policies establish\nconcentration limits for securities and prohibit the purchase of securities issued by AEP (with the exception of proportionate\nand immaterial holdings of AEP securities in passive index strategies or certain commingled funds). However, the investment\npolicies do not preclude the benefit trust funds from receiving contributions in the form of AEP securities, provided that the\nAEP securities acquired by each plan may not exceed the limitations imposed by law.\nFor equity investments, the concentration limits are generally as follows:\n• No security in excess of 5% of all equities.\n• Cash equivalents must be less than 10% of an investment manager’s equity portfolio.\n• No individual stock may be more than 10% and 7% for pension and OPEB investments, respectively, of each\nmanager’s equity portfolio.\n• No securities may be bought or sold on margin or other use of leverage.\nFor fixed income investments, each investment manager’s portfolio is compared to investment grade, diversified long and\nintermediate benchmark indices.\n184\nA portion of the pension assets is invested in real estate funds to provide diversification, add return and hedge against\ninflation. Real estate properties are illiquid, difficult to value and not actively traded. The pension plan uses external real estate\ninvestment managers to invest in commingled funds that hold real estate properties. To mitigate investment risk in the real\nestate portfolio, commingled real estate funds are used to ensure that holdings are diversified by region, property type and risk\nclassification. Real estate holdings include core, value-added and opportunistic classifications.\nA portion of the pension assets is invested in private equity. Private equity investments add return and provide diversification\nand typically require a long-term time horizon to evaluate investment performance. Private equity is classified as an alternative\ninvestment because it is illiquid, difficult to value and not actively traded. The pension plan uses limited partnerships to invest\nacross the private equity investment spectrum. The private equity holdings are with multiple general partners who help monitor\nthe investments and provide investment selection expertise. The holdings are currently comprised of venture capital, buyout\nand hybrid debt and equity investments.\nAEP participates in a securities lending program with BNY Mellon to provide incremental income on idle assets and to provide\nincome to offset custody fees and other administrative expenses. AEP lends securities to borrowers approved by BNY Mellon\nin exchange for collateral. All loans are collateralized by at least 102% of the loaned asset’s market value and the collateral is\ninvested. The difference between the rebate owed to the borrower and the collateral rate of return determines the earnings on\nthe loaned security. The securities lending program’s objective is to provide modest incremental income with a limited increase\nin risk. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair value of securities on loan as part of the program was $62 million and $83\nmillion, respectively. Cash and securities obtained as collateral exceeded the fair value of the securities loaned as of December\n31, 2023 and 2022.\nTrust owned life insurance (TOLI) underwritten by The Prudential Insurance Company is held in the OPEB plan trusts. The\nstrategy for holding life insurance contracts in the taxable Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association trust is to minimize\ntaxes paid on the asset growth in the trust. Earnings on plan assets are tax-deferred within the TOLI contract and can be tax-\nfree if held until claims are paid. Life insurance proceeds remain in the trust and are used to fund future retiree medical benefit\nliabilities. With consideration to other investments held in the trust, the cash value of the TOLI contracts is invested in two\ndiversified funds. A portion is invested in a commingled fund with underlying investments in stocks that are actively traded on\nmajor international equity exchanges. The other portion of the TOLI cash value is invested in a diversified, commingled fixed\nincome fund with underlying investments in government bonds, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities.\nCash and cash equivalents are held in each trust to provide liquidity and meet short-term cash needs. Cash equivalent funds are\nused to provide diversification and preserve principal. The underlying holdings in the cash funds are investment grade money\nmarket instruments including commercial paper, certificates of deposit, treasury bills and other types of investment grade short-\nterm debt securities. The cash funds are valued each business day and provide daily liquidity.\nNuclear Trust Funds (Applies to AEP and I&M)\nNuclear decommissioning and SNF trust funds represent funds that regulatory commissions allow I&M to collect through rates\nto fund future decommissioning and SNF disposal liabilities. By rules or orders, the IURC, the MPSC and the FERC\nestablished investment limitations and general risk management guidelines. In general, limitations include:\n• Acceptable investments (rated investment grade or above when purchased).\n• Maximum percentage invested in a specific type of investment.\n• Prohibition of investment in obligations of AEP, I&M or their affiliates.\n• Withdrawals permitted only for payment of decommissioning costs and trust expenses.\nI&M maintains trust funds for each regulatory jurisdiction. Regulatory approval is required to withdraw decommissioning\nfunds. These funds are managed by an external investment manager that must comply with the guidelines and rules of the\napplicable regulatory authorities. The trust assets are invested to optimize the net of tax earnings of the trust giving\nconsideration to liquidity, risk, diversification and other prudent investment objectives.\nI&M records securities held in these trust funds in Spent Nuclear Fuel and Decommissioning Trusts on its balance sheets. I&M\nrecords these securities at fair value. I&M classifies debt securities in the trust funds as available-for-sale due to their long-term\npurpose.\nOther-than-temporary impairments for investments in debt securities are considered realized losses as a result of securities\nbeing managed by an external investment management firm. The external investment management firm makes specific\n185\ninvestment decisions regarding the debt and equity investments held in these trusts and generally intends to sell debt securities\nin an unrealized loss position as part of a tax optimization strategy. Impairments reduce the cost basis of the securities which\nwill affect any future unrealized gain or realized gain or loss due to the adjusted cost of investment. I&M records unrealized\ngains, unrealized losses and other-than-temporary impairments from securities in these trust funds as adjustments to the\nregulatory liability account for the nuclear decommissioning trust funds and to regulatory assets or liabilities for the SNF\ndisposal trust funds in accordance with their treatment in rates. Consequently, changes in fair value of trust assets do not affect\nearnings or AOCI. See the “Nuclear Contingencies” section of Note 6 for additional discussion of nuclear matters. See “Fair\nValue Measurements of Trust Assets for Decommissioning and SNF Disposal” section of Note 11 for disclosure of the fair\nvalue of assets within the trusts.\nComprehensive Income (Loss) (Applies to AEP only)\nComprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity (net assets) of a business enterprise during a period from\ntransactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. It includes all changes in equity during a period\nexcept those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. Comprehensive income (loss) has two\ncomponents: net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss).\nStock-Based Compensation Plans\nAs of December 31, 2023, AEP had performance shares and restricted stock units outstanding under the American Electric\nPower System 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2015 LTIP). Upon vesting, all outstanding performance shares and restricted\nstock units settle in AEP common stock. The impact of AEP’s stock-based compensation plan is insignificant to the financial\nstatements of the Registrant Subsidiaries.\nAEP maintains a variety of tax qualified and non-qualified deferred compensation plans for employees and non-employee\ndirectors that include, among other options, an investment in or an investment return equivalent to that of AEP common\nstock. This includes AEP career shares maintained under the American Electric Power System Stock Ownership Requirement\nPlan (SORP), which facilitates executives in meeting minimum stock ownership requirements assigned to them by the Human\nResources Committee of the Board of Directors. AEP career shares are derived from vested performance shares granted to\nemployees under the 2015 LTIP and previous long-term incentive plans. AEP career shares accrue additional dividend shares\nin an amount equal to dividends paid on AEP common shares at the closing market price on the dividend payments date. All\nAEP career shares are settled in shares of AEP common stock after the executive’s service with AEP ends.\nPerformance shares awarded after January 1, 2017 are classified as temporary equity in the Mezzanine Equity section of the\nbalance sheets until the awards vest. Upon vesting, the performance shares are classified as permanent equity. These awards\nmay be settled in cash upon an employee’s qualifying termination due to a change in control. Because such event is not solely\nwithin the control of the company, these awards are classified outside of permanent equity until the awards vest.\nAEP compensates their non-employee directors, in part, with stock units under the American Electric Power Company, Inc.\nStock Unit Accumulation Plan for Non-Employee Directors. Prior to June 2022, these stock units were payable in cash to\ndirectors after their service ended and are now payable in AEP common stock.\nManagement measures and recognizes compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and directors\nbased on estimated fair values. For share-based payment awards with service only vesting conditions, management recognizes\ncompensation expense on a straight-line basis. Stock-based compensation expense recognized on the statements of income for\nthe years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 is based on the number of outstanding awards at the end of each period\nwithout a reduction for estimated forfeitures. AEP accounts for forfeitures in the period in which they occur.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, compensation costs are included in Net Income for the performance\nshares, career shares, restricted stock units, the non-employee director stock units and other qualified and non-qualified deferred\ncompensation plans that provide an investment in or an investment return equivalent to that of AEP common stock.\nCompensation costs may also be capitalized. See Note 15 - Stock-based Compensation for additional information.\nEquity Method Investments in Unconsolidated Entities (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo)\nThe equity method of accounting is used for equity investments where either AEP or SWEPCo exercise significant influence\nbut do not hold a controlling financial interest. Such investments are initially recorded at cost in Deferred Charges and Other\nNoncurrent Assets on the balance sheets. The proportionate share of the investee’s equity earnings or losses is included in\n186\nEquity Earnings (Loss) of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries on the statements of income. AEP and SWEPCo regularly monitor and\nevaluate equity method investments to determine whether they are impaired. An impairment is recognized when the investment\nhas experienced a loss in value that is other-than-temporary in nature.\nAs of December 31, 2023, AEP’s significant equity method investments include ETT and DHLC. In August 2023, AEP\ndisposed of four joint venture interests as a part of the sale of AEP Renewables’ competitive contracted renewables portfolio.\nPrior to the sale, these joint venture interests were accounted for as equity method investments. See the “Disposition of the\nCompetitive Contracted Renewables Portfolio” section of Note 7 and the “AEP Wind Holdings, LLC ” section of Note 17 for\nadditional information.\nEarnings Per Share (EPS) (Applies to AEP)\nBasic EPS is calculated by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of\ncommon shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is calculated by adjusting the weighted-average outstanding\ncommon shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock awards.\nThe following table presents AEP’s basic and diluted EPS calculations included on the statements of income:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in millions, except per-share data)\n$/share $/share $/share\nEarnings Attributable to AEP Common Shareholders $ 2,208.1 $ 2,307.2 $ 2,488.1\nWeighted-Average Number of Basic AEP Common Shares\nOutstanding 518.9 $ 4.26 511.8 $ 4.51 500.5 $ 4.97\nWeighted-Average Dilutive Effect of Stock-Based Awards 1.3 (0.02) 1.7 (0.02) 1.3 (0.01)\nWeighted-Average Number of Diluted AEP Common\nShares Outstanding 520.2 $ 4.24 513.5 $ 4.49 501.8 $ 4.96\nThere were no antidilutive shares outstanding as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nSupplementary Income Statement Information\nThe following tables provide the components of Depreciation and Amortization for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022\nand 2021:\n2023\nAEP\nDepreciation and Amortization AEP Texas AEPTCo APCo I&M OPCo PSO SWEPCo\n(in millions)\nDepreciation and Amortization of\nProperty, Plant and Equipment $ 2,927.5 $ 380.0 $ 393.8 $ 571.1 $ 439.8 $ 315.8 $ 240.3 $ 323.4\nAmortization of Certain Securitized\nAssets 91.9 91.9 — — — — — —\nAmortization of Regulatory Assets\nand Liabilities 71.0 (3.4) — 0.8 30.2 0.4 15.2 19.4\nTotal Depreciation and\nAmortization $ 3,090.4 $ 468.5 $ 393.8 $ 571.9 $ 470.0 $ 316.2 $ 255.5 $ 342.8\n2022\nAEP\nDepreciation and Amortization AEP Texas AEPTCo APCo I&M OPCo PSO SWEPCo\n(in millions)\nDepreciation and Amortization of\nProperty, Plant and Equipment $ 3,072.8 $ 363.5 $ 346.2 $ 576.1 $ 511.9 $ 293.1 $ 226.2 $ 319.3\nAmortization of Certain Securitized\nAssets 93.3 93.3 — — — — — —\nAmortization of Regulatory Assets\nand Liabilities 36.7 (4.4) — (0.2) 15.3 1.2 3.9 5.5\nTotal Depreciation and\nAmortization $ 3,202.8 $ 452.4 $ 346.2 $ 575.9 $ 527.2 $ 294.3 $ 230.1 $ 324.8\n187\n2021\nAEP\nDepreciation and Amortization AEP Texas AEPTCo APCo I&M OPCo PSO SWEPCo\n(in millions)\nDepreciation and Amortization of\nProperty, Plant and Equipment $ 2,717.1 $ 327.2 $ 297.3 $ 547.0 $ 424.9 $ 301.1 $ 185.9 $ 292.9\nAmortization of Certain Securitized\nAssets 64.2 64.2 — — — — — —\nAmortization of Regulatory Assets\nand Liabilities 44.4 (4.4) — (0.8) 21.1 2.2 10.7 2.1\nTotal Depreciation and\nAmortization $ 2,825.7 $ 387.0 $ 297.3 $ 546.2 $ 446.0 $ 303.3 $ 196.6 $ 295.0\nSupplementary Cash Flow Information (Applies to AEP)\nYears Ended December 31,\nCash Flow Information 2023 2022 2021\n(in millions)\nCash Paid (Received) for:\nInterest, Net of Capitalized Amounts $ 1,673.5 $ 1,286.3 $ 1,137.2\nIncome Taxes 78.4 116.8 13.2\nSale of Transferable Tax Credits (102.0) — —\nNoncash Investing and Financing Activities:\nAcquisitions Under Finance Leases 48.7 31.8 287.6\nConstruction Expenditures Included in Current Liabilities as of December 31, 842.4 1,258.9 1,180.4\nAcquisition of Nuclear Fuel Included in Current Liabilities as of December 31, 24.2 — —\nNoncash Contribution of Assets to Cedar Creek Project — — (9.3)\nNoncontrolling Interest Assumed - Dry Lake Solar Project — — 35.3\nNoncash Increase in Noncurrent Assets from the Sale of the Competitive\nContracted Renewables Portfolio 74.7 — —\n188\n2. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.\nDuring the FASB’s standard-setting process and upon issuance of final standards, management reviews the new accounting\nliterature to determine its relevance, if any, to the Registrants’ business. The following standards will impact the Registrants’\nfinancial statements.\nASU 2023-09 “Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” (ASU 2023-09)\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, to address investors’ suggested enhancements to (a) better understand an\nentity’s exposure to potential changes in jurisdictional tax legislation and the ensuing risks and opportunities, (b) assess income\ntax information that affects cash flow forecasts and capital allocation decisions and (c) identify potential opportunities to\nincrease future cash flows.\nThe new standard requires an annual rate reconciliation disclosure of the following categories regardless of materiality: state\nand local income tax net of federal income tax effect, foreign tax effects, effect of changes in tax laws or rates enacted in the\ncurrent period, effect of cross-border tax laws, tax credits, changes in valuation allowances, nontaxable or nondeductible items\nand changes in unrecognized tax benefits.\nThe new standard also requires an annual disclosure of the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated\nby federal, state and foreign taxes and by individual jurisdictions that are equal to or greater than 5 percent of total income taxes\npaid. Disclosure of income (loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (benefit) disaggregated between\ndomestic and foreign jurisdictions and income tax expense (benefit) from continuing operations disaggregated by federal, state\nand foreign jurisdictions is required.\nThe new standard removes the requirement to disclose the cumulative amount of each type of temporary difference when a\ndeferred tax liability is not recognized because of the exceptions to comprehensive recognition of deferred taxes related to\nsubsidiaries and corporate joint ventures.\nThe amendments in the new standard may be applied on either a prospective or retrospective basis for public business entities\nfor fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted. Management has not yet made a decision to\nearly adopt the amendments to this standard or how to apply them.\nASU 2023-07 “Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (ASU 2023-07)\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, to address investors’ observations that there is limited information\ndisclosed about segment expenses and to better understand expense categories and amounts included in segment profit or loss.\nThe new standard requires annual and interim disclosure of (a) the categories and amounts of significant segment expenses\n(determined by management using both qualitative and quantitative factors) that are regularly provided to the chief operating\ndecision maker (CODM) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, (b) the amounts and a qualitative\ndescription of “other segment items”, defined as the difference between reported segment revenues less the significant segment\nexpenses and each reported measure of segment profit or loss disclosed, (c) reportable segment profit or loss and assets that are\ncurrently only required annually, (d) the CODM’s title and position, and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported\nmeasure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources and (e) a\nrequirement that entities with a single reportable segment provide all disclosures required by ASU 2023-07 and all existing\nsegment disclosures in Topic 280. Additionally, this new standard allows disclosure of one or more of additional profit or loss\nmeasures if the CODM uses more than one measure provided that at least one of the disclosed measures is determined in a\nmanner “most consistent with the measurement principles under GAAP”. If multiple measures are presented, additional\ndisclosure is required about how the CODM uses each measure to assess performance and decide how to allocate resources.\nThe amendments in the new standard are effective on a retrospective basis for all entities for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted.\nManagement does not plan to early adopt the amendments to this standard.\n189\n3. COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nThe disclosures in this note apply to AEP only. The impact of AOCI is not material to the financial statements of the Registrant\nSubsidiaries.\nPresentation of Comprehensive Income\nThe following tables provide AEP’s components of changes in AOCI and details of reclassifications from AOCI for the years\nended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.

RATE MATTERS\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.\nThe Registrants are involved in rate and regulatory proceedings at the FERC and their state commissions. Rate matters can\nhave a material impact on net income, cash flows and possibly financial condition. The Registrants’ recent significant rate\norders and pending rate filings are addressed in this note.\nAEP Texas Rate Matters (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas)\nAEP Texas Interim Transmission and Distribution Rates\nThrough December 31, 2023, AEP Texas’ cumulative revenues from interim base rate increases that are subject to a prudency\nreview is approximately $987 million. A base rate review could result in a refund to customers if AEP Texas incurs a\ndisallowance of the transmission or distribution investment on which an interim increase was based. Management is unable to\ndetermine a range of potential losses, if any, that are reasonably possible of occurring. A revenue decrease, including a refund\nof interim transmission and distribution rates, could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nAEP Texas is required to file for a comprehensive rate review no later than April 5, 2024.\nAPCo and WPCo Rate Matters (Applies to AEP and APCo)\n2020-2022 Virginia Triennial Review\nIn March 2023, APCo submitted its 2020-2022 Virginia triennial review filing and base rate case with the Virginia SCC as\nrequired by state law. APCo requested a $213 million annual increase in Virginia base rates based upon a proposed 10.6%\nreturn on common equity. The requested annual increase includes $47 million related to vegetation management and a\n$35 million increase in depreciation expense. The requested increase in depreciation expense reflects, among other things, the\nimpacts of incremental investments made since APCo’s last depreciation study using property balances as of December 31,\n2022. Effective January 1, 2023 and in accordance with past Virginia SCC directives, APCo implemented updated Virginia\ndepreciation rates. APCo’s proposed revenue requirement also includes the recovery of certain costs incurred that partially\ncontributed to APCo’s calculated earnings shortfall for the 2020-2022 triennial period. For triennial review periods in which a\nVirginia utility earns below its authorized ROE band, the utility may file to recover expenses incurred, up to the bottom of the\nauthorized ROE band, related to certain categories of costs, including system restoration costs for severe weather events.\nIn August 2023, APCo, Virginia Staff and intervening parties reached a settlement agreement that included the following: (a) a\n$127 million annual increase in Virginia base rates, (b) a 9.5% ROE, (c) updated depreciation rates that reflect a 2040 Amos\nPlant retirement date, (d) approval of a regulatory asset, including tax gross-up, to be recovered over three years starting in\n2024 related to major storm expenses incurred during the 2020-2022 triennial period when APCo under-earned in Virginia, (e)\napproval of the revenue requirement impact of net operating loss carryforward related to income taxes and approval of deferral\nauthority for corporate alternative minimum taxes incurred and (f) approval of the revenue requirement impact of an increase in\nvegetation management costs with certain costs subject to over-/under-recovery accounting. In November 2023, the Virginia\nSCC issued a final order approving the settlement agreement as described above with new rates taking effect in January 2024.\nENEC (Expanded Net Energy Cost) Filings\nIn April 2023, APCo and WPCo (the Companies) submitted their 2023 annual ENEC filing with the WVPSC, proposing two\nalternatives to increase ENEC rates effective September 1, 2023 and to resolve the Companies’ open 2021 and 2022 ENEC\nfilings. The first alternative was a $293 million annual increase in ENEC rates comprised of an $89 million increase for current\nyear ENEC expense and a $200 million annual increase for the recovery of the Companies’ February 28, 2023 ENEC under-\nrecovery balances over three years, including debt and equity carrying costs. The second alternative was an $89 million annual\nincrease in ENEC rates with the Companies securitizing approximately $1.9 billion of assets, including: (a) $553 million\nrelating to ENEC under-recoveries as of February 28, 2023, (b) $88 million relating to major storm expense deferrals and (c)\n$1.2 billion relating to APCo’s West Virginia jurisdictional book values of the Amos and Mountaineer Plants and forecasted\nCCR and ELG investments at these generating facilities.\nIn September 2023, the WVPSC issued an order on the 2023 ENEC filing approving an $89 million annual increase in ENEC\nsurcharge rates for the Companies’ forecasted costs for the period September 2023 through August 2024.\nIn January 2024, the WVPSC issued an order resolving the Companies’ 2021-2023 ENEC cases. In the order, the WVPSC: (a)\ndisallowed $232 million in ENEC under-recovered costs as of February 28, 2023 ($136 million related to APCo) and (b)\napproved the recovery of $321 million of ENEC under-recovered costs as of February 28, 2023 ($174 million related to APCo)\nplus a 4% carrying charge rate over a ten-year recovery period starting September 1, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the\nCompanies’ financial statements reflect the impact of the disallowance. In February 2024, the Companies filed briefs with the\n192\nWest Virginia Supreme Court to initiate an appeal of this order. The Companies will submit their annual ENEC update filing\nwith the WVPSC in the second quarter of 2024 proposing that updated ENEC rates become effective September 1, 2024.\nETT Rate Matters (Applies to AEP)\nETT Interim Transmission Rates\nAEP has a 50% equity ownership interest in ETT. Predominantly all of ETT’s revenues are based on interim rate changes that\ncan be filed twice annually and are subject to review and possible true-up in the next base rate proceeding. Through\nDecember 31, 2023, AEP’s share of ETT’s cumulative revenues that are subject to a prudency review is approximately\n$1.7 billion. A base rate review could produce a refund to customers if ETT incurs a disallowance of the transmission\ninvestment on which an interim increase was based. A revenue decrease, including a refund of interim transmission rates, could\nreduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. Management is unable to determine a range of\npotential losses, if any, that are reasonably possible of occurring. ETT is required to file for a comprehensive rate review no\nlater than February 1, 2025, during which the $1.7 billion of cumulative revenues above will be subject to review.\nI&M Rate Matters (Applies to AEP and I&M)\nMichigan Power Supply Cost Recovery (PSCR)\nIn April 2023, I&M received intervenor testimony in I&M’s 2021 PSCR Reconciliation for the 12-month period ending\nDecember 31, 2021, recommending disallowances of purchased power costs of $18 million associated with the OVEC Inter-\nCompany Power Agreement (ICPA) and the UPA with AEGCo that were alleged to be above market in applying the MPSC’s\nCode of Conduct rules. Michigan staff submitted testimony in I&M’s 2021 PSCR Reconciliation with no recommended\ndisallowances for PSCR costs incurred, including those associated with the OVEC ICPA and the AEGCo UPA. Michigan staff\nalso recommended several options to address I&M’s shortfall in achieving Michigan’s annual one percent energy waste\nreduction savings level, resulting in potential future disallowed costs of up to approximately $14 million. In June 2023,\nMichigan staff submitted rebuttal testimony to update their calculation of the 2021 market proxy price resulting in a\nrecommended disallowance of approximately $1 million related to the OVEC ICPA.\nIn January 2024, I&M received staff testimony in I&M’s 2022 PSCR Reconciliation for the 12-month period ending December\n31, 2022 recommending disallowances of purchased power costs of $2 million associated with the OVEC ICPA that were\nalleged to be above market in applying the MPSC’s Code of Conduct rules. Similar to the 2021 PSCR Reconciliation,\nMichigan staff also recommended several options to address I&M’s shortfall in achieving Michigan’s annual one percent\nenergy waste reduction savings level, resulting in potential future disallowed costs of up to approximately $6 million.\nMPSC orders on I&M’s 2021 and 2022 PSCR Reconciliations are expected in the first half of 2024. If any PSCR costs are not\nrecoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\n2023 Indiana Base Rate Case\nIn August 2023, I&M filed a request with the IURC for a $116 million annual increase in Indiana base rates based upon a 2024\nforecasted test year, a proposed 10.5% ROE and a proposed capital structure of 48.8% debt and 51.2% common equity. I&M\nproposed that the annual increase in base rates be implemented in two steps, with the first increase effective in mid-2024,\nfollowing an IURC order, and the second increase effective in January 2025. The proposed annual increase includes a\n$41 million increase related to depreciation expense, driven by increased depreciation rates and increased capital investments,\nand a $15 million increase related to storm expenses. I&M’s Indiana base case filing requests recovery of certain historical\nperiod regulatory asset balances and proposes deferral accounting for certain future investments and tax related issues,\nincluding corporate alternative minimum tax expense and PTCs related to the Cook Plant.\nIn December 2023, I&M and intervenors reached a settlement agreement that was submitted to the IURC recommending a two-\nstep increase in Indiana rates with a $28 million annual increase effective upon an IURC order and the remaining $34 million\nannual increase effective in January 2025. The recommended revenue increase includes: (a) a 9.85% ROE, (b) a two-step\nupdate of I&M’s capital structure with a capital structure of 50% for both debt and common equity effective upon an IURC\norder and I&M will submit an updated capital structure in January 2025 with the common equity component adjusted to no\nmore than 51.2%, (c) a $25 million increase related to depreciation expense and (d) an $11 million increase related to storm\nexpenses.\n193\nA hearing was held in January 2024 and an order is expected in the second quarter of 2024. If any costs included in this filing\nare not approved for recovery, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\n2023 Michigan Base Rate Case\nIn September 2023, I&M filed a request with the MPSC for a $34 million annual increase in Michigan base rates based upon a\n2024 forecasted test year, a proposed 10.5% ROE and a capital structure of 49.4% debt and 50.6% common equity. The\nproposed annual increase includes an $11 million annual increase in depreciation expense driven by increased capital\ninvestment. I&M’s Michigan base case filing requests recovery of certain historical period regulatory asset balances and\nproposes deferral accounting for certain future investments and tax related issues, including corporate alternative minimum tax\nexpense and PTCs related to the Cook Plant.\nIn January 2024, Michigan Staff and various intervenors submitted testimony recommending changes in base rates ranging\nfrom a $6 million annual decrease to a $19 million annual increase. These changes are based on ROEs ranging from 9.7% to\n9.9% and capital structures ranging from 49.4% debt and 50.6% equity to 52% debt and 48% equity. Intervenors also proposed\nin testimony certain disallowances related to existing regulatory assets totaling approximately $5 million, the exclusion of\nCAMT from any future deferrals and the prospective inclusion of PTCs related to the Cook Plant in I&M’s PSCR.\nA hearing was held in February 2024. If any costs included in this filing are not approved for recovery, it could reduce future\nnet income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nKPCo Rate Matters (Applies to AEP)\nInvestigation of the Service, Rates and Facilities of KPCo\nIn June 2023, the KPSC issued an order directing KPCo to show cause why it should not be subject to Kentucky statutory\nremedies, including fines and penalties, for failure to provide adequate service in its service territory. The KPSC’s show cause\norder did not make any determination regarding the adequacy of KPCo’s service. In July 2023, KPCo filed a response to the\nshow cause order demonstrating that it has provided adequate service. In December 2023 and February 2024, KPCo and\ncertain intervenors filed testimony with the KPSC. In February 2024, KPCo filed a motion to strike and exclude intervenor\ntestimony in its entirety on the grounds that issues raised are outside the scope of the proceeding and because the testimony is\nlargely unreasoned, unsupported, and provides no evidentiary value. A hearing is expected in 2024. If any fines or penalties\nare levied against KPCo relating to the show cause order, it could reduce net income and cash flows and impact financial\ncondition.\n2023 Kentucky Base Rate and Securitization Case\nIn June 2023, KPCo filed a request with the KPSC for a $94 million net annual increase in base rates based upon a proposed\n9.9% ROE with the increase to be implemented no earlier than January 2024. The filing proposes no changes in depreciation\nrates and an annual level of storm restoration expense in base rates of approximately $1 million. KPCo also proposed to\ndiscontinue tracking of PJM transmission costs through a rider, and to instead collect an annual level of costs through base\nrates. In addition, KPCo has proposed a rider to recover certain distribution reliability investments and related incremental\noperation and maintenance expenses. KPCo also requested a prudency determination and recovery mechanism for\napproximately $16 million of purchased power costs not recoverable through its FAC since its last base case. KPCo’s proposal\ndid not address the disposition of its 50% interest in Mitchell Plant, which will be addressed in the future. As of December 31,\n2023, the net book value of KPCo’s share of the Mitchell Plant, before cost of removal including CWIP and inventory, was\n$553 million. If any of these costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial\ncondition.\nIn conjunction with its June 2023 filing, KPCo further requested to finance, through the issuance of securitization bonds,\napproximately $471 million of regulatory assets recorded as of June 2023 including: (a) $289 million of plant retirement costs,\n(b) $79 million of deferred storm costs related to 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 major storms, (c) $52 million of deferred\npurchased power expenses and (d) $51 million of under-recovered purchased power rider costs. Plant retirement costs and\ndeferred purchased power expenses have been deemed prudent in prior KPSC decisions. KPCo has requested a prudency\ndetermination in this proceeding for the deferred storm costs and under-recovered purchase power rider costs since the last base\ncase.\nIn November 2023, KPCo filed an uncontested settlement agreement with the KPSC, that included an annual base rate increase\nof $75 million, based upon a 9.75% ROE. Settlement parties agreed that the KPSC should approve KPCo’s securitization\nrequest, and that the approximately $471 million regulatory assets requested for securitization are comprised of prudently\nincurred costs. The settlement does not modify KPCo’s proposal to discontinue tracking of PJM transmission costs through a\n194\nrider, and to instead collect an annual level of costs through base rates. The settlement approved KPCo’s request to implement\na rider to recover certain distribution reliability investments. Under the terms of the settlement, KPCo agreed to forgo recovery\nof approximately $16 million of purchased power costs not recoverable through the FAC since KPCo’s last base case and\nexcluded a return on its stand-alone NOLC deferred tax asset from the base rate revenue requirement while it seeks a private\nletter ruling from the IRS. Other differences between KPCo’s requested annual base rate increase and the uncontested\nsettlement agreement are primarily due to exclusion of certain employee-related expenses from the revenue requirement.\nIn January 2024, consistent with the November 2023 uncontested settlement agreement, the KPSC issued a financing order\napproving KPCo’s securitization request and concluding that costs requested for recovery were prudently incurred. The\nKPSC’s financing order includes certain additional requirements related to securitization bond structuring, marketing,\nplacement, and issuance that were not reflected in KPCo’s proposal. As a result, in January 2024, KPCo filed a request for\nrehearing with the KPSC to clarify certain aspects of these additional requirements. In February 2024, the KPSC denied\nKPCo’s rehearing requests. In accordance with Kentucky statutory requirements and the financing order, the issuance of the\nsecuritized bonds is subject to final review by the KPSC after bond pricing. KPCo expects to proceed with the securitized bond\nissuance process and to complete the securitization process in the second half of 2024, subject to market conditions. If any of\nthese costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nIn January 2024, the KPSC issued an order modifying the November 2023 uncontested settlement agreement and approving an\nannual base rate increase of $60 million based upon a 9.75% ROE effective with billing cycles mid-January 2024. The order\nreduced KPCo’s base rate revenue requirement by $14 million to allow recovery of actual test year PJM transmission costs\ninstead of KPCo’s requested annual level of costs based on PJM 2023 projected transmission revenue requirements. The KPSC\ndenied implementation of a rider to recover certain distribution reliability investments. In February 2024, KPCo filed an appeal\nwith the Commonwealth of Kentucky Franklin Circuit Court, challenging among other aspects of the order the $14 million base\nrate revenue requirement reduction.\nFuel Adjustment Clause (FAC) Review\nIn December 2023, KPCo received intervenor testimony in its FAC review for the two-year period ending October 31, 2022,\nrecommending a disallowance ranging from $44 million to $60 million of its total $432 million purchased power cost\nrecoveries as a result of proposed modifications to the ratemaking methodology that limits purchased power costs recoverable\nthrough the FAC. A hearing was held in February 2024. If any fuel costs are not recoverable or refunds are ordered, it could\nreduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nRockport Offset Recovery\nIn January 2024, KPCo filed an application with the KPSC seeking to recover an allowed cost (Rockport Offset) of $41 million\nin accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement in the 2017 Kentucky Base Rate Case permitting KPCo to use the\nlevel of non-fuel, non-environmental Rockport Plant UPA expense included in base rates to earn its authorized ROE in 2023\nsince the Rockport UPA ended in December 2022. An estimated Rockport Offset of $23 million was recovered through a rider,\nsubject to true-up, during the 12-months ended December 2023. KPCo is requesting to recover the remaining $18 million\nRockport Offset true-up over a 12-month period beginning March 2024, also through a rider. The Rockport Offset true-up is\nnot yet reflected in revenue, as KPCo has not met the requirements of alternative revenue recognition in accordance with the\naccounting guidance for “Regulated Operations”. In February 2024, the KPSC issued an order allowing KPCo to collect the\nremaining $18 million through interim rates, subject to refund, over twelve months starting in March 2024. Intervenor\ntestimony is expected in April 2024 and an order is expected in the second quarter of 2024. If the Rockport Offset is not\nrecoverable or refunds are ordered, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nOPCo Rate Matters (Applies to AEP and OPCo)\nOVEC Cost Recovery Audits\nIn December 2021, as part of OVEC cost recovery audits pending before the PUCO, intervenors filed positions claiming that\ncosts incurred by OPCo during the 2018-2019 audit period were imprudent and should be disallowed. In May 2022,\nintervenors filed for rehearing on the 2016-2017 OVEC cost recovery audit period claiming the PUCO’s April 2022 order to\nadopt the findings of the audit report were unjust, unlawful and unreasonable for multiple reasons, including the position that\nOPCo recovered imprudently incurred costs. In June 2022, the PUCO granted rehearing on the 2016-2017 audit period for\npurposes of further consideration.\nIn May 2023, as part of the OVEC cost recovery audits pending before the PUCO, intervenors filed positions claiming that\ncosts incurred by OPCo during the 2020 audit period were imprudent and should be disallowed. A hearing was held in\nNovember 2023.\n195\nManagement disagrees with these claims and is unable to predict the impact of these disputes. If any costs are disallowed or\nrefunds are ordered, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nOhio ESP Filings\nIn January 2023, OPCo filed an application with the PUCO to approve an ESP that included proposed rate adjustments,\nproposed new riders and the continuation and modification of certain existing riders, including the DIR, effective June 2024\nthrough May 2030. The proposal includes a return on common equity of 10.65% on capital costs for certain riders. In June\n2023, intervenors filed testimony opposing OPCo’s plan for various new riders and modifications to existing riders, including\nthe DIR. In September 2023, OPCo and certain intervenors filed a settlement agreement with the PUCO addressing the ESP\napplication. The settlement included a four year term from June 2024 through May 2028, an ROE of 9.7% and continuation of\na number of riders including the DIR subject to revenue caps. An order from the PUCO is expected in the first quarter of 2024.\nIf OPCo is ultimately not permitted to fully collect its ESP rates it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact\nfinancial condition.\nPSO Rate Matters (Applies to AEP and PSO)\n2022 Oklahoma Base Rate Case\nIn November 2022, PSO filed a request with the OCC for an annual base rate increase of $294 million based upon a 10.4%\nROE with a capital structure of 45.4% debt and 54.6% common equity. The requested $294 million annual base rate increase,\nnet of existing rider revenues and certain incremental renewable facility benefits expected to be provided to customers through\nriders, represented a requested annual increase in rates of $173 million and included a $47 million annual depreciation expense\nincrease related to the accelerated depreciation recovery of the Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 through 2026, and a $16 million\nannual amortization expense increase to recover intangible plant over a 5-year useful life instead of a 10-year useful life. PSO’s\nrequest also included recovery of the 155 MW Rock Falls Wind Facility through base rates to aid PSO’s near-term capacity\nneeds and support compliance with SPP’s 2023 increased capacity planning reserve margin requirements.\nIn November 2023, the OCC issued a final order approving an annual base rate increase of $131 million based upon a 9.3%\nROE. As a result of the final order, PSO is required to exclude Rock Falls Wind Facility from recovery through base rates until\na future base case since the facility was placed into service for PSO customers after the conclusion of the customary six-month\npost-test year period for ratemaking adjustments. In addition, PSO must provide Rock Falls Wind Facility benefits in excess of\n$21 million on an annual basis to customers through a rider. The order also stipulates PSO’s proposals related to inclusion of a\nstand-alone NOLC deferred tax asset in rate base will be addressed in a future proceeding, upon receipt of a private letter ruling\nfrom the IRS. Effective January 2024, interim rates implemented in May 2023 concluded and updated rates and tariffs were\nimplemented in accordance with the final order. In January 2024, refund of the $18 million interim rate over collection began\nand will be competed no later than April 2024, in compliance with the final order. In December 2023, PSO appealed certain\nelements of the OCC’s final order to the Supreme Court of the State of Oklahoma.\n2024 Oklahoma Base Rate Case\nIn January 2024, PSO filed a request with the OCC for a $218 million annual base rate increase based upon a 10.8% ROE with\na capital structure of 48.9% debt and 51.1% common equity. PSO requested an expanded transmission cost recovery rider and\na mechanism to recover generation costs necessary to comply with SPP’s 2023 increased capacity planning reserve margin\nrequirements. PSO’s request reflects recovery of Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 through 2040.\nSWEPCo Rate Matters (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo)\n2012 Texas Base Rate Case\nIn 2012, SWEPCo filed a request with the PUCT to increase annual base rates primarily due to the completion of the Turk\nPlant. In 2013, the PUCT issued an order affirming the prudence of the Turk Plant but determined that the Turk Plant’s Texas\njurisdictional capital cost cap established in a previous Certificate of Convenience and Necessity case also limited SWEPCo’s\nrecovery of AFUDC in addition to limits on its recovery of cash construction costs.\nUpon rehearing in 2014, the PUCT reversed its initial ruling and determined that AFUDC was excluded from the Turk Plant’s\nTexas jurisdictional capital cost cap. As a result, SWEPCo reversed $114 million of a previously recorded regulatory\ndisallowance in 2013. In 2017, the Texas District Court upheld the PUCT’s 2014 order and intervenors filed appeals with the\nTexas Third Court of Appeals.\nIn August 2021, the Texas Third Court of Appeals reversed the Texas District Court judgment affirming the PUCT’s order on\nAFUDC, concluding that the language of the PUCT’s original 2008 order intended to include AFUDC in the Texas\n196\njurisdictional capital cost cap, and remanded the case to the PUCT for future proceedings. In November 2021, SWEPCo and\nthe PUCT submitted Petitions for Review with the Texas Supreme Court. In October 2022, the Texas Supreme Court denied\nthe Petitions for Review submitted by SWEPCo and the PUCT. In December 2022, SWEPCo and the PUCT filed requests for\nrehearing with the Texas Supreme Court. In June 2023, the Texas Supreme Court denied SWEPCo’s request for rehearing and\nthe case was remanded to the PUCT for future proceedings. In October 2023, SWEPCo filed testimony with the PUCT in the\nremanded proceeding recommending no refund or disallowance.\nOn December 14, 2023, the PUCT approved a preliminary order stating the PUCT will not address SWEPCo’s request that\nwould allow the PUCT to find cause to allow SWEPCo to exceed the Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap in the current remand\nproceeding. As a result of the PUCT’s approval of the preliminary order, SWEPCo believes it is probable the PUCT will\ndisallow capitalized AFUDC in excess of the Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap and recorded a pretax, non-cash disallowance\nof $86 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Such determination may reduce SWEPCo’s future revenues by approximately\n$15 million on an annual basis. On December 21, 2023, SWEPCo filed a motion with the PUCT for reconsideration of the\npreliminary order. In January 2024, the PUCT denied the motion for reconsideration of the preliminary order.\nThe PUCT’s December 2023 approval of the preliminary order determined that it will address, in the ongoing PUCT remand\nproceeding, any potential revenue refunds to customers that may be required by future PUCT orders. In January 2024, the\nPUCT established a procedural schedule for the remand proceeding. Supplemental testimony from SWEPCo is due in March\n2024, intervenor and staff testimony is due in April 2024 and a hearing is scheduled for May 2024. Although SWEPCo does\nnot currently believe any refunds are probable of occurring, SWEPCo estimates it could be required to make customer refunds,\nincluding interest, ranging from $0 to $200 million related to revenues collected from February 2013 through December 2023.\n2016 Texas Base Rate Case\nIn 2016, SWEPCo filed a request with the PUCT for a net increase in Texas annual revenues of $69 million based upon a 10%\nROE. In January 2018, the PUCT issued a final order approving a net increase in Texas annual revenues of $50 million based\nupon a ROE of 9.6%, effective May 2017. The final order also included: (a) approval to recover the Texas jurisdictional share\nof environmental investments placed in-service, as of June 30, 2016, at various plants, including Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3, (b)\napproval of recovery of, but no return on, the Texas jurisdictional share of the net book value of Welsh Plant, Unit 2, (c)\napproval of $2 million in additional vegetation management expenses and (d) the rejection of SWEPCo’s proposed transmission\ncost recovery mechanism.\nAs a result of the final order, in 2017 SWEPCo: (a) recorded an impairment charge of $19 million, which included $7 million\nassociated with the lack of return on Welsh Plant, Unit 2 and $12 million related to other disallowed plant investments, (b)\nrecognized $32 million of additional revenues, for the period of May 2017 through December 2017, that was surcharged to\ncustomers in 2018 and (c) recognized an additional $7 million of expenses consisting primarily of depreciation expense and\nvegetation management expense, offset by the deferral of rate case expense. SWEPCo implemented new rates in February\n2018 billings. The $32 million of additional 2017 revenues was collected during 2018. In March 2018, the PUCT clarified and\ncorrected portions of the final order, without changing the overall decision or amounts of the rate change. The order has been\nappealed by various intervenors related to limiting SWEPCo’s recovery of AFUDC on Turk Plant and recovery of Welsh Plant,\nUnit 2. If certain parts of the PUCT order are overturned, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial\ncondition.\n2020 Texas Base Rate Case\nIn October 2020, SWEPCo filed a request with the PUCT for a $105 million annual increase in Texas base rates based upon a\nproposed 10.35% ROE. The request would move transmission and distribution interim revenues recovered through riders into\nbase rates. Eliminating these riders would result in a net annual requested base rate increase of $90 million primarily due to\nincreased investments. SWEPCo subsequently filed a request with the PUCT lowering the requested annual increase in Texas\nbase rates to $100 million which would result in an $85 million net annual base rate increase after moving the proposed riders\nto rate base.\nIn January 2022, the PUCT issued a final order approving an annual revenue increase of $39 million based upon a 9.25% ROE.\nThe order also includes: (a) rates implemented retroactively back to March 18, 2021, (b) $5 million of the proposed increase\nrelated to vegetation management, (c) $2 million annually to establish a storm catastrophe reserve and (d) the creation of a rider\nto recover the Dolet Hills Power Station as if it were in rate base until its retirement at the end of 2021 and starting in 2022 the\nremaining net book value to be recovered as a regulatory asset through 2046. As a result of the final order, SWEPCo recorded\na disallowance of $12 million in 2021 associated with the lack of return on the Dolet Hills Power Station. In February 2022,\nSWEPCo filed a motion for rehearing with the PUCT challenging several errors in the order, which include challenges of the\napproved ROE, the denial of a reasonable return or carrying costs on the Dolet Hills Power Station and the calculation of the\nTexas jurisdictional share of the storm catastrophe reserve. In April 2022, the PUCT denied the motion for rehearing. In May\n197\n2022, SWEPCo filed a petition for review with the Texas District Court seeking a judicial review of the several errors\nchallenged in the PUCT’s final order.\n2020 Louisiana Base Rate Case\nIn December 2020, SWEPCo filed a request with the LPSC for a $134 million annual increase in Louisiana base rates based\nupon a proposed 10.35% ROE. SWEPCo’s requested annual increase includes accelerated depreciation related to the Dolet\nHills Power Station, Pirkey Power Plant and Welsh Plant, all of which were or are expected to be retired early. SWEPCo also\nincluded recovery of Welsh Plant, Unit 2 over the blended useful life of Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3. SWEPCo subsequently\nrevised the requested annual increase to $95 million to reflect removing hurricane storm restoration costs from the base case\nfiling, to modify the proposed recovery of the Dolet Hills Power Station and revisions to various proposed amortizations. The\nhurricane costs have been requested in a separate storm filing. See “2021 Louisiana Storm Cost Filing” below for more\ninformation.\nIn January 2023, the LPSC approved a settlement which provides for an annual revenue increase of $27 million based upon a\n9.5% ROE and includes: (a) a $21 million increase in base rates effective February 2023, (b) a $14 million rider to recover costs\nof the Dolet Hills Power Station and Pirkey Plant including a return, (c) an $8 million reduction in fuel rates, (d) adoption of a\n3-year formula rate term subject to an earnings band and (e) the recovery of certain incremental SPP charges net of associated\nrevenue and the Louisiana jurisdictional share of the return on and of projected transmission capital investment outside of the\nearnings band. The settlement agreement did not rule on the prudency of the early retirement of the Dolet Hills Power Station,\nwhich is being addressed in a separate proceeding.\nThe primary differences between SWEPCo’s requested annual rate increase and the agreed upon settlement increase are\nprimarily due to: (a) a reduction in the requested ROE, (b) recovery of the Dolet Hills Power Station and Pirkey Plant over ten\nyears in a separate rider mechanism as opposed to base rates with accelerated depreciation rates, (c) maintaining existing\ndepreciation rates for Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3 and (d) the severing of SWEPCo’s proposed adjustment to include a stand-\nalone NOLC deferred tax asset in rate base.\nIn January 2023, a hearing was held related to the inclusion of a stand-alone NOLC deferred tax asset in rate base. In\nSeptember 2023, an order was received from the LPSC directing SWEPCo to seek a private letter ruling from the IRS to\naddress the matter.\n2021 Louisiana Storm Cost Filing\nIn 2020, Hurricanes Laura and Delta caused power outages and extensive damage to the SWEPCo service territories, primarily\nimpacting the Louisiana jurisdiction. Following both hurricanes, the LPSC issued orders allowing Louisiana utilities, including\nSWEPCo, to establish regulatory assets to track and defer expenses associated with these storms. In February 2021, severe\nwinter weather impacted the Louisiana jurisdiction and in March 2021, the LPSC approved the deferral of incremental storm\nrestoration expenses related to the winter storm. In March 2023, SWEPCo and the LPSC staff filed a joint stipulation and\nsettlement agreement with the LPSC which confirmed the prudency of $150 million of deferred incremental storm restoration\nexpenses. The agreement also authorized an interim carrying charge at a rate of 3.125% until the recovery mechanism is\ndetermined in phase two of this proceeding. In April 2023, the LPSC issued an order approving the stipulation and settlement\nagreement. In July 2023, SWEPCo submitted additional information in phase two of this proceeding to obtain a financing order\nand prudency review of capital investment. The procedural schedule for this case states that a hearing will take place in the\nsecond quarter of 2024.\n198\nFebruary 2021 Severe Winter Weather Impacts in SPP\nIn February 2021, severe winter weather had a significant impact in SPP, resulting in significantly increased market prices for\nnatural gas power plants to meet reliability needs for the SPP electric system. For the time period of February 9, 2021, to\nFebruary 20, 2021, SWEPCo’s natural gas expenses and purchases of electricity still to be recovered from customers are shown\nin the table below:\nDecember 31, Approved Approved\nJurisdiction 2023 2022 Recovery Period Carrying Charge\n(in millions)\nArkansas $ 54.2 $ 74.9 6 years (a)\nLouisiana 97.2 121.7 (b) (b)\nTexas 101.9 132.4 5 years 1.65%\nTotal $ 253.3 $ 329.0\n(a) SWEPCo is permitted to record carrying costs on the unrecovered balance of fuel costs at a weighted-cost of capital approved\nby the APSC. The APSC will conclude an audit of these costs in 2024. A hearing is scheduled for May 2024.\n(b) In March 2021, the LPSC approved a special order granting a temporary modification to the FAC and shortly after SWEPCo\nbegan recovery of its Louisiana jurisdictional share of these fuel costs based on a five-year recovery period inclusive of an\ninterim carrying charge equal to the prime rate. The special order states the fuel and purchased power costs incurred will be\nsubject to a future LPSC audit.\nIf SWEPCo is unable to recover any of the costs relating to the extraordinary fuel and purchases of electricity, or obtain\nauthorization of a reasonable carrying charge on these costs, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact\nfinancial condition.\nFERC Rate Matters\nFERC 2019 SPP Transmission Formula Rate Challenge (Applies to AEP, AEPTCo, PSO and SWEPCo)\nIn May 2021, certain joint customers submitted a formal challenge at the FERC related to the 2020 Annual Update of the 2019\nSPP Transmission Formula Rates of the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within SPP. In March 2022, the FERC issued\nan order granting the formal challenge on several issues and denying the formal challenge on other issues. Management has\ndetermined that the result of the order had an immaterial impact to the financial statements of AEP, AEPTCo, PSO and\nSWEPCo. In November 2022, certain joint customers appealed the FERC denial of issues to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nDistrict of Columbia Circuit. In January 2024, the court agreed with the FERC’s order and denied the certain joint customers\npetition for review.\nIndependence Energy Connection Project (Applies to AEP)\nIn 2016, PJM approved the Independence Energy Connection Project (IEC) and included it in its Regional Transmission\nExpansion Plan to alleviate congestion. Transource Energy has an ownership interest in the IEC, which is located in Maryland\nand Pennsylvania. In June 2020, the Maryland Public Service Commission approved a Certificate of Public Convenience and\nNecessity to construct the portion of the IEC in Maryland. In May 2021, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission\n(PAPUC) denied the IEC certificate for siting and construction of the portion in Pennsylvania. Transource Energy appealed the\nPAPUC ruling in Pennsylvania state court and challenged the ruling before the United States District Court for the Middle\nDistrict of Pennsylvania. In May 2022, the Pennsylvania state court issued an order affirming the PAPUC decision as to state\nlaw claims. In December 2023, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania granted summary\njudgment in favor of Transource Energy, finding that the PAPUC decision violated federal law and the United States\nConstitution. In January 2024, the PAPUC filed an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.\nAdditional regulatory proceedings before the PAPUC are expected to resume in 2024.\nIn September 2021, PJM notified Transource Energy that the IEC was suspended to allow for the regulatory and related appeals\nprocess to proceed in an orderly manner without breaching milestone dates in the project agreement. At that time, PJM stated\nthat the IEC has not been cancelled and remains necessary to alleviate congestion. PJM continues to evaluate reliability and\nmarket efficiency in the area. As of December 31, 2023, AEP’s share of IEC capital expenditures was approximately\n$93 million, located in Total Property, Plant and Equipment - Net on AEP’s balance sheets. The FERC has previously granted\nabandonment benefits for this project, allowing the full recovery of prudently incurred costs if the project is cancelled for\nreasons outside the control of Transource Energy. If any of the IEC costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income\nand cash flows and impact financial condition.\n199\nFERC RTO Incentive Complaint (Applies to AEP, AEPTCo and OPCo)\nIn February 2022, the OCC filed a complaint against AEPSC, American Transmission Systems, Inc. and Duke Energy Ohio,\nalleging the 50 basis point RTO incentive included in Ohio Transmission Owners’ respective transmission formula rates is not\njust and reasonable and therefore should be eliminated on the basis that RTO participation is not voluntary, but rather is\nrequired by Ohio law. In March 2022, AEPSC filed a motion to dismiss the OCC’s February 2022 complaint with the FERC on\nthe basis of certain deficiencies, including that the complaint fails to request relief that can be granted under FERC regulations\nbecause AEPSC is not a public utility nor does it have a transmission rate on file with the FERC. In December 2022, the FERC\nissued an order removing the 50 basis point RTO incentive from OPCo and OHTCo transmission formula rates effective the\ndate of the February 2022 complaint filing and directed OPCo and OHTCo to provide refunds, with interest, within sixty days\nof the date of its order. In January 2023, both AEPSC and the OCC filed requests for rehearing with the FERC. In February\n2023, in compliance with the FERC’s December 2022 order, AEPSC submitted a filing to the FERC to update OPCo and\nOHTCo 2023 transmission formula rates to exclude the 50 basis point RTO incentive and provide refunds with interest. In\nApril 2023, the FERC approved the updated transmission formula rates for OPCo and OHTCo and issued an Order on\nRehearing affirming its December 2022 decision. During 2023, in compliance with FERC’s December 2022 order, OPCo and\nOHTCo provided refunds including interest of $5 million and $13 million, respectively. This decision has been appealed to the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.\nRequest to Update AEGCo Depreciation Rates (Applies to AEP and I&M)\nIn October 2022, AEP, on behalf of AEGCo, submitted proposed revisions to AEGCo’s depreciation rates for its 50%\nownership interest in Rockport Plant, Unit 1 and Unit 2, reflected in the UPA between AEGCo and I&M. The proposed\ndepreciation rates for these assets reflect an estimated 2028 retirement date for the Rockport Plant. AEGCo’s previous FERC-\napproved depreciation rates for Rockport Plant, Unit 1 were based upon a December 31, 2028 estimated retirement date while\nAEGCo’s previous FERC-approved depreciation rates for Rockport Plant, Unit 2 leasehold improvements were based upon a\nDecember 31, 2022 estimated retirement date in conjunction with the termination of the Rockport Plant, Unit 2 lease.\nIn December 2022, the FERC issued an order approving the proposed AEGCo Rockport depreciation rates effective January 1,\n2023, subject to further review and a potential refund. The FERC established a separate proceeding to review: (a) AEGCo’s\nacquisition value for the Rockport Plant, Unit 2 base generating asset (original cost and accumulated depreciation), (b) the\nappropriateness of including future capital additions as stated components in proposed depreciation rates, in light of the UPA’s\nformula rate mechanism, (c) the appropriateness of applying two different depreciation rates to a single asset common to both\nunits and (d) the accounting and regulatory treatment of Rockport Plant, Unit 2 costs of removal and related AROs. In August\n2023, AEGCo reached a settlement agreement with the FERC Trial Staff that resolves all issues set for hearing. In September\n2023, the settlement agreement was certified to the FERC as uncontested. An order from the FERC on this settlement\nagreement is expected in 2024. If the FERC finalizes the settlement agreement as proposed, management anticipates the results\nof the order will not have a material impact on financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nFERC 2021 PJM and SPP Transmission Formula Rate Challenge (Applies to AEP, AEPTCo, APCo, I&M, PSO and\nSWEPCo)\nThe Registrants transitioned to stand-alone treatment of NOLCs in its PJM and SPP transmission formula rates beginning with\nthe 2022 projected transmission revenue requirements and 2021 true-up to actual transmission revenue requirements and\nprovided notice of this change in informational filings made with the FERC. Stand-alone treatment of the NOLCs for\ntransmission formula rates increased the annual revenue requirements for years 2023, 2022 and 2021 by $60 million,\n$69 million and $78 million, respectively.\nIn March 2023 and May 2023, certain joint customers submitted a complaint and a formal challenge at the FERC related to the\n2022 Annual Update of the 2021 Transmission Formula Rates of the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within PJM and\nSPP, respectively. These challenges primarily relate to stand-alone treatment of NOLCs in the transmission formula rates of the\nAEP transmission owning subsidiaries. AEPSC, on behalf of the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within PJM and SPP,\nfiled answers to the joint formal challenge and complaint with the FERC in the second quarter of 2023.\nIn January 2024, the FERC issued two orders, granting the joint customers’ challenges related to stand-alone treatment of\nNOLCs in the 2021 Transmission Formula Rates of the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within PJM and SPP. The\nFERC directed the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within PJM and SPP to provide refunds with interest on all amounts\ncollected for the 2021 rate year, and for such refunds to be reflected in the annual update for the next rate year. In February\n2024, AEPSC on behalf of the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within PJM and SPP filed requests with the FERC that it\ngrant rehearing and reverse findings in its January 2024 orders or establish hearing procedures to address outstanding factual\nissues.\n200\nAs a result of the January 2024 FERC orders, the Registrants’ 2022 and 2023 income statements cumulatively reflect a\nprovision for refund for the probable refund of all NOLC revenues included in transmission formula rates for years 2023, 2022\nand 2021. The probable refunds to affiliated and nonaffiliated customers are reflected as Deferred Credits and Other\nNoncurrent Liabilities on the balance sheets. Refunds probable to be received by affiliated companies, resulting in a reduction\nto affiliated transmission expense, were deferred as an increase to Regulatory Liabilities or a reduction to Regulatory Assets on\nthe balance sheets where management expects that refunds would be returned to retail customers through authorized retail\njurisdiction rider mechanisms. The FERC directed cash refunds with interest related to the 2021 rate year to occur through the\nannual update for the next rate year, which will be invoiced by PJM and SPP primarily in 2025. The Registrants have not yet\nbeen directed to make cash refunds related to the 2022 or 2023 rate years.\nThe FERC's January 2024 orders reduced AEP and AEPTCo's 2023 pretax net income by approximately $76 million and\n$74 million, respectively. The impact of the FERC's orders on the pretax net income of AEP's remaining Registrant\nSubsidiaries was not material.\nRequest to Update SWEPCo Generation Depreciation Rates (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo)\nIn October 2023, SWEPCo filed an application to revise its generation wholesale customer’s contracts to reflect an increase in\nthe annual revenue requirement of approximately $5 million for updated depreciation rates and allow for the return on and of\nFERC customers jurisdictional share of regulatory assets associated with retired plants. In November 2023, certain intervenors\nfiled a motion with the FERC protesting and recommending the rejection of SWEPCo’s filings. In December 2023, the FERC\nissued an order approving the proposed rates effective January 1, 2024, subject to further review and refund and established\nhearing and settlement proceedings. If SWEPCo is unable to recover the remaining regulatory assets associated with retired\nplants, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\n201\n5. EFFECTS OF REGULATION\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.\nCoal-Fired Generation Plants (Applies to AEP, PSO and SWEPCo)\nCompliance with extensive environmental regulations requires significant capital investment in environmental monitoring,\ninstallation of pollution control equipment, emission fees, disposal costs and permits. Management continuously evaluates cost\nestimates of complying with these regulations which has resulted in, and in the future may result in, a decision to retire coal-\nfired generating facilities earlier than their currently estimated useful lives.\nManagement is seeking or will seek regulatory recovery, as necessary, for any net book value remaining when the plants are\nretired. To the extent the net book value of these generation assets is not deemed recoverable, it could materially reduce future\nnet income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nRegulated Generating Units that have been Retired\nSWEPCo\nIn December 2021, the Dolet Hills Power Station was retired. As part of the 2020 Texas Base Rate Case, the PUCT authorized\nrecovery of SWEPCo’s Texas jurisdictional share of the Dolet Hills Power Station through 2046, but denied SWEPCo the\nability to earn a return on this investment resulting in a disallowance of $12 million in 2021. As part of the 2021 Arkansas Base\nRate Case, the APSC authorized recovery of SWEPCo’s Arkansas jurisdictional share of the Dolet Hills Power Station through\n2027, but denied SWEPCo the ability to earn a return on this investment resulting in a disallowance of $2 million in the second\nquarter of 2022. Also, the APSC did not rule on the prudency of the early retirement of the Dolet Hills Power Station, which\nwill be addressed in a future proceeding. As part of the 2020 Louisiana Base Rate Case, the LPSC authorized the recovery of\nSWEPCo’s Louisiana share of the Dolet Hills Power Station, through a separate rider, through 2032, but did not rule on the\nprudency of the early retirement of the plant, which is being addressed in a separate proceeding. See “2020 Texas Base Rate\nCase” and “2020 Louisiana Base Rate Case” sections of Note 4 for additional information.\nIn March 2023, the Pirkey Plant was retired. As part of the 2020 Louisiana Base Rate Case, the LPSC authorized the recovery\nof SWEPCo’s Louisiana jurisdictional share of the Pirkey Plant, through a separate rider, through 2032. As part of the 2021\nArkansas Base Rate Case, the APSC granted SWEPCo regulatory asset treatment. SWEPCo will request recovery including a\nweighted average cost of capital carrying charge through a future proceeding. In July 2023, Texas ALJs issued a proposal for\ndecision that concluded the decision to retire the Pirkey Plant was prudent. In September 2023, the PUCT rejected the ALJs\nproposal for decision concluding the retirement of the Pirkey Plant was prudent. In the open meeting, the commissioners\nexpressed their concerns that the analysis in support of SWEPCo’s decision to retire the Pirkey Plant was not robust enough and\nthat SWEPCo should have re-evaluated the decision following Winter Storm Uri. The treatment of the cost of recovery of the\nPirkey Plant is expected to be addressed in a future rate case. As of December 31, 2023, the Texas jurisdictional share of the\nnet book value of the Pirkey Plant was $67 million. To the extent any portion of the Texas jurisdictional share of the net book\nvalue of the Pirkey Plant is not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nRegulated Generating Units to be Retired\nPSO\nIn 2014, PSO received final approval from the Federal EPA to close Northeastern Plant, Unit 3, in 2026. The plant was\noriginally scheduled to close in 2040. As a result of the early retirement date, PSO revised the useful life of Northeastern Plant,\nUnit 3, to the projected retirement date of 2026 and the incremental depreciation is being deferred as a regulatory asset. As part\nof the 2022 Oklahoma Base Rate Case, PSO will continue to recover Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 through 2040.\nSWEPCo\nIn November 2020, management announced that it will cease using coal at the Welsh Plant in 2028. As a result of the\nannouncement, SWEPCo began recording a regulatory asset for accelerated depreciation.\nThe table below summarizes the net book value including CWIP, before cost of removal and materials and supplies, as of\nDecember 31, 2023, of generating facilities planned for early retirement:\n202\nAccelerated\nNet Book Depreciation Cost of Removal Projected Current Authorized Annual\nPlant Value Regulatory Asset Regulatory Liability Retirement Date Recovery Period Depreciation (a)\n(dollars in millions)\nNortheastern Plant, Unit 3 $ 104.5 $ 164.2 $ 20.5 (b) 2026 (c) $ 15.0\nWelsh Plant, Units 1 and 3 352.0 125.6 58.2 (d) 2028 (e) (f) 38.6\n(a) Represents the amount of annual depreciation that has been collected from customers over the prior 12-month period.\n(b) Includes Northeastern Plant, Unit 4, which was retired in 2016. Removal of Northeastern Plant, Unit 4, will be performed with the removal of\nNortheastern Plant, Unit 3, after retirement.\n(c) Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 is currently being recovered through 2040.\n(d) Includes Welsh Plant, Unit 2, which was retired in 2016. Removal of Welsh Plant, Unit 2, will be performed with the removal of Welsh Plant, Units 1\nand 3, after retirement.\n(e) Represents projected retirement date of coal assets, units are being evaluated for conversion to natural gas after 2028.\n(f) Unit 1 is being recovered through 2027 in the Louisiana jurisdiction and through 2037 in the Arkansas and Texas jurisdictions. Unit 3 is being\nrecovered through 2032 in the Louisiana jurisdiction and through 2042 in the Arkansas and Texas jurisdictions.\nDolet Hills Power Station and Related Fuel Operations (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo)\nIn December 2021, the Dolet Hills Power Station was retired. While in operation, DHLC provided 100% of the fuel supply to\nDolet Hills Power Station. The remaining book value of Dolet Hills Power Station non-fuel related assets are recoverable by\nSWEPCo through rate riders. As of December 31, 2023, SWEPCo’s share of the net investment in the Dolet Hills Power\nStation was $103 million, including materials and supplies, net of cost of removal collected in rates. Fuel costs incurred by the\nDolet Hills Power Station are recoverable by SWEPCo through active fuel clauses and are subject to prudency determinations\nby the various commissions. After closure of the DHLC mining operations and the Dolet Hills Power Station, additional\nreclamation and other land-related costs incurred by DHLC and Oxbow will continue to be billed to SWEPCo and included in\nexisting fuel clauses. As of December 31, 2023, SWEPCo had a net under-recovered fuel balance of $77 million, inclusive of\ncosts related to the Dolet Hills Power Station billed by DHLC, but excluding impacts of the February 2021 severe winter\nweather event.\nIn March 2021, the LPSC issued an order allowing SWEPCo to recover up to $20 million of fuel costs in 2021 and defer\napproximately $35 million of additional costs with a recovery period to be determined at a later date. In August 2022, the\nLPSC staff filed testimony recommending fuel disallowances of up to $55 million, including denial of recovery of the\n$35 million deferral, with refunds to customers over five years. In February 2024, an ALJ issued a final recommendation\nwhich included a proposed $55 million refund to customers and the denial of recovery of the $35 million deferral. SWEPCo\nfiled a motion to present oral arguments with the LPSC to dispute the ALJ’s recommendations. Management believes its\nfinancial statements adequately address the impact of the LPSC staff and ALJ recommendations. A decision from the LPSC is\nexpected in the first quarter of 2024.\nIn March 2021, the APSC approved fuel rates that provide recovery of $20 million for the Arkansas share of the 2021 Dolet\nHills Power Station fuel costs over five years through the existing fuel clause.\nIn September 2023, the PUCT approved an unopposed settlement agreement that provides recovery of $48 million of Oxbow\nmine related costs through 2035.\nIf any of these costs are not recoverable or customer refunds are required, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and\nimpact financial condition.\nPirkey Plant and Related Fuel Operations (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo)\nIn March 2023, the Pirkey Plant was retired. SWEPCo is recovering, or will seek recovery of, the remaining net book value of\nPirkey Plant non-fuel costs. As of December 31, 2023, SWEPCo’s share of the net investment in the Pirkey Plant was\n$182 million, including materials and supplies, net of cost of removal. See the “Regulated Generating Units that have been\nRetired” section above for additional information. Fuel costs are recovered through active fuel clauses and are subject to\nprudency determinations by the various commissions. As of March 31, 2023, SWEPCo fuel deliveries, including billings of all\nfixed costs, from Sabine ceased. Additionally, as of December 31, 2023, SWEPCo had a net under-recovered fuel balance of\n$77 million, inclusive of costs related to the Pirkey Plant billed by Sabine, but excluding impacts of the February 2021 severe\nwinter weather event. Remaining operational, reclamation and other land-related costs incurred by Sabine will be billed to\nSWEPCo and included in existing fuel clauses.\nIn July 2023, the LPSC ordered that a separate proceeding be established to review the prudence of the decision to retire the\nPirkey Plant, including the costs included in fuel for years starting in 2019 and after.

COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.\nThe Registrants are subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the\nRegistrants’ business activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the\nenvironment. The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against the Registrants cannot be\npredicted. Management accrues contingent liabilities only when management concludes that it is both probable that a liability\nhas been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When\nmanagement determines that it is not probable, but rather reasonably possible that a liability has been incurred at the date of the\nfinancial statements, management discloses such contingencies and the possible loss or range of loss if such estimate can be\nmade. Any estimated range is based on currently available information and involves elements of judgment and significant\nuncertainties. Any estimated range of possible loss may not represent the maximum possible loss exposure. Circumstances\nchange over time and actual results may vary significantly from estimates.\nFor current proceedings not specifically discussed below, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising\nfrom such proceedings would have a material effect on the financial statements.\nCOMMITMENTS (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas and AEPTCo)\nAEP subsidiaries have substantial commitments for fuel, energy and capacity contracts as part of the normal course of business.\nCertain contracts contain penalty provisions for early termination.\nIn accordance with the accounting guidance for “Commitments”, the following tables summarize the Registrants’ actual\ncontractual commitments as of December 31, 2023:\nLess Than After\nContractual Commitments - AEP 1 Year 2-3 Years 4-5 Years 5 Years Total\n(in millions)\nFuel Purchase Contracts (a) $ 1,126.7 $ 1,260.7 $ 313.5 $ 256.1 $ 2,957.0\nEnergy and Capacity Purchase Contracts 186.4 412.3 308.8 419.8 1,327.3\nTotal $ 1,313.1 $ 1,673.0 $ 622.3 $ 675.9 $ 4,284.3\nLess Than After\nContractual Commitments - APCo 1 Year 2-3 Years 4-5 Years 5 Years Total\n(in millions)\nFuel Purchase Contracts (a) $ 595.2 $ 626.1 $ 99.5 $ — $ 1,320.8\nEnergy and Capacity Purchase Contracts 40.1 80.2 65.5 75.9 261.7\nTotal $ 635.3 $ 706.3 $ 165.0 $ 75.9 $ 1,582.5\nLess Than After\nContractual Commitments - I&M 1 Year 2-3 Years 4-5 Years 5 Years Total\n(in millions)\nFuel Purchase Contracts (a) $ 144.4 $ 232.3 $ 130.8 $ 241.6 $ 749.1\nEnergy and Capacity Purchase Contracts 127.0 253.8 236.6 182.2 799.6\nTotal $ 271.4 $ 486.1 $ 367.4 $ 423.8 $ 1,548.7\nLess Than After\nContractual Commitments - OPCo 1 Year 2-3 Years 4-5 Years 5 Years Total\n(in millions)\nEnergy and Capacity Purchase Contracts $ 33.4 $ 66.6 $ 66.3 $ 102.6 $ 268.9\n219\nLess Than After\nContractual Commitments - PSO 1 Year 2-3 Years 4-5 Years 5 Years Total\n(in millions)\nFuel Purchase Contracts (a) $ 31.5 $ 36.6 $ — $ — $ 68.1\nEnergy and Capacity Purchase Contracts 56.6 139.3 88.0 56.3 340.2\nTotal $ 88.1 $ 175.9 $ 88.0 $ 56.3 $ 408.3\nLess Than After\nContractual Commitments - SWEPCo 1 Year 2-3 Years 4-5 Years 5 Years Total\n(in millions)\nFuel Purchase Contracts (a) $ 109.2 $ 48.1 $ — $ — $ 157.3\nEnergy and Capacity Purchase Contracts 16.4 26.2 2.2 — 44.8\nTotal $ 125.6 $ 74.3 $ 2.2 $ — $ 202.1\n(a) Represents contractual commitments to purchase coal, natural gas, uranium and other consumables as fuel for electric generation\nalong with related transportation of the fuel.\nGUARANTEES\nLiabilities for guarantees are recorded in accordance with the accounting guidance for “Guarantees.” There is no collateral held\nin relation to any guarantees. In the event any guarantee is drawn, there is no recourse to third-parties unless specified below.\nLetters of Credit (Applies to AEP, AEP Texas, APCo and I&M)\nStandby letters of credit are entered into with third-parties. These letters of credit are issued in the ordinary course of business\nand cover items such as natural gas and electricity risk management contracts, construction contracts, insurance programs,\nsecurity deposits and debt service reserves.\nAEP has $4 billion and $1 billion revolving credit facilities due in March 2027 and 2025, respectively, under which up to $1.2\nbillion may be issued as letters of credit on behalf of subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2023, no letters of credit were issued\nunder the revolving credit facility.\nAn uncommitted facility gives the issuer of the facility the right to accept or decline each request made under the facility. AEP\nissues letters of credit on behalf of subsidiaries under six uncommitted facilities totaling $450 million. The Registrants’\nmaximum future payments for letters of credit issued under the uncommitted facilities as of December 31, 2023 were as\nfollows:\nCompany Amount Maturity\n(in millions)\nAEP $ 257.0 January 2024 to November 2024\nAEP Texas 1.8 July 2024\nAPCo 6.3 September 2024\nI&M 2.9 September 2024\nIndemnifications and Other Guarantees\nContracts\nThe Registrants enter into certain types of contracts which require indemnifications. Typically these contracts include, but are\nnot limited to, sale agreements, lease agreements, purchase agreements and financing agreements. Generally, these agreements\nmay include, but are not limited to, indemnifications around certain tax, contractual and environmental matters. With respect to\nsale agreements, exposure generally does not exceed the sale price. As of December 31, 2023, there were no material liabilities\nrecorded for any indemnifications.\nAEPSC conducts power purchase-and-sale activity on behalf of APCo, I&M, KPCo and WPCo, who are jointly and severally\nliable for activity conducted on their behalf. AEPSC also conducts power purchase-and-sale activity on behalf of PSO and\nSWEPCo, who are jointly and severally liable for activity conducted on their behalf.\n220\nLease Obligations\nCertain Registrants lease equipment under master lease agreements. See “Master Lease Agreements” section of Note 13 for\nadditional information.\nENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCIES (Applies to All Registrants except AEPTCo)\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (Superfund) and State Remediation\nBy-products from the generation of electricity include materials such as ash, slag, sludge, low-level radioactive waste and\nSNF. Coal combustion by-products, which constitute the overwhelming percentage of these materials, are typically treated and\ndeposited in captive disposal facilities or are beneficially utilized. In addition, the generation plants and transmission and\ndistribution facilities have used asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls and other hazardous and non-hazardous materials. The\nRegistrants currently incur costs to dispose of these substances safely.\nSuperfund addresses clean-up of hazardous substances that are released to the environment. The Federal EPA administers the\nclean-up programs. Several states enacted similar laws. As of December 31, 2023, AGR, APCo, OPCo and SWEPCo are\nnamed as a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) for one, one, two and one sites, respectively, by the Federal EPA for which\nalleged liability is unresolved. There are 11 additional sites for which APCo, I&M, KPCo, OPCo and SWEPCo received\ninformation requests which could lead to PRP designation. In those instances where a PRP or defendant has been named,\ndisposal or recycling activities were in accordance with the then-applicable laws and regulations. Superfund does not recognize\ncompliance as a defense, but imposes strict liability on parties who fall within its broad statutory categories. Liability has been\nresolved for a number of sites with no significant effect on net income.\nManagement evaluates the potential liability for each Superfund site separately, but several general statements can be made\nabout potential future liability. Allegations that materials were disposed at a particular site are often unsubstantiated and the\nquantity of materials deposited at a site can be small and often non-hazardous. Although Superfund liability has been\ninterpreted by the courts as joint and several, typically many parties are named as PRPs for each site and several of the parties\nare financially sound enterprises. As of December 31, 2023, management’s estimates do not anticipate material clean-up costs\nfor identified Superfund sites.\nNUCLEAR CONTINGENCIES (APPLIES TO AEP AND I&M)\nI&M owns and operates the two-unit 2,296 MW Cook Plant under licenses granted by the NRC. I&M has a significant future\nfinancial commitment to dispose of SNF and to safely decommission and decontaminate the plant. The licenses to operate the\ntwo nuclear units at the Cook Plant expire in 2034 and 2037. Management is currently evaluating applying for license\nextensions for both units. The operation of a nuclear facility also involves special risks, potential liabilities and specific\nregulatory and safety requirements. By agreement, I&M is partially liable, together with all other electric utility companies that\nown nuclear generation units, for a nuclear power plant incident at any nuclear plant in the U.S. Should a nuclear incident\noccur at any nuclear power plant in the U.S., the resultant liability could be substantial.\nDecommissioning and Low-Level Waste Accumulation Disposal\nThe costs to decommission a nuclear plant are affected by NRC regulations and the SNF disposal program. Decommissioning\ncosts are accrued over the service life of Cook Plant. The most recent decommissioning cost study was performed in\n2021. According to that study, the estimated cost of decommissioning and disposal of low-level radioactive waste was $2.2\nbillion in 2021 non-discounted dollars, with additional ongoing costs of $7 million per year for post decommissioning storage\nof SNF and an eventual cost of $33 million for the subsequent decommissioning of the SNF storage facility, also in 2021 non-\ndiscounted dollars. I&M recovers estimated decommissioning costs for the Cook Plant in its rates. The amounts recovered in\nrates were $2 million, $2 million and $4 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. Decommissioning costs recovered from customers are deposited in external trusts.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the total decommissioning trust fund balances were $3.5 billion and $3.0 billion,\nrespectively. The increase in the trust fund balance was driven by favorable investment performance in 2023. Trust fund\nearnings increase the fund assets and may decrease the amount remaining to be recovered from customers. Trust fund losses\ndecrease the fund assets and may increase the amount remaining to be recovered from customers. The decommissioning costs\n(including unrealized gains and losses, interest and trust funds expenses) increase or decrease the recorded liability.\n221\nI&M continues to work with regulators and customers to establish rates designed to collect the estimated costs of\ndecommissioning the Cook Plant. However, future net income and cash flows would be reduced and financial condition could\nbe impacted if the cost of SNF disposal and decommissioning increases and cannot be recovered.\nSpent Nuclear Fuel Disposal\nThe federal government is responsible for permanent SNF disposal and assesses fees to nuclear plant owners for SNF\ndisposal. A fee of one-mill per KWh for fuel consumed after April 6, 1983 at the Cook Plant was collected from customers and\nremitted to the DOE through May 14, 2014. In May 2014, pursuant to court order from the U.S Court of Appeals for the\nDistrict of Columbia Circuit, the DOE adjusted the fee to $0. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, fees and related interest of\n$300 million and $286 million, respectively, for fuel consumed prior to April 7, 1983 were recorded as Long-term Debt and\nfunds collected from customers along with related earnings totaling $348 million and $330 million, respectively, to pay the fee,\nwere recorded as part of Spent Nuclear Fuel and Decommissioning Trusts on the balance sheets. I&M has not paid the\ngovernment the pre-April 1983 fees due to continued delays and uncertainties related to the federal disposal program.\nIn 2011, I&M signed a settlement agreement with the federal government which permits I&M to make annual filings to recover\ncertain SNF storage costs incurred as a result of the government’s delay in accepting SNF for permanent storage. Under the\nsettlement agreement, I&M received $21 million, $3 million and $14 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, to recover\ncosts and will be eligible to receive additional payment of annual claims for allowed costs that are incurred through December\n31, 2023. The proceeds reduced costs for dry cask storage. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, I&M deferred $12 million and\n$21 million, respectively, in Prepayments and Other Current Assets and $9 million and $3 million, respectively, in Deferred\nCharges and Other Noncurrent Assets on the balance sheets for dry cask storage and related operation and maintenance costs\nfor recovery under this agreement. See “Fair Value Measurements of Trust Assets for Decommissioning and SNF Disposal”\nsection of Note 11 for additional information.\nNuclear Insurance\nI&M carries nuclear property insurance of $2.7 billion to cover a nuclear incident at Cook Plant including coverage for\ndecontamination and stabilization, as well as premature decommissioning caused by a nuclear incident. Insurance coverage for\na nonnuclear property incident at Cook Plant is $500 million. Additional insurance provides coverage for a weekly indemnity\npayment resulting from an insured accidental outage. I&M utilizes industry mutual insurers for the placement of this insurance\ncoverage. Coverage from these industry mutual insurance programs require a contingent financial obligation of up to $42\nmillion for I&M, which is assessable if the insurer’s financial resources would be inadequate to pay for industry losses.\nThe Price-Anderson Act, extended through December 31, 2025, establishes insurance protection for public nuclear liability\narising from a nuclear incident of $16.3 billion and applies to any incident at a licensed reactor in the U.S. Commercially\navailable insurance, which must be carried for each licensed reactor, provides $500 million of primary coverage. In the event of\na nuclear incident at any nuclear plant in the U.S., the remainder of the liability would be provided by a deferred premium\nassessment of $332 million per nuclear incident on Cook Plant’s reactors payable in annual installments of $49 million. The\nnumber of incidents for which payments could be required is not limited.\nIn the event of an incident of a catastrophic nature, I&M is covered for public nuclear liability for the first $500 million through\ncommercially available insurance. The next level of liability coverage of up to $15.8 billion would be covered by claim\npremium assessments made under the Price-Anderson Act. In the event nuclear losses or liabilities are underinsured or exceed\naccumulated funds, I&M would seek recovery of those amounts from customers through a rate increase. If recovery from\ncustomers is not possible, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nOPERATIONAL CONTINGENCIES\nInsurance and Potential Losses\nThe Registrants maintain insurance coverage normal and customary for electric utilities, subject to various deductibles. The\nRegistrants also maintain property and casualty insurance that may cover certain physical damage or third-party injuries caused\nby cybersecurity incidents. Insurance coverage includes all risks of physical loss or damage to nonnuclear assets, subject to\ninsurance policy conditions and exclusions. Covered property generally includes power plants, substations, facilities and\ninventories. Excluded property generally includes transmission and distribution lines, poles and towers. The insurance\nprograms also generally provide coverage against loss arising from certain claims made by third-parties and are in excess of\nretentions absorbed by the Registrants. Coverage is generally provided by a combination of the protected cell of EIS and/or\nvarious industry mutual and/or commercial insurance carriers. See “Nuclear Contingencies” section above for additional\ninformation.\n222\nSome potential losses or liabilities may not be insurable or the amount of insurance carried may not be sufficient to meet\npotential losses and liabilities, including, but not limited to, liabilities relating to a cybersecurity incident or damage to the Cook\nPlant and costs of replacement power in the event of an incident at the Cook Plant. Future losses or liabilities, if they occur,\nwhich are not completely insured, unless recovered from customers, could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact\nfinancial condition.\nLitigation Related to Ohio House Bill 6 (HB 6) (Applies to AEP and OPCo)\nIn 2019, Ohio adopted and implemented HB 6 which benefits OPCo by authorizing rate recovery for certain costs including\nrenewable energy contracts and OVEC’s coal-fired generating units. OPCo engaged in lobbying efforts and provided testimony\nduring the legislative process in connection with HB 6. In July 2020, an investigation led by the U.S. Attorney’s Office\nresulted in a federal grand jury indictment of an Ohio legislator and associates in connection with an alleged racketeering\nconspiracy involving the adoption of HB 6. After AEP learned of the criminal allegations against the Ohio legislator and others\nrelating to HB 6, AEP, with assistance from outside advisors, conducted a review of the circumstances surrounding the passage\nof the bill. Management does not believe that AEP was involved in any wrongful conduct in connection with the passage of\nHB 6.\nIn August 2020, an AEP shareholder filed a putative class action lawsuit in the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of\nOhio against AEP and certain of its officers for alleged violations of securities laws. In December 2021, the district court\nissued an opinion and order dismissing the securities litigation complaint with prejudice, determining that the complaint failed\nto plead any actionable misrepresentations or omissions. The plaintiffs did not appeal the ruling.\nIn January 2021, an AEP shareholder filed a derivative action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio\npurporting to assert claims on behalf of AEP against certain AEP officers and directors. In February 2021, a second AEP\nshareholder filed a similar derivative action in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, Ohio. In April 2021, a third\nAEP shareholder filed a similar derivative action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio and a fourth AEP\nshareholder filed a similar derivative action in the Supreme Court for the State of New York, Nassau County. These derivative\ncomplaints allege the officers and directors made misrepresentations and omissions similar to those alleged in the putative\nsecurities class action lawsuit filed against AEP. The derivative complaints together assert claims for: (a) breach of fiduciary\nduty, (b) waste of corporate assets, (c) unjust enrichment, (d) breach of duty for insider trading and (e) contribution for\nviolations of sections 10(b) and 21D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and seek monetary damages and changes to\nAEP’s corporate governance and internal policies among other forms of relief. The court entered a scheduling order in the New\nYork state court derivative action staying the case other than with respect to briefing the motion to dismiss. AEP filed\nsubstantive and forum-based motions to dismiss in April 2022. In June 2022, the Ohio state court entered an order continuing\nthe stays of that case until the final resolution of the consolidated derivative actions pending in Ohio federal district court. In\nSeptember 2022, the New York state court granted the forum-based motion to dismiss with prejudice and the plaintiff\nsubsequently filed a notice of appeal with the New York appellate court. In January 2023, the New York plaintiff filed a\nmotion to intervene in the pending Ohio federal court action and withdrew his appeal in New York. The two derivative actions\npending in federal district court in Ohio have been consolidated and the plaintiffs in the consolidated action filed an amended\ncomplaint. AEP filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint and subsequently filed a brief in opposition to the New York\nplaintiffs’ motion to intervene in the consolidated action in Ohio. In March 2023, the federal district court issued an order\ngranting the motion to dismiss with prejudice and denying the New York plaintiffs’ motion to intervene. In April 2023, one of\nthe plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit of the Ohio federal district court order\ndismissing the consolidated action and denying the intervention. The defendants will continue to defend against the claims.\nManagement is unable to determine a range of potential losses that is reasonably possible of occurring.\nIn March 2021, AEP received a litigation demand letter from counsel representing a purported AEP shareholder. The litigation\ndemand letter was directed to the Board of Directors of AEP (AEP Board) and contained factual allegations involving HB 6 that\nwere generally consistent with those in the derivative litigation filed in state and federal court. The shareholder that sent the\nletter has since withdrawn the litigation demand, which is now terminated and of no further effect. In April 2023, AEP received\na litigation demand from counsel representing the purported AEP shareholder who filed the dismissed derivative action in New\nYork state court and unsuccessfully tried to intervene in the consolidated derivative actions in Ohio federal court. The litigation\ndemand letter is directed to the AEP Board and contains factual allegations involving HB 6 that are generally consistent with\nthose in the derivative litigation filed in state and federal court. The letter demands, among other things, that the AEP Board\nundertake an independent investigation into alleged legal violations by certain current and former directors and officers, and\nthat AEP commence a civil action for breaches of fiduciary duty and related claims against any individuals who allegedly\nharmed AEP. The AEP Board considered the 2023 litigation demand letter and formed a committee of the Board (the “Demand\nReview Committee”) to investigate, review, monitor and analyze the allegations in the letter and make a recommendation to the\n223\nAEP Board regarding a reasonable and appropriate response to the same. The AEP Board will act in response to the letter as\nappropriate. Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that is reasonably possible of occurring.\nIn May 2021, AEP received a subpoena from the SEC’s Division of Enforcement seeking various documents, including\ndocuments relating to the passage of HB 6 and documents relating to AEP’s policies and financial processes and controls. In\nAugust 2022, AEP received a second subpoena from the SEC seeking various additional documents relating to its ongoing\ninvestigation. AEP is cooperating fully with the SEC’s investigation, which has included taking testimony from certain\nindividuals and inquiries regarding Empowering Ohio’s Economy, Inc., which is a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization, and\nrelated disclosures. The SEC staff has advanced its discussions with certain parties involved in the investigation, including\nAEP, concerning the staff’s intentions regarding potential claims under the securities laws. AEP and the SEC are engaged in\ndiscussions about a possible resolution of the SEC’s investigation and potential claims under the securities laws. Any\nresolution or filed claims, the outcome of which cannot be predicted, may subject AEP to civil penalties and other remedial\nmeasures. Discussions are continuing and management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that is reasonably\npossible of occurring, but management does not believe the results of this investigation or a possible resolution thereof will\nhave a material impact on results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nClaims for Indemnification Made by Owners of the Gavin Power Station (Applies to AEP)\nIn November 2022, the Federal EPA issued a final decision denying Gavin Power LLC’s requested extension to allow a CCR\nsurface impoundment at the Gavin Power Station to continue to receive CCR and non-CCR waste streams after April 11, 2021\nuntil May 4, 2023 (the Gavin Denial). As part of the Gavin Denial, the Federal EPA made several assertions related to the CCR\nRule (see “Environmental Issues - CCR Rule” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations for additional information), including an assertion that the closure of the 300 acre unlined fly ash\nreservoir (FAR) is noncompliant with the CCR Rule in multiple respects. The Gavin Power Station was formerly owned and\noperated by AEP and was sold to Gavin Power LLC and Lightstone Generation LLC in 2017. Pursuant to the PSA, AEP\nmaintained responsibility to complete closure of the FAR in accordance with the closure plan approved by the Ohio EPA which\nwas completed in July 2021. The PSA contains indemnification provisions, pursuant to which the owners of the Gavin Power\nStation have notified AEP they believe they are entitled to indemnification for any damages that may result from these claims,\nincluding any future enforcement or litigation resulting from any determinations of noncompliance by the Federal EPA with\nvarious aspects of the CCR Rule consistent with the Gavin Denial. The owners of the Gavin Power Station have also sought\nindemnification for landowner claims for property damage allegedly caused by modifications to the FAR. Management does\nnot believe that the owners of the Gavin Power Station have any valid claim for indemnity or otherwise against AEP under the\nPSA. In addition, Gavin Power LLC, several AEP subsidiaries, and other parties have filed Petitions for Review of the Gavin\nDenial with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Management is unable to determine a range of\npotential losses that is reasonably possible of occurring. Gavin Power LLC has also filed a complaint with the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of Ohio, alleging various violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and asserting\nthat the Federal EPA, through its prior inaction, has waived and is estopped from raising certain objections raised in the Gavin\nDenial. Management cannot predict the outcome of that litigation.\n224\n7. ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND IMPAIRMENTS\nThe disclosures in this note apply to AEP unless indicated otherwise.\nACQUISITIONS\nDry Lake Solar Project (Generation & Marketing Segment) (Applies to AEP)\nIn March 2021, AEP acquired a 75% ownership interest in the Dry Lake Solar Project located in southern Nevada for\napproximately $114 million and the project was placed in-service in May 2021. In August 2023, Dry Lake was included in the\nsale of the competitive contracted renewables portfolio. See the “Disposition of the Competitive Contracted Renewables\nPortfolio” section below and Note 17 - Variable Interest Entities and Equity Method Investments for additional information.\nNorth Central Wind Energy Facilities (Vertically Integrated Utilities Segment) (Applies to AEP, PSO and SWEPCo)\nIn 2020, PSO and SWEPCo received regulatory approvals to acquire the NCWF, comprised of three Oklahoma wind facilities\ntotaling 1,484 MWs, on a fixed cost turn-key basis. PSO and SWEPCo own undivided interests of 45.5% and 54.5% of the\nNCWF, respectively. In total, the three wind facilities cost approximately $2 billion and consist of Traverse (998 MW),\nMaverick (287 MW) and Sundance (199 MW). Output from the NCWF serves retail load in PSO’s Oklahoma service territory\nand both retail and FERC wholesale load in SWEPCo’s service territories in Arkansas and Louisiana. The Oklahoma and\nLouisiana portions of the NCWF revenue requirement, net of PTC benefit, are recoverable through authorized riders until the\namounts are reflected in base rates. Recovery of the Arkansas portion of the NCWF revenue requirement through base rates\nwas approved by the APSC in May 2022. The NCWF are subject to various regulatory performance requirements. If these\nperformance requirements are not met, PSO and SWEPCo would recognize a regulatory liability to refund retail customers.\nIn April 2021, PSO and SWEPCo acquired respective undivided ownership interests in the entity that owned Sundance during\nits development and construction for $270 million. Sundance was placed in-service in April 2021. In September 2021, PSO\nand SWEPCo acquired respective undivided ownership interests in the entity that owned Maverick during its development and\nconstruction for $383 million. Maverick was placed in-service in September 2021. In March 2022, PSO and SWEPCo\nacquired respective undivided ownership interests in the entity that owned Traverse during its development and construction for\n$1.2 billion. Traverse was placed in-service in March 2022. Immediately following the acquisitions, PSO and SWEPCo\nliquidated the entities and simultaneously distributed the assets in proportion to their undivided ownership interests. PSO and\nSWEPCo apply the joint plant accounting model to account for their respective undivided interests in the assets, liabilities,\nrevenues and expenses of the NCWF projects.\nRock Falls Wind Facility (Vertically Integrated Utilities Segment) (Applies to AEP and PSO)\nIn November 2022, PSO entered into an agreement to acquire the Rock Falls Wind Facility. In February 2023, the FERC\napproved PSO’s acquisition of the Rock Falls Wind Facility under Section 203 of the Federal Power Act. In March 2023, PSO\nacquired an ownership interest in the entity that owned Rock Falls during its development and construction for $146 million. In\naccordance with the guidance for “Business Combinations,” AEP management determined that the acquisition of the Rock Falls\nWind Facility represents an asset acquisition. The lease obligations related to Rock Falls were not material at the time of\nacquisition. See the “2022 Oklahoma Base Rate Case” section of Note 4 for additional information.\nDISPOSITIONS\nTermination of Planned Disposition of KPCo and KTCo (Vertically Integrated Utilities and AEP Transmission Holdco\nSegments) (Applies to AEP and AEPTCo)\nIn October 2021, AEP entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (SPA) to sell KPCo and KTCo to Liberty Utilities Co., a\nsubsidiary of Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. (Liberty), for approximately a $2.85 billion enterprise value. The SPA was\nsubsequently amended in September 2022 to reduce the purchase price to approximately $2.646 billion. The sale required\napproval from the KPSC and from the FERC under Section 203 of the Federal Power Act. The SPA contained certain\ntermination rights if the closing of the sale did not occur by April 26, 2023.\nIn May 2022, the KPSC approved the sale of KPCo to Liberty subject to certain conditions contingent upon the closing of the\nsale. In December 2022, the FERC issued an order denying, without prejudice, authorization of the proposed sale stating the\napplicants failed to demonstrate the proposed transaction will not have an adverse effect on rates. In February 2023, a new\nfiling for approval under Section 203 of the Federal Power Act was submitted. In March 2023, the KPSC and other intervenors\nmade filings recommending the FERC reject AEP and Liberty’s new Section 203 application seeking approval of the sale.\n225\nAs a result of delays in the anticipated timing of the closing of the transaction and other factors, AEP recorded a $363 million\npretax loss on the expected sale of the Kentucky Operations for the year ended December 31, 2022. In April 2023, AEP,\nAEPTCo and Liberty entered into a Mutual Termination Agreement (Termination Agreement) terminating the SPA. The\nparties entered into the Termination Agreement as all of the conditions precedent to closing the sale could not be satisfied prior\nto April 26, 2023. Upon termination of the sale and reverting to a held and used model, in the first quarter of 2023, AEP\nreversed $28 million of expected transaction costs included in the $363 million pretax loss and was required to present its\ninvestment in the Kentucky Operations at the lower of fair value or historical carrying value which resulted in a $335 million\nreduction recorded in Property, Plant and Equipment. The reduced investment in KPCo’s assets is being amortized over the 30-\nyear average useful life of the KPCo assets.\nDisposition of the Competitive Contracted Renewables Portfolio (Generation & Marketing Segment) (Applies to AEP)\nIn February 2022, AEP management announced the initiation of a process to sell all or a portion of AEP Renewables’\ncompetitive contracted renewables portfolio (the portfolio) within the Generation & Marketing segment. In late January 2023,\nAEP received final bids from interested parties. In February 2023, AEP’s Board of Directors approved management’s plan to\nsell the portfolio and AEP signed an agreement with a nonaffiliated party.\nIn August 2023, AEP completed the sale of the entire portfolio to the nonaffiliated party and received cash proceeds of\napproximately $1.2 billion, net of taxes and transaction costs. AEP recorded a pretax loss of $93 million ($73 million after-tax)\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023 related to the sale.\nDisposition of Mineral Rights (Generation & Marketing Segment) (Applies to AEP)\nIn June 2022, AEP closed on the sale of certain mineral rights to a nonaffiliated third-party and received $120 million of\nproceeds. The sale resulted in a pretax gain of $116 million in the second quarter of 2022.\nIMPAIRMENTS\n2012 Texas Base Rate Case (Vertically Integrated Utilities Segment) (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo)\nIn December 2023, SWEPCo recorded a pretax, non-cash disallowance of $86 million in Asset Impairments and Other Related\nCharges on the statements of income due to regulatory disallowance of recovery of AFUDC on Turk Plant in the 2012 Texas\nBase Rate case. See the “2012 Texas Base Rate Case” section of Note 4 for additional information.\nNMRD (Generation & Marketing Segment) (Applies to AEP)\nIn December 2023, as a result of sale negotiations AEP determined a decline in the fair value of AEP’s investment in New\nMexico Renewable Development (NMRD) was other than temporary. In accordance with the accounting guidance for\n“Investment - Equity Method and Joint Ventures”, in the fourth quarter of 2023 AEP recorded a pretax other than temporary\nimpairment charge of $19 million which is presented in Equity Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries on AEP’s\nStatement of Income. AEP’s determination of fair value utilized the accounting guidance for Fair Value Measurement market\napproach to valuation and was based on negotiations to sell the investment to a non-affiliate. The carrying value of the\ninvestment in NMRD was not material to AEP as of December 31, 2023.\nFlat Ridge 2 Wind LLC (Generation & Marketing Segment) (Applies to AEP)\nIn 2019, AEP acquired a 50% ownership interest in five non-consolidated joint ventures, including Flat Ridge 2 Wind LLC\n(Flat Ridge 2), and two tax equity partnerships. The five non-consolidated joint ventures are jointly owned and operated by BP\nWind Energy. Flat Ridge 2 sells electricity to three counterparties through long-term PPAs.\nRegarding AEP’s investment in Flat Ridge 2, in June 2022, as a result of Flat Ridge 2’s deteriorating financial performance,\nsale negotiations and AEP’s ongoing evaluation and ultimate decision to exit the investment in the near term, AEP determined a\ndecline in the fair value of AEP’s investment in Flat Ridge 2 was other than temporary. In accordance with the accounting\nguidance for “Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures”, in the second quarter of 2022 AEP recorded a pretax other\nthan temporary impairment charge of $186 million which is presented in Equity Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated\nSubsidiaries on AEP’s Statement of Income. AEP’s determination of fair value utilized the accounting guidance for Fair Value\nMeasurement market approach to valuation and was based on negotiations to sell the investment to a non-affiliate. In the third\nquarter of 2022, AEP recorded an additional $2 million pretax other than temporary impairment charge which is presented in\nEquity Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries on AEP’s Statement of Income. In September 2022, AEP signed a\nPurchase and Sale Agreement with a nonaffiliate for AEP’s interest in Flat Ridge 2. The transaction closed in the fourth quarter\nof 2022 and had an immaterial impact on the financial statements at closing.\n226\n2020 Texas Base Rate Case (Vertically Integrated Utilities Segment) (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo)\nIn January 2022, the PUCT issued a final order which included a return of investment only for the recovery of the Dolet Hills\nPower Station. As a result of the final order, SWEPCo recorded a disallowance of $12 million associated with the lack of\nreturn on the Dolet Hills Power Station. In February 2022, SWEPCo filed a motion for rehearing with the PUCT challenging\ndenial of a reasonable return or carrying costs on the Dolet Hills Power Station among other items. In April 2022, the PUCT\ndenied the motion for rehearing. In May 2022, SWEPCo filed a petition for review with the Texas District Court seeking a\njudicial review of the several errors challenged in the PUCT’s final order. See “2020 Texas Base Rate Case” section of Note 4\nfor additional information.\n227\n8. BENEFIT PLANS\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants except AEPTCo unless indicated otherwise.\nFor a discussion of investment strategy, investment limitations, target asset allocations and the classification of investments\nwithin the fair value hierarchy, see “Fair Value Measurements of Assets and Liabilities” and “Investments Held in Trust for\nFuture Liabilities” sections of Note 1.\nAEPSC sponsors a qualified pension plan and two unfunded non-qualified pension plans. Substantially all AEP subsidiary\nemployees are covered by the qualified plan or both the qualified and a non-qualified pension plan. AEPSC also sponsors\nOPEB plans to provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees.\nDue to the Registrant Subsidiaries’ participation in AEP’s benefit plans, the assumptions used by the actuary, with the\nexception of the rate of compensation increase, and the accounting for the plans by each subsidiary are the same. This section\ndetails the assumptions that apply to all Registrants and the rate of compensation increase for each Registrant.\nThe Registrants recognize the funded status associated with defined benefit pension and OPEB plans on the balance\nsheets. Disclosures about the plans are required by the “Compensation – Retirement Benefits” accounting guidance. The\nRegistrants recognize an asset for a plan’s overfunded status or a liability for a plan’s underfunded status, and recognize, as a\ncomponent of other comprehensive income, the changes in the funded status of the plan that arise during the year that are not\nrecognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. The Registrants record a regulatory asset instead of other\ncomprehensive income for qualifying benefit costs of regulated operations that for rate-making purposes are deferred for future\nrecovery. The cumulative funded status adjustment is equal to the remaining unrecognized deferrals for unamortized actuarial\nlosses or gains, prior service costs and transition obligations, such that remaining deferred costs result in an AOCI equity\nreduction or regulatory asset and deferred gains result in an AOCI equity addition or regulatory liability.\nActuarial Assumptions for Benefit Obligations\nThe weighted-average assumptions used in the measurement of the Registrants’ benefit obligations are shown in the following\ntables:\nPension Plans OPEB\nDecember 31,\nAssumption 2023 2022 2023 2022\nDiscount Rate 5.15 % 5.50 % 5.15 % 5.50 %\nInterest Crediting Rate 4.00 % 4.25 % NA NA\nNA Not applicable.\nAssumption – Rate of Compensation Increase (a) - Pension Plans\nAEP\nAEP Texas APCo I&M OPCo PSO SWEPCo\nDecember 31, 2023 5.05 % 5.20 % 4.95 % 5.05 % 5.45 % 5.20 % 5.00 %\nDecember 31, 2022 5.05 % 5.15 % 4.90 % 5.00 % 5.35 % 5.15 % 5.00 %\n(a) Rates are for base pay only. In addition, an amount is added to reflect target incentive compensation for exempt employees and\novertime and incentive pay for nonexempt employees.\nA duration-based method is used to determine the discount rate for the plans. A hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate\nbonds is constructed with cash flows matching the benefit plan liability. The composite yield on the hypothetical bond portfolio\nis used as the discount rate for the plan. The discount rate is the same for each Registrant.\nFor 2023, the rate of compensation increase assumed varies with the age of the employee, ranging from 3% per year to 11.5%\nper year, with the average increase shown in the table above. The compensation increase rates reflect variations in each\nRegistrants’ population participating in the pension plan.\n228\nActuarial Assumptions for Net Periodic Benefit Costs\nThe weighted-average assumptions used in the measurement of each Registrants’ benefit costs are shown in the following\ntables:\nPension Plans OPEB\nYear Ended December 31,\nAssumption 2023 2022 2021 2023 2022 2021\nDiscount Rate 5.50 % 2.90 % 2.50 % 5.50 % 2.90 % 2.55 %\nInterest Crediting Rate 4.25 % 4.00 % 4.00 % NA NA NA\nExpected Return on Plan Assets 7.50 % 5.25 % 4.75 % 7.25 % 5.50 % 4.75 %\nNA Not applicable.\nAssumption – Rate of Compensation Increase (a) - Pension Plans\nAEP AEP Texas APCo I&M OPCo PSO SWEPCo\nDecember 31, 2023 5.05 % 5.20 % 4.95 % 5.05 % 5.45 % 5.20 % 5.00 %\nDecember 31, 2022 5.05 % 5.15 % 4.90 % 5.00 % 5.35 % 5.15 % 5.00 %\nDecember 31, 2021 5.10 % 5.10 % 4.85 % 5.00 % 5.30 % 5.10 % 4.95 %\n(a) Rates are for base pay only. In addition, an amount is added to reflect target incentive compensation for exempt employees and\novertime and incentive pay for nonexempt employees.\nThe expected return on plan assets was determined by evaluating historical returns, the current investment climate (yield on\nfixed income securities and other recent investment market indicators), rate of inflation, third-party forecasts and current\nprospects for economic growth. The expected return on plan assets is the same for each Registrant.\nThe health care trend rate assumptions used for OPEB plans measurement purposes are shown below:\nHealth Care Trend Rates December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nInitial 7.00 % 7.50 %\nUltimate 4.50 % 4.50 %\nYear Ultimate Reached 2030 2029\nSignificant Concentrations of Risk within Plan Assets\nIn addition to establishing the target asset allocation of plan assets, the investment policy also places restrictions on securities to\nlimit significant concentrations within plan assets. The investment policy establishes guidelines that govern maximum market\nexposure, security restrictions, prohibited asset classes, prohibited types of transactions, minimum credit quality, average\nportfolio credit quality, portfolio duration and concentration limits. The guidelines were established to mitigate the risk of loss\ndue to significant concentrations in any investment. Management monitors the plans to control security diversification and\nensure compliance with the investment policy. As of December 31, 2023, the assets were invested in compliance with all\ninvestment limits. See “Investments Held in Trust for Future Liabilities” section of Note 1 for limit details.\nBenefit Plan Obligations, Plan Assets, Funded Status and Amounts Recognized on the Balance Sheets\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the pension plans had an actuarial loss primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate,\nand to a lesser extent the effect of demographic experience (updated census data on January 1, 2023). These losses were\npartially offset by decreasing the cash balance account interest crediting rate. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the\nOPEB plans had an actuarial loss primarily due to discount rates, as well as actual net benefit payments above expected. These\nlosses were partially offset by updated per capita cost assumptions. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the pension plans\nhad an actuarial gain primarily due to an increase in the discount rate and was partially offset by increases in the assumed lump\nsum conversion rate and cash balance account interest crediting rate. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the OPEB plans\nhad an actuarial gain primarily due to an increase in the discount rate and updated per capita cost assumptions.

This qualified\nplan offers participants an opportunity to contribute a portion of their pay, includes features under Section 401(k) of the Internal\nRevenue Code and provides for company matching contributions. The matching contributions to the plan are 100% of the first\n1% of eligible employee contributions and 70% of the next 5% of contributions.\nThe following table provides the cost for matching contributions to the retirement savings plans by Registrant:\nYear Ended December 31, AEP AEP Texas APCo I&M OPCo PSO SWEPCo\n(in millions)\n2023 $ 87.9 $ 7.1 $ 8.4 $ 11.0 $ 8.2 $ 5.3 $ 6.7\n2022 81.9 6.5 7.8 11.1 7.7 4.7 6.4\n2021 79.9 6.4 7.6 10.9 7.2 4.6 6.4\nUMWA Benefits\nHealth and Welfare Benefits (Applies to AEP and APCo)\nAEP provides health and welfare benefits negotiated with the UMWA for certain unionized employees, retirees and their\nsurvivors who meet eligibility requirements. APCo also provides the same UMWA health and welfare benefits for certain\nunionized mining retirees and their survivors who meet eligibility requirements. AEP and APCo administer the health and\nwelfare benefits and pay them from their general assets.\nMultiemployer Pension Benefits (Applies to AEP)\nUMWA pension benefits are provided through the United Mine Workers of America 1974 Pension Plan (Employer\nIdentification Number: 52-1050282, Plan Number 002), a multiemployer plan. The UMWA pension benefits are administered\nby a board of trustees appointed in equal numbers by the UMWA and the Bituminous Coal Operators’ Association (BCOA), an\nindustry bargaining association. AEP makes contributions to the United Mine Workers of America 1974 Pension Plan based on\nprovisions in its labor agreement and the plan documents. The UMWA pension plan is different from single-employer plans as\nan employer’s contributions may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers. A withdrawing\nemployer may be subject to a withdrawal liability, which is calculated based upon that employer’s share of the plan’s unfunded\nbenefit obligations. If an employer fails to make required contributions or if its payments in connection with its withdrawal\nliability fall short of satisfying its share of the plan’s unfunded benefit obligations, the remaining employers may be allocated a\ngreater share of the remaining unfunded plan obligations. Under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA), the UMWA\npension plan is in Critical Status for the plan year beginning July 1, 2023 and was in Critical Status for the plan year beginning\nJuly 1, 2022. As required under the PPA, the Plan adopted a Rehabilitation Plan in 2015. The Rehabilitation Plan has been\nupdated annually, most recently in April 2023.\n242\nAEP affiliates contributed $396 thousand, $329 thousand and $339 thousand to the United Mine Workers of America 1974\nPension Plan for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The contributions did not include\nsurcharges. An AEP affiliate, Cook Coal Terminal (CCT), was listed in the plan’s 2021 Form 5500 as providing more than 5\npercent of the total contributions for the plan year ending June 30, 2022. The plan’s 2022 Form 5500 is expected to be filed in\nthe second quarter of 2024.\nUnder the terms of the UMWA pension plan, contributions will be required to continue beyond the January 25, 2025 expiration\nof the current collective bargaining agreement between the CCT facility and the UMWA, whether or not the term of that\nagreement is extended or a subsequent agreement is entered, so long as both the UMWA pension plan remains in effect and an\nAEP affiliate continues to operate the facility covered by the current collective bargaining agreement. The contribution rate\napplicable would be determined in accordance with the terms of the UMWA pension plan by reference to the National\nBituminous Coal Wage Agreement, subject to periodic revisions, between the UMWA and the BCOA. If the UMWA pension\nplan would terminate or an AEP affiliate would cease operation of the facility without arranging for a successor operator to\nassume its liability, the withdrawal liability obligation would be triggered.\nAEP records a UMWA pension withdrawal liability on the balance sheet that is re-measured annually and is the estimated value\nof the company’s anticipated contributions toward its proportionate share of the plan’s unfunded vested liabilities. As of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the liability balance was $13 million and $12 million, respectively. AEP recovers the estimated\nvalue of its UMWA pension withdrawal liability through fuel clauses in certain regulated jurisdictions. AEP records a\nregulatory asset on the balance sheets when the UMWA pension withdrawal liability exceeds the cumulative billings collected\nand a regulatory liability on the balance sheets when the cumulative billings collected exceed the withdrawal liability. If any\nportion of the UMWA pension withdrawal liability is not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and\nimpact financial condition.\n243\n9. BUSINESS SEGMENTS\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.\nAEP’s Reportable Segments\nAEP’s primary business is the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity. Within its Vertically Integrated Utilities\nsegment, AEP centrally dispatches generation assets and manages its overall utility operations on an integrated basis because of\nthe substantial impact of cost-based rates and regulatory oversight.

Other activities are insignificant. The Registrant Subsidiaries’ operations are managed on an\nintegrated basis because of the substantial impact of cost-based rates and regulatory oversight on the business process, cost\nstructures and operating results.\nAEPTCo’s Reportable Segments\nAEPTCo Parent is the holding company of seven FERC-regulated transmission-only electric utilities. The seven State Transcos\nhave been identified as operating segments of AEPTCo under the accounting guidance for “Segment Reporting.” The State\nTranscos business consists of developing, constructing and operating transmission facilities at the request of the RTOs in which\nthey operate and in replacing and upgrading facilities, assets and components of the existing AEP transmission system as\nneeded to maintain reliability standards and provide service to AEP’s wholesale and retail customers. The State Transcos are\nregulated for rate-making purposes exclusively by the FERC and earn revenues through tariff rates charged for the use of their\nelectric transmission systems.\nAEPTCo’s Chief Operating Decision Maker makes operating decisions, allocates resources to and assesses performance-based\non these operating segments. The State Transcos operating segments all have similar economic characteristics and meet all of\nthe criteria under the accounting guidance for “Segment Reporting” to be aggregated into one operating segment. As a result,\nAEPTCo has one reportable segment. The remainder of AEPTCo’s activity is presented in AEPTCo Parent. While not\nconsidered a reportable segment, AEPTCo Parent represents the activity of the holding company which primarily relates to debt\nfinancing activity and general corporate activities.\n246\nThe tables below present AEPTCo’s reportable segment income statement information for the years ended December 31, 2023,\n2022 and 2021 and reportable segment balance sheet information as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nAEPTCo Reconciling AEPTCo\nState Transcos Parent Adjustments Consolidated\n2023 (in millions)\nRevenues from:\nExternal Customers $ 354.2 $ — $ — $ 354.2\nSales to AEP Affiliates 1,317.8 — — 1,317.8\nTotal Revenues $ 1,672.0 $ — $ — $ 1,672.0\nDepreciation and Amortization $ 393.8 $ — $ — $ 393.8\nInterest Income 3.8 218.0 (214.8) (a) 7.0\nAllowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction 83.2 — — 83.2\nInterest Expense 194.2 215.1 (214.8) (a) 194.5\nIncome Tax Expense 145.7 1.4 — 147.1\nNet Income $ 612.9 $ 1.3 (b) $ — $ 614.2\nGross Property Additions $ 1,503.1 $ — $ — $ 1,503.1\nTotal Assets $ 15,120.6 $ 5,486.6 (c) $ (5,534.7) (d) $ 15,072.5\nAEPTCo Reconciling AEPTCo\nState Transcos Parent Adjustments Consolidated\n2022 (in millions)\nRevenues from:\nExternal Customers $ 340.9 $ — $ — $ 340.9\nSales to AEP Affiliates 1,283.8 — — 1,283.8\nOther Revenues (0.2) — — (0.2)\nTotal Revenues $ 1,624.5 $ — $ — $ 1,624.5\nDepreciation and Amortization $ 346.2 $ — $ — $ 346.2\nInterest Income 0.7 177.8 (176.9) (a) 1.6\nAllowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction 70.7 — — 70.7\nInterest Expense 162.5 177.1 (176.9) (a) 162.7\nIncome Tax Expense 169.1 — — 169.1\nNet Income $ 594.2 $ — (b) $ — $ 594.2\nGross Property Additions $ 1,468.3 $ — $ — $ 1,468.3\nTotal Assets $ 13,875.6 $ 4,817.4 (c) $ (4,878.8) (d) $ 13,814.2\nAEPTCo Reconciling AEPTCo\nState Transcos Parent Adjustments Consolidated\n2021 (in millions)\nRevenues from:\nExternal Customers $ 315.1 $ — $ — $ 315.1\nSales to AEP Affiliates 1,153.9 — — 1,153.9\nOther Revenues 0.3 — — 0.3\nTotal Revenues $ 1,469.3 $ — $ — $ 1,469.3\nDepreciation and Amortization $ 297.3 $ — $ — $ 297.3\nInterest Income 0.1 158.1 (157.7) (a) 0.5\nAllowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction 67.2 — — 67.2\nInterest Expense 141.2 157.7 (157.7) (a) 141.2\nIncome Tax Expense 144.1 — — 144.1\nNet Income $ 591.5 $ 0.2 (b) $ — $ 591.7\nGross Property Additions $ 1,442.7 $ — $ — $ 1,442.7\n(a) Elimination of intercompany interest income/interest expense on affiliated debt arrangement.\n(b) Includes elimination of AEPTCo Parent’s equity earnings in the State Transcos.\n(c) Primarily relates to Notes Receivable from the State Transcos.\n(d) Primarily relates to elimination of Notes Receivable from the State Transcos.\n247\n10. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise. For the periods presented, AEPTCo did not\nhave any derivative and hedging activity.\nOBJECTIVES FOR UTILIZATION OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\nAEPSC is agent for and transacts on behalf of certain AEP subsidiaries, including the Registrant Subsidiaries. AEPEP is agent\nfor and transacts on behalf of other AEP subsidiaries.\nThe Registrants are exposed to certain market risks as major power producers and participants in the electricity, capacity,\nnatural gas, coal and emission allowance markets. These risks include commodity price risks which may be subject to capacity\nrisk, interest rate risk and credit risk. These risks represent the risk of loss that may impact the Registrants due to changes in the\nunderlying market prices or rates. Management utilizes derivative instruments to manage these risks.\nSTRATEGIES FOR UTILIZATION OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO ACHIEVE OBJECTIVES\nRisk Management Strategies\nThe strategy surrounding the use of derivative instruments primarily focuses on managing risk exposures, future cash flows and\ncreating value utilizing both economic and formal hedging strategies. The risk management strategies also include the use of\nderivative instruments for trading purposes which focus on seizing market opportunities to create value driven by expected\nchanges in the market prices of the commodities. To accomplish these objectives, the Registrants primarily employ risk\nmanagement contracts including physical and financial forward purchase-and-sale contracts and, to a lesser extent, OTC swaps\nand options. Not all risk management contracts meet the definition of a derivative under the accounting guidance for\n“Derivatives and Hedging.” Derivative risk management contracts elected normal under the normal purchases and normal sales\nscope exception are not subject to the requirements of this accounting guidance.\nThe Registrants utilize power, capacity, coal, natural gas, interest rate and, to a lesser extent, heating oil, gasoline and other\ncommodity contracts to manage the risk associated with the energy business. The Registrants utilize interest rate derivative\ncontracts in order to manage the interest rate exposure associated with the commodity portfolio. For disclosure purposes, such\nrisks are grouped as “Commodity,” as these risks are related to energy risk management activities. The Registrants also utilize\nderivative contracts to manage interest rate risk associated with debt financing. For disclosure purposes, these risks are grouped\nas “Interest Rate.” The amount of risk taken is determined by the Commercial Operations, Energy Supply and Finance groups\nin accordance with established risk management policies as approved by the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors.\nThe following table represents the gross notional volume of the Registrants’ outstanding derivative contracts:\nNotional Volume of Derivative Instruments\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nPrimary Risk AEP AEP\nExposure AEP Texas APCo I&M OPCo PSO SWEPCo AEP Texas APCo I&M OPCo PSO SWEPCo\n(in millions)\nCommodity:\nPower (MWhs) 246.8 — 16.8 5.9 2.2 4.1 2.9 226.8 — 17.9 4.2 2.5 2.9 2.2\nNatural Gas\n(MMBtus) 151.6 — 37.3 — — 34.9 17.9 77.1 — 1.9 — — 1.9 2.1\nHeating Oil and\nGasoline\n(Gallons) 6.5 1.8 1.0 0.6 1.2 0.7 0.9 6.9 1.9 1.0 0.7 1.4 0.9 1.0\nInterest Rate\n(USD) $ 80.1 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 99.9 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nInterest Rate on Long-\nterm Debt (USD) $ 1,300.0 $ 150.0 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 1,650.0 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 200.0 $ —\nFair Value Hedging Strategies (Applies to AEP)\nParent enters into interest rate derivative transactions as part of an overall strategy to manage the mix of fixed-rate and floating-\nrate debt. Certain interest rate derivative transactions effectively modify exposure to interest rate risk by converting a portion of\nfixed-rate debt to a floating-rate. Provided specific criteria are met, these interest rate derivatives may be designated as fair\nvalue hedges.\n248\nCash Flow Hedging Strategies\nThe Registrants utilize cash flow hedges on certain derivative transactions for the purchase and sale of power (“Commodity”) in\norder to manage the variable price risk related to forecasted purchases and sales. Management monitors the potential impacts of\ncommodity price changes and, where appropriate, enters into derivative transactions to protect profit margins for a portion of\nfuture electricity sales and purchases. The Registrants do not hedge all commodity price risk.\nThe Registrants utilize a variety of interest rate derivative transactions in order to manage interest rate risk exposure. The\nRegistrants also utilize interest rate derivative contracts to manage interest rate exposure related to future borrowings of fixed-\nrate debt. The Registrants do not hedge all interest rate exposure.\nACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND THE IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe accounting guidance for “Derivatives and Hedging” requires recognition of all qualifying derivative instruments as either\nassets or liabilities on the balance sheets at fair value. The fair values of derivative instruments accounted for using MTM\naccounting or hedge accounting are based on exchange prices and broker quotes. If a quoted market price is not available, the\nestimate of fair value is based on the best information available including valuation models that estimate future energy prices\nbased on existing market and broker quotes and other assumptions. In order to determine the relevant fair values of the\nderivative instruments, the Registrants apply valuation adjustments for discounting, liquidity and credit quality.\nCredit risk is the risk that a counterparty will fail to perform on the contract or fail to pay amounts due. Liquidity risk\nrepresents the risk that imperfections in the market will cause the price to vary from estimated fair value based upon prevailing\nmarket supply and demand conditions. Since energy markets are imperfect and volatile, there are inherent risks related to the\nunderlying assumptions in models used to fair value risk management contracts. Unforeseen events may cause reasonable price\ncurves to differ from actual price curves throughout a contract’s term and at the time a contract settles. Consequently, there\ncould be significant adverse or favorable effects on future net income and cash flows if market prices are not consistent with\nmanagement’s estimates of current market consensus for forward prices in the current period. This is particularly true for\nlonger term contracts. Cash flows may vary based on market conditions, margin requirements and the timing of settlement of\nrisk management contracts.\nAccording to the accounting guidance for “Derivatives and Hedging,” the Registrants reflect the fair values of derivative\ninstruments subject to netting agreements with the same counterparty net of related cash collateral. For certain risk\nmanagement contracts, the Registrants are required to post or receive cash collateral based on third-party contractual\nagreements and risk profiles. AEP netted cash collateral received from third-parties against short-term and long-term risk\nmanagement assets in the amounts of $46 million and $481 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There was\nno cash collateral received from third-parties netted against short-term and long-term risk management assets for the Registrant\nSubsidiaries as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The amount of cash collateral paid to third-parties netted against short-term\nand long-term risk management liabilities was not material for the Registrants as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n249\nLocation and Fair Value of Derivative Assets and Liabilities Recognized In the Balance Sheet\nThe following tables represent the gross fair value of the Registrants’ derivative activity on the balance sheets. The derivative\ninstruments are disclosed as gross. They are subject to master netting agreements and are presented on the balance sheets on a\nnet basis in accordance with the accounting guidance for “Derivatives and Hedging.” Unless shown as a separate line on the\nbalance sheets due to materiality, Current Risk Management Assets are included in Prepayments and Other Current Assets,\nLong-term Risk Management Assets are included in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets, Current Risk Management\nLiabilities are included in Other Current Liabilities and Long-term Risk Management Liabilities are included in Deferred\nCredits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities on the balance sheets.\nDecember 31, 2023\nAEP AEP Texas APCo I&M OPCo PSO SWEPCo\nAssets: (in millions)\nCurrent Risk Management Assets\nRisk Management Contracts - Commodity $ 555.1 $ — $ 24.6 $ 30.1 $ — $ 19.7 $ 12.0\nHedging Contracts - Commodity 56.7 — — — — — —\nHedging Contracts - Interest Rate — — — — — — —\nTotal Current Risk Management Assets 611.8 — 24.6 30.1 — 19.7 12.0\nLong-term Risk Management Assets\nRisk Management Contracts - Commodity 468.8 — 0.3 12.0 — — 0.5\nHedging Contracts - Commodity 86.8 — — — — — —\nHedging Contracts - Interest Rate — — — — — — —\nTotal Long-term Risk Management Assets 555.6 — 0.3 12.0 — — 0.5\nTotal Assets $ 1,167.4 $ — $ 24.9 $ 42.1 $ — $ 19.7 $ 12.5\nLiabilities:\nCurrent Risk Management Liabilities\nRisk Management Contracts - Commodity $ 588.0 $ 0.2 $ 18.5 $ 5.4 $ 6.9 $ 29.7 $ 14.9\nHedging Contracts - Commodity 8.2 — — — — — —\nHedging Contracts - Interest Rate 50.5 2.7 — — — — —\nTotal Current Risk Management Liabilities 646.7 2.9 18.5 5.4 6.9 29.7 14.9\nLong-term Risk Management Liabilities\nRisk Management Contracts - Commodity 377.6 — 6.9 0.2 43.9 1.0 1.7\nHedging Contracts - Commodity 2.2 — — — — — —\nHedging Contracts - Interest Rate 56.9 — — — — — —\nTotal Long-term Risk Management Liabilities 436.7 — 6.9 0.2 43.9 1.0 1.7\nTotal Liabilities $ 1,083.4 $ 2.9 $ 25.4 $ 5.6 $ 50.8 $ 30.7 $ 16.6\nTotal MTM Derivative Contract Net Assets\n(Liabilities) Recognized $ 84.0 $ (2.9) $ (0.5) $ 36.5 $ (50.8) $ (11.0) $ (4.1)\n250\nDecember 31, 2022\nAEP AEP Texas APCo I&M OPCo PSO SWEPCo\nAssets: (in millions)\nCurrent Risk Management Assets\nRisk Management Contracts - Commodity $ 965.4 $ — $ 69.3 $ 16.0 $ — $ 24.1 $ 16.8\nHedging Contracts - Commodity 212.2 — — — — — —\nHedging Contracts - Interest Rate 1.8 — — — — 1.6 —\nTotal Current Risk Management Assets 1,179.4 — 69.3 16.0 — 25.7 16.8\nLong-term Risk Management Assets\nRisk Management Contracts - Commodity 565.6 — 0.7 0.5 — — —\nHedging Contracts - Commodity 148.9 — — — — — —\nHedging Contracts - Interest Rate 14.3 — — — — — —\nTotal Long-term Risk Management Assets 728.8 — 0.7 0.5 — — —\nTotal Assets $ 1,908.2 $ — $ 70.0 $ 16.5 $ — $ 25.7 $ 16.8\nLiabilities:\nCurrent Risk Management Liabilities\nRisk Management Contracts - Commodity $ 663.8 $ — $ 4.1 $ 0.9 $ 2.1 $ 2.1 $ 2.0\nHedging Contracts - Commodity 60.4 — — — — — —\nHedging Contracts - Interest Rate 41.4 — — — — — —\nTotal Current Risk Management Liabilities 765.6 — 4.1 0.9 2.1 2.1 2.0\nLong-term Risk Management Liabilities\nRisk Management Contracts - Commodity 412.0 — 0.7 0.3 37.9 — —\nHedging Contracts - Commodity 17.4 — — — — — —\nHedging Contracts - Interest Rate 91.1 — — — — — —\nTotal Long-term Risk Management Liabilities 520.5 — 0.7 0.3 37.9 — —\nTotal Liabilities $ 1,286.1 $ — $ 4.8 $ 1.2 $ 40.0 $ 2.1 $ 2.0\nTotal MTM Derivative Contract Net Assets\n(Liabilities) Recognized $ 622.1 $ — $ 65.2 $ 15.3 $ (40.0) $ 23.6 $ 14.8\n251\nOffsetting Assets and Liabilities\nThe following tables show the net amounts of assets and liabilities presented on the balance sheets.

derivative instruments have been designated as normal purchase or normal sale contracts, as provided in the\naccounting guidance for “Derivatives and Hedging.” Derivative contracts that have been designated as normal purchases or\nnormal sales under that accounting guidance are not subject to MTM accounting treatment and are recognized on the statements\nof income on an accrual basis.\nThe accounting for the changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it qualifies for and has been\ndesignated as part of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship. Depending on the exposure,\nmanagement designates a hedging instrument as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge.\nFor contracts that have not been designated as part of a hedging relationship, the accounting for changes in fair value depends\non whether the derivative instrument is held for trading purposes. Unrealized and realized gains and losses on derivative\ninstruments held for trading purposes are included in revenues on a net basis on the statements of income. Unrealized and\nrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments not held for trading purposes are included in revenues or expenses on the\nstatements of income depending on the relevant facts and circumstances. Certain derivatives that economically hedge future\ncommodity risk are recorded in the same line item on the statements of income as that of the associated risk being hedged.\nHowever, unrealized and some realized gains and losses in regulated jurisdictions for both trading and non-trading derivative\ninstruments are recorded as regulatory assets (for losses) or regulatory liabilities (for gains) in accordance with the accounting\nguidance for “Regulated Operations.”\nAccounting for Fair Value Hedging Strategies (Applies to AEP)\nFor fair value hedges (i.e. hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability or an identified portion thereof\nattributable to a particular risk), the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged\nitem associated with the hedged risk impacts net income during the period of change.\nAEP records realized and unrealized gains or losses on interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify for fair value hedge\naccounting treatment and any offsetting changes in the fair value of the debt being hedged in Interest Expense on the statements\nof income.\nThe following table shows the impacts recognized on the balance sheets related to the hedged items in fair value hedging\nrelationships:\nCumulative Amount of Fair Value Hedging\nAdjustment Included in the Carrying\nCarrying Amount of the Hedged Liabilities Amount of the Hedged Liabilities\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\n(in millions)\nLong-term Debt (a) (b) $ (878.2) $ (855.5) $ 68.4 $ 89.7\n(a) Amounts included within Noncurrent Liabilities line item Long-term Debt on the Balance Sheet.\n(b) Amounts include $(30) million and $(38) million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, for the fair value\nhedge adjustment of hedged debt obligations for which hedge accounting has been discontinued.\nThe pretax effects of fair value hedge accounting on income were as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in millions)\nGain (Loss) on Interest Rate Contracts:\nFair Value Hedging Instruments (a) $ 29.0 $ (90.4) $ (35.5)\nFair Value Portion of Long-term Debt (a) (29.0) 90.4 35.5\n(a) Gain (Loss) is included in Interest Expense on the statements of income.\nAccounting for Cash Flow Hedging Strategies (Applies to AEP, AEP Texas, APCo, I&M, PSO and SWEPCo)\nFor cash flow hedges (i.e. hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular\nrisk), the Registrants initially report the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as a component of Accumulated Other\nComprehensive Income (Loss) on the balance sheets until the period the hedged item affects net income.\n254\nRealized gains and losses on derivative contracts for the purchase and sale of power designated as cash flow hedges are\nincluded in Total Revenues or Purchased Electricity, Fuel and Other Consumables Used for Electric Generation on the\nstatements of income or in Regulatory Assets or Regulatory Liabilities on the balance sheets, depending on the specific nature\nof the risk being hedged. During the years ended 2023, 2022 and 2021, AEP applied cash flow hedging to outstanding power\nderivatives and the Registrant Subsidiaries did not.\nThe Registrants reclassify gains and losses on interest rate derivative hedges related to debt financings from Accumulated Other\nComprehensive Income (Loss) on the balance sheets into Interest Expense on the statements of income in those periods in\nwhich hedged interest payments occur. During the year ended 2023, AEP, AEP Texas, I&M, PSO and SWEPCo applied cash\nflow hedging to outstanding interest rate derivatives and the other Registrant Subsidiaries did not. During the year ended 2022,\nAEP and PSO applied cash flow hedging to outstanding interest rate derivatives. During the year ended 2021, AEP and APCo\napplied cash flow hedging to outstanding interest rate derivatives.\nFor details on effective cash flow hedges included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) on the balance sheets\nand the reasons for changes in cash flow hedges, see Note 3 - Comprehensive Income.\nCash flow hedges included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) on the balance sheets were:\nImpact of Cash Flow Hedges on the Registrants’ Balance Sheets\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nPortion Expected to Portion Expected to\nAOCI be Reclassed to AOCI be Reclassed to\nGain (Loss) Net Income During Gain (Loss) Net Income During\nNet of Tax the Next Twelve Months Net of Tax the Next Twelve Months\nInterest Interest Interest Interest\nCommodity Rate Commodity Rate Commodity Rate Commodity Rate\n(in millions)\nAEP $ 104.9 $ (8.1) $ 38.3 $ 3.2 $ 223.5 $ 0.3 $ 119.9 $ 0.3\nAEP Texas — 0.5 — 0.2 — (0.3) — (0.2)\nAPCo — 5.9 — 0.8 — 6.7 — 0.8\nI&M — (5.5) — (0.4) — (5.1) — (0.6)\nPSO — (0.2) — — — 1.3 — 0.1\nSWEPCo — 1.3 — 0.3 — 1.1 — 0.2\nAs of December 31, 2023 the maximum length of time that AEP is hedging its exposure to variability in future cash flows\nrelated to forecasted transactions is 87 months.\nThe actual amounts reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) to Net Income can differ from the\nestimate above due to market price changes.\nCredit Risk\nManagement mitigates credit risk in wholesale marketing and trading activities by assessing the creditworthiness of potential\ncounterparties before entering into transactions with them and continuing to evaluate their creditworthiness on an ongoing\nbasis. Management uses credit agency ratings and current market-based qualitative and quantitative data as well as financial\nstatements to assess the financial health of counterparties on an ongoing basis.\nMaster agreements are typically used to facilitate the netting of cash flows associated with a single counterparty and may\ninclude collateral requirements. Collateral requirements in the form of cash, letters of credit and parental/affiliate guarantees\nmay be obtained as security from counterparties in order to mitigate credit risk. Some master agreements include margining,\nwhich requires a counterparty to post cash or letters of credit in the event exposure exceeds the established threshold. The\nthreshold represents an unsecured credit limit which may be supported by a parental/affiliate guaranty, as determined in\naccordance with AEP’s credit policy. In addition, master agreements allow for termination and liquidation of all positions in\nthe event of a default including a failure or inability to post collateral when required.\n255\nCredit-Risk-Related Contingent Features\nCredit Downgrade Triggers (Applies to AEP, APCo, I&M, PSO and SWEPCo)\nA limited number of derivative contracts include collateral triggering events, which include a requirement to maintain certain\ncredit ratings. On an ongoing basis, AEP’s risk management organization assesses the appropriateness of these collateral\ntriggering events in contracts. The Registrants have not experienced a downgrade below a specified credit rating threshold that\nwould require the posting of additional collateral. AEP had derivative contracts with collateral triggering events in a net\nliability position with a total exposure of $0 and $2 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Registrant\nSubsidiaries had no derivative contracts with collateral triggering events in a net liability position as of December 31, 2023 and\n2022.\nCross-Acceleration Triggers\nCertain interest rate derivative contracts contain cross-acceleration provisions that, if triggered, would permit the counterparty\nto declare a default and require settlement of the outstanding payable. These cross-acceleration provisions could be triggered if\nthere was a non-performance event by the Registrants under any of their outstanding debt of at least $50 million and the lender\non that debt has accelerated the entire repayment obligation. On an ongoing basis, AEP’s risk management organization\nassesses the appropriateness of these cross-acceleration provisions in contracts. AEP had derivative contracts with cross-\nacceleration provisions in a net liability position of $107 million and $127 million and no cash collateral posted as of December\n31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. If a cross-acceleration provision would have been triggered, settlement at fair value would\nhave been required. The Registrant Subsidiaries’ derivative contracts with cross-acceleration provisions outstanding as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\nCross-Default Triggers (Applies to AEP, APCo, I&M, PSO and SWEPCo)\nIn addition, a majority of non-exchange traded commodity contracts contain cross-default provisions that, if triggered, would\npermit the counterparty to declare a default and require settlement of the outstanding payable. These cross-default provisions\ncould be triggered if there was a non-performance event by Parent or the obligor under outstanding debt or a third-party\nobligation that is $50 million or greater. On an ongoing basis, AEP’s risk management organization assesses the\nappropriateness of these cross-default provisions in the contracts. AEP had derivative contracts with cross-default provisions in\na net liability position of $242 million and $217 million and no cash collateral posted as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, after considering contractual netting arrangements. If a cross-default provision would have been triggered,\nsettlement at fair value would have been required. APCo, PSO and SWEPCo had derivative contracts with cross-default\nprovisions in a net liability position of $22 million, $29 million and $15 million, respectively, and no cash collateral posted as\nof December 31, 2023. The other Registrant Subsidiaries had no derivative contracts with cross-default provisions outstanding\nas of December 31, 2023. The Registrant Subsidiaries’ derivative contracts with cross-default provisions outstanding as of\nDecember 31, 2022 were not material.\n256\n11. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants except AEPTCo unless indicated otherwise.\nFair Value Measurements of Long-term Debt (Applies to all Registrants)\nThe fair values of Long-term Debt are based on quoted market prices, without credit enhancements, for the same or similar\nissues and the current interest rates offered for instruments with similar maturities classified as Level 2 measurement\ninputs. These instruments are not marked-to-market. The estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that\ncould be realized in a current market exchange. The fair value of AEP’s Equity Units (Level 1) are valued based on publicly-\ntraded securities issued by AEP.\nThe book values and fair values of Long-term Debt are summarized in the following table:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nCompany Book Value Fair Value Book Value Fair Value\n(in millions)\nAEP (a) $ 40,143.2 $ 37,325.7 $ 36,801.0 $ 35,915.9\nAEP Texas 5,889.8 5,400.7 5,657.8 5,045.8\nAEPTCo 5,414.4 4,796.9 4,782.8 3,940.5\nAPCo 5,588.3 5,390.1 5,410.5 5,079.2\nI&M 3,499.4 3,291.6 3,260.8 2,929.0\nOPCo 3,366.8 2,992.1 2,970.3 2,516.6\nPSO 2,384.6 2,154.3 1,912.8 1,635.8\nSWEPCo 3,646.9 3,209.7 3,391.6 2,870.9\n(a) The fair value amounts include debt related to AEP’s Equity Units and had a fair value of $0 million and $877\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

As required by the accounting guidance for “Fair Value Measurements and\nDisclosures,” financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to\nthe fair value measurement. Management’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement\nrequires judgment and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value\nhierarchy levels. There have not been any significant changes in management’s valuation techniques.\nAEP\nDecember 31, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Other Total\nAssets: (in millions)\nOther Temporary Investments and Restricted Cash\nRestricted Cash $ 48.9 $ — $ — $ — $ 48.9\nOther Cash Deposits (a) — — — 13.9 13.9\nFixed Income Securities – Mutual Funds 159.7 — — — 159.7\nEquity Securities – Mutual Funds (b) 40.7 — — — 40.7\nTotal Other Temporary Investments and Restricted Cash 249.3 — — 13.9 263.2\nRisk Management Assets\nRisk Management Commodity Contracts (c) (d) 9.7 736.9 274.3 (617.0) 403.9\nCash Flow Hedges:\nCommodity Hedges (c) — 123.5 19.8 (8.5) 134.8\nTotal Risk Management Assets 9.7 860.4 294.1 (625.5) 538.7\nSpent Nuclear Fuel and Decommissioning Trusts\nCash and Cash Equivalents (e) 7.8 — — 9.0 16.8\nFixed Income Securities:\nUnited States Government — 1,273.0 — — 1,273.0\nCorporate Debt — 132.1 — — 132.1\nState and Local Government — 1.7 — — 1.7\nSubtotal Fixed Income Securities — 1,406.8 — — 1,406.8\nEquity Securities – Domestic (b) 2,436.6 — — — 2,436.6\nTotal Spent Nuclear Fuel and Decommissioning Trusts 2,444.4 1,406.8 — 9.0 3,860.2\nTotal Assets $ 2,703.4 $ 2,267.2 $ 294.1 $ (602.6) $ 4,662.1\nLiabilities:\nRisk Management Liabilities\nRisk Management Commodity Contracts (c) (d) $ 24.7 $ 783.8 $ 154.1 $ (600.3) $ 362.3\nCash Flow Hedges:\nCommodity Hedges (c) — 9.6 0.6 (8.5) 1.7\nInterest Rate Hedges — 9.0 — — 9.0\nFair Value Hedges — 98.4 — — 98.4\nTotal Risk Management Liabilities $ 24.7 $ 900.8 $ 154.7 $ (608.8) $ 471.4\n260\nAEP\nDecember 31, 2022\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Other Total\nAssets: (in millions)\nOther Temporary Investments and Restricted Cash\nRestricted Cash $ 47.1 $ — $ — $ — $ 47.1\nOther Cash Deposits (a) — — — 9.0 9.0\nFixed Income Securities – Mutual Funds 144.1 — — — 144.1\nEquity Securities – Mutual Funds (b) 34.5 — — — 34.5\nTotal Other Temporary Investments and Restricted Cash 225.7 — — 9.0 234.7\nRisk Management Assets\nRisk Management Commodity Contracts (c) (f) 15.0 1,197.5 314.4 (1,211.5) 315.4\nCash Flow Hedges:\nCommodity Hedges (c) — 332.6 26.7 (52.8) 306.5\nInterest Rate Hedges — 11.0 — — 11.0\nTotal Risk Management Assets 15.0 1,541.1 341.1 (1,264.3) 632.9\nSpent Nuclear Fuel and Decommissioning Trusts\nCash and Cash Equivalents (e) 11.3 — — 9.9 21.2\nFixed Income Securities:\nUnited States Government — 1,123.8 — — 1,123.8\nCorporate Debt — 61.6 — — 61.6\nState and Local Government — 3.3 — — 3.3\nSubtotal Fixed Income Securities — 1,188.7 — — 1,188.7\nEquity Securities – Domestic (b) 2,131.3 — — — 2,131.3\nTotal Spent Nuclear Fuel and Decommissioning Trusts 2,142.6 1,188.7 — 9.9 3,341.2\nTotal Assets $ 2,383.3 $ 2,729.8 $ 341.1 $ (1,245.4) $ 4,208.8\nLiabilities:\nRisk Management Liabilities\nRisk Management Commodity Contracts (c) (f) $ 21.8 $ 870.9 $ 179.0 $ (731.9) $ 339.8\nCash Flow Hedges:\nCommodity Hedges (c) — 74.3 1.7 (52.8) 23.2\nFair Value Hedges — 127.4 — — 127.4\nTotal Risk Management Liabilities $ 21.8 $ 1,072.6 $ 180.7 $ (784.7) $ 490.4\n261\nAEP Texas\nDecember 31, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Other Total\nAssets: (in millions)\nRestricted Cash for Securitized Funding $ 34.0 $ — $ — $ — $ 34.0\nLiabilities:\nRisk Management Liabilities\nRisk Management Commodity Contracts (c) $ — $ 0.2 $ — $ (0.2) $ —\nCash Flow Hedges:\nInterest Rate Hedges — 2.7 — — 2.7\nTotal Risk Management Liabilities $ — $ 2.9 $ — $ (0.2) $ 2.7\nDecember 31, 2022\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Other Total\nAssets: (in millions)\nRestricted Cash for Securitized Funding $ 32.7 $ — $ — $ — $ 32.7\nAPCo\nDecember 31, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Other Total\nAssets: (in millions)\nRestricted Cash for Securitized Funding $ 14.9 $ — $ — $ — $ 14.9\nRisk Management Assets\nRisk Management Commodity Contracts (c) — 1.1 23.5 (2.2) 22.4\nTotal Assets $ 14.9 $ 1.1 $ 23.5 $ (2.2) $ 37.3\nLiabilities:\nRisk Management Liabilities\nRisk Management Commodity Contracts (c) $ — $ 24.0 $ 1.1 $ (2.6) $ 22.5\nDecember 31, 2022\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Other Total\nAssets: (in millions)\nRestricted Cash for Securitized Funding $ 14.4 $ — $ — $ — $ 14.4\nRisk Management Assets\nRisk Management Commodity Contracts (c) — 0.7 69.4 (1.0) 69.1\nTotal Assets $ 14.4 $ 0.7 $ 69.4 $ (1.0) $ 83.5\nLiabilities:\nRisk Management Liabilities\nRisk Management Commodity Contracts (c) $ — $ 4.6 $ 0.3 $ (1.4) $ 3.5\n262\nI&M\nDecember 31, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Other Total\nAssets: (in millions)\nRisk Management Assets\nRisk Management Commodity Contracts (c) $ — $ 37.4 $ 4.5 $ (2.3) $ 39.6\nSpent Nuclear Fuel and Decommissioning Trusts\nCash and Cash Equivalents (e) 7.8 — — 9.0 16.8\nFixed Income Securities:\nUnited States Government — 1,273.0 — — 1,273.0\nCorporate Debt — 132.1 — — 132.1\nState and Local Government — 1.7 — — 1.7\nSubtotal Fixed Income Securities — 1,406.8 — — 1,406.8\nEquity Securities -

AEP has agreed to extend the statute of limitations on the 2017-2019 tax returns to October 31, 2024, to allow\ntime for our refund claim to be approved by the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. The statute of limitations for the\n2020 return is set to naturally expire in October 2024 as well.\nThe current IRS audit and associated refund claim evolved from a net operating loss carryback to 2015 that originated in the\n2017 return. AEP has received and agreed to immaterial IRS proposed adjustments on the 2017 tax return. The IRS exam is\ncomplete, and AEP is currently waiting on the IRS to submit the refund claim to the Congressional Joint Committee on\nTaxation for resolution and final approval.\nAEP and subsidiaries file income tax returns in various state and local jurisdictions. These taxing authorities routinely examine\nthe tax returns, and AEP and subsidiaries are currently under examination in several state and local jurisdictions. Generally, the\nstatutes of limitations have expired for tax years prior to 2017. In addition, management is monitoring and continues to\nevaluate the potential impact of federal legislation and corresponding state conformity.\nNet Income Tax Operating Loss Carryforward\nAs of December 31, 2023, AEP, OPCo, PSO and SWEPCo have state net income tax operating loss carryforwards as indicated\nin the table below:\nState Net Income\nTax Operating Loss Years of\nCompany State/Municipality Carryforward Expiration\n(in millions)\nAEP Arkansas $ 259.3 2024 - 2033\nAEP Colorado 80.8 2041\nAEP Illinois 54.4 2039 - 2041\nAEP Kentucky 204.1 2030 - 2037\nAEP Louisiana 629.2 NA\nAEP Michigan 45.6 2030 - 2032\nAEP Ohio Municipal 1,954.8 2024 - 2028\nAEP Oklahoma 877.9 2037\nAEP Pennsylvania 47.8 2030 - 2043\nAEP Tennessee 47.7 2032 - 2038\nOPCo Ohio Municipal 152.3 2024 - 2028\nPSO Oklahoma 947.1 2037\nSWEPCo Arkansas 258.9 2024 - 2033\nSWEPCo Louisiana 619.1 NA\nNA Not applicable.\nTax Credit Carryforward\nFederal and state net income tax operating losses sustained in 2017, 2019 and 2021 resulted in unused federal and state income\ntax credits. As of December 31, 2023, the Registrants have federal tax credit carryforwards and AEP and PSO have state tax\ncredit carryforwards as indicated in the table below. If these credits are not utilized, federal general business tax credits will\nexpire in the years 2036 through 2041 and state tax credits will remain available indefinitely.\nTotal Federal Total State\nTax Credit Tax Credit\nCompany Carryforward Carryforward\n(in millions)\nAEP $ 321.9 $ 40.0\nAEP Texas 13.7 —\nAPCo 0.1 —\nI&M 7.2 —\nOPCo 41.0 —\nPSO 53.8 40.0\nSWEPCo 68.6 —\nThe Registrants anticipate future federal taxable income will be sufficient to realize the tax benefits of the federal tax credits\nbefore they expire unused.\n272\nValuation Allowance\nAEP assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income of the\nappropriate tax character will be generated to realize the benefits of existing deferred tax assets. When the evaluation of the\nevidence indicates that it is more-likely-than-not that AEP will not be able to realize the benefits of existing deferred tax assets,\na valuation allowance is recorded to reduce existing deferred tax assets to the net realizable amount. Objective evidence\nevaluated includes whether AEP has a history of recognizing income, future reversals of existing temporary differences and tax\nplanning strategies.\nValuation allowance activity for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were not material.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe amount and activity of unrecognized tax benefits was not material for the Registrants for the years ended December 31,\n2023, 2022 and 2021. Management believes that there will be no significant net increase or decrease in unrecognized benefits\nwithin 12 months of the reporting date. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the\neffective tax rate for AEP as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $13 million, $23 million, and $14 million,\nrespectively.\nFederal Tax Legislation\nIn August 2022, President Biden signed H.R. 5376 into law, commonly known as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA.\nMost notably this budget reconciliation legislation creates a 15% minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income\n(Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax or CAMT), extends and increases the value of PTCs and ITCs, adds a nuclear and clean\nhydrogen PTC, an energy storage ITC and allows the sale or transfer of tax credits to third parties for cash. As further\nsignificant guidance from Treasury and the IRS is expected on the tax provisions in the IRA, AEP will continue to monitor any\nissued guidance and evaluate the impact on future net income, cash flows and financial condition.\nIn December 2022, the IRS released Notice 2023-7, which provided initial CAMT guidance that AEP can begin to rely on in\n2023. Notably, the interim guidance in Notice 2023-7 confirmed the CAMT depreciation adjustment includes tax depreciation\nthat is capitalized to inventory under §263A and recovered as part of cost of goods sold, providing significant relief to AEP’s\npotential CAMT exposure. In September 2023, the IRS released Notice 2023-64, which clarifies and supplements items in\nNotice 2023-7 and stated that additional guidance in the form of proposed regulations is expected. AEP will continue to\nmonitor and assess any additional guidance.\nAEP and subsidiaries expect to be applicable corporations for purposes of the CAMT beginning in 2023. CAMT cash taxes are\nexpected to be partially offset by regulatory recovery, the utilization of tax credits and additionally the cash inflow generated by\nthe sale of tax credits. The sale of tax credits are presented in the operating section of the statements of cash flows consistent\nwith the presentation of cash taxes paid. AEP presents the loss on sale of tax credits through income tax expense.\nIn June 2023, the IRS issued temporary regulations related to the transfer of tax credits. In the third and fourth quarter of 2023,\nAEP, on behalf of PSO, SWEPCo and AEP Energy Supply, LLC, entered into transferability agreements with nonaffiliated\nparties to sell 2023 generated PTCs resulting in cash proceeds of approximately $102 million received in the fourth quarter of\n2023 and an additional $76 million expected in early 2024. AEP expects to continue to explore the ability to efficiently\nmonetize its tax credits through third party transferability agreements.\n273\n13. LEASES\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.\nThe Registrants lease property, plant and equipment including, but not limited to, fleet, information technology and real estate\nleases. These leases require payments of non-lease components, including related property taxes, operating and maintenance\ncosts. AEP does not separate non-lease components from associated lease components. Many of these leases have purchase or\nrenewal options. Leases not renewed are often replaced by other leases. Options to renew or purchase a lease are included in\nthe measurement of lease assets and liabilities if it is reasonably certain the Registrant will exercise the option.\nLease obligations are measured using the discount rate implicit in the lease when that rate is readily determinable. AEP has\nvisibility into the rate implicit in the lease when assets are leased from selected financial institutions under master leasing\nagreements. When the implicit rate is not readily determinable, the Registrants measure their lease obligation using their\nestimated secured incremental borrowing rate. Incremental borrowing rates are comprised of an underlying risk-free rate and a\nsecured credit spread relative to the lessee on a matched maturity basis.\nOperating lease rentals and finance lease amortization costs are generally charged to Other Operation and Maintenance expense\nin accordance with rate-making treatment for regulated operations. The amortization costs related to the Rockport finance lease\nwere charged to Depreciation and Amortization. Interest on finance lease liabilities is generally charged to Interest Expense.\nLease costs associated with capital projects are included in Property, Plant and Equipment on the balance sheets. For regulated\noperations with finance leases, a finance lease asset and offsetting liability are recorded at the present value of the remaining\nlease payments for each reporting period. Finance leases for nonregulated property are accounted for as if the assets were\nowned and financed.

AEPTCo’s\ncontractually-defined priority debt was 1.3% of consolidated tangible net assets as of December 31, 2023. The method for\ncalculating the consolidated tangible net assets is contractually-defined in the note purchase agreement.\nDividend Restrictions\nUtility Subsidiaries’ Restrictions\nParent depends on its utility subsidiaries to pay dividends to shareholders. AEP utility subsidiaries pay dividends to Parent\nprovided funds are legally available. Various financing arrangements and regulatory requirements may impose certain\nrestrictions on the ability of the subsidiaries to transfer funds to Parent in the form of dividends.\n281\nAll of the dividends declared by AEP’s utility subsidiaries that provide transmission or local distribution services are subject to\na Federal Power Act requirement that prohibits the payment of dividends out of capital accounts in certain circumstances;\npayment of dividends is generally allowed out of retained earnings. The Federal Power Act also creates a reserve on earnings\nattributable to hydroelectric generation plants. Because of their ownership of such plants, this reserve applies to APCo and\nI&M.\nCertain AEP subsidiaries have credit agreements that contain covenants that limit their debt to capitalization ratio to 67.5%.\nThe method for calculating outstanding debt and capitalization is contractually-defined in the credit agreements.\nThe most restrictive dividend limitation for certain AEP subsidiaries is through the Federal Power Act restriction, while for\nother AEP subsidiaries the most restrictive dividend limitation is through the credit agreements. As of December 31, 2023, the\nmaximum amount of restricted net assets of AEP’s subsidiaries that may not be distributed to the Parent in the form of a loan,\nadvance or dividend was $16.6 billion.\nThe Federal Power Act restriction limits the ability of the AEP subsidiaries owning hydroelectric generation to pay dividends\nout of retained earnings. Additionally, the credit agreement covenant restrictions can limit the ability of the AEP subsidiaries to\npay dividends out of retained earnings. As of December 31, 2023, the amount of any such restrictions were as follows:\nAEP AEP Texas AEPTCo APCo I&M OPCo PSO SWEPCo\n(in millions)\nRestricted Retained\nEarnings $ 3,003.4 (a) $ 737.1 $ — $ 721.5 $ 702.6 $ — $ 1.3 $ 337.3\n(a) Includes the restrictions of consolidated and non-consolidated subsidiaries.\nParent Restrictions (Applies to AEP)\nThe holders of AEP’s common stock are entitled to receive the dividends declared by the Board of Directors provided funds are\nlegally available for such dividends. Parent’s income primarily derives from common stock equity in the earnings of its utility\nsubsidiaries.\nPursuant to the leverage restrictions in credit agreements, AEP must maintain a percentage of debt-to-total capitalization at a\nlevel that does not exceed 67.5%. The method for calculating outstanding debt and capitalization is contractually-defined in the\ncredit agreements. As of December 31, 2023, AEP had $7.6 billion of available retained earnings to pay dividends to common\nshareholders. AEP paid $1.8 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion of dividends to common shareholders for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n282\nLines of Credit and Short-term Debt (Applies to AEP)\nAEP uses its commercial paper program to meet the short-term borrowing needs of its subsidiaries. The program funds a\nUtility Money Pool, which funds AEP’s utility subsidiaries; a Nonutility Money Pool, which funds certain AEP nonutility\nsubsidiaries; and the short-term debt requirements of subsidiaries that are not participating in either money pool for regulatory\nor operational reasons, as direct borrowers. As of December 31, 2023, AEP had $5 billion in revolving credit facilities to\nsupport its commercial paper program. Securitized Debt for Receivables, for the year ended 2023, had a weighted-average\ninterest rate of 5.33% and a maximum amount outstanding of $900 million. The commercial paper program, for the year ended\n2023, had a weighted-average interest rate of 5.38% and a maximum amount outstanding of $3.2 billion.

The\ncorporate borrowing program includes a Utility Money Pool, which funds AEP’s utility subsidiaries; a Nonutility Money Pool,\nwhich funds certain AEP nonutility subsidiaries; and direct borrowing from AEP. The AEP Utility Money Pool operates in\naccordance with the terms and conditions of its agreement filed with the FERC. The amounts of outstanding loans to\n(borrowings from) the Utility Money Pool as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 are included in Advances to Affiliates and\nAdvances from Affiliates, respectively, on the Registrant Subsidiaries’ balance sheets.

Under the securitization agreement, AEP Credit\nreceives financing from the bank conduits for the interest in the receivables AEP Credit acquires from affiliated utility\nsubsidiaries. These securitized transactions allow AEP Credit to repay its outstanding debt obligations, continue to purchase\nthe operating companies’ receivables and accelerate AEP Credit’s cash collections.\nAEP Credit’s receivables securitization agreement provides a commitment of $900 million from bank conduits to purchase\nreceivables.

APCo does not have\nregulatory authority to sell its West Virginia accounts receivable. KPCo ceased selling accounts receivable to AEP Credit in\nthe first quarter of 2022, based on the expected sale to Liberty. As a result, in the first quarter of 2022, KPCo recorded an\nallowance for uncollectible accounts on its balance sheet for those receivables no longer sold to AEP Credit. In the third quarter\nof 2023, KPCo resumed selling accounts receivable to AEP Credit, due to the termination of the sale to Liberty, and the balance\nin KPCo’s allowance for uncollectible accounts was reversed.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe disclosures in this note apply to AEP only. The impact of AEP’s share-based compensation plans is insignificant to the\nfinancial statements of the Registrant Subsidiaries.\nAwards under the American Electric Power System 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2015 LTIP), which replaced prior long-\nterm incentive plans effective April 2015, may be granted to employees and directors. The 2015 LTIP was subsequently\namended in September 2016. The 2015 LTIP provides for a maximum of 10 million AEP common shares to be available for\ngrant to eligible employees and directors. As of December 31, 2023, 3,698,144 shares remained available for issuance under\nthe 2015 LTIP. No new awards may be granted under the Prior Plan. Awards granted under the 2015 LTIP awards may be\nmade in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares,\nperformance units, cash-based awards and other stock-based awards. Shares issued pursuant to a stock option or a stock\nappreciation right reduce the shares remaining available for grants under the 2015 LTIP by 0.286 of a share. Each share issued\nfor any other award that settles in AEP stock reduces the shares remaining available for grants under the 2015 LTIP by one\nshare. Cash settled awards do not reduce the number of shares remaining available under the 2015 LTIP. The following\nsections provide further information regarding each type of stock-based compensation award granted under these plans.\nPerformance Shares\nPerformance units granted prior to 2017 were settled in cash rather than AEP common stock and did not reduce the number of\nshares remaining available under the 2015 LTIP. Those performance units had a fair value upon vesting equal to the average\nclosing market price of AEP common stock for the last 20 trading days of the performance period. Performance shares granted\nin and after 2017 are settled in AEP common stock and reduce the aggregate share authorization. In all cases the number of\nperformance shares held at the end of the three-year performance period is multiplied by the performance score for such period\nto determine the actual number of performance shares that participants realize. The performance score can range from 0% to\n200% and is determined at the end of the performance period based on performance measures, which include both performance\nand market conditions, established for each grant at the beginning of the performance period by the Human Resources\nCommittee of AEP’s Board of Directors (HR Committee).\nCertain employees must satisfy a minimum stock ownership requirement. If those employees have not met their stock\nownership requirement, a portion or all of their performance shares are mandatorily deferred upon vesting into AEP career\nshares to the extent needed to meet their stock ownership requirement. AEP career shares are a form of non-qualified deferred\ncompensation that has a value equivalent to a share of AEP common stock. AEP career shares are settled in AEP common\nstock after the participant’s termination of employment.\nAEP career shares are recorded in Paid-in Capital on the balance sheets. Amounts equivalent to cash dividends on both\nperformance shares and AEP career shares accrue as additional shares. Management records compensation cost for\nperformance shares over an approximately three-year vesting period. Performance shares are recorded as mezzanine equity on\nthe balance sheets until the vesting date and compensation cost is calculated at fair value based on the performance metrics for\neach grant. Performance shares granted in 2023, 2022 and 2021 have three performance metrics: (a) three-year cumulative\noperating earnings per-share with a 50% weight, (b) relative total shareholder return with a 40% weight and (c) renewable\ngeneration additions (2023 grants) or non-emitting generation capacity as a percentage of total owned and purchased capacity\n(2022 and 2021 grants) with a 10% weight. The three-year cumulative operating earnings per-share and renewable generation\nadditions or non-emitting generating capacity metrics are adjusted quarterly for changes in performance relative to the metric\napproved by the HR Committee. The total shareholder return metric is measured relative to a peer group of similar companies\nand is based on a third-party Monte Carlo valuation. The value related to this metric does not change over the three-year\nvesting period.\n288\nThe HR Committee awarded performance shares and reinvested dividends on outstanding performance shares and AEP career\nshares as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\nPerformance Shares 2023 2022 2021\nAwarded Shares (in thousands) 486.7 530.3 565.0\nWeighted-Average Share Fair Value at Grant Date $ 98.63 $ 97.61 $ 81.02\nVesting Period (in years) 3 3 3\nPerformance Shares and AEP Career Shares Years Ended December 31,\n(Reinvested Dividends Portion) 2023 2022 2021\nAwarded Shares (in thousands) 81.3 63.3 74.5\nWeighted-Average Fair Value at Grant Date $ 82.02 $ 98.73 $ 84.48\nVesting Period (in years) (a) (a) (a)\n(a) The vesting period for the reinvested dividends on performance shares is equal to the remaining life of the related\nperformance shares.

The valuations use a lattice model and the expected volatility assumptions\nused were the historical volatilities for AEP and the members of their peer group. The assumptions used in the Monte Carlo\nvaluations were as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\nAssumptions 2023 2022 2021\nValuation Period (in years) (a) 2.87 2.86 2.88\nExpected Volatility Minimum 21.23 % 25.92 % 25.87 %\nExpected Volatility Maximum 39.00 % 40.82 % 39.90 %\nExpected Volatility Average 25.35 % 31.09 % 31.01 %\nDividend Rate (b) — % — % — %\nRisk Free Rate 4.32 % 1.64 % 0.19 %\n(a) Period from award date to vesting date.\n(b) Equivalent to reinvesting dividends.\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe HR Committee grants restricted stock units (RSUs), which generally vest, subject to the participant’s continued AEP\nemployment, over at least three years in approximately equal annual increments. The RSUs accrue dividends as additional\nRSUs. The additional RSUs granted as dividends vest on the same date, subject to the participant’s continued AEP\nemployment, as the underlying RSUs. RSUs are converted into shares of AEP common stock upon vesting. Executive officers\nare those officers who are subject to the disclosure requirements set forth in Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nThe RSU compensation cost is measured at fair value on the grant date and recorded over the vesting period. Fair value is\ndetermined by multiplying the number of RSUs granted by the grant date market closing price. The maximum contractual term\nof outstanding RSUs is approximately 40 months from the grant date.\nThe HR Committee awarded RSUs, including additional units awarded as dividends, as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\nRestricted Stock Units 2023 2022 2021\nAwarded Units (in thousands) 268.4 290.4 280.0\nWeighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value $ 88.52 $ 90.48 $ 80.39\nThe total fair value and total intrinsic value of restricted stock units vested were as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\nRestricted Stock Units 2023 2022 2021\n(in millions)\nFair Value of Restricted Stock Units Vested $ 18.8 $ 17.8 $ 20.5\nIntrinsic Value of Restricted Stock Units Vested (a) 19.0 20.3 22.0\n(a) Intrinsic value is calculated as market price at the vesting date.\nA summary of the status of AEP’s nonvested RSUs as of December 31, 2023 and changes during the year ended December 31,\n2023 were as follows:\nWeighted Average\nNonvested Restricted Stock Units Shares/Units Grant Date Fair Value\n(in thousands)\nNonvested as of January 1, 2023 459.6 $ 88.05\nAwarded 268.4 88.52\nVested (212.4) 88.47\nForfeited (84.5) 86.84\nNonvested as of December 31, 2023 431.1 88.57\n290\nThe total aggregate intrinsic value of nonvested RSUs as of December 31, 2023 was $33 million and the weighted-average\nremaining contractual life was 1.5 years.\nOther Stock-Based Plans\nAEP also has a Stock Unit Accumulation Plan (SUAP) for Non-Employee Directors providing each non-employee director with\nAEP stock units as a substantial portion of the compensation for their services as a director. The number of stock units\nprovided is based on the closing price of AEP common stock on the last trading day of the quarter for which the stock units\nwere earned. Amounts equivalent to cash dividends on the stock units accrue as additional AEP stock units. The stock units\ngranted to non-employee directors are fully vested on their grant date. Stock units are paid to directors upon termination of\ntheir board service or up to 10 years later if the participant so elects. Cash settlements for stock units were calculated based on\nthe average closing price of AEP common stock for the last 20 trading days prior to the distribution date. Effective June 30,\n2022, the SUAP was amended to pay stock units in AEP common stock rather than cash.\nManagement records compensation costs for stock units when the units are awarded and prior to June 2022 adjusted the liability\nfor changes in value based on the current 20-day average closing price of AEP common stock on the valuation date.\nAfter five years of service on the Board of Directors, non-employee directors receive subsequent AEP stock units as\ncontributions to an AEP stock fund under the Stock Unit Accumulation Plan. Such amounts may be exchanged into other\nmarket-based investment options available to employees that participate in AEP’s Incentive Compensation Deferral Plan.\nThese balances are paid in cash upon termination of board service or up to 10 years later if the participant so elects.\nAEP common stock and cash settlements for stock unit distributions were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2023,\n2022 and 2021.\nThe Board of Directors awarded stock units, including units awarded for dividends, as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\nStock Unit Accumulation Plan for Non-Employee Directors 2023 2022 2021\nAwarded Units (in thousands) 19.8 14.5 12.6\nWeighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value $ 82.14 $ 95.16 $ 84.54\nShare-based Compensation Plans\nFor share-based payment arrangements the compensation cost, the actual tax benefit from the tax deductions for compensation\ncost recognized in income and the total compensation cost capitalized were as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\nShare-based Compensation Plans 2023 2022 2021\n(in millions)\nCompensation Cost for Share-based Payment Arrangements (a) $ 50.9 $ 63.3 $ 61.1\nActual Tax Benefit 6.4 8.0 8.7\nTotal Compensation Cost Capitalized 15.3 16.0 16.9\n(a) Compensation cost for share-based payment arrangements is included in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses on\nthe statements of income.\nAs of December 31, 2023, there was $66 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based\ncompensation arrangements granted under the 2015 LTIP. Unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based\narrangements will change as the fair value of performance shares is adjusted each period and as forfeitures for all award types\nare realized. AEP’s unrecognized compensation cost will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.4 years.\nUnder the 2015 LTIP, AEP is permitted to use authorized but unissued shares, treasury shares, shares acquired in the open\nmarket specifically for distribution under these plans, or any combination thereof to fulfill share commitments. AEP’s current\npractice is to use authorized but unissued shares to fulfill share commitments. The number of shares used to fulfill share\ncommitments is generally reduced to offset tax withholding obligations.\n291\n16.

The costs of these services are billed on a direct-charge basis, whenever possible, or on reasonable basis of proration\nfor services that benefit multiple companies. The billings for services are made at cost and include no compensation for the use\nof equity capital.\nPower Coordination Agreement (Applies to all Registrant Subsidiaries except AEP Texas and AEPTCo)\nEffective January 1, 2014, the FERC approved the PCA. Under the PCA, APCo, I&M, KPCo and WPCo are individually\nresponsible for planning their respective capacity obligations. The PCA allows, but does not obligate, APCo, I&M, KPCo and\nWPCo to participate collectively under a common fixed resource requirement capacity plan in PJM and to participate in\nspecified collective Off-system Sales and purchase activities.\nAEPSC conducts power, capacity, coal, natural gas, interest rate and, to a lesser extent, heating oil, gasoline and other risk\nmanagement activities on behalf of APCo, I&M, KPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and WPCo. Certain power and natural gas risk\nmanagement activities for APCo, I&M, KPCo and WPCo are allocated based on the four member companies’ respective equity\npositions, while power and natural gas risk management activities for PSO and SWEPCo are allocated based on the Operating\nAgreement. AEPSC conducts only gasoline, diesel fuel, energy procurement and risk management activities on OPCo’s behalf.\nJoint License Agreement (Applies to all Registrant Subsidiaries except AEP Texas and SWEPCo)\nAEPTCo entered into a 50-year joint license agreement with APCo, I&M, KPCo, OPCo and PSO, respectively, allowing either\nparty to occupy the granting party’s facilities or real property. In addition, AEPTCo entered into a 5-year joint license\nagreement with APCo and WPCo. After the expiration of these agreements, the term shall automatically renew for successive\none-year terms unless either party provides notice. The joint license billing provides compensation to the granting party for the\ncost of carrying assets, including depreciation expense, property taxes, interest expense, return on equity and income taxes.\nAEPTCo recorded the costs related to these agreements in Other Operation expense on the statements of income. APCo, I&M,\nKPCo, OPCo, PSO and WPCo recorded income related to these agreements in Sales to AEP Affiliates on the statements of\nincome. The impact of the joint license agreement for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was not material.\nUnit Power Agreements (Applies to I&M)\nA UPA between AEGCo and I&M (the I&M Power Agreement) provides for the sale by AEGCo to I&M of all the power (and\nthe energy associated therewith) available to AEGCo at the Rockport Plant unless it is sold to another utility. I&M is obligated,\nwhether or not power is available from AEGCo, to pay as a demand charge for the right to receive such power (and as an\nenergy charge for any associated energy taken by I&M) net of amounts received by AEGCo from any other sources, sufficient\nto enable AEGCo to pay all of its operating and other expenses, including a rate of return on the common equity of AEGCo as\napproved by the FERC. The UPA will continue in effect until the debt obligations of AEGCo secured by the Rockport Plant\nhave been satisfied and discharged (currently expected to be December 2028). I&M’s direct purchases from AEGCo were\n$181 million, $242 million and $218 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These direct\npurchases are presented as Purchased Electricity from AEP Affiliates on I&M’s statements of income.\nOhio Auctions (Applies to OPCo)\nIn connection with OPCo’s June 2012 - May 2015 ESP, the PUCO ordered OPCo to conduct energy and capacity auctions for\nits entire SSO load for delivery beginning in June 2015. AEP Energy and AEPEP participate in the auction process and have\nbeen awarded tranches of OPCo’s SSO load. OPCo’s auction purchases were $87 million, $10 million and $52 million for the\nyears ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These direct purchases are presented as Purchased Electricity\nfrom AEP Affiliates on OPCo’s statements of income.\n292\nSales and Purchases of Property\nCertain AEP subsidiaries had affiliated sales and purchases of electric property individually amounting to $100 thousand or\nmore, sales and purchases of meters and transformers, and sales and purchases of transmission property. There were no gains\nor losses recorded on the transactions and the net book value of all sales and purchases for the years ended December 31, 2023,\n2022 and 2021 were not material. These sales and purchases are recorded in Property, Plant and Equipment on the balance\nsheets.\nCharitable Contributions to AEP Foundation\nThe American Electric Power Foundation is funded by American Electric Power and its utility operating units. The Foundation\nprovides a permanent, ongoing resource for charitable initiatives and multi-year commitments in the communities served by\nAEP and initiatives outside of AEP’s 11-state service area. Charitable contributions to the AEP Foundation were not made in\n2023 or 2021.

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.\nThe accounting guidance for “Variable Interest Entities” is a consolidation model that considers if a company has a variable\ninterest in a VIE. A VIE is a legal entity that possesses any of the following conditions: the entity’s equity at risk is not\nsufficient to permit the legal entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, equity owners are\nunable to direct the activities that most significantly impact the legal entity’s economic performance (or they possess\ndisproportionate voting rights in relation to the economic interest in the legal entity), or the equity owners lack the obligation to\nabsorb the legal entity’s expected losses or the right to receive the legal entity’s expected residual returns. Entities are required\nto consolidate a VIE when it is determined that they have a controlling financial interest in a VIE and therefore, are the primary\nbeneficiary of that VIE, as defined by the accounting guidance for “Variable Interest Entities.” In determining whether AEP is\nthe primary beneficiary of a VIE, management considers whether AEP has the power to direct the most significant activities of\nthe VIE and is obligated to absorb losses or receive the expected residual returns that are significant to the VIE. Management\nbelieves that significant assumptions and judgments were applied consistently.\nAEP holds ownership interests in businesses with varying ownership structures. Partnership interests and other variable\ninterests are evaluated to determine if each entity is a VIE, and if so, whether or not the VIE should be consolidated into AEP’s\nfinancial statements. AEP has not provided material financial or other support that was not previously contractually required to\nany of its consolidated VIEs. If an entity is determined not to be a VIE, or if the entity is determined to be a VIE and AEP is\nnot deemed to be the primary beneficiary, the entity is accounted for under the equity method of accounting.\nConsolidated Variable Interests Entities\nSabine (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo)\nSabine is a mining operator providing mining services to SWEPCo. SWEPCo has no equity investment in Sabine but is\nSabine’s only customer. SWEPCo guarantees the debt obligations and lease obligations of Sabine. Under the terms of the note\nagreements, substantially all assets are pledged and all rights under the lignite mining agreement are assigned to SWEPCo. The\ncreditors of Sabine have no recourse to any AEP entity other than SWEPCo. Under the provisions of the mining agreement,\nSWEPCo is required to pay, as a part of the cost of lignite delivered, an amount equal to mining costs plus a management\nfee. In addition, SWEPCo determines how much coal will be mined each year. Based on these facts, management concluded\nthat SWEPCo is the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate Sabine. SWEPCo’s total billings from Sabine for the\nyears ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $101 million, $168 million and $162 million, respectively. As of March\n31, 2023, SWEPCo fuel deliveries, including billings of all fixed costs, from Sabine ceased, which resulted in a decrease in\nbillings in 2023 as compared to 2022. See \"Pirkey Plant and Related Fuel Operations\" section of Note 5 for additional\ninformation. See the tables below for the classification of Sabine’s assets and liabilities on SWEPCo’s balance sheets.\nAs part of the process to receive a renewal of a Texas Railroad Commission permit for lignite mining, SWEPCo provides\nguarantees of mine reclamation of $155 million. Since SWEPCo uses self-bonding, the guarantee commits SWEPCo to\ncomplete the reclamation, in the event, Sabine does not complete the work. This guarantee ends upon completion of\nreclamation. Pirkey Plant was retired in March 2023 and the mine end-of-life has been adjusted accordingly. Reclamation is\nexpected to be complete by 2037 at an estimated cost of $144 million. Actual reclamation costs could vary due to inflation and\nscope changes to the mine reclamation. SWEPCo recovers these costs through its fuel clauses. As of December 31, 2023,\nSWEPCo has recorded $134 million of mine reclamation costs in ARO and $34 million in Accounts Payable - Affiliated\nCompanies for collected reclamation costs that have been billed to SWEPCo. SWEPCo has collected $92 million through a\nrider for reclamation costs. The remaining ARO of $76 million is recorded in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets\non SWEPCo’s balance sheets.\nDCC Fuel (Applies to AEP and I&M)\nI&M has nuclear fuel lease agreements with DCC Fuel, which was formed for the purpose of acquiring, owning and leasing\nnuclear fuel to I&M. DCC Fuel purchased the nuclear fuel from I&M with funds received from the issuance of notes to\nfinancial institutions. Each DCC Fuel entity is a single-lessee leasing arrangement with only one asset and is capitalized with\nall debt. Each is a separate legal entity from I&M, the assets of which are not available to satisfy the debts of I&M. Payments\non the leases for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $97 million, $84 million and $91 million,\nrespectively. The leases were recorded as finance leases on I&M’s balance sheets as title to the nuclear fuel transfers to I&M at\nthe end of the respective lease terms, which do not exceed 54 months. Based on I&M’s control of DCC Fuel, management\nconcluded that I&M is the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate DCC Fuel. The finance leases are eliminated upon\nconsolidation. See the tables below for the classification of DCC Fuel’s assets and liabilities on I&M’s balance sheets.\n295\nTransition Funding (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas)\nTransition Funding was formed for the sole purpose of issuing and servicing securitization bonds related to restructuring\nlegislation in Texas. Management has concluded that AEP Texas is the primary beneficiary of Transition Funding because\nAEP Texas has the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE and AEP Texas’ equity interest could potentially be\nsignificant. Therefore, AEP Texas is required to consolidate Transition Funding. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, $72\nmillion and $70 million of the securitized bonds were included in Long-term Debt Due Within One Year - Nonaffiliated,\nrespectively, on the balance sheets. The securitized bonds included in Long-term Debt - Nonaffiliated were immaterial and\n$71 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, on the balance sheets. Transition Funding has securitized\ntransition assets of $64 million and $125 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which are presented\nseparately on the face of the balance sheets. The securitized transition assets represent the right to impose and collect Texas\ntrue-up costs from customers receiving electric transmission or distribution service from AEP Texas under-recovery\nmechanisms approved by the PUCT. The securitization bonds are payable only from and secured by the securitized transition\nassets. The bondholders have no recourse to AEP Texas or any other AEP entity. AEP Texas acts as the servicer for Transition\nFunding’s securitized transition assets and remits all related amounts collected from customers to Transition Funding for\ninterest and principal payments on the securitization bonds and related costs. See the tables below for the classification of\nTransition Funding’s assets and liabilities on the balance sheets.\nRestoration Funding (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas)\nRestoration Funding was formed for the sole purpose of issuing and servicing securitization bonds related to storm restoration\nof AEP Texas’ distribution system primarily due to damage caused by Hurricane Harvey. Management has concluded that\nAEP Texas is the primary beneficiary of Restoration Funding because AEP Texas has the power to direct the most significant\nactivities of the VIE and AEP Texas’ equity interest could potentially be significant. Therefore, AEP Texas is required to\nconsolidate Restoration Funding. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, $24 million and $24 million of the securitized bonds\nwere included in Long-term Debt Due Within One Year - Nonaffiliated, respectively, and $126 million and $150 million were\nincluded in Long-term Debt - Nonaffiliated, respectively, on the balance sheets. Restoration Funding has securitized assets of\n$139 million and $161 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which are presented separately on the face of\nthe balance sheets. The securitized restoration assets represent the right to impose and collect Texas storm restoration costs\nfrom customers receiving electric transmission or distribution service from AEP Texas under-recovery mechanisms approved\nby the PUCT. The securitization bonds are payable only from and secured by the securitized assets. The bondholders have no\nrecourse to AEP Texas or any other AEP entity. AEP Texas acts as the servicer for Restoration Funding’s securitized assets\nand remits all related amounts collected from customers to Restoration Funding for interest and principal payments on the\nsecuritization bonds and related costs. See the tables below for the classification of Restoration Funding’s assets and liabilities\non the balance sheets.\nAppalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding (Applies to AEP and APCo)\nAppalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding was formed for the sole purpose of issuing and servicing securitization bonds\nrelated to APCo’s under-recovered ENEC deferral balance. Management has concluded that APCo is the primary beneficiary\nof Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding because APCo has the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE\nand APCo’s equity interest could potentially be significant. Therefore, APCo is required to consolidate Appalachian Consumer\nRate Relief Funding. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, $27 million and $26 million of the securitized bonds were included\nin Long-term Debt Due Within One Year - Nonaffiliated, respectively, and $120 million and $147 million were included in\nLong-term Debt - Nonaffiliated, respectively, on the balance sheets. Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding has\nsecuritized assets of $133 million and $160 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which are presented\nseparately on the face of the balance sheets. The phase-in recovery property represents the right to impose and collect West\nVirginia deferred generation charges from customers receiving electric transmission, distribution and generation service from\nAPCo under a recovery mechanism approved by the WVPSC. In November 2013, securitization bonds were issued. The\nsecuritization bonds are payable only from and secured by the securitized assets. The bondholders have no recourse to APCo or\nany other AEP entity. APCo acts as the servicer for Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding’s securitized assets and remits\nall related amounts collected from customers to Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding for interest and principal payments\non the securitization bonds and related costs. See the tables below for the classification of Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief\nFunding’s assets and liabilities on APCo’s balance sheets.\nAEP Credit (Applies to AEP)\nAEP Credit is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. AEP Credit purchases, without recourse, accounts receivable from certain\nutility subsidiaries of AEP to reduce working capital requirements. AEP provides a minimum of 5% equity and up to 35% of\nAEP Credit’s short-term borrowing needs in excess of third-party financings. Any third-party financing of AEP Credit only has\nrecourse to the receivables securitized for such financing. Based on AEP’s control of AEP Credit, management concluded that\n296\nAEP is the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate AEP Credit. See the tables below for the classification of AEP\nCredit’s assets and liabilities on the balance sheets. See “Securitized Accounts Receivables - AEP Credit” section of Note 14.\nEIS (Applies to AEP)\nAEP’s subsidiaries participate in one protected cell of EIS for seven lines of insurance. EIS has multiple protected cells.\nNeither AEP nor its subsidiaries have an equity investment in EIS. The AEP System is essentially this EIS cell’s only\nparticipant, but allows certain third-parties access to this insurance. AEP’s subsidiaries and any allowed third-parties share in\nthe insurance coverage, premiums and risk of loss from claims. Based on AEP’s control and the structure of the protected cell\nof EIS, management concluded that AEP is the primary beneficiary of the protected cell and is required to consolidate the\nprotected cell of EIS. The insurance premium expense to the protected cell for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and\n2021 was $34 million, $31 million and $30 million, respectively.

The amount reported as equity is the protected cell’s policy holders’ surplus.\nTransource Energy (Applies to AEP)\nTransource Energy was formed for the purpose of investing in utilities which develop, acquire, construct, own and operate\ntransmission facilities in accordance with FERC-approved rates. AEP has equity and voting ownership of 86.5% with the other\nowner having 13.5% interest. Management has concluded that Transource Energy is a VIE and that AEP is the primary\nbeneficiary because AEP has the power to direct the most significant activities of the entity and AEP’s equity interest could\npotentially be significant. Therefore, AEP is required to consolidate Transource Energy. Transource Energy’s activities consist\nof the development, construction and operation of FERC-regulated transmission assets in Missouri, West Virginia,\nPennsylvania, Maryland and Oklahoma. Transource Energy has a credit facility agreement where borrowings are loaned\nthrough intercompany lending agreements to its subsidiaries.

The\noperations of DHLC are governed by the lignite mining agreement among SWEPCo, CLECO and DHLC. SWEPCo and\nCLECO share the executive board seats and voting rights equally. In accordance with the lignite mining agreement, each entity\nis responsible for 50% of DHLC’s obligations, including debt. SWEPCo and CLECO equally approve DHLC’s annual\nbudget. The creditors of DHLC have no recourse to any AEP entity other than SWEPCo. As SWEPCo is the sole equity owner\nof DHLC, it receives 100% of the management fee earned by DHLC. In April 2020, SWEPCo and CLECO jointly filed a\nnotification letter to the LPSC providing notice of the cessation of lignite mining. SWEPCo’s total billings from DHLC for the\nyears ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were not material, and for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $47\nmillion. DHLC paid dividends of $1 million, $25 million, and $0 to SWEPCo for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022\nand 2021, respectively. SWEPCo does not have the power to control decision making that significantly impacts the economic\nperformance of DHLC because such power is shared with CLECO. As a result, SWEPCo is not required to consolidate DHLC\nas it is not the primary beneficiary, although it holds a significant variable interest in DHLC. SWEPCo’s equity investment in\nDHLC is included in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets on SWEPCo’s balance sheets.\n298\nSWEPCo’s investment in DHLC was:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nAs Reported on Maximum As Reported on Maximum\nthe Balance Sheet Exposure the Balance Sheet Exposure\n(in millions)\nCapital Contribution from SWEPCo $ 7.6 $ 7.6 $ 7.6 $ 7.6\nRetained Earnings 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4\nSWEPCo’s Share of Obligations — 19.2 — 36.8\nTotal Investment in DHLC $ 8.0 $ 27.2 $ 8.0 $ 44.8\nOVEC (Applies to AEP and OPCo)\nAEP and several nonaffiliated utility companies jointly own OVEC.

The Registrants’ power participation ratios are 15.69% for APCo, 7.85% for I&M and 19.93% for OPCo.\nParticipants of this agreement are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all OVEC generating capacity, approximately\n2,400 MWs, in proportion to their respective power participation ratios. The proceeds from the sale of power by OVEC are\ndesigned to be sufficient for OVEC to meet its operating expenses and fixed costs, including outstanding indebtedness, and\nprovide a return on capital. The intercompany power agreement ends in June 2040.\nAEP and other nonaffiliated owners authorized environmental investments related to their ownership interests. OVEC financed\ncapital expenditures in connection with the engineering and construction of FGD projects and the associated waste disposal\nlandfills at its two generation plants. These environmental projects were funded through debt issuances. As of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, OVEC’s outstanding indebtedness was approximately $1.1 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively.

See \"Coal-Fired Generation Plants\" of Note 5 for additional information.\nNA Not applicable.\nFor regulated operations, the composite depreciation rate generally includes a component for non-ARO removal costs, which is\ncredited to Accumulated Depreciation and Amortization on the balance sheets. Actual removal costs incurred are charged to\nAccumulated Depreciation and Amortization. Any excess of accrued non-ARO removal costs over actual removal costs\nincurred is reclassified from Accumulated Depreciation and Amortization and reflected as a regulatory liability. For\nnonregulated operations, non-ARO removal costs are expensed as incurred.\nAsset Retirement Obligations (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo)\nThe Registrants recorded the following revisions to ARO estimates as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n• As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, I&M’s ARO liability for nuclear decommissioning of the Cook Plant was\n$2.11 billion and $2 billion, respectively. These liabilities are reflected in Asset Retirement Obligations on I&M’s\nbalance sheets. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair value of I&M’s assets that are legally restricted for\npurposes of settling decommissioning liabilities totaled $3.51 billion and $3.01 billion, respectively. These assets are\nincluded in Spent Nuclear Fuel and Decommissioning Trusts on I&M’s balance sheets.\n• In September 2022, APCo recorded a $14 million revision due to an increase in estimated ash pond closure costs at the\nAmos Plant.\n• In March 2022, PSO and SWEPCo acquired respective undivided ownership interests in the entity that owned\nTraverse during its development and construction. Immediately following the acquisition, PSO and SWEPCo\nliquidated the entity and simultaneously distributed the Traverse assets in proportion to their undivided ownership\ninterests. Traverse was placed in-service in March 2022. As a result, PSO and SWEPCo incurred additional ARO\nliabilities of $13 million and $15 million, respectively. See the “North Central Wind Energy Facilities” section of\nNote 7 for additional information.\n• In March 2022, SWEPCo recorded a $13 million revision due to an increase in estimated ash pond closure costs at the\nPirkey Plant and the Welsh Plant. In June 2022, SWEPCo recorded a $16 million revision due to an increase in\nestimated reclamation costs at Sabine. In September 2022, SWEPCo recorded a $14 million revision due to an\n304\nincrease in estimated landfill closure costs at Pirkey Plant. In November 2022, SWEPCo recorded an additional\n$7 million revision related to an increase in estimated reclamation costs at Sabine.\n• In August 2023, AEP completed the sale of its competitive contracted renewables portfolio to a nonaffiliated party and\nsettled ARO liabilities of $31 million. See “Disposition of the Competitive Contracted Renewables Portfolio” section\nof Note 7 for additional information.\n• In December 2023, SWEPCo recorded a $32 million revision related to an increase in estimated reclamation costs at\nSabine. Additionally in 2023, SWEPCo settled $50 million of costs related to closure/reclamation work performed\ndue to the recent retirements of the Pirkey Plant and Dolet Hills Power Station. See “Coal-Fired Generation Plants”\nsection of Note 5 for additional information.\n• In 2023, APCo recorded revisions of $27 million primarily due to an increase in estimated asbestos costs at several\nplants.\nThe following is a reconciliation of the 2023 and 2022 aggregate carrying amounts of ARO by Registrant:\nARO as of Revisions in ARO as of\nDecember 31, Accretion Liabilities Liabilities Cash Flow December 31,\nCompany 2022 Expense Incurred Settled Estimates (a) 2023\n(in millions)\nAEP(b)(c)(d)(e)(f)(g) $ 2,943.6 $ 116.3 $ 38.9 $ (130.6) $ 63.0 $ 3,031.2\nAEP Texas (b)(e) 4.5 0.2 — (0.3) 0.1 4.5\nAPCo (b)(e) 427.7 16.8 16.1 (23.1) 26.5 464.0\nI&M (b)(c)(e) 2,028.1 74.8 4.8 (3.7) 2.0 2,106.0\nOPCo (e) 5.0 0.2 — (3.1) — 2.1\nPSO (b)(e)(g) 75.7 4.7 5.8 (1.2) (0.8) 84.2\nSWEPCo (b)(d)(e)(g) 280.9 13.7 7.5 (55.0) 34.5 281.6\nARO as of Revisions in ARO as of\nDecember 31, Accretion Liabilities Liabilities Cash Flow December 31,\nCompany 2021 Expense Incurred Settled Estimates (a) 2022\n(in millions)\nAEP (b)(c)(d)(e)(f)(g) $ 2,741.7 $ 111.2 $ 37.4 $ (47.0) $ 100.3 $ 2,943.6\nAEP Texas (b)(e) 4.4 0.3 — (0.2) — 4.5\nAPCo (b)(e) 404.6 15.8 3.0 (12.7) 17.0 427.7\nI&M (b)(c)(e) 1,946.3 71.5 3.2 (0.6) 7.7 2,028.1\nOPCo (e) 1.9 0.2 3.0 (0.1) — 5.0\nPSO (b)(e)(g) 57.6 4.1 12.8 (0.7) 1.9 75.7\nSWEPCo (b)(d)(e)(g) 222.7 11.9 15.4 (25.8) 56.7 280.9\n(a) Unless discussed above, primarily related to ash ponds, landfills and mine reclamation, generally due to changes in\nestimated closure area, volumes and/or unit costs.\n(b) Includes ARO related to ash disposal facilities.\n(c) Includes ARO related to nuclear decommissioning costs for the Cook Plant of $2.11 billion and $2 billion as of December\n31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n(d) Includes ARO related to Sabine and DHLC.\n(e) Includes ARO related to asbestos removal.\n(f) Includes ARO related to solar farms.\n(g) Includes ARO related to wind farms.\n305\nAllowance for Funds Used During Construction and Interest Capitalization\nThe Registrants’ amounts of Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction are summarized in the following table:\nYears Ended December 31,\nCompany 2023 2022 2021\n(in millions)\nAEP $ 174.9 $ 133.7 $ 139.7\nAEP Texas 28.4 19.7 21.5\nAEPTCo 83.2 70.7 67.2\nAPCo 11.9 11.7 15.6\nI&M 10.9 9.8 12.8\nOPCo 17.1 13.9 10.8\nPSO 8.4 1.5 2.4\nSWEPCo 11.5 4.9 7.0\nThe Registrants’ amounts of allowance for borrowed funds used during construction, including capitalized interest, are\nsummarized in the following table:\nYears Ended December 31,\nCompany 2023 2022 2021\n(in millions)\nAEP $ 117.3 $ 63.0 $ 53.8\nAEP Texas 23.4 11.5 10.5\nAEPTCo 31.4 22.4 21.0\nAPCo 14.1 6.5 7.5\nI&M 7.7 5.7 5.1\nOPCo 14.0 6.7 4.7\nPSO 5.2 2.7 0.7\nSWEPCo 9.8 4.3 3.0\n306\nJointly-owned Electric Facilities (Applies to AEP, I&M, PSO and SWEPCo)\nThe Registrants have electric facilities that are jointly-owned with affiliated and nonaffiliated companies.

A performance obligation is a promise to transfer a\ndistinct good or service, or a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of\ntransfer to a customer. The invoice practical expedient within the accounting guidance for “Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers” allows for the recognition of revenue from performance obligations in the amount of consideration to which there is\na right to invoice the customer and when the amount for which there is a right to invoice corresponds directly to the value\ntransferred to the customer.\nThe purpose of the invoice practical expedient is to depict an entity’s measure of progress toward completion of the\nperformance obligation within a contract and can only be applied to performance obligations that are satisfied over time and\nwhen the invoice is representative of services provided to date. AEP subsidiaries elected to apply the invoice practical\nexpedient to recognize revenue for performance obligations satisfied over time as the invoices from the respective revenue\nstreams are representative of services or goods provided to date to the customer. Performance obligations for AEP’s\nsubsidiaries are summarized as follows:\nRetail Revenues\nAEP’s subsidiaries within the Vertically Integrated Utilities and Transmission and Distribution Utilities segments have\nperformance obligations to generate, transmit and distribute electricity for sale to rate-regulated retail customers. The\nperformance obligation to deliver electricity is satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the\nbenefits provided. Revenues are variable as they are subject to the customer’s usage requirements.\nRate-regulated retail customers typically have the right to discontinue receiving service at will, therefore these contracts\nbetween AEP’s subsidiaries and their customers for rate-regulated services are generally limited to the services requested and\nreceived to date for such arrangements. Retail customers are generally billed on a monthly basis, and payment is typically due\nwithin 15 to 20 days after the issuance of the invoice. Payments from REPs are due to AEP Texas within 35 days.\n313\nWholesale Revenues - Generation\nAEP’s subsidiaries within the Vertically Integrated Utilities and Generation & Marketing segments have performance\nobligations to sell electricity to wholesale customers from generation assets in PJM, SPP and ERCOT. The performance\nobligation to deliver electricity from generation assets is satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and\nconsumes the benefits provided. Wholesale generation revenues are variable as they are subject to the customer’s usage\nrequirements.\nAEP’s subsidiaries within the Vertically Integrated Utilities and Generation & Marketing segments also have performance\nobligations to stand ready in order to promote grid reliability. Stand ready services are sold into PJM’s RPM capacity market.\nRPM entails a base auction and at least three incremental auctions for a specific PJM delivery year, with the incremental\nauctions spanning three years. The performance obligation to stand ready is satisfied over time and the consideration for which\nis variable until the occurrence of the final incremental auction, at which point the performance obligation becomes fixed.\nPayments from the RTO for stand ready services are typically received within one week from the issuance of the invoice, which\nis typically issued weekly. Gross margin resulting from generation sales within the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment are\nprimarily subject to margin sharing agreements with customers and vary by state, where the revenues are reflected gross in the\ndisaggregated revenues tables above.\nAPCo has a performance obligation to supply wholesale electricity to KGPCo through a PPA. The FERC regulates the cost-\nbased wholesale power transactions between APCo and KGPCo. The purchased power agreement includes a component for the\nrecovery of transmission costs under the FERC OATT. The transmission cost component of purchased power is cost-based and\nregulated by the Tennessee Regulatory Authority. APCo’s performance obligation under the purchased power agreement is\nsatisfied over time as KGPCo simultaneously receives and consumes the wholesale electricity. APCo’s revenues from the\npurchased power agreement are presented within the Generation Revenues line in the disaggregated revenues tables above.\nWholesale Revenues - Transmission\nAEP’s subsidiaries within the Vertically Integrated Utilities, Transmission and Distribution Utilities and AEP Transmission\nHoldco segments have performance obligations to transmit electricity to wholesale customers through assets owned and\noperated by AEP subsidiaries. The performance obligation to provide transmission services in PJM, SPP and ERCOT is\npartially fixed for a period of one year or less. Payments from the RTO for transmission services are typically received within\none week from the issuance of the invoice, which is issued monthly for SPP and ERCOT and weekly for PJM.\nAEP subsidiaries within the PJM and SPP regions collect revenues through transmission formula rates. The FERC-approved\nrates establish the annual transmission revenue requirement (ATRR) and transmission service rates for transmission owners.\nThe formula rates establish rates for a one year period and also include a true-up calculation for the prior year’s billings,\nallowing for over/under-recovery of the transmission owner’s ATRR. The annual true-ups meet the definition of alternative\nrevenues in accordance with the accounting guidance for “Regulated Operations,” and are therefore presented as such in the\ndisaggregated revenues tables above. AEP subsidiaries within the ERCOT region collect revenues through a combination of\nbase rates and interim Transmission Costs of Services filings that are approved by the PUCT.\nThe AEP East Companies are parties to the TA, which defines how transmission costs are allocated among the AEP East\nCompanies on a 12-month average coincident peak basis. PSO, SWEPCo and AEPSC are parties to the TCA by and among\nPSO, SWEPCo and AEPSC, in connection with the operation of the transmission assets of the two AEP utility subsidiaries.\nAEPTCo is a transmission owner within the PJM and SPP regions providing transmission services to affiliates in accordance\nwith the OATT, TA and TCA. Affiliate revenues as a result of the respective TA and the TCA are reflected as Transmission\nRevenues in the disaggregated revenues tables above.\nMarketing, Competitive Retail and Renewable Revenues\nAEP’s subsidiaries within the Generation & Marketing segment have performance obligations to deliver electricity to\ncompetitive retail and wholesale customers. Performance obligations for marketing, competitive retail and renewable offtake\nsales are satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided. Revenues are\nprimarily variable as they are subject to customer’s usage requirements; however, certain contracts mandate a delivery of a set\nquantity of electricity at a predetermined price, resulting in a fixed performance obligation.\nPayment terms under marketing arrangements typically follow standard Edison Electric Institute and International Swaps and\nDerivatives Association terms, which call for payment in 20 days. Payments for competitive retail and offtake arrangements for\nrenewable assets range from 15 to 60 days and are dependent on the product sold, location and the creditworthiness of\ncustomer. Invoices for marketing arrangements, competitive retail and offtake arrangements for renewable assets are issued\nmonthly.\n314\nFixed Performance Obligations (Applies to AEP, APCo and I&M)\nThe following table represents the Registrants’ remaining fixed performance obligations satisfied over time as of December 31,\n2023. Fixed performance obligations primarily include electricity sales for fixed amounts of energy and stand ready services\ninto PJM’s RPM market. The Registrants elected to apply the exemption to not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance\nobligations for contracts with an original expected term of one year or less. Due to the annual establishment of revenue\nrequirements, transmission revenues are excluded from the table below. The Registrant Subsidiaries amounts shown in the\ntable below include affiliated and nonaffiliated revenues.\nCompany 2024 2025-2026 2027-2028 After 2028 Total\n(in millions)\nAEP $ 84.4 $ 167.2 $ 84.4 $ 27.3 $ 363.3\nAPCo 16.1 32.2 23.2 11.7 83.2\nI&M 4.4 8.8 8.8 4.5 26.5\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nContract assets are recognized when the Registrants have a right to consideration that is conditional upon the occurrence of an\nevent other than the passage of time, such as future performance under a contract. The Registrants did not have any material\ncontract assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nWhen the Registrants receive consideration, or such consideration is unconditionally due from a customer prior to transferring\ngoods or services to the customer under the terms of a sales contract, they recognize a contract liability on the balance sheet in\nthe amount of that consideration. Revenue for such consideration is subsequently recognized in the period or periods in which\nthe remaining performance obligations in the contract are satisfied. The Registrants’ contract liabilities typically arise from\nservices provided under joint use agreements for utility poles. The Registrants did not have any material contract liabilities as\nof December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nAccounts Receivable from Contracts with Customers\nAccounts receivable from contracts with customers are presented on the Registrants’ balance sheets within the Accounts\nReceivable - Customers line item. The Registrants’ balances for receivables from contracts that are not recognized in\naccordance with the accounting guidance for “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” included in Accounts Receivable -\nCustomers were not material as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.

Contract costs to acquire a contract are\namortized in a manner consistent with the transfer of goods or services to the customer in Other Operation on the Registrants’\nincome statements. The Registrants did not have material contract costs as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n315\nITEM 9.

The Registrants continually strive\nto improve their disclosure controls and procedures to enhance the quality of their financial reporting and to maintain dynamic\nsystems that change as events warrant.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in the Registrants’ internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule\n13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter 2023 that materially affected, or are reasonably\nlikely to materially affect, the Registrants’ internal control over financial reporting.\nInternal Control over Financial Reporting\nSee Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting for each Registrant under Item 8. As discussed in that\nreport, management assessed and reported on the effectiveness of each Registrant’s internal control over financial reporting as\nof December 31, 2023. As a result of that assessment, management concluded that each Registrant’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nITEM 9B.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe condensed financial information of Parent is required as a result of the restricted net assets of AEP consolidated\nsubsidiaries exceeding 25% of AEP consolidated net assets as of December 31, 2023. Parent is a public utility holding\ncompany that owns all of the outstanding common stock of its public utility subsidiaries and varying percentages of other\nsubsidiaries, including joint ventures and equity investments. The primary source of income for Parent is equity in its\nsubsidiaries’ earnings. Its major source of cash is dividends from the subsidiaries, which are evaluated for cash flow\npresentation based on the nature of the distribution. Parent borrows the funds for the money pool that is used by the\nsubsidiaries for their short-term cash needs. Parent financial statements should be read in conjunction with the AEP\nconsolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. For purposes of these condensed financial statements,\nAEP wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries are recorded based upon its proportionate share of the subsidiaries’ net\nassets (similar to presenting them on the equity method).\nIncome Taxes\nParent files a consolidated federal income tax return with its subsidiaries. Historically, the allocation of the AEP System’s\ncurrent consolidated federal income tax to the AEP System companies allocated the benefit of current tax loss of the parent\ncompany (Parent Company Loss Benefit) to the AEP System subsidiaries through a reduction of current tax expense. In the\nfirst quarter of 2022, AEP and subsidiaries changed accounting for the Parent Company Loss Benefit from a reduction of\ncurrent tax expense to an allocation through equity. The impact of this change was immaterial to the Subsidiaries’ financial\nstatements. The consolidated NOL of the AEP System is allocated to each company in the consolidated group with taxable\nincome. With the exception of the allocation of the consolidated AEP System NOL, the loss of the Parent and tax credits, the\nmethod of allocation reflects a separate return result for each company in the consolidated group.\nTermination of Planned Disposition of KPCo and KTCo\nIn October 2021, AEP entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (SPA) to sell KPCo and KTCo to Liberty Utilities Co., a\nsubsidiary of Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. (Liberty), for approximately a $2.85 billion enterprise value. The SPA was\nsubsequently amended in September 2022 to reduce the purchase price to approximately $2.646 billion. The sale required\napproval from the KPSC and from the FERC under Section 203 of the Federal Power Act. The SPA contained certain\ntermination rights if the closing of the sale did not occur by April 26, 2023.\nIn May 2022, the KPSC approved the sale of KPCo to Liberty subject to certain conditions contingent upon the closing of the\nsale. In December 2022, the FERC issued an order denying, without prejudice, authorization of the proposed sale stating the\napplicants failed to demonstrate the proposed transaction will not have an adverse effect on rates. In February 2023, a new\nfiling for approval under Section 203 of the Federal Power Act was submitted. In March 2023, the KPSC and other intervenors\nmade filings recommending the FERC reject AEP and Liberty’s new Section 203 application seeking approval of the sale.\nIn April 2023, AEP, AEPTCo and Liberty entered into a Mutual Termination Agreement (Termination Agreement) terminating\nthe SPA. The parties entered into the Termination Agreement as all of the conditions precedent to closing the sale could not be\nsatisfied prior to April 26, 2023.\nUpon reverting to a held and used model, AEP Parent was required to present its investment in the Kentucky Operations at the\nlower of fair value or historical carrying value. As a result, AEP Parent’s December 31, 2022 balance sheets reflect a $363\nmillion pretax reduction in the basis of its investment in KPCo’s assets which is recorded in Investments in Unconsolidated\nSubsidiaries. In 2023, the $363 million was reduced by $28 million to remove the impact of estimated costs to sell KPCo and\nKTCo which was included in the Loss on the Expected Sale of the Kentucky Operations in 2022. The reduced investment in\nKPCo’s assets is being amortized over the 30-year average useful life of the KPCo assets.\n2. COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES\nParent and its subsidiaries are parties to environmental and other legal matters. For further discussion, see Note 6 -\nCommitments, Guarantees and Contingencies included in the 2023 Annual Report.\nS-6\n3.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nPayments on Behalf of Subsidiaries\nDue to occasional time sensitivity and complexity of payments, Parent makes certain insurance, tax and benefit payments on\nbehalf of subsidiary companies. Parent is then fully reimbursed by the subsidiary companies.\nShort-term Lending to Subsidiaries\nParent uses a commercial paper program to meet the short-term borrowing needs of subsidiaries. The program is used to fund\nboth a Utility Money Pool, which funds the utility subsidiaries, and a Nonutility Money Pool, which funds certain nonutility\nsubsidiaries. In addition, the program also funds, as direct borrowers, the short-term debt requirements of other subsidiaries\nthat are not participants in either money pool for regulatory or operational reasons. The program also allows some direct\nborrowers to invest excess cash with Parent.\nInterest expense related to Parent’s short-term borrowing is included in Interest Expense on Parent’s statements of\nincome. Parent incurred interest expense for amounts borrowed from subsidiaries of $33 million, $30 million and $2 million\nfor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nInterest income related to Parent’s short-term lending is included in Interest Income on Parent’s statements of income. Parent\nearned interest income for amounts advanced to subsidiaries of $164 million, $71 million and $15 million for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAffiliated Notes\nParent issued long-term debt, portions of which were loaned to its subsidiaries. Parent pays interest on the affiliated notes, but\nthe subsidiaries accrue interest for their share of the affiliated borrowing and remit the interest to Parent. Interest income\nrelated to Parent’s loans to subsidiaries is included in Interest Income on Parent’s statements of income. Parent earned interest\nincome on loans to subsidiaries of $6 million, $3 million and $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and\n2021, respectively.\nS-8\nSCHEDULE II – VALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS AND RESERVES\nAEP Additions\nBalance at Charged to Charged to Balance at\nBeginning Costs and Other Deductions End of\nDescription of Period Expenses Accounts (a) (b) Period\n(in millions)\nDeducted from Assets:\nAccumulated Provision for Uncollectible\nAccounts:\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 $ 57.1 $ 15.0 $ — $ 12.0 $ 60.1\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 55.4 41.2 0.8 40.3 57.1\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 71.1 20.3 0.6 36.6 55.4\n(a) Recoveries offset by reclasses to other assets and liabilities.\n(b) Uncollectible accounts written off.\nSchedule II for the Registrant Subsidiaries is not presented because the amounts are not material.\nS-9\n- THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK -\nINDEX OF AEP TRANSMISSION COMPANY, LLC (AEPTCO PARENT)\nFINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES\nPage\nNumber\nThe following financial statement schedules are included in this report on the pages indicated:\nAEP Transmission Company, LLC (AEPTCo Parent):\nSchedule I – Condensed Financial Information S-11\nSchedule I – Condensed Notes to Condensed Financial Information S-15\nS-10\nSCHEDULE I\nAEP TRANSMISSION COMPANY, LLC (AEPTCo Parent)\nCONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nCONDENSED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021\n(in millions)\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nEXPENSES\nOther Operation $ 0.2 $ 0.7 $ 0.2\nTOTAL EXPENSES 0.2 0.7 0.2\nOPERATING LOSS (0.2) (0.7) (0.2)\nOther Income (Expense):\nInterest Income -

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe condensed financial information of AEPTCo Parent is required as a result of the restricted net assets of AEPTCo\nconsolidated subsidiaries exceeding 25% of AEPTCo consolidated net assets as of December 31, 2023. AEPTCo Parent is the\ndirect holding company for the seven State Transcos. The primary source of income for AEPTCo Parent is equity in its\nsubsidiaries’ earnings. AEPTCo Parent financial statements should be read in conjunction with the AEPTCo consolidated\nfinancial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. For purposes of these condensed financial statements, AEPTCo\nwholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries are recorded based upon its proportionate share of the subsidiaries’ net assets\n(similar to presenting them on the equity method).\nIncome Taxes\nAEPTCo Parent joins in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return with its affiliates in the AEP System.\nHistorically, the allocation of the AEP System’s current consolidated federal income tax to the AEP System companies\nallocated the benefit of current tax loss of the parent company (Parent Company Loss Benefit) to the AEP System subsidiaries\nthrough a reduction of current tax expense.

In December 2022, the FERC issued an order denying, without prejudice, authorization of the proposed sale stating the\napplicants failed to demonstrate the proposed transaction will not have an adverse effect on rates. In February 2023, a new\nfiling for approval under Section 203 of the Federal Power Act was submitted. In March 2023, the KPSC and other intervenors\nmade filings recommending the FERC reject AEP and Liberty’s new Section 203 application seeking approval of the sale.\nIn April 2023, AEP, AEPTCo and Liberty entered into a Mutual Termination Agreement (Termination Agreement) terminating\nthe SPA. The parties entered into the Termination Agreement as all of the conditions precedent to closing the sale could not be\nsatisfied prior to April 26, 2023.\n2. COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES\nAEPTCo Parent and its subsidiaries are parties to legal matters. For further discussion, see Note 6 - Commitments, Guarantees\nand Contingencies included in the 2023 Annual Report.\n3. FINANCING ACTIVITIES\nFor discussion of Financing Activities, see Note 14 - Financing Activities to AEPTCo’s audited consolidated financial\nstatements included in the 2023 Annual Report.\n4. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nPayments on Behalf of Subsidiaries\nDue to occasional time sensitivity and complexity of payments, Parent makes certain insurance, tax and other payments on\nbehalf of subsidiary companies. Parent is then fully reimbursed by the subsidiary companies. AEPTCo Parent also makes\nconvenience payments on behalf of its State Transcos. AEPTCo Parent is then fully reimbursed by its State Transcos.\nS-15\nLong-term Lending to Subsidiaries\nAEPTCo Parent enters into debt arrangements with nonaffiliated entities. AEPTCo Parent has long-term debt of $5.4 billion\nand $4.8 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. AEPTCo Parent uses the proceeds from these nonaffiliated\ndebt arrangements to make affiliated loans to its State Transcos using the same interest rates and maturity dates as the\nnonaffiliated debt arrangements. AEPTCo Parent has recorded Notes Receivable – Affiliated of $5.4 billion and $4.8 billion as\nof December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The program is used to fund\nboth a Utility Money Pool, which funds the utility subsidiaries, and a Nonutility Money Pool, which funds certain nonutility\nsubsidiaries. In addition, the program also funds, as direct borrowers, the short-term debt requirements of other subsidiaries\nthat are not participants in either money pool for regulatory or operational reasons. The program also allows some direct\nborrowers to invest excess cash with Parent.\nInterest expense related to AEPTCo Parent’s short-term borrowing is included in Interest Expense on AEPTCo Parent’s\nstatements of income. AEPTCo Parent incurred immaterial interest expense for amounts borrowed from AEP affiliates for the\nyears ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nInterest income related to AEPTCo Parent’s short-term lending is included in Interest Income – Affiliated on AEPTCo Parent’s\nstatements of income.

These supply chain disruptions have not\nhad a material impact on the Registrants’ net income, cash flows and financial condition, but have extended lead times for\ncertain goods and services and have contributed to higher prices for fuel, materials, labor, equipment and other needed\ncommodities. Management has implemented risk mitigation strategies in an attempt to mitigate the impacts of these supply\nchaindisruptions.\nThe United States economy has experienced a significant level of inflation that has contributed to increased uncertainty in the\noutlook of near-term economic activity, including whether the pace of inflation will continue to moderate.

AEPEnergyhadapproximately929,000customeraccountsasofDecember31,2023. InApril2023,AEP\nmanagement completed the strategic evaluation of AEP Energy and initiated a sales process. The timing of the completion of\nthe sales process is dependent upon a number of factors. AEP is currently targeting the sales process to be completed in the\nfirst half of 2024. Depending on the outcome of the sales process, it could reduce future net income and impact financial\ncondition.\nAEPOnsitePartners\nIn April 2023, AEP also made a decision to include AEP Onsite Partners in a sales process. AEP OnSite Partners targets\nopportunities in distributed solar, combined heat and power, energy storage, waste heat recovery, energy efficiency, peaking\ngeneration and other energy solutions.

In2013,thePUCTissuedanorderaffirmingtheprudenceoftheTurkPlantbutdeterminedthattheTurkPlant’sTexas\njurisdictional capital cost cap established in a previous Certificate of Convenience and Necessity case also limited SWEPCo’s\nrecovery of AFUDC in addition to limits on its recovery of cash construction costs. Upon rehearing in 2014, the PUCT\nreverseditsinitialrulinganddeterminedthatAFUDCwasexcludedfromtheTurkPlant’sTexasjurisdictionalcapitalcostcap.\nIn 2017, the Texas District Court upheld the PUCT’s 2014 order and intervenors filed appeals with the Texas Third Court of\nAppeals. InAugust2021,theTexasThirdCourtofAppealsreversedtheTexasDistrictCourtjudgmentaffirmingthePUCT’s\norder on AFUDC, concluding that the language of the PUCT’s original 2008 order intended to include AFUDC in the Texas\njurisdictional capital cost cap, and remanded the case to the PUCT for future proceedings. In November 2021, SWEPCo and\nthe PUCT submitted Petitions for Review with the Texas Supreme Court. In October 2022, the Texas Supreme Court denied\nthePetitionsforReviewsubmittedbySWEPCoandthePUCT.

IfAEPisunabletorecover\nthecostsofitsinvestments,itwouldreducefuturenetincomeandcashflowsandimpactfinancialcondition.\nMATSRule\nIn April 2023, the Federal EPA issued a proposed rule that would revise the MATS for power plants. The proposed rule\nincludes a more stringent standard for emissions of filterable PM for coal-fired electric generating units, as well as a new\nmercury standard for lignite-fired electric generating units. The proposed rule also requires the installation and operation of\ncontinuous emissions monitors for PM. Management is evaluating the impacts of the rule as proposed and will continue to\nmonitortherulemaking.\nCCRRule\nThe Federal EPA’s CCR rule regulates the disposal and beneficial re-use of CCR, including fly ash and bottom ash created\nfrom coal-fired generating units and FGD gypsum generated at some coal-fired plants. The rule applies to active and inactive\nCCRlandfillsandsurfaceimpoundmentsatfacilitiesofactiveelectricutilityorindependentpowerproducers.\n22\nIn2020,theFederalEPArevisedtheCCRruletoincludearequirementthatunlinedCCRstoragepondsceaseoperationsand\ninitiateclosurebyApril11,2021. Therevisedruleprovidestwooptionsthatallowfacilitiestoextendthedatebywhichthey\nmustceasereceiptofcoalashandclosetheponds.\nThe first option provides an extension to cease receipt of CCR no later than October 15, 2023 for most units, and October 15,\n2024foranarrowsubsetofunits;however,theFederalEPA’sgrantofsuchanextensionrequiresasatisfactorydemonstration\nof the need for additional time to develop alternative ash disposal capacity and will be limited to the soonest timeframe\ntechnically feasible to cease receipt of CCR. Additionally, each request must undergo formal review, including public\ncomments, and be approved by the Federal EPA. AEP filed applications for additional time to develop alternative disposal\ncapacityatthevariousplants.\nIn January 2022, the Federal EPA proposed to deny several extension requests filed by the other utilities based on allegations\nthat those utilities are not in compliance with the CCR Rule (the January Actions). In November 2022, the Federal EPA\nfinalized one of these denials (the Gavin Denial, discussed above). The Federal EPA’s allegations of noncompliance rely on\nnew interpretations of the CCR Rule requirements. The January Actions of the Federal EPA and the Gavin Denial have been\nchallenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit as unlawful rulemaking that revises the existing\nCCR Rule requirements without proper notice and without opportunity for comment. Management is unable to predict the\noutcomeofthatlitigationorhowitmayimpacttheFederalEPA’sinterpretationoftheCCRRule.\nInJuly2022,theFederalEPAproposedconditionalapprovalofthependingextensionrequestforAPCo’sMountaineerPlant.\nThe Federal EPA alleged that the Mountaineer Plant was not fully compliant with the CCR Rule. In December 2022, AEP\nwithdrew the pending extension request for the Mountaineer Plant as work to construct new CCR disposal facilities was\ncompleted and the extension was no longer needed. In addition, AEP ceased receiving ash in the other ponds subject to the\nextension requests, completed construction of new, CCR Rule compliant facilities and withdrew all of the remaining\napplicationsforadditionaltimetodevelopalternativedisposalcapacity.\nUnderthesecondoptionforobtaininganextensionoftheApril11,2021deadlinetoceaseoperationofunlinedimpoundments,\nageneratingfacilitymaycontinueoperatingitsexistingimpoundmentswithoutdevelopingalternativeCCRdisposal,provided\nthefacilitycommitstoceasecombustionofcoalbyadatecertain.

Pursuant to this option, AEP informed the Federal EPA of its\nintenttoretirethePirkeyPlantandceaseusingcoalattheWelshPlant. InMarch2023,thePirkeyPlantwasretired.

Management\nwillcontinuetoparticipateinrulemakingactivitiesandmakeadjustmentsbasedonnewfederalandstaterequirementsaffecting\nitsashdisposalunits.\nIn May 2023, the Federal EPA proposed revisions to the CCR Rule to expand the scope of the rule to include inactive\nimpoundments at inactive facilities (“legacy CCR surface impoundments”) as well as to establish requirements for currently\nexempt solid waste management units that involve the direct placement of CCR on the land (“CCR management units”). The\nFederalEPAisproposingthatownersandoperatorsoflegacysurfaceimpoundmentscomplywithalloftheexistingCCRRule\nrequirementsapplicabletoinactiveCCRsurfaceimpoundmentsatactivefacilities,exceptforthelocationrestrictionsandliner\ndesigncriteria. Theproposalestablishesacceleratedcompliancedeadlinesforlegacysurfaceimpoundmentstomeetregulatory\nrequirements, including a requirement to initiate closure within one year after the effective date of the final rule. The Federal\nEPA's proposal would require evaluations to be completed at both active facilities and inactive facilities with one or more\nlegacy surface impoundments. If finalized, AEP may incur material, additional costs complying with the Federal EPA’s\nproposal, including costs to upgrade or close and replace legacy CCR surface impoundments and to conduct any required\nremedial actions including removal of coal ash. In addition, AEP would need to seek cost recovery through regulated rates,\nincluding proposing new regulatory mechanisms for cost recovery, for which regulatory approval cannot be assured. The\nproposed rule, if finalized, could have a material adverse impact on net income, cash flows and financial condition if AEP\ncannotultimatelyrecoveranyadditionalcostsofcompliance.\n23\nCleanWaterActRegulations\nThe Federal EPA’s ELG rule for generating facilities establishes limits for FGD wastewater, fly ash and bottom ash transport\nwater and flue gas mercury control wastewater, which are to be implemented through each facility’s wastewater discharge\npermit. ArevisiontotheELGrule,publishedinOctober2020,establishedadditionaloptionsforreusinganddischargingsmall\nvolumesofbottomashtransportwater,providedanexceptionforretiringunitsandextendedthecompliancedeadlinetoadate\nas soon as possible beginning one year after the rule was published but no later than December 2025. Management has\nassessed technology additions and retrofits to comply with the rule and the impacts of the Federal EPA’s actions on facilities’\nwastewater discharge permitting for FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water. For affected facilities that must install\nadditionaltechnologiestomeettheELGrulelimits,permitmodificationswerefiledinJanuary2021thatreflecttheoutcomeof\nthat assessment. AEP continues to work with state agencies to finalize permit terms and conditions. Other facilities opted to\nfile Notices of Planned Participation (NOPP), pursuant to which the facilities are not required to install additional controls to\nmeet ELG limits provided they make commitments to cease coal combustion by a date certain. In March 2023, the Federal\nEPA proposed further revisions to the ELG rule which, if finalized, would establish a zero discharge standard for FGD\nwastewaterandbottomashtransportwater,andmorestringentdischargelimitsforcombustionresidualleachate. Management\nisevaluatingtheimpactsoftheproposedruletooperations. ManagementcannotpredictwhethertheFederalEPAwillactually\nfinalize further revisions, but will continue to monitor this issue and will participate in further rulemaking activities as they\narise.\nThe definition of “waters of the United States” has been subject to rule making and litigation which has led to inconsistent\nscope among the states. Management will continue to monitor developments in rule making and litigation for any potential\nimpacttooperations.\nImpactofEnvironmentalRegulationonCoal-FiredGeneration\nCompliance with extensive environmental regulations requires significant capital investment in environmental monitoring,\ninstallation of pollution control equipment, emission fees, disposal, remediation and permits. Management continuously\nevaluates cost estimates of complying with these regulations which may result in a decision to retire coal-fired generating\nfacilitiesearlierthantheircurrentlyestimatedusefullives.\nThe table below summarizes the net book value, as of December 31, 2023, of generating facilities retired or planned for early\nretirementinadvanceoftheretirementdatecurrentlyauthorizedforratemakingpurposes:\nCurrent\nAccelerated Actual/Projected Authorized\nNet Depreciation Retirement Recovery Annual\nCompany Plant Investment(a) RegulatoryAsset Date Period Depreciation(b)\n(inmillions) (inmillions)\nPSO NortheasternPlant,Unit3 $ 104.5 $ 164.2 2026 (c) $ 15.0\nSWEPCo PirkeyPlant — 114.4 (d) 2023 (e) —\nSWEPCo WelshPlant,Units1and3 352.0 125.6 2028 (f) (g) 38.6\n(a) NetbookvalueincludingCWIPexcludingcostofremovalandmaterialsandsupplies.\n(b) Theseamountsrepresenttheamountofannualdepreciationthathasbeencollectedfromcustomersovertheprior12-monthperiod.\n(c) NortheasternPlant,Unit3iscurrentlybeingrecoveredthrough2040.\n(d) RepresentsArkansasandTexasjurisdictionalshare.\n(e) Aspartofthe2021ArkansasBaseRateCase,theAPSCgrantedSWEPCoregulatoryassettreatment.

The\ndeterminationofsalestoindividualcustomersisbasedonthereadingoftheirmeters,whichisperformedonasystematicbasis\nthroughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter\nreading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue accrual is recorded.

TheVaRisbasedonthevariance-covariancemethodusinghistoricalpricestoestimatevolatilitiesand\ncorrelations and assumes a 95% confidence level and a one-day holding period. Based on this VaR analysis, as of\nDecember31,2023,aneartermtypicalchangeincommoditypricesisnotexpectedtomateriallyimpactnetincome,cashflows\norfinancialcondition.\nManagement calculates the VaR for both a trading and non-trading portfolio.

Based on the assumed 95%\nconfidence interval, the performance due to actual price movements would be expected to exceed the VaR at least once every\n20tradingdays.\nAs the VaR calculation captures recent price movements, management also performs regular stress testing of the trading\nportfolio to understand AEP’s exposure to extreme price movements. A historical-based method is employed whereby the\ncurrenttradingportfolioissubjectedtoactual,observedpricemovementsfromthelastseveralyearsinordertoascertainwhich\nhistorical price movements translated into the largest potential MTM loss.

Prior to 2022, interest rates\nremained at low levels and the Federal Reserve maintained the federal funds target range at 0.0% to 0.25% for much of 2021.\nHowever, during 2022, the Federal Reserve approved several rate increases for a cumulative total of 4.25% increase.

In addition, AEP operated competitive wind and\nsolar farms prior to the sale of AEP Renewables’ competitive contracted renewables portfolio in August 2023. I&M provides\nbargingservicestobothaffiliatedandnonaffiliatedcompanies.\nSUMMARYOFSIGNIFICANTACCOUNTINGPOLICIES\nRatesandServiceRegulation\nAEP’s public utility subsidiaries’ rates are regulated by the FERC and state regulatory commissions in the eleven state\noperatingterritoriesinwhichtheyoperate. TheFERCalsoregulatestheRegistrants’affiliatedtransactions,includingAEPSC\nintercompanyservicebillingswhicharegenerallyatcost,underthe2005PublicUtilityHoldingCompanyActandtheFederal\nPower Act. The FERC also has jurisdiction over certain issuances and acquisitions of securities of the public utility\nsubsidiaries, the acquisition or sale of certain utility assets and mergers with another electric utility or holding company. The\nstate regulatory commissions also regulate certain intercompany transactions under various orders and affiliate statutes. Both\nthe FERC and state regulatory commissions are permitted to review and audit the relevant books and records of companies\nwithinapublicutilityholdingcompanysystem.\nThe FERC regulates wholesale power markets and wholesale power transactions. The Registrants’ wholesale power\ntransactions are generally market-based.

Since APCo does not have\nregulatory authority to sell accounts receivable in its West Virginia regulatory jurisdiction, only a portion of APCo’s accounts\nreceivable are sold to AEP Credit. AEP Credit has a receivables securitization agreement with bank conduits. Under the\nsecuritization agreement, AEP Credit receives financing from bank conduits for a portion of its interests in the billed and\nunbilled receivables acquired from the affiliated utility subsidiaries.

The assessment is performed separately for each\nparticipating AEP subsidiary, which inherently contemplates any differences in geographical risk characteristics for the\nallowance for uncollectible accounts. From January 2022 through August 2023, KPCo ceased selling accounts receivable to\nAEP Credit due to the planned sale of KPCo to Liberty. During this time period, KPCo recognized an allowance for\nuncollectible accounts on its balance sheet for its accounts receivables using the same assessment methodology used for AEP\nCredit’s receivables. In September 2023, KPCo resumed selling accounts receivable to AEP Credit, due to the termination of\nthe sale to Liberty. For receivables related to APCo’s West Virginia operations, the allowance for uncollectible accounts is\ncalculatedbasedonarollingtwo-yearaveragewrite-offinproportiontogrossaccountsreceivable.\n66\nFor customer accounts receivables relating to risk management activities, accounts receivable are reviewed for potential credit\nlosses at a specific counterparty level basis. For AEP Texas, allowances for uncollectible accounts are calculated using the\nspecificidentificationofreceivablebalancesgreaterthan120daysdelinquent,andforthosebalanceslessthan120dayswhere\nthe collection is doubtful.

Quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value\nand are used as the basis for the measurement, if available. In the absence of quoted prices for identical or similar assets in\nactive markets, fair value is estimated using various internal and external valuation methods including cash flow analysis and\nappraisals.\nNonregulated\nNonregulated operations generally follow the policies of rate-regulated operations listed above but with the following\nexceptions.

The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for\nidentical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3\nmeasurement). Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is\ncategorized in Level 2. When quoted market prices are not available, pricing may be completed using comparable securities,\ndealer values, operating data and general market conditions to determine fair value. Valuation models utilize various inputs\nsuch as commodity, interest rate and, to a lesser degree, volatility and credit that include quoted prices for similar assets or\nliabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, market corroborated\ninputs(i.e.inputsderivedprincipallyfrom,orcorrelatedto,observablemarketdata)andotherobservableinputsfortheassetor\nliability.\nForcommercialactivities,exchange-tradedderivatives,namelyfuturescontracts,aregenerallyfairvaluedbasedonunadjusted\nquoted prices in active markets and are classified as Level 1.

The investment strategy for the trust funds is to use a diversified portfolio of\ninvestments to achieve an acceptable rate of return while managing the investment risk of the assets relative to the associated\nliabilities. To minimize investment risk, the trust funds are broadly diversified among classes of assets, investment strategies\nand investment managers. Management regularly reviews the actual asset allocations and periodically rebalances the\ninvestments to targeted allocations when appropriate.

TheKPSC’sshowcause\norder did not make any determination regarding the adequacy of KPCo’s service. In July 2023, KPCo filed a response to the\nshow cause order demonstrating that it has provided adequate service. In December 2023 and February 2024, KPCo and\ncertain intervenors filed testimony with the KPSC. In February 2024, KPCo filed a motion to strike and exclude intervenor\ntestimony in its entirety on the grounds that issues raised are outside the scope of the proceeding and because the testimony is\nlargely unreasoned, unsupported, and provides no evidentiary value. A hearing is expected in 2024. If any fines or penalties\nare levied against KPCo relating to the show cause order, it could reduce net income and cash flows and impact financial\ncondition.\n2023KentuckyBaseRateandSecuritizationCase\nIn June 2023, KPCo filed a request with the KPSC for a $94 million net annual increase in base rates based upon a proposed\n9.9% ROE with the increase to be implemented no earlier than January 2024. The filing proposes no changes in depreciation\nrates and an annual level of storm restoration expense in base rates of approximately $1 million. KPCo also proposed to\ndiscontinue tracking of PJM transmission costs through a rider, and to instead collect an annual level of costs through base\nrates. In addition, KPCo has proposed a rider to recover certain distribution reliability investments and related incremental\noperation and maintenance expenses. KPCo also requested a prudency determination and recovery mechanism for\napproximately$16millionofpurchasedpowercostsnotrecoverablethroughitsFACsinceitslastbasecase.

AsofDecember31,\n2023, the net book value of KPCo’s share of the Mitchell Plant, before cost of removal including CWIP and inventory, was\n$553 million. If any of these costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial\ncondition.\nIn conjunction with its June 2023 filing, KPCo further requested to finance, through the issuance of securitization bonds,\napproximately$471millionofregulatoryassetsrecordedasofJune2023including:(a)$289millionofplantretirementcosts,\n(b) $79 million of deferred storm costs related to 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 major storms, (c) $52 million of deferred\npurchased power expenses and (d) $51 million of under-recovered purchased power rider costs.

The\nKPSC’s financing order includes certain additional requirements related to securitization bond structuring, marketing,\nplacement, and issuance that were not reflected in KPCo’s proposal. As a result, in January 2024, KPCo filed a request for\nrehearing with the KPSC to clarify certain aspects of these additional requirements.

The Rockport Offset true-up is\nnot yet reflected in revenue, as KPCo has not met the requirements of alternative revenue recognition in accordance with the\naccounting guidance for “Regulated Operations”. In February 2024, the KPSC issued an order allowing KPCo to collect the\nremaining $18 million through interim rates, subject to refund, over twelve months starting in March 2024.

The\nRegistrantsalsomaintainpropertyandcasualtyinsurancethatmaycovercertainphysicaldamageorthird-partyinjuriescaused\nby cybersecurity incidents. Insurance coverage includes all risks of physical loss or damage to nonnuclear assets, subject to\ninsurance policy conditions and exclusions. Covered property generally includes power plants, substations, facilities and\ninventories. Excluded property generally includes transmission and distribution lines, poles and towers. The insurance\nprograms also generally provide coverage against loss arising from certain claims made by third-parties and are in excess of\nretentions absorbed by the Registrants. Coverage is generally provided by a combination of the protected cell of EIS and/or\nvarious industry mutual and/or commercial insurance carriers.

The fair values of derivative instruments accounted for using MTM\naccountingorhedgeaccountingarebasedonexchangepricesandbrokerquotes. Ifaquotedmarketpriceisnotavailable,the\nestimate of fair value is based on the best information available including valuation models that estimate future energy prices\nbased on existing market and broker quotes and other assumptions. In order to determine the relevant fair values of the\nderivativeinstruments,theRegistrantsapplyvaluationadjustmentsfordiscounting,liquidityandcreditquality.\nCredit risk is the risk that a counterparty will fail to perform on the contract or fail to pay amounts due. Liquidity risk\nrepresentstheriskthatimperfectionsinthemarketwillcausethepricetovaryfromestimatedfairvaluebaseduponprevailing\nmarket supply and demand conditions. Since energy markets are imperfect and volatile, there are inherent risks related to the\nunderlyingassumptionsinmodelsusedtofairvalueriskmanagementcontracts. Unforeseeneventsmaycausereasonableprice\ncurves to differ from actual price curves throughout a contract’s term and at the time a contract settles. Consequently, there\ncould be significant adverse or favorable effects on future net income and cash flows if market prices are not consistent with\nmanagement’s estimates of current market consensus for forward prices in the current period. This is particularly true for\nlonger term contracts. Cash flows may vary based on market conditions, margin requirements and the timing of settlement of\nriskmanagementcontracts.\nAccording to the accounting guidance for “Derivatives and Hedging,” the Registrants reflect the fair values of derivative\ninstruments subject to netting agreements with the same counterparty net of related cash collateral. For certain risk\nmanagement contracts, the Registrants are required to post or receive cash collateral based on third-party contractual\nagreements and risk profiles. AEP netted cash collateral received from third-parties against short-term and long-term risk\nmanagementassetsintheamountsof$46millionand$481millionasofDecember31,2023and2022,respectively.

Management uses credit agency ratings and current market-based qualitative and quantitative data as well as financial\nstatementstoassessthefinancialhealthofcounterpartiesonanongoingbasis.\nMaster agreements are typically used to facilitate the netting of cash flows associated with a single counterparty and may\ninclude collateral requirements. Collateral requirements in the form of cash, letters of credit and parental/affiliate guarantees\nmay be obtained as security from counterparties in order to mitigate credit risk. Some master agreements include margining,\nwhich requires a counterparty to post cash or letters of credit in the event exposure exceeds the established threshold. The\nthreshold represents an unsecured credit limit which may be supported by a parental/affiliate guaranty, as determined in\naccordance with AEP’s credit policy. In addition, master agreements allow for termination and liquidation of all positions in\ntheeventofadefaultincludingafailureorinabilitytopostcollateralwhenrequired.\n144\nCredit-Risk-RelatedContingentFeatures\nCreditDowngradeTriggers(AppliestoAEP,APCo,I&M,PSOandSWEPCo)\nA limited number of derivative contracts include collateral triggering events, which include a requirement to maintain certain\ncredit ratings.

These cross-default provisions\ncould be triggered if there was a non-performance event by Parent or the obligor under outstanding debt or a third-party\nobligation that is $50 million or greater.

The\ncreditors of Sabine have no recourse to any AEP entity other than SWEPCo. Under the provisions of the mining agreement,\nSWEPCo is required to pay, as a part of the cost of lignite delivered, an amount equal to mining costs plus a management\nfee. In addition, SWEPCo determines how much coal will be mined each year. Based on these facts, management concluded\nthat SWEPCo is the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate Sabine. SWEPCo’s total billings from Sabine for the\nyearsendedDecember31,2023,2022and2021were$101million,$168millionand$162million,respectively. AsofMarch\n31, 2023, SWEPCo fuel deliveries, including billings of all fixed costs, from Sabine ceased, which resulted in a decrease in\nbillings in 2023 as compared to 2022.

AEP subsidiaries elected to apply the invoice practical\nexpedient to recognize revenue for performance obligations satisfied over time as the invoices from the respective revenue\nstreams are representative of services or goods provided to date to the customer. Performance obligations for AEP’s\nsubsidiariesaresummarizedasfollows:\nRetailRevenues\nAEP’s subsidiaries within the Vertically Integrated Utilities and Transmission and Distribution Utilities segments have\nperformance obligations to generate, transmit and distribute electricity for sale to rate-regulated retail customers.

The FERC-approved\nrates establish the annual transmission revenue requirement (ATRR) and transmission service rates for transmission owners.\nThe formula rates establish rates for a one year period and also include a true-up calculation for the prior year’s billings,\nallowing for over/under-recovery of the transmission owner’s ATRR. The annual true-ups meet the definition of alternative\nrevenues in accordance with the accounting guidance for “Regulated Operations,” and are therefore presented as such in the\ndisaggregated revenues tables above. AEP subsidiaries within the ERCOT region collect revenues through a combination of\nbaseratesandinterimTransmissionCostsofServicesfilingsthatareapprovedbythePUCT.\nThe AEP East Companies are parties to the TA, which defines how transmission costs are allocated among the AEP East\nCompanies on a 12-month average coincident peak basis.

AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nAEP Consolidated Earnings Attributable to Common Shareholders\nSecond Quarter of 2024 Compared to Second Quarter of 2023\nEarnings Attributable to AEP Common Shareholders decreased from $521 million in 2023 to $340 million in 2024 primarily\ndue to:\n• A revenue refund provision related to SWEPCo’s 2012 Texas Base Rate Case and the Turk Plant.\n• An increase in operating expenses due to the Federal EPA’s revised CCR rule finalized in May 2024.\n• A severance accrual resulting from the voluntary severance program announced in April 2024.\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\n• Favorable rate proceedings in AEP’s various jurisdictions.\n• An increase in sales volumes driven by favorable weather and increased load in the commercial customer class.\n• Investment in transmission assets, which resulted in higher revenues and income.\nSix Months Ended June 30, 2024 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2023\nEarnings Attributable to AEP Common Shareholders increased from $918 million in 2023 to $1,343 million in 2024\nprimarily due to:\n• A favorable impact from the receipt of PLRs in 2024 related to the treatment of NOLCs in retail rate making. See\n“NOLCs in Retail Jurisdictions - IRS PLRs” section below for additional information.\n• Favorable rate proceedings in AEP’s various jurisdictions.\n• An increase in sales volumes driven by favorable weather and increased load in the commercial customer class.\n• Investment in transmission assets, which resulted in higher revenues and income.\n• A loss on the sale of the competitive contracted renewables portfolio in 2023.\nThese increases were partially offset by:\n• A revenue refund provision related to SWEPCo’s 2012 Texas Base Rate Case and the Turk Plant.\n• An increase in operating expenses due to the Federal EPA’s revised CCR rule finalized in May 2024.\n• A severance accrual resulting from the voluntary severance program announced in April 2024.\nSee “Results of Operations” section for additional information by operating segment.\nCustomer Demand\nAEP’s weather-normalized retail sales volumes for the second quarter of 2024 increased by 4.0% from the second quarter\nof 2023. Weather-normalized residential sales decreased by 0.9% in the second quarter of 2024 from the second quarter of\n2023. Weather-normalized commercial sales increased by 12.4% in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the second\nquarter of 2023. The increase in commercial sales was primarily due to new data processor loads and economic\ndevelopment. AEP’s second quarter 2024 industrial sales volumes increased by 1.1% from the second quarter of 2023.\nAEP’s weather-normalized retail sales volumes for the six months ended June 30, 2024 increased by 3.4% compared to the\nsix months ended June 30, 2023. Weather-normalized residential sales decreased by 0.8% for the six months ended\nJune 30, 2024 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023. Weather-normalized commercial sales increased by 11.5%\nfor the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in commercial sales\nwas primarily due to new data processor loads and economic development. AEP’s industrial sales volumes increased by\n0.7% for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023.\n1\nSupply Chain Disruption and Inflation\nThe Registrants have experienced certain supply chain disruptions driven by several factors including international tensions\nand the ramifications of regional conflict, inflation, labor shortages in certain trades and shortages in the availability of\ncertain raw materials. These supply chain disruptions have not had a material impact on the Registrants’ net income, cash\nflows and financial condition, but have extended lead times for certain goods and services and have contributed to higher\nprices for fuel, materials, labor, equipment and other needed commodities. Management has implemented risk mitigation\nstrategies in an attempt to mitigate the impacts of these supply chain disruptions.\nThe United States economy has experienced a significant level of inflation that has contributed to increased uncertainty in\nthe outlook of near-term economic activity, including whether the pace of inflation will continue to moderate. A prolonged\ncontinuation or a further increase in the severity of supply chain and inflationary disruptions could result in additional\nincreases in the cost of certain goods, services and cost of capital and further extend lead times which could reduce future\nnet income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\n2024 SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS\nCCR Rule Revisions\nIn April 2024, the Federal EPA finalized revisions to the CCR Rule to expand the scope of the rule to include inactive\nimpoundments at inactive facilities as well as to establish requirements for currently exempt solid waste management units\nthat involve the direct placement of CCR on the land. In the second quarter of 2024, AEP evaluated the applicability of the\nrule to current and former plant sites and recorded a $674 million increase in ARO. See “CCR Rule” section in\nEnvironmental Issues below for additional information.\nVoluntary Severance Program\nIn April 2024, management announced a voluntary severance program designed to achieve a reduction in the size of AEP’s\nworkforce and help offset increasing operating expenses due to inflation and high interest costs in order to keep electricity\ncosts affordable for customers. Approximately 7,400 of AEP’s 16,800 employees were eligible to participate in the\nprogram. Approximately 1,000 employees have chosen to take the voluntary severance package and substantially all will\nterminate employment in July 2024. The severance program provides two weeks of base pay for every year of service with\na minimum of four weeks and a maximum of 52 weeks of base pay. AEP recorded a $122 million pretax expense in the\nsecond quarter of 2024 related to this voluntary severance program.

The registrants completed the transition in Tennessee, West Virginia and Virginia prior to 2024 and in Michigan in\nJuly 2024. In the most recent KPCo, I&M (Indiana jurisdiction), PSO and SWEPCo base rate cases, the companies filed to\ntransition to stand-alone rate making which was contingent upon a supportive PLR from the IRS.\nIn April 2024, supportive PLRs for certain retail jurisdictions were received from the IRS, effective March 2024. The PLRs\nconcluded NOLCs on a stand-alone rate making basis should be included in rate base and should also be included in the\ncomputation of Excess ADIT regulatory liabilities to be refunded to customers. Based on this conclusion, I&M, PSO and\nSWEPCo recognized regulatory assets related to revenue requirement amounts to be collected from customers, reduced\nExcess ADIT regulatory liabilities and recorded favorable impacts to net income in the first quarter of 2024 as shown in the\ntable below:\n2\nIncrease in Pretax Income\nfrom the Recognition of Reduction in Income Increase in Net\nCompany Regulatory Assets Tax Expense (a) Income\n(in millions)\nI&M $ 20.2 $ 49.5 $ 69.7\nPSO 12.1 44.7 56.8\nSWEPCo 35.4 101.1 136.5\nAEP Total $ 67.7 $ 195.3 $ 263.0\n(a) Primarily relates to a $224 million remeasurement of Excess ADIT Regulatory Liabilities partially\noffset by $29 million of tax expense on favorable pretax income from the recognition of regulatory\nassets.\nIn the second quarter of 2024, requests seeking to establish a recovery mechanism for these regulatory assets were filed in\nIndiana, Oklahoma and Texas.\nPlanned Sale of AEP Energy and AEP OnSite Partners\nAEP management has continued a strategic evaluation of AEP’s portfolio of businesses with a focus on core regulated utility\noperations, risk mitigation and simplification. As a result of these efforts, the following decisions have recently been made\nwith respect to AEP Energy and AEP OnSite Partners.\nAEP Energy\nIn October 2022, AEP initiated a strategic evaluation for its ownership in AEP Energy, a wholly-owned retail energy\nsupplier that offers electricity and natural gas on a price risk managed basis to residential, commercial and industrial\ncustomers. AEP Energy provides various energy solutions in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio\nand Washington, D.C. AEP Energy had approximately 1,004,000 customer accounts as of June 30, 2024. In April 2023,\nAEP management completed the strategic evaluation of AEP Energy and initiated a sale process. In May 2024,\nmanagement announced AEP will retain AEP Energy.\nAEP OnSite Partners\nIn April 2023, AEP initiated a sales process for its ownership in AEP OnSite Partners. AEP OnSite Partners targets\nopportunities in distributed solar, combined heat and power, energy storage, waste heat recovery, energy efficiency, peaking\ngeneration and other energy solutions. As of June 30, 2024, AEP OnSite Partners owned projects located in 21 states,\nincluding approximately 103 MWs of installed solar capacity and two solar projects under construction totaling\napproximately 8 MWs. As of June 30, 2024, the net book value of the assets and liabilities of AEP OnSite Partners was\n$341 million.\nIn May 2024, AEP signed an agreement to sell AEP OnSite Partners to a nonaffiliated third party. AEP has received\nclearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. The sale remains subject to FERC approval\nunder Section 203 of the Federal Power Act and is expected to close in the third quarter of 2024. AEP expects to receive\ncash proceeds of approximately $315 million, net of taxes and transaction costs. See the “Planned Disposition of AEP\nOnSite Partners” section of Note 6 for additional information.\nFederal Tax Legislation\nIn August 2022, President Biden signed H.R. 5376 into law, commonly known as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or\nIRA. Most notably this budget reconciliation legislation created a 15% minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income\n(CAMT), extended and increased the value of PTCs and ITCs, added a nuclear and clean hydrogen PTC, an energy storage\nITC and allowed the sale or transfer of tax credits to third-parties for cash. As further significant guidance from Treasury\nand the IRS is expected on the tax provisions in the IRA, AEP will continue to monitor any issued guidance and evaluate the\nimpact on future net income, cash flows and financial condition.\nAEP and subsidiaries are applicable corporations for purposes of the CAMT in 2024. CAMT cash taxes are expected to be\npartially offset by regulatory recovery, the utilization of tax credits and additionally the cash inflow generated by the sale of\ntax credits. The sale of tax credits are presented in the operating section of the statements of cash flows consistent with the\npresentation of cash taxes paid. AEP presents the loss on sale of tax credits through income tax expense.\n3\nIn April 2024, the IRS issued final regulations related to the transfer of tax credits. In 2023, AEP, on behalf of PSO,\nSWEPCo and AEP Energy Supply, LLC, entered into transferability agreements with nonaffiliated parties to sell 2023\ngenerated PTCs resulting in cash proceeds of approximately $174 million with $102 million received in 2023, $62 million\nreceived in the first quarter of 2024 and the remaining $10 million was received in the second quarter of 2024. In July 2024,\nAEP, on behalf of PSO and SWEPCo, entered into another transferability agreement with a nonaffiliated party to sell 2024\ngenerated PTCs which will result in approximately $100 million of cash proceeds, of which approximately $90 million is\nexpected by the end of 2024 and the remainder in 2025. AEP expects to continue to explore the ability to efficiently\nmonetize its tax credits through third-party transferability agreements.\nI&M’s Cook Plant qualifies for the transferable Nuclear PTC, which is available for tax years beginning in 2024 through\n2032. The Nuclear PTC is calculated based on electricity generated and sold to third-parties and is subject to a “reduction\namount” as the facility’s gross receipts increase above a certain threshold. Due to lack of guidance and uncertainty\nsurrounding the computation of gross receipts, AEP and I&M are unable to estimate the amount of the Nuclear PTCs earned\nas of June 30, 2024 and have not included any Nuclear PTCs in the annualized effective tax rate for the second quarter of\n2024. See Note 11 - Income Taxes for additional information.\nNew Generation to Support Reliability\nThe growth of AEP’s regulated generation portfolio reflects the company’s commitment to meet customer’s energy and\ncapacity needs while balancing cost and reliability.\nSignificant Approved Generation Filings\nAEP has received regulatory approvals from various state regulatory commissions to acquire approximately 2,811 MWs of\nowned renewable generation facilities, totaling approximately $6.6 billion. The estimated cost of these facilities are\nincluded in the Budgeted Capital Expenditures disclosure included in the Financial Condition section below. In addition,\nAEP has also received regulatory approvals for 612 MWs of renewable purchase power agreements. The following table\nsummarizes regulatory approvals received for renewable projects as of June 30, 2024:\nGeneration Generating\nCompany Type Expected Commercial Operation Owned/PPA Capacity\n(in MWs)\nAPCo Solar 2024-2026 PPA 439\nAPCo Wind 2025-2026 Owned 347\nI&M Solar 2026 PPA 100\nI&M Solar 2027 Owned 469\nPSO (a) Solar 2025-2026 Owned 443\nPSO (a) Wind 2025-2026 Owned 553\nSWEPCo (b) Solar 2025-2027 Owned/PPA 273\nSWEPCo (b)(c) Wind 2024-2025 Owned 799\nTotal Approved Renewable Projects 3,423\n(a) PSO issued notices to proceed for the construction of three wind facilities and one solar facility for a combined total\ncapacity of 477 MWs. These facilities reflect the first of the approved projects contemplated within PSO’s 996 MWs of\ntotal new renewable generation.\n(b) Includes approvals by the APSC and LPSC for 999 MWs of owned projects. Additionally, the LPSC approved the flex-\nup option, allowing SWEPCo to provide additional service to Louisiana customers and recover the portion of the projects\ndenied by the PUCT.\n(c) SWEPCo issued notice to proceed for the construction of all 799 MWs of wind capacity.\nIn June 2024, PSO entered into a PSA to acquire a 795 MW combined-cycle power generation facility located in Oklahoma.\nThe acquisition is subject to OCC pre-approval including the approval of a rider to allow asset recovery prior to the\ninclusion in base rates in a future rate case. The acquisition also requires FERC approval and clearance under the Hart-\nScott-Rodino Act. Subject to these approvals, PSO expects to close on the transaction by June 30, 2025.\n4\nIn addition to the generation projects discussed above, AEP enters into Capacity Purchase Agreements (CPA) to satisfy\noperating companies capacity reserve margins to serve customers. The following table includes CPA amounts currently\nunder contract, by year:\nI&M KPCo PSO SWEPCo WPCo\nNatural Natural Natural Natural\nCoal Gas Coal Gas Gas Wind Gas Wind Coal\nDelivery\nStart Year (in MWs)\n2024 230 314 74 80 1,114 29 425 57 72\n2025 — 440 — 85 1,150 29 350 135 —\n2026 — — — — 980 86 200 78 —\n2027 — 210 — — 260 86 — 78 —\n2028 — 210 — — 260 — — — —\nAfter 2028 — 1,050 — — 780 — — — —\nSignificant Generation Requests for Proposal (RFP)\nThe table below includes RFPs recently issued for both owned and purchased power generation.

Depending on the\noutcomes, these rate cases and proceedings can have a material impact on results of operations, cash flows and possibly\nfinancial condition. AEP is currently involved in the following key proceedings.\nThe following tables show the Registrants’ completed and pending base rate case proceedings in 2024. See Note 4 - Rate\nMatters for additional information.\n5\nCompleted Base Rate Case Proceedings\nAnnual\nBase Revenue Approved New Rates\nCompany Jurisdiction Increase ROE Effective\n(in millions)\nPSO Oklahoma $ 131.0 (a) 9.3% January 2024\nAPCo Virginia 127.0 (b) 9.5% January 2024\nKPCo Kentucky 60.0 (c) 9.75% January 2024\nI&M Indiana 62.0 (d) 9.85% May 2024\nI&M Michigan 17.0 9.86% July 2024\n(a) See “2022 Oklahoma Base Rate Case” section of Note 4 in the 2023 Annual Report for additional\ninformation.\n(b) See “2020-2022 Virginia Triennial Review” section of Note 4 in the 2023 Annual Report for\nadditional information.\n(c) See “2023 Kentucky Base Rate and Securitization Case” section of Note 4 in the 2023 Annual\nReport for additional information.\n(d) A phased-in increase in Indiana rates with a $28 million annual increase effective May 2024 with the\nremaining $34 million annual increase effective in January 2025 subject to I&M’s level of electric\nplant in service as of December 31, 2024 in comparison to I&M’s 2024 forecasted test year.\nPending Base Rate Case Proceedings\nAnnual\nFiling Base Revenue Requested\nCompany Jurisdiction Date Increase Request ROE\n(in millions)\nPSO Oklahoma January 2024 $ 218.0 10.8%\nAEP Texas Texas February 2024 164.0 10.6%\nAPCo Virginia March 2024 78.0 (a) 10.8%\n(a) In June 2024, APCo submitted an amendment to its Virginia base case reducing the originally\nrequested annual base rate increase from $95 million to $78 million.\nOther Significant Regulatory Matters\nOhio ESP Filings\nIn January 2023, OPCo filed an application with the PUCO to approve an ESP that included proposed rate adjustments,\nproposed new riders and the continuation and modification of certain existing riders, including the DIR, effective June 2024\nthrough May 2030. The proposal includes a return on common equity of 10.65% on capital costs for certain riders. In June\n2023, intervenors filed testimony opposing OPCo’s plan for various new riders and modifications to existing riders,\nincluding the DIR. In September 2023, OPCo and certain intervenors filed a settlement agreement with the PUCO\naddressing the ESP application. The settlement included a four year term from June 2024 through May 2028, an ROE of\n9.7% and continuation of a number of riders including the DIR subject to revenue caps. In April 2024, the PUCO issued an\norder approving the settlement agreement. In May 2024, intervenors filed an application for rehearing with the PUCO on\nthe approved settlement agreement and in response OPCo filed an opposition to rehearing. In June 2024, the PUCO denied\nthe intervenors’ application for rehearing.\n6\nSWEPCo 2012 Texas Base Rate Case\nIn 2012, SWEPCo filed a request with the PUCT to increase annual base rates primarily due to the completion of the Turk\nPlant. In 2013, the PUCT issued an order affirming the prudence of the Turk Plant but determined that the Turk Plant’s\nTexas jurisdictional capital cost cap established in a previous Certificate of Convenience and Necessity case also limited\nSWEPCo’s recovery of AFUDC in addition to limits on its recovery of cash construction costs. Upon rehearing in 2014, the\nPUCT reversed its initial ruling and determined that AFUDC was excluded from the Turk Plant’s Texas jurisdictional\ncapital cost cap. In 2017, the Texas District Court upheld the PUCT’s 2014 order and intervenors filed appeals with the\nTexas Third Court of Appeals. In August 2021, the Texas Third Court of Appeals reversed the Texas District Court\njudgment affirming the PUCT’s order on AFUDC, concluding that the language of the PUCT’s original 2008 order intended\nto include AFUDC in the Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap, and remanded the case to the PUCT for future proceedings.\nIn November 2021, SWEPCo and the PUCT submitted Petitions for Review with the Texas Supreme Court. In October\n2022, the Texas Supreme Court denied the Petitions for Review submitted by SWEPCo and the PUCT. In December 2022,\nSWEPCo and the PUCT filed requests for rehearing with the Texas Supreme Court. In June 2023, the Texas Supreme Court\ndenied SWEPCo’s request for rehearing and the case was remanded to the PUCT for future proceedings. In October 2023,\nSWEPCo filed testimony with the PUCT in the remanded proceeding recommending no refund or disallowance.\nOn December 14, 2023, the PUCT approved a preliminary order stating the PUCT will not address SWEPCo’s request that\nwould allow the PUCT to find cause to allow SWEPCo to exceed the Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap in the current\nremand proceeding. As a result of the PUCT’s approval of the preliminary order, SWEPCo believes it is probable the PUCT\nwill disallow capitalized AFUDC in excess of the Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap and recorded a pretax, non-cash\ndisallowance of $86 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Such determination may reduce SWEPCo’s future revenues by\napproximately $15 million on an annual basis. On December 21, 2023, SWEPCo filed a motion with the PUCT for\nreconsideration of the preliminary order. In January 2024, the PUCT denied the motion for reconsideration of the\npreliminary order.\nThe PUCT’s December 2023 approval of the preliminary order determined that it will address, in the ongoing PUCT remand\nproceeding, any potential revenue refunds to customers that may be required by future PUCT orders. In January 2024, the\nPUCT established a procedural schedule for the remand proceeding. On March 1, 2024, SWEPCo filed supplemental direct\ntestimony with the PUCT in response to the December 2023 preliminary order. On March 8, 2024, intervenors and the\nPUCT staff filed a motion with the PUCT to strike portions of SWEPCo’s October 2023 direct testimony and March 2024\nsupplemental direct testimony. On March 19, 2024, the ALJ granted portions of the motion which included removal of\ntestimony supporting SWEPCo’s position that refunds are not appropriate. On March 28, 2024, SWEPCo filed an appeal of\nthe ALJ decision with the PUCT. In April 2024, intervenors and PUCT staff submitted testimony recommending customer\nrefunds through December 2023 ranging from $149 million to $197 million, including carrying charges, with refund periods\nranging from 18 months to 48 months. In May 2024, the PUCT denied SWEPCo’s appeal of the ALJ’s March 2024\ndecision. In the second quarter of 2024, based on the PUCT’s decision, SWEPCo recorded a one-time, probable revenue\nrefund provision of $160 million, including interest, associated with revenue collected from February 2013 through\nDecember 2023. The $160 million revenue refund provision represents management’s best estimate based on the range of\nprobable refunds between $104 million and $197 million, including interest. In June 2024, SWEPCo and parties to the\nremand proceeding reached an agreement in principle that would resolve all issues in the case. The settlement is expected to\nbe filed and considered by the PUCT in the third quarter of 2024.\nFERC 2021 PJM and SPP Transmission Formula Rate Challenge\nThe Registrants transitioned to stand-alone treatment of NOLCs in its PJM and SPP transmission formula rates beginning\nwith the 2022 projected transmission revenue requirements and 2021 true-up to actual transmission revenue requirements,\nand provided notice of this change in informational filings made with the FERC. Stand-alone treatment of the NOLCs for\ntransmission formula rates increased the annual revenue requirements for years 2024, 2023, 2022 and 2021 by $52 million,\n$60 million, $69 million and $78 million, respectively.\nIn January 2024, the FERC issued two orders granting formal challenges by certain unaffiliated customers related to stand-\nalone treatment of NOLCs in the 2021 Transmission Formula Rates of the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within\nPJM and SPP. The FERC directed the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within PJM and SPP to provide refunds with\ninterest on all amounts collected for the 2021 rate year, and for such refunds to be reflected in the annual update for the next\nrate year. In February 2024, AEPSC on behalf of the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within PJM and SPP filed\nrequests for rehearing. In March 2024, the FERC denied AEPSC’s requests for rehearing of the January 2024 orders by\noperation of law and stated it may address the requests for rehearing in future orders. In March 2024, AEPSC submitted\nrefund compliance reports to the FERC, which preserve the non-finality of the FERC’s January 2024 orders pending further\nproceedings on rehearing and appeal. In April 2024, AEPSC made filings with the FERC which request that the FERC: (a)\nreopen the record so that the FERC may take the IRS PLRs received in April 2024 regarding the treatment of stand-alone\n7\nNOLCs in ratemaking into evidence and consider them in substantive orders on rehearing and (b) stay its January 2024\norders and related compliance filings and refunds to provide time for consideration of the April 2024 IRS PLRs. In May\n2024, AEPSC filed a petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit\nseeking review of the FERC’s January 2024 and March 2024 decisions. In July 2024, the FERC issued orders approving\nAEPSC’s request to reopen the record for the limited purpose of accepting into the record the IRS PLRs and establish\nadditional briefing procedures. AEPSC is required to file briefs with the FERC in the third quarter of 2024.\nAs a result of the January 2024 FERC orders, the Registrants’ balance sheets reflect a liability for the probable refund of all\nNOLC revenues included in transmission formula rates for years 2024, 2023, 2022 and 2021, with interest. The Registrants\nhave not yet been directed to make cash refunds related to the 2024, 2023 or 2022 rate years. The probable refunds to\naffiliated and nonaffiliated customers are reflected as Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities on the balance\nsheets, with the exception of amounts expected to be refunded within one year which are reflected in Other Current\nLiabilities. Refunds probable to be received by affiliated companies, resulting in a reduction to affiliated transmission\nexpense, were deferred as an increase to Regulatory Liabilities or a reduction to Regulatory Assets on the balance sheets\nwhere management expects that refunds would be returned to retail customers through authorized retail jurisdiction rider\nmechanisms.\nMerchant Portion of Turk Plant\nSWEPCo constructed the Turk Plant, a base load 600 MW (650 MW net maximum capacity) pulverized coal ultra-\nsupercritical generating unit in Arkansas, which was placed in-service in December 2012 and is included in the Vertically\nIntegrated Utilities segment. SWEPCo owns 73% (440 MWs/477 MWs) of the Turk Plant and operates the facility. As of\nJune 30, 2024, the net book value of the Turk Plant was $1.3 billion, before cost of removal including CWIP and inventory.\nApproximately 20% of SWEPCo’s portion of the Turk Plant output is currently not subject to cost-based rate recovery in\nArkansas. This portion of the plant’s output is being sold into the wholesale market. Approximately 80% of the Turk Plant\ninvestment is recovered under retail cost-based rate recovery in Texas, Louisiana and through SWEPCo’s wholesale\ncustomers under FERC-approved rates. In November 2022, SWEPCo filed a Certificate of Public Convenience and\nNecessity with the APSC for approval to operate the Turk Plant to serve Arkansas customers and recover the associated\ncosts through a cost recovery rider. Cost-based recovery of the Turk Plant would aid SWEPCo’s near-term capacity needs\nand support compliance with SPP’s 2023 increased capacity planning reserve margin requirements. In April 2023,\nintervenors filed testimony recommending the APSC deny the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity on the basis\nthat the Turk Plant is not the least cost alternative. In March 2024, the APSC issued an order denying SWEPCo’s request to\nallow the merchant portion of the Turk Plant to serve Arkansas customers. As a result of the APSC’s March 2024 order,\nSWEPCo recorded a $32 million favorable impact to net income as a result of the reduction to the regulatory liability related\nto the merchant portion of Turk Plant Excess ADIT.\nKentucky Securitization Case\nIn January 2024, the KPSC issued a financing order approving KPCo’s request to securitize certain regulatory assets\nbalances as of the time securitization bonds are issued and concluding that costs requested for recovery through\nsecuritization were prudently incurred. The KPSC’s financing order includes certain additional requirements related to\nsecuritization bond structuring, marketing, placement and issuance that were not reflected in KPCo’s proposal. In\naccordance with Kentucky statutory requirements and the financing order, the issuance of the securitized bonds is subject to\nfinal review by the KPSC after bond pricing. KPCo expects to proceed with the securitized bond issuance process and to\ncomplete the securitization process in the second half of 2024, subject to market conditions. As of June 30, 2024, regulatory\nasset balances expected to be recovered through securitization total $481 million and include: (a) $293 million of plant\nretirement costs, (b) $79 million of deferred storm costs related to 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 major storms, (c) $48 million\nof deferred purchased power expenses, (d) $60 million of under-recovered purchased power rider costs and (e) $1 million of\ndeferred issuance-related expenses including KPSC advisor expenses. If any of these costs are not recoverable, it could\nreduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nInvestigation of the Service, Rates and Facilities of KPCo\nIn June 2023, the KPSC issued an order directing KPCo to show cause why it should not be subject to Kentucky statutory\nremedies, including fines and penalties, for failure to provide adequate service in its service territory. The KPSC’s show\ncause order did not make any determination regarding the adequacy of KPCo’s service. In July 2023, KPCo filed a response\nto the show cause order demonstrating that it has provided adequate service. In December 2023 and February 2024, KPCo\nand certain intervenors filed testimony with the KPSC. In February 2024, KPCo filed a motion to strike and exclude\nintervenor testimony. In March 2024, the KPSC denied KPCo’s February 2024 motion. The June 2024 hearing with the\n8\nKPSC was postponed and has not yet been rescheduled. If any fines or penalties are levied against KPCo relating to the\nshow cause order, it could reduce net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nKPCo Fuel Adjustment Clause (FAC) Review\nIn December 2023, KPCo received intervenor testimony in its FAC review for the two-year period ending October 31, 2022,\nrecommending a disallowance ranging from $44 million to $60 million of its total $432 million purchased power cost\nrecoveries as a result of proposed modifications to the ratemaking methodology that limits purchased power costs\nrecoverable through the FAC. A hearing was held in February 2024 and an order is expected in the second half of 2024. If\nany fuel costs are not recoverable or refunds are ordered, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact\nfinancial condition.\nVirginia Fuel Adjustment Clause (FAC) Review\nIn 2023, APCo submitted their annual fuel cost filing with the Virginia SCC. Interim Virginia FAC rates were\nimplemented in November 2023. In APCo's 2022 Virginia fuel update filing, the Virginia staff ordered the Virginia\nStaff to commence an audit of APCo’s fuel costs for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022. The\nVirginia staff analyzed APCo’s 2019 through 2022 fuel procurement activities and concluded the procurement practices\nwere reasonable and prudent and recommended no disallowances. In May 2024, the Virginia SCC issued an order\napproving the audit of APCo’s 2019 and 2020 fuel costs but concluded that the review of APCo fuel costs for 2021 and\n2022 remains open for further evaluation. As of June 30, 2024, APCo had a Virginia jurisdictional under-recovered fuel\nbalance of $190 million. If any fuel costs are not recoverable or refunds are ordered, it could reduce future net income\nand cash flows and impact financial condition\nOhio House Bill 6 (HB 6)\nIn July 2019, HB 6, which offered incentives for power-generating facilities with zero or reduced carbon emissions, was\nsigned into law by the Ohio Governor. HB 6 terminated energy efficiency programs as of December 31, 2020, including\nOPCo’s shared savings revenues of $26 million annually and phased out renewable mandates after 2026. HB 6 also\nprovided for continued recovery of existing renewable energy contracts on a bypassable basis through 2032 and included a\nprovision for continued recovery of OVEC costs through 2030 which is allocated to all electric distribution utility customers\nin Ohio on a non-bypassable basis. OPCo’s Inter-Company Power Agreement for OVEC terminates in June 2040. In July\n2020, an investigation led by the U.S. Attorney’s Office resulted in a federal grand jury indictment of the Speaker of the\nOhio House of Representatives, Larry Householder, four other individuals, and Generation Now, an entity registered as a\n501(c)(4) social welfare organization, in connection with an alleged racketeering conspiracy involving the adoption of HB 6.\nCertain defendants in that case had previously plead guilty and, in March 2023, a federal jury convicted Larry Householder\nand another individual of participating in the racketeering conspiracy. In February 2024, an Ohio grand jury indictment\ncharged certain former FirstEnergy executives and the former PUCO Chairman and related entities with various crimes,\nincluding bribery. In 2021, four AEP shareholders filed derivative actions purporting to assert claims on behalf of AEP\nagainst certain AEP officers and directors. In April 2024, AEP reached an agreement with the four shareholders to fully and\nfinally resolve the derivative actions. See “Litigation Related to Ohio House Bill 6” section of Litigation below for\nadditional information.\nIn March 2021, the Governor of Ohio signed legislation that, among other things, repealed the payments to the nonaffiliated\nowner of Ohio’s nuclear power plants that were previously authorized under HB 6. The new legislation, House Bill 128,\nwent into effect in May 2021 and leaves unchanged other provisions of HB 6 regarding energy efficiency programs,\nrecovery of renewable energy costs and recovery of OVEC costs. To the extent that the law changes or OPCo: (a) is unable\nto recover the costs of renewable energy contracts on a bypassable basis by the end of 2032, (b) is unable to recover costs of\nOVEC after 2030 or (c) incurs significant costs associated with the derivative actions, it could reduce future net income and\ncash flows and impact financial condition.\n9\nLITIGATION\nIn the ordinary course of business, AEP is involved in employment, commercial, environmental and regulatory litigation. Since\nit is difficult to predict the outcome of these proceedings, management cannot predict the eventual resolution, timing or amount\nof any loss, fine or penalty. Management assesses the probability of loss for each contingency and accrues a liability for cases\nthat have a probable likelihood of loss if the loss can be estimated. Adverse results in these proceedings have the potential to\nreduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. See Note 4 – Rate Matters and Note 5 –\nCommitments, Guarantees and Contingencies for additional information.\nLitigation Related to Ohio House Bill 6 (HB 6)\nIn 2019, Ohio adopted and implemented HB 6 which benefits OPCo by authorizing rate recovery for certain costs including\nrenewable energy contracts and OVEC’s coal-fired generating units. OPCo engaged in lobbying efforts and provided testimony\nduring the legislative process in connection with HB 6. In July 2020, an investigation led by the U.S. Attorney’s Office\nresulted in a federal grand jury indictment of an Ohio legislator and associates in connection with an alleged racketeering\nconspiracy involving the adoption of HB 6. After AEP learned of the criminal allegations against the Ohio legislator and others\nrelating to HB 6, AEP, with assistance from outside advisors, conducted a review of the circumstances surrounding the passage\nof the bill. Management does not believe that AEP was involved in any wrongful conduct in connection with the passage of\nHB 6.\nIn August 2020, an AEP shareholder filed a putative class action lawsuit in the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of\nOhio against AEP and certain of its officers for alleged violations of securities laws. In December 2021, the district court\nissued an opinion and order dismissing the securities litigation complaint with prejudice, determining that the complaint failed\nto plead any actionable misrepresentations or omissions. The plaintiffs did not appeal the ruling.\nIn January 2021, an AEP shareholder filed a derivative action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio\npurporting to assert claims on behalf of AEP against certain AEP officers and directors. In February 2021, a second AEP\nshareholder filed a similar derivative action in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, Ohio. In April 2021, a third\nAEP shareholder filed a similar derivative action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio and a fourth AEP\nshareholder filed a similar derivative action in the Supreme Court for the State of New York, Nassau County. These derivative\ncomplaints allege the officers and directors made misrepresentations and omissions similar to those alleged in the putative\nsecurities class action lawsuit filed against AEP. The derivative complaints (collectively, the “Derivative Actions”) together\nassert claims for: (a) breach of fiduciary duty, (b) waste of corporate assets, (c) unjust enrichment, (d) breach of duty for insider\ntrading and (e) contribution for violations of sections 10(b) and 21D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and seek monetary\ndamages and changes to AEP’s corporate governance and internal policies among other forms of relief. The court entered a\nscheduling order in the New York state court derivative action staying the case other than with respect to briefing the motion to\ndismiss. AEP filed substantive and forum-based motions to dismiss in April 2022. In June 2022, the Ohio state court entered\nan order continuing the stays of that case until the final resolution of the consolidated derivative actions pending in Ohio federal\ndistrict court. In September 2022, the New York state court granted the forum-based motion to dismiss with prejudice and the\nplaintiff subsequently filed a notice of appeal with the New York appellate court. In January 2023, the New York plaintiff filed\na motion to intervene in the pending Ohio federal court action and withdrew his appeal in New York. The two derivative\nactions pending in federal district court in Ohio have been consolidated and the plaintiffs in the consolidated action filed an\namended complaint. AEP filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint and subsequently filed a brief in opposition to the\nNew York plaintiffs’ motion to intervene in the consolidated action in Ohio. In March 2023, the federal district court issued an\norder granting the motion to dismiss with prejudice and denying the New York plaintiffs’ motion to intervene. In April 2023,\none of the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit of the Ohio federal district court\norder dismissing the consolidated action and denying the intervention.\nIn March 2021, AEP received a litigation demand letter from counsel representing a purported AEP shareholder. The litigation\ndemand letter was directed to the Board of Directors of AEP (AEP Board) and contained factual allegations involving HB 6 that\nwere generally consistent with those in the derivative litigation filed in state and federal court. The shareholder that sent the\nletter has since withdrawn the litigation demand, which is now terminated and of no further effect. In April 2023, AEP received\na litigation demand letter from counsel representing the purported AEP shareholder who had filed the dismissed derivative\naction in New York state court and unsuccessfully tried to intervene in the consolidated derivative actions in Ohio federal court\nthe (“Litigation Demand”). The Litigation Demand is directed to the AEP Board and contains factual allegations involving HB\n6 that are generally consistent with those in the Derivative Actions. The Litigation Demand requested, among other things, that\nthe AEP Board undertake an independent investigation into alleged legal violations by certain current and former directors and\nofficers, and that AEP commence a civil action asserting claims similar to the claims asserted in the Derivative Actions. The\nAEP Board considered the Litigation Demand and formed a committee of the Board (the “Demand Review Committee”) to\n10\ninvestigate, review, monitor and analyze the Litigation Demand and make a recommendation to the AEP Board regarding a\nreasonable and appropriate response to the same.\nIn April 2024, AEP reached an agreement with the four shareholders to fully and finally resolve the Derivative Actions and the\nLitigation Demand, and all claims asserted or that could have been asserted by any AEP shareholder based on the facts alleged,\nin the manner and upon the terms and conditions set forth in the settlement documents (the “Settlement”). In July 2024, the\nCourt preliminarily approved the Settlement. Subject to final approval by the Court, the Settlement includes a payment of $450\nthousand for attorneys’ fees and the implementation of certain corporate governance changes outlined in the Settlement, many\nof which have already been put in place. The Settlement does not include any admission of liability. In the event the\nSettlement is not approved by the Court or the Derivative Actions and the Litigation Demand are not otherwise settled or\ndismissed, the defendants will continue to defend against the Derivative Actions and the AEP Board will continue to act in\nresponse to the Litigation Demand as appropriate. Management does not believe the range of potential losses that is reasonably\npossible of occurring as a result of either the Derivative Actions or the Litigation Demand will have a material impact on results\nof operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nIn May 2021, AEP received a subpoena from the SEC’s Division of Enforcement seeking various documents, including\ndocuments relating to the passage of HB 6 and documents relating to AEP’s policies and financial processes and controls. In\nAugust 2022, AEP received a second subpoena from the SEC seeking various additional documents relating to its ongoing\ninvestigation. AEP is cooperating fully with the SEC’s investigation, which has included taking testimony from certain\nindividuals and inquiries regarding Empowering Ohio’s Economy, Inc., which is a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization, and\nrelated disclosures. The SEC staff has advanced its discussions with certain parties involved in the investigation, including\nAEP, concerning the staff’s intentions regarding potential claims under the securities laws. AEP and the SEC are engaged in\ndiscussions about a possible resolution of the SEC’s investigation and potential claims under the securities laws. Any\nresolution or filed claims, the outcome of which cannot be predicted, may subject AEP to civil penalties and other remedial\nmeasures. Discussions are continuing and management does not believe the range of potential losses that is reasonably possible\nof occurring as a result of this investigation, or possible resolution thereof, will have a material impact on results of operations,\ncash flows or financial condition.\nClaims for Indemnification Made by Owners of the Gavin Power Station\nIn November 2022, the Federal EPA issued a final decision denying Gavin Power LLC’s requested extension to allow a CCR\nsurface impoundment at the Gavin Power Station to continue to receive CCR and non-CCR waste streams after April 11, 2021\nuntil May 4, 2023 (the Gavin Denial). As part of the Gavin Denial, the Federal EPA made several assertions related to the CCR\nRule (see “CCR Rule” section below for additional information), including an assertion that the closure of the 300 acre unlined\nfly ash reservoir (FAR) is noncompliant with the CCR Rule in multiple respects. The Gavin Power Station was formerly\nowned and operated by AEP and was sold to Gavin Power LLC and Lightstone Generation LLC in 2017. Pursuant to the PSA,\nAEP maintained responsibility to complete closure of the FAR in accordance with the closure plan approved by the Ohio EPA\nwhich was completed in July 2021. The PSA contains indemnification provisions, pursuant to which the owners of the Gavin\nPower Station have notified AEP they believe they are entitled to indemnification for any damages that may result from these\nclaims, including any future enforcement or litigation resulting from any determinations of noncompliance by the Federal EPA\nwith various aspects of the CCR Rule consistent with the Gavin Denial. The owners of the Gavin Power Station have also\nsought indemnification for landowner claims for property damage allegedly caused by modifications to the FAR. Management\ndoes not believe that the owners of the Gavin Power Station have any valid claim for indemnity or otherwise against AEP under\nthe PSA. In addition, Gavin Power LLC, several AEP subsidiaries, and other parties have filed Petitions for Review of the\nGavin Denial with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which in June 2024, were dismissed for lack\nof jurisdiction. In January 2024, Gavin Power LLC also filed a complaint with the United States District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of Ohio, alleging various violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and asserting that the Federal EPA, through its\nprior inaction, has waived and is estopped from raising certain objections raised in the Gavin Denial. Management cannot\npredict the outcome of that litigation. Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that is reasonably possible\nof occurring.\n11\nLitigation Regarding Justice Thermal Coal Contract\nIn December 2023, APCo filed a suit in the Franklin County Ohio Court of Common Pleas seeking a declaratory judgment\nconfirming APCo’s right to terminate a long-term coal contract with Justice Thermal LLC (Justice Thermal) based on Justice\nThermal’s failure to perform under the contract. APCo terminated that contract in January 2024, and in April 2024, APCo filed\nan amended complaint seeking a declaration that the termination was proper and also seeking damages for Justice Thermal’s\nbreach of contract. Justice Thermal filed an answer and counterclaim in April 2024, contesting the validity of the contract\ntermination and asserting counterclaims. Justice Thermal’s counterclaims allege that APCo breached the contract, assert a\nclaim for fraud relating to APCo’s alleged fabrication of coal sample analyses, and seek damages. APCo will continue to\npursue its claims and defend against the counterclaims. Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that is\nreasonably possible of occurring.\nENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES\nAEP has a substantial capital investment program and incurs additional operational costs to comply with environmental control\nrequirements. Additional investments and operational changes will be made in response to existing and anticipated\nrequirements to reduce emissions from fossil generation and in response to rules governing the beneficial use and disposal of\ncoal combustion by-products, clean water and renewal permits for certain water discharges.\nAEP is engaged in litigation about environmental issues, was notified of potential responsibility for the clean-up of\ncontaminated sites and incurred costs for disposal of SNF and future decommissioning of the nuclear units. Management is\nengaged in the development of possible future requirements including the items discussed below.\nAEP will seek recovery of expenditures for pollution control technologies and associated costs from customers through rates in\nregulated jurisdictions. Environmental rules could result in accelerated depreciation, impairment of assets or regulatory\ndisallowances. If AEP cannot recover the costs of environmental compliance, it would reduce future net income and cash flows\nand impact financial condition.\nImpact of Environmental Compliance on the Generating Fleet\nThe rules and environmental control requirements discussed below will have a material impact on AEP’s operations. As of\nJune 30, 2024, AEP owned generating capacity of approximately 23,200 MWs, of which approximately 10,700 MWs were\ncoal-fired. In April 2024, the Federal EPA announced four major new rules directed at fossil-fuel electric generation facilities.\nManagement continues to evaluate the impacts of these rules on the plans for the future of AEP’s generating fleet, in particular,\nthe economic feasibility of making the requisite environmental investments on AEP’s fossil generation fleet. AEP continues to\nrefine the cost estimates of complying with these rules to identify the best alternative for ensuring compliance with all of the\nrules while meeting AEP’s obligations to provide reliable and affordable electricity.\nThe costs of complying with new rules may also change based on: (a) potential state rules that impose additional more stringent\nstandards, (b) additional rulemaking activities in response to court decisions, (c) actual performance of the pollution control\ntechnologies installed, (d) changes in costs for new pollution controls, (e) new generating technology developments, (f) total\nMWs of capacity retired and replaced, including the type and amount of such replacement capacity and (g) other factors.\nClean Air Act Requirements\nThe CAA establishes a comprehensive program to protect and improve the nation’s air quality and control sources of air\nemissions. The states implement and administer many of these programs and could impose additional or more stringent\nrequirements. The primary regulatory programs that continue to drive investments in AEP’s existing generating units include:\n(a) periodic revisions to NAAQS and the development of SIPs to achieve more stringent standards, (b) implementation of the\nregional haze program by the states and the Federal EPA, (c) regulation of hazardous air pollutant emissions under MATS, (d)\nimplementation and review of CSAPR and (e) the Federal EPA’s regulation of GHG emissions from fossil generation under\nSection 111 of the CAA. Notable developments in significant CAA regulatory requirements affecting AEP’s operations are\ndiscussed in the following sections.\nNational Ambient Air Quality Standards\nThe Federal EPA periodically reviews and revises the NAAQS for criteria pollutants under the CAA. Revisions tend to\nincrease the stringency of the standards, which in turn may require AEP to make investments in pollution control equipment at\nexisting generating units, or, since most units are already well controlled, to make changes in how units are dispatched and\noperated. In February 2024, the Federal EPA finalized a new more stringent annual primary PM standard.\n2.5\n12\nAreas with air quality that does not meet the new standard will be designated by the Federal EPA as “nonattainment,” which\nwill trigger an obligation for states to revise their SIPs to include additional requirements, resulting in further emission\nreductions to ensure that the new standard will be met. Areas around some of AEP’s generating facilities may be deemed\nnonattainment, which may require those facilities to install additional pollution controls or to implement operational constraints.\nThe nonattainment designations by the Federal EPA and the subsequent SIP revisions by the affected states will take some time\nto complete; therefore, management cannot reasonably estimate the impact on AEP’s operations, cash flows, net income or\nfinancial condition.\nRegional Haze\nThe Federal EPA issued a Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) in 2005, which could require power plants and other facilities to\ninstall best available retrofit technology to address regional haze in federal parks and other protected areas. CAVR is\nimplemented by the states, through SIPs, or by the Federal EPA, through FIPs. In 2017, the Federal EPA revised the rules\ngoverning submission of SIPs to implement the visibility programs. Petitions for review of the final rule revisions have been\nfiled in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\nThe Federal EPA disapproved portions of the Texas regional haze SIP and finalized a FIP that allows participation in the\nCSAPR ozone season program to satisfy the NO regional haze obligations for electric generating units in Texas. Additionally,\nX\nthe Federal EPA finalized an intrastate SO emissions trading program based on CSAPR allowance allocations. Environmental\n2\ngroups filed challenges to these various rulemakings in district courts in the Fifth Circuit and the District of Columbia Circuit.\nManagement cannot predict the outcome of that litigation, although management supports the intrastate trading program as a\ncompliance alternative to source-specific controls and intervened in the Fifth Circuit litigation in support of the Federal EPA.\nIn July 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Circuit entered a consent decree setting deadlines for the\nFederal EPA to rule on Regional Haze SIPs for 33 states, including Texas. The deadlines for the Federal EPA to make\nproposed and final action on the Texas SIP revision are September 30, 2024 and May 30, 2025.\nCross-State Air Pollution Rule\nCSAPR is a regional trading program that the Federal EPA began implementing in 2015, which was originally designed to\naddress interstate transport of emissions that contribute significantly to non-attainment and interfere with maintenance of the\n1997 ozone NAAQS and the 1997 and 2006 PM NAAQS in downwind states. CSAPR relies on SO and NO allowances\n2.5 2 X\nand individual state budgets to compel further emission reductions from electric utility generating units. Interstate trading of\nallowances is allowed on a restricted basis. The Federal EPA has revised, or updated, the CSAPR trading programs several\ntimes since they were established.\nIn January 2021, the Federal EPA finalized a revised CSAPR, which substantially reduced the ozone season NO budgets for\nX\nseveral states, including states where AEP operates, beginning in ozone season 2021. AEP has been able to meet the\nrequirements of the revised rule over the first few years of implementation, and is evaluating its compliance options for later\nyears, when the budgets are further reduced.\nIn addition, in February 2023, the Federal EPA Administrator finalized the disapproval of interstate transport SIPs submitted by\n19 states, including Texas, addressing the 2015 Ozone NAAQS. The Federal EPA disapproved interstate transport SIPs\nsubmitted by additional states soon thereafter. Disapproval of the SIPs provided the Federal EPA with authority to impose a\nFIP for those states, replacing the SIPs that were disapproved. In August 2023, a FIP went into effect that further revised the\nozone season NO budgets under the existing CSAPR program in states to which the FIP applies. As a result of several\nX\nseparate legal challenges brought by states and industry parties in various federal courts, implementation of the FIP has been\nstayed in all of the states in which AEP operates. Management will continue to monitor the outcome of this litigation and the\ndevelopment of SIPs for any potential impact to operations.\nClimate Change, CO Regulation and Energy Policy\n2\nIn April 2024, the Administrator of the Federal EPA signed new GHG standards and guidelines for new and existing fossil-fuel\nfired sources. The rule relies on carbon capture and sequestration and natural gas co-firing as means to reduce CO emissions\n2\nfrom coal fired plants and carbon capture and sequestration or limited utilization to reduce CO emissions from new gas\n2\nturbines. The rule also offers early retirement of coal plants in lieu of carbon capture and storage as an alternative means of\ncompliance. The Federal EPA deferred the finalization of standards for existing gas turbines until later in 2024. AEP is in the\nearly stages of evaluating and identifying the best strategy for complying with this and other new rules, discussed below, while\nensuring the adequacy of resources to meet customer needs. The rule has been challenged by 27 states, numerous companies,\ntrade associations and others. AEP has joined with several other utilities to challenge the rule and has asked the court to stay\nthe rule during the litigation, and the appeals have been consolidated. In July 2024, the D.C. Circuit Court of appeals denied\nthose motions to stay and several parties, including AEP and other utilities, have filed applications with the United States\nSupreme Court seeking an emergency stay. Management will continue to monitor the outcome of this litigation.\n13\nAEP routinely submits IRPs in various regulatory jurisdictions to address future generation and capacity needs. These IRPs\ntake into account economics, customer demand, grid reliability and resilience, regulations and RTO capacity requirements. The\nobjective of the IRPs is to recommend future generation and capacity resources that provide the most cost-efficient and reliable\npower to customers. Based on the output of these IRPs, AEP has set the intermediate and long-term GHG emission reduction\ngoals. The intermediate goal is an 80% reduction in Scope 1 GHG emissions by 2030 (from a 2005 baseline); the long-term\ngoal is net-zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 2045. AEP’s total Scope 1 GHG estimated emissions in 2023 were\napproximately 43.4 million metric tons, a 68% reduction according to the GHG Protocol, which excludes emission reductions\nthat result from assets that have been sold, or a 71% reduction from AEP’s 2005 Scope 1 GHG emissions (inclusive of emission\nreductions that result from plants that have been sold).\nAEP has made significant progress in reducing CO emissions from its power generation fleet and expects its emissions to\n2\ncontinue to decline over the long-term due to the retirement of some coal-fired generation units and increased energy efficiency,\nwhere there is regulatory support for such activities. AEP also expects Scope 1 GHG emissions to vary annually depending on\nthe mix of its own generation and purchased power used to serve customers as well as load growth on the system. AEP’s\nability to achieve these goals is dependent upon a number of factors including continuing to provide the most cost-efficient and\nreliable power to customers, having regulatory support to execute on renewable resource plans, evolving RTO requirements, the\nadvancement of carbon-free generation technologies, customer demand for carbon-free energy, potential tariffs, carbon policy\nand regulation, operational performance of renewable generation, load growth and supply chain costs and constraints.\nExcessive costs to comply with environmental regulations have led to the announcement of early plant closures across the\ncountry. The Federal EPA’s new GHG rules, and suite of other new rules issued simultaneously which are discussed below, are\ndirected at the fossil-fuel fired electric utility industry and could force AEP to close additional coal-fired generation facilities\nearlier than their estimated useful life. If AEP is unable to recover the costs of its investments, it would reduce future net\nincome and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nMATS Rule\nIn April 2024, the Federal EPA issued a revised MATS rule for power plants. The rule includes a more stringent standard for\nemissions of filterable PM for coal-fired electric generating units, as well as a new mercury standard for lignite-fired electric\ngenerating units. The rule also requires the installation and operation of continuous emissions monitors for PM. Several states\nand other parties have challenged the rule, but it is too soon to predict the outcome of the litigation. Management is evaluating\nthe impacts of the rule, but does not anticipate any significant challenges complying with the rule.\nCCR Rule\nThe Federal EPA’s CCR Rule regulates the disposal and beneficial re-use of CCR, including fly ash and bottom ash created\nfrom coal-fired generating units and FGD gypsum generated at some coal-fired plants. The original rule applied to active and\ninactive CCR landfills and surface impoundments at facilities of active electric utility or independent power producers. With\nrevisions announced in April 2024, the scope of the rule has expanded significantly, to include inactive impoundments at\ninactive facilities (“legacy CCR surface impoundments”) as well as to establish requirements for currently exempt solid waste\nmanagement units that involve the direct placement of CCR on the land (“CCR management units”).\nIn 2020, the Federal EPA revised the original CCR Rule to include a requirement that unlined CCR storage ponds cease\noperations and initiate closure by April 11, 2021. The revised rule provides two options that allow facilities to extend the date\nby which they must cease receipt of coal ash and close the ponds.\nThe first option provided an extension to cease receipt of CCR no later than October 15, 2023 for most units, and October 15,\n2024 for a narrow subset of units; however, the Federal EPA’s grant of such an extension requires a satisfactory demonstration\nof the need for additional time to develop alternative ash disposal capacity and will be limited to the soonest timeframe\ntechnically feasible to cease receipt of CCR. Additionally, each request must undergo formal review, including public\ncomments, and be approved by the Federal EPA. AEP had filed several applications for additional time to develop alternative\ndisposal capacity at the various plants. AEP has since ceased receiving ash in the ponds subject to the extension requests,\ncompleted construction of new, CCR Rule compliant facilities and has withdrawn those applications as moot.\nIn January 2022, the Federal EPA proposed to deny several extension requests filed by the other utilities based on allegations\nthat those utilities are not in compliance with the CCR Rule (the January Actions). In November 2022, the Federal EPA\nfinalized one of these denials (the Gavin Denial, discussed above). The Federal EPA’s allegations of noncompliance rely on\nwhat AEP and others believe are new interpretations of the CCR Rule requirements. The new interpretations in the January\nActions of the Federal EPA and the Gavin Denial were challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia\nCircuit as unlawful rulemaking that revises the existing CCR Rule requirements without proper notice and without opportunity\nfor comment. In June 2024, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that the Federal EPA’s\n14\nJanuary actions and statements made in the Gavin Denial did not constitute new agency rules subject to review by the court.\nThe court dismissed the appeals for lack of jurisdiction.\nUnder the second option for obtaining an extension of the April 11, 2021 deadline to cease operation of unlined impoundments,\na generating facility may continue operating its existing impoundments without developing alternative CCR disposal, provided\nthe facility commits to cease combustion of coal by a date certain. Under this option, a generating facility had until October 17,\n2023 to cease coal-fired operations and to close CCR storage ponds 40 acres or less in size, or through October 17, 2028 for\nfacilities with CCR storage ponds greater than 40 acres in size. Pursuant to this option, AEP informed the Federal EPA of its\nintent to retire the Pirkey Plant and cease using coal at the Welsh Plant. In March 2023, the Pirkey Plant was retired. To date,\nthe Federal EPA has not taken any action on the pending extension request for the Welsh Plant.\nIn April 2024, the Federal EPA finalized revisions to the CCR Rule to expand the scope of the rule to include inactive\nimpoundments at inactive facilities (“legacy CCR surface impoundments”) as well as to establish requirements for currently\nexempt solid waste management units that involve the direct placement of CCR on the land (“CCR management units”). The\nFederal EPA is requiring that owners and operators of legacy surface impoundments comply with all of the existing CCR Rule\nrequirements applicable to inactive CCR surface impoundments at active facilities, except for the location restrictions and liner\ndesign criteria. The rule establishes compliance deadlines for legacy surface impoundments to meet regulatory requirements,\nincluding a requirement to initiate closure within five years after the effective date of the final rule. The rule requires\nevaluations to be completed at both active facilities and inactive facilities with one or more legacy surface impoundments.\nClosure may be accomplished by applying an impermeable cover system over the CCR material (“closure in place”) or the CCR\nmaterial may be excavated and placed in a compliant landfill (“closure by removal”). Groundwater monitoring and other\nanalysis over the next three years will provide additional information on the planned closure method. AEP evaluated the\napplicability of the rule to current and former plant sites and recorded incremental ARO in the second quarter of 2024, as shown\nin the table below, based on initial cost estimates primarily reflecting compliance with the rule through closure in place and\nfuture groundwater monitoring requirements pursuant to the CCR Rule.\nIncrease in Generation Increase in Regulatory Charged to Operating\nRegistrant Increase in ARO Property (a) Assets (b) Expenses (c)\n(in millions)\nAPCo $ 312.2 $ 75.6 $ 236.6 $ —\nI&M 85.7 — 72.3 13.4\nOPCo 52.9 — — 52.9\nPSO 33.7 33.7 — —\nSWEPCo 23.8 23.8 — —\nNon-Registrants 166.1 43.8 46.1 76.2\nTotal $ 674.4 $ 176.9 $ 355.0 $ 142.5\n(a) ARO is related to a legacy CCR surface impoundment or CCR management unit at an operating generation facility.\n(b) ARO is related to a legacy CCR surface impoundment or CCR management unit at a retired generation facility and recognition of a\nregulatory asset in accordance with the accounting guidance for “Regulated Operations” is supported.\n(c) ARO is related to a legacy CCR surface impoundment or CCR management unit and recognition of a regulatory asset in accordance\nwith the accounting guidance for “Regulated Operations” is not yet supported.\nAs further groundwater monitoring and other analysis is performed, management expects to refine the assumptions and\nunderlying cost estimates used in recording the ARO. These refinements may include, but are not limited to, changes in the\nexpected method of closure, changes in estimated quantities of CCR at each site, the identification of new CCR management\nunits, among other items. These future changes could have a material impact on the ARO and materially reduce future net\nincome and cash flows and further impact financial condition.\nAEP will seek cost recovery through regulated rates, including proposal of new regulatory mechanisms for cost recovery where\nexisting mechanisms are not applicable. The rule could have an additional, material adverse impact on net income, cash flows\nand financial condition if AEP cannot ultimately recover these additional costs of compliance. In June 2024, a third-party filed\na petition for review of the rule with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Management is also evaluating potential\nlegal challenges to the revised rule.\n15\nClean Water Act Regulations\nThe Federal EPA’s ELG rule for generating facilities establishes limits for FGD wastewater, fly ash and bottom ash transport\nwater and flue gas mercury control wastewater, which are to be implemented through each facility’s wastewater discharge\npermit. A revision to the ELG rule, published in October 2020, established additional options for reusing and discharging small\nvolumes of bottom ash transport water, provided an exception for retiring units and extended the compliance deadline to a date\nas soon as possible beginning one year after the rule was published but no later than December 2025. Management has\nassessed technology additions and retrofits to comply with the rule and the impacts of the Federal EPA’s actions on facilities’\nwastewater discharge permitting for FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water. For affected facilities required to install\nadditional technologies to meet the ELG rule limits, permit modifications were filed in January 2021 that reflect the outcome of\nthat assessment. AEP continues to work with state agencies to finalize permit terms and conditions. Other facilities opted to\nfile Notices of Planned Participation (NOPP), pursuant to which the facilities are not required to install additional controls to\nmeet ELG limits provided they make commitments to cease coal combustion by a date certain. In April 2024, the Federal EPA\nfinalized further revisions to the ELG rule that establish a zero liquid discharge standard for FGD wastewater, bottom ash\ntransport water, and managed combustion residual leachate, as well as more stringent discharge limits for unmanaged\ncombustion residual leachate. The revised rule provides a new compliance alternative that would avoid the need to install zero\nliquid discharge systems for facilities that comply with the 2020 rule’s control technology requirements and commit by\nDecember 31, 2025 to retire by 2034. Management is evaluating the compliance alternatives in the rule, taking into\nconsideration the requirements of the other new rules and their combined impacts to operations. Several appeals have been\nfiled with various federal courts challenging the 2024 ELG rule. SWEPCo has also challenged the rule, by filing a joint appeal\nwith a utility trade association in which AEP participates. The various appeals have been consolidated before the United States\nCourt of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. SWEPCo and the utility trade association have also moved the court to stay the rule\nduring the litigation. Management cannot predict the outcome of the litigation.\nThe definition of “waters of the United States” has been subject to rule-making and litigation which has led to inconsistent\nscope among the states. Management will continue to monitor developments in rule-making and litigation for any potential\nimpact to operations.\nImpact of Environmental Regulation on Coal-Fired Generation\nCompliance with extensive environmental regulations requires significant capital investment in environmental monitoring,\ninstallation of pollution control equipment, emission fees, disposal, remediation and permits. Management continuously\nevaluates cost estimates of complying with these regulations which may result in a decision to retire coal-fired generating\nfacilities earlier than their currently estimated useful lives.\nThe table below summarizes the net book value, as of June 30, 2024, of generating facilities retired or planned for early\nretirement in advance of the retirement date currently authorized for ratemaking purposes:\nCurrent\nAccelerated Actual/Projected Authorized\nNet Depreciation Retirement Recovery Annual\nCompany Plant Investment (a) Regulatory Asset Date Period Depreciation (b)\n(in millions) (in millions)\nPSO Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 $ 122.8 $ 173.6 2026 (c) $ 15.1\nSWEPCo Pirkey Plant — 117.9 (d) 2023 (e) —\nSWEPCo Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3 344.9 145.4 2028 (f) (g) 39.9\n(a) Net book value, including CWIP excluding cost of removal and materials and supplies.\n(b) These amounts represent the amount of annual depreciation that has been collected from customers over the prior 12-month period.\n(c) Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 is currently being recovered through 2040.\n(d) Represents Arkansas and Texas jurisdictional share.\n(e) As part of the 2021 Arkansas Base Rate Case, the APSC granted SWEPCo regulatory asset treatment. SWEPCo will request recovery including a\nweighted average cost of capital carrying charge through a future proceeding. The Texas share of the Pirkey Plant will be addressed in SWEPCo’s\nnext base rate case. See the “Regulated Generating Units” section of Note 4 for additional information.\n(f) In November 2020, management announced it will cease using coal at the Welsh Plant in 2028. Management is evaluating a potential conversion to\nnatural gas after 2028 for both units.\n(g) Welsh Plant, Unit 1 is being recovered through 2027 in the Louisiana jurisdiction and through 2037 in the Arkansas and Texas jurisdictions. Welsh\nPlant, Unit 3 is being recovered through 2032 in the Louisiana jurisdiction and through 2042 in the Arkansas and Texas jurisdictions.\nManagement is seeking or will seek regulatory recovery, as necessary, for any net book value remaining when the plants are\nretired. To the extent the net book value of these generation assets is not deemed recoverable, it could materially reduce future\nnet income, cash flows and impact financial condition.\n16\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAEP’s Reportable Segments\nAEP’s primary business is the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity. Within its Vertically Integrated Utilities\nsegment, AEP centrally dispatches generation assets and manages its overall utility operations on an integrated basis because of\nthe substantial impact of cost-based rates and regulatory oversight. Intersegment sales and transfers are generally based on\nunderlying contractual arrangements and agreements. AEP’s reportable segments are as follows:\n• Vertically Integrated Utilities\n• Transmission and Distribution Utilities\n• AEP Transmission Holdco\n• Generation & Marketing\nThe remainder of AEP’s activities are presented as Corporate and Other, which is not considered a reportable segment. See\nNote 8 - Business Segments for additional information on AEP’s segments.\nThe following discussion of AEP’s results of operations by operating segment provides a comparison of Earnings Attributable\nto AEP Common Shareholders for the three months ended and six months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the three months\nended and six months ended June 30, 2023. For AEP’s Vertically Integrated Utilities and Transmission and Distribution\nUtilities segments and subsidiary registrants within these segments, the results include revenues from rate rider mechanisms\ndesigned to recover fuel, purchased power and other recoverable expenses such that the revenues and expenses associated with\nthese items generally offset and do not affect Earnings Attributable to AEP Common Shareholders. For additional information\nregarding the financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, see the discussions of Results of\nOperations by Subsidiary Registrant.\nThe

following:\n• A $148 million decrease at SWEPCo primarily due to a $160 million probable revenue refund associated with the\nTurk Plant and SWEPCo’s 2012 Texas Base Rate Case.\n• A $27 million decrease in weather-normalized revenues primarily in the residential class.\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\n• A $64 million increase in weather-related usage primarily in the residential class driven by a 46% increase in cooling\ndegree days.\n• A $50 million increase in rider revenues at APCo.\nExpenses and Other and Income Tax Benefit changed between years as follows:\n• Other Operation and Maintenance expenses increased $134 million primarily due to:\n• A $76 million increase in employee-related expenses due to the voluntary severance program.\n• A $22 million increase in recoverable PJM expenses.\n• A $9 million increase in recoverable SPP expenses.\n21\n• Asset Impairments and Other Related Charges increased $13 million due to the Federal EPA’s revised CCR rules.\n• Depreciation and Amortization increased $29 million primarily due to a higher depreciable base at APCo, I&M and\nSWEPCo and an increase in amortization of regulatory assets at SWEPCo.\n• Taxes Other Than Income Taxes increased $6 million primarily due to increased property taxes at PSO and I&M,\npartially offset by a decrease in property taxes at SWEPCo.\n• Non-Service Cost Components of Net Periodic Pension Cost increased $10 million primarily due to the expiration of\nprior service credit amortization from previous plan changes and settlements in excess of the plan’s settlement threshold,\npartially offset by lower loss amortization resulting from favorable asset returns during 2023 and lower interest costs due\nto lower discount rates.\n• Income Tax Benefit increased $25 million primarily due to the following:\n• A $50 million increase due to a decrease in pretax book income.\nThis increase was partially offset by:\n• A $15 million decrease due to a decrease in

probable revenue refund associated with the\nTurk Plant and SWEPCo’s 2012 Texas Base Rate Case.\n• A $63 million decrease in fuel revenues primarily due to lower authorized fuel rates at PSO.\n• A $25 million decrease in weather-normalized revenues primarily in the residential and industrial classes partially\noffset by an increase in the commercial class.\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\n• A $96 million increase in rider revenues at APCo.\n• An $88 million increase in weather-related usage primarily in the residential class driven by a 42% increase in\ncooling degree days.\n• A $34 million increase in base rate and rider revenues at PSO.\n• A $30 million increase in rider revenues at KPCo.\n• Transmission Revenues increased $15 million primarily due to the following:\n• A $17 million increase due to continued investment in transmission assets.\n• An $8 million increase primarily due to lower PJM rates in 2023 for certain point-to-point transmission service\nresulting from a December 2022 FERC approved settlement agreement.\nThese increases were partially offset by:\n• A $9 million decrease due to transmission formula rate true-up activity.\n• Other Revenues

in recoverable PJM expenses.\n• A $10 million increase in recoverable SPP expenses.\n• Asset Impairments and Other Related Charges increased $13 million due to the Federal EPA’s revised CCR rules.\n• Depreciation and Amortization expenses increased $9 million primarily due to the following:\n• A $14 million increase at APCo primarily due to a higher depreciable base.\n• A $14 million increase at SWEPCo primarily due to an increase in amortization of regulatory assets and a higher\ndepreciable base, partially offset by the recognition of a regulatory asset related to NOLCs.\nThese increases were partially offset by:\n• A $17 million decrease at I&M primarily due to the deferral of Excess ADIT as a result of the PLR received\nregarding the treatment of stand-alone NOLCs and the timing of refunds to customers under rate rider mechanisms.\n22\n• Taxes Other Than Income Taxes increased $14 million primarily due to increased property taxes at PSO and I&M and\nan increase in Virginia state minimum taxes at APCo, partially offset by a decrease in property taxes at SWEPCo.\n• Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction increased $9 million primarily due to higher CWIP and\nAFUDC equity rates.\n• Non-Service Cost Components of Net Periodic Benefit Cost increased $16 million primarily due to the expiration of\nprior service credit amortization from previous plan changes and settlements in excess of the plan’s settlement threshold,\npartially offset by lower loss amortization resulting from favorable asset returns during 2023 and lower interest costs due\nto lower discount rates.\n• Interest Expense decreased $21 million primarily due to the following:\n• A $54 million decrease due to the recognition of debt carrying charges as a result of the IRS PLR received regarding\nthe treatment of stand-alone NOLCs in retail rate making.\nThis decrease was partially offset by:\n• A $27 million increase due to higher long-term debt balances and interest rates.\n• Income Tax Expense decreased $285 million primarily due to the following:\n• A $212 million decrease due to a reduction in Excess ADIT regulatory liabilities at I&M, PSO, and SWEPCo as a\nresult of the IRS PLR received regarding the treatment of stand-alone NOLCs.\n• A $36 million decrease due to a decrease in pretax book income.\n• A $32 million decrease due to a reduction in Excess ADIT

and the liquidity provided by its cash flows.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nDebt and Equity Capitalization\nJune 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(dollars in millions)\nLong-term Debt, including amounts due within one year $ 42,062.3 60.2 % $ 40,143.2 58.8 %\nShort-term Debt 1,681.7 2.4 2,830.2 4.2\nTotal Debt 43,744.0 62.6 42,973.4 63.0\nAEP Common Equity 26,135.2 37.4 25,246.7 37.0\nNoncontrolling Interests 40.5 — 39.2 —\nTotal Debt and Equity Capitalization $ 69,919.7 100.0 % $ 68,259.3 100.0 %\nAEP’s ratio of debt-to-total capital decreased slightly from 63.0% to 62.6% as of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2024,\nrespectively, primarily due to an increase in earnings and equity issued under the ATM program in 2024, partially offset by an\nincrease in debt to support distribution, transmission and renewable investment growth in addition to working capital needs.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity, or access to cash, is an important factor in determining AEP’s financial stability. Management believes AEP has\nadequate liquidity. As of June 30, 2024, AEP had $6 billion of revolving credit facilities to support its commercial paper\nprogram. Additional liquidity is available from cash from operations and a receivables securitization agreement. Management\nis committed to maintaining adequate liquidity. AEP generally uses short-term borrowings to fund working capital needs,\nproperty acquisitions and construction until long-term funding is arranged. Sources of long-term funding include issuance of\nlong-term debt, long-term asset securitizations, leasing agreements, hybrid securities or common stock. AEP and its utilities\nfinance its operations with commercial paper and other variable rate instruments that are subject to fluctuations in interest rates.\nTo the extent that there is an increase in interest rates, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial\ncondition.\nMarket volatility and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect AEP’s ability to raise capital on reasonable terms to\nfund capital needs, including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness. AEP is also monitoring the current\nbank environment and any impacts thereof. AEP was not materially impacted by these conditions during the six months ended\nJune 30, 2024.\nAEP continues to address the cash flow implications of increased fuel and purchased power costs, see “Deferred Fuel Costs”\nsection of Executive Overview for additional information.\nNet Available Liquidity\nAEP manages liquidity by maintaining adequate external financing commitments. As of June 30, 2024, available liquidity was\napproximately $5.4 billion as illustrated in the table below:\nAmount Maturity (a)\nCommercial Paper Backup: (in millions)\nRevolving Credit Facility $ 5,000.0 March 2029\nRevolving Credit Facility 1,000.0 March 2027\nCash and Cash Equivalents 202.5\nTotal Liquidity Sources 6,202.5\nLess: AEP Commercial Paper Outstanding 776.0\nNet Available Liquidity $ 5,426.5\n(a) In March 2024, AEP increased its $4 billion Revolving Credit Facility to $5 billion and\nextended the maturity date from March 2027 to March 2029. Also, in March 2024, AEP\nextended the maturity date of its $1 billion Revolving Credit Facility from March 2025 to March\n2027.\n33\nAEP uses its commercial paper program to meet the short-term borrowing needs of its subsidiaries. The program funds a\nUtility Money Pool, which funds AEP’s utility subsidiaries; a Nonutility Money Pool, which funds certain AEP nonutility\nsubsidiaries; and the short-term debt requirements of subsidiaries that are not participating in either money pool for regulatory\nor operational reasons, as direct borrowers. The maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during the first six months\nof 2024 was $2.9 billion. The weighted-average interest rate for AEP’s commercial paper during 2024 was 5.58%.\nOther Credit Facilities\nAn uncommitted facility gives the issuer of the facility the right to accept or decline each request made under the facility. AEP\nissues letters of credit on behalf of subsidiaries under six uncommitted facilities totaling $450 million. The Registrants’\nmaximum future payments for letters of credit issued under the uncommitted facilities as of June 30, 2024 was $245 million\nwith maturities ranging from July 2024 to July 2025.\nSecuritized Accounts Receivables\nAEP Credit’s receivables securitization agreement provides a commitment of $900 million from bank conduits to purchase\nreceivables and expires in September 2025. As of June 30, 2024, the affiliated utility subsidiaries were in compliance with all\nrequirements under the agreement.\nDebt Covenants and Borrowing Limitations\nAEP’s credit agreements contain certain covenants and require it to maintain a percentage of debt-to-total capitalization at a\nlevel that does not exceed 67.5%. The method for calculating outstanding debt and capitalization is contractually-defined in\nAEP’s credit agreements. Debt as defined in the revolving credit agreement excludes securitization bonds and debt of AEP\nCredit. As of June 30, 2024, this contractually-defined percentage was 58.6%. Non-performance under these covenants could\nresult in an event of default under these credit agreements. In addition, the acceleration of AEP’s payment obligations, or the\nobligations of certain of AEP’s major subsidiaries, prior to maturity under any other agreement or instrument relating to debt\noutstanding in excess of $100 million, would cause an event of default under these credit agreements. This condition also\napplies, at the more restrictive level of $50 million of debt outstanding, in a majority of AEP’s non-exchange-traded commodity\ncontracts and would similarly allow lenders and counterparties to declare the outstanding amounts payable. However, a default\nunder AEP’s non-exchange-traded commodity contracts would not cause an event of default under its credit agreements.\nThe revolving credit facilities do not permit the lenders to refuse a draw on any facility if a material adverse change occurs.\nUtility Money Pool borrowings and external borrowings may not exceed amounts authorized by regulatory orders and AEP\nmanages its borrowings to stay within those authorized limits.\nATM Program\nAEP participates in an ATM offering program that allows AEP to issue, from time to time, up to an aggregate of $1.7 billion of\nits common stock, including shares of common stock that may be sold pursuant to an equity forward sales agreement. As of\nJune 30, 2024, approximately $1.3 billion of equity is available for issuance under the ATM offering program. See Note 12 -\nFinancing Activities for additional information.\nDividend Policy and Restrictions\nThe Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.88 per share in July 2024. Future dividends may vary depending\nupon AEP’s profit levels, operating cash flow levels and capital requirements, as well as financial and other business conditions\nexisting at the time. Parent’s income primarily derives from common stock equity in the earnings of its utility subsidiaries.\nVarious financing arrangements and regulatory requirements may impose certain restrictions on the ability of the subsidiaries to\ntransfer funds to Parent in the form of dividends. Management does not believe these restrictions will have any significant\nimpact on its ability to access cash to meet the payment of dividends on its common stock. See “Dividend Restrictions” section\nof Note 12 for additional information.\nCredit Ratings\nAEP and its utility subsidiaries do not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules\nor terminations as a result of a credit downgrade, but its access to the commercial paper market may depend on its credit\nratings. In addition, downgrades in AEP’s credit ratings by one of the rating agencies could increase its borrowing\ncosts. Counterparty concerns about the credit quality of AEP or its utility subsidiaries could subject AEP to additional\ncollateral demands under adequate assurance clauses under its derivative and non-derivative energy contracts.\n34\nCASH FLOW\nAEP relies primarily on cash flows from operations, debt issuances and its existing cash and cash equivalents to fund its\nliquidity and investing activities. AEP’s investing and capital requirements are primarily capital expenditures, repaying of\nlong-term debt and paying dividends to shareholders. AEP uses short-term debt, including commercial paper, as a bridge to\nlong-term debt financing. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly due to the timing of long-term debt financings and\nthe impact of fluctuations in cash flows.\nSix Months Ended\nJune 30,\n2024 2023\n(in millions)\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash at Beginning of Period $ 379.0 $ 556.5\nNet Cash Flows from Operating Activities 2,904.2 1,881.6\nNet Cash Flows Used for Investing Activities (3,249.7) (4,265.5)\nNet Cash Flows from Financing Activities 214.4 2,178.1\nNet Decrease in Cash and Cash Equivalents (131.1) (205.8)\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash at End of Period $ 247.9 $ 350.7\nOperating Activities\nSix Months Ended\nJune 30,\n2024 2023\n(in millions)\nNet Income $ 1,348.2 $ 916.5\nNon-Cash Adjustments to Net Income (a) 1,596.6 1,692.6\nMark-to-Market of Risk Management Contracts (75.0) (124.7)\nProperty Taxes 213.2 202.7\nDeferred Fuel Over/Under-Recovery, Net 120.0 342.5\nChange in Other Noncurrent Assets (131.0) (375.5)\nChange in Other Noncurrent Liabilities 189.9 (55.4)\nChange in Certain Components of Working Capital (357.7) (717.1)\nNet Cash Flows from Operating Activities $ 2,904.2 $ 1,881.6\n(a) Non-Cash Adjustments to Net Income includes Depreciation and Amortization, Deferred Income Taxes, Loss on\nthe Sale of the Competitive Contracted Renewables Portfolio, Asset Impairments and Other Related Charges and\nAFUDC.\nNet Cash Flows from Operating Activities increased by $1 billion primarily due to the following:\n• A $490 million increase in cash from Change in Other Noncurrent Assets and Change in Other Noncurrent Liabilities.\nThis increase is primarily due to changes in regulatory assets and liabilities driven by timing differences between\ncollections from and refunds to customers under rate rider mechanisms.\n• A $359 million increase in cash from the Change in Certain Components of Working Capital. The increase is\nprimarily due to a decrease in fuel, material and supplies driven by lower coal inventory on hand, employee-related\nbenefits and proceeds received from the sale of transferable tax credits. These increases were partially offset by the\ntiming of accounts receivable collections.\n• A $336 million increase in cash from Net Income, after non-cash adjustments.

Estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and\nmodification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental regulations, business\nopportunities, market volatility, economic trends, supply chain issues, weather, legal reviews, inflation and the ability to access\ncapital. Management expects to fund these capital expenditures through cash flows from operations, proceeds from the\nstrategic sale of assets and financing activities. Generally, the Registrant Subsidiaries use cash or short-term borrowings under\nthe money pool to fund these expenditures until long-term funding is arranged. For complete information of forecasted capital\nexpenditures, see “Budgeted Capital Expenditures” section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations” in the 2023 Annual Report.\nSIGNIFICANT CASH REQUIREMENTS\nA summary of significant cash requirements is included in the 2023 Annual Report and has not changed significantly from\nyear-end other than the debt issuances and retirements discussed in the “Cash Flow” section above.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES AND ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nSee the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations” in the 2023 Annual Report for a discussion of the estimates and judgments required for\nregulatory accounting, revenue recognition, derivative instruments, the valuation of long-lived assets, the accounting for\npension and other postretirement benefits and the impact of new accounting standards and SEC rulemaking activity.\nAROs\nAROs are recognized for legal obligations associated with the retirement of property, plant and equipment. When recording an\nARO, the present value of the projected liability is recognized in the period in which the legal obligation is incurred or enacted,\nif a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The liability is accreted over time. For operating facilities, the present value\nof the liability is added to the cost of the associated asset and depreciated over the remaining life of the asset. For retired\nfacilities, the present value of the liability is expensed, and where future recovery through rates is probable, the present value of\nthe liability is subsequently deferred as a regulatory asset. The present value of the initial ARO and subsequent updates are\nbased on discounted cash flows, which include estimates regarding timing of future cash flows, discount rates and cost\nescalation rates. These estimates are subject to change. Depreciation expense is adjusted prospectively for any changes to the\ncarrying amount of the associated asset.\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nSee Note 2 - New Accounting Standards for information related to accounting standards and SEC rulemaking activity.\n37\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket Risks\nThe Vertically Integrated Utilities segment is exposed to certain market risks as a major power producer and through\ntransactions in power, coal, natural gas and marketing contracts. These risks include commodity price risks which may be\nsubject to capacity risk, credit risk as well as interest rate risk. These risks represent the risk of loss that may impact this\nsegment due to changes in the underlying market prices or rates.\nThe Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment is exposed to energy procurement risk and interest rate risk.\nThe Generation & Marketing segment conducts marketing, risk management and retail activities in ERCOT, PJM, SPP and\nMISO. This segment is exposed to certain market risks as a marketer of wholesale and retail electricity. These risks include\ncommodity price risks which may be subject to capacity risk, credit risk as well as interest rate risk. These risks represent the\nrisk of loss that may impact this segment due to changes in the underlying market prices or rates. In addition, the Generation\n& Marketing segment is also exposed to certain market risks as a power producer and through transactions in wholesale\nelectricity, natural gas and marketing contracts.\nManagement employs risk management contracts including physical forward and financial forward purchase-and-sale\ncontracts. Management engages in risk management of power, capacity, coal, natural gas and, to a lesser extent, heating oil,\ngasoline and other commodity contracts to manage the risk associated with the energy business. As a result, AEP is subject to\nprice risk. The amount of risk taken is determined by the Commercial Operations, Energy Supply and Finance groups in\naccordance with established risk management policies as approved by the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors.\nAEPSC’s market risk oversight staff independently monitors risk policies, procedures and risk levels and provides members of\nthe Regulated Risk Committee and the Energy Supply Risk Committee (Competitive Risk Committee) various reports\nregarding compliance with policies, limits and procedures. The Regulated Risk Committee consists of AEPSC’s Chief\nFinancial Officer, Chief Commercial Officer, Executive Vice President Utilities, Executive Vice President Grid Solutions &\nGovernment Affairs, Senior Vice President of Regulated Commercial Operations, Senior Vice President of Treasury and Risk\nand Chief Risk Officer. The Competitive Risk Committee consists of AEPSC’s Chief Financial Officer, Chief Commercial\nOfficer, Senior Vice President of Treasury and Risk, Senior Vice President of Competitive Commercial Operations and Chief\nRisk Officer. When commercial activities exceed predetermined limits, positions are modified to reduce the risk to be within\nthe limits unless specifically approved by the respective committee.\nThe following table summarizes the reasons for changes in total MTM value as compared to December 31, 2023:\nMTM Derivative Contract Net Assets (Liabilities)\nSix Months Ended June 30, 2024\nTransmission\nVertically and Generation\nIntegrated Distribution &\nUtilities Utilities Marketing Total\n(in millions)\nTotal MTM Risk Management Contracts - Commodity Net\nAssets (Liabilities) as of December 31, 2023 $ 16.9 $ (51.0) $ 92.4 $ 58.3\n(Gain)/Loss from Contracts Realized/Settled During the Period and\nEntered in a Prior Period (12.3) 4.2 58.3 50.2\nFair Value of New Contracts at Inception When Entered During the\nPeriod (a) — — (45.8) (45.8)\nChanges in Fair Value Due to Market Fluctuations During the\nPeriod (b) (21.5) — 58.6 37.1\nChanges in Fair Value Allocated to Regulated Jurisdictions (c) 165.7 3.6 — 169.3\nTotal MTM Risk Management Contracts - Commodity Net\nAssets (Liabilities) as of June 30, 2024 $ 148.8 $ (43.2) $ 163.5 269.1\nCommodity Cash Flow Hedge Contracts 131.6\nInterest Rate Cash Flow Hedge Contracts 10.1\nFair Value Hedge Contracts (96.5)\nCollateral Deposits (152.6)\nTotal MTM Derivative Contract Net Assets as of June 30, 2024 $ 161.7\n38\n(a) Reflects fair value on primarily auctions or long-term structured contracts which are typically with customers that seek fixed pricing\nto limit their risk against fluctuating energy prices. The contract prices are valued against market curves associated with the delivery\nlocation and delivery term.

These net gains (losses) are\nrecorded as regulatory liabilities/assets or accounts payable on the balance sheet.\nSee Note 9 – Derivatives and Hedging and Note 10 – Fair Value Measurements for additional information related to risk\nmanagement contracts. The following tables and discussion provide information on credit risk and market volatility risk.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is mitigated in wholesale marketing and trading activities by assessing the creditworthiness of potential\ncounterparties before entering into transactions with them and continuing to evaluate their creditworthiness on an ongoing\nbasis. Management uses credit agency ratings and current market-based qualitative and quantitative data as well as financial\nstatements to assess the financial health of counterparties on an ongoing basis.\nAEP has risk management contracts (includes non-derivative contracts) with numerous counterparties. Since open risk\nmanagement contracts are valued based on changes in market prices of the related commodities, exposures change daily. As\nof June 30, 2024, credit exposure net of collateral to sub investment grade counterparties was approximately 10.6%, expressed\nin terms of net MTM assets, net receivables and the net open positions for contracts not subject to MTM (representing\neconomic risk even though there may not be risk of accounting loss).\nAs of June 30, 2024, the following table approximates AEP’s counterparty credit quality and exposure based on netting across\ncommodities, instruments and legal entities where applicable:\nExposure Number of Net Exposure\nBefore Counterparties of\nCredit Credit Net >10% of Counterparties\nCounterparty Credit Quality Collateral Collateral Exposure Net Exposure >10%\n(in millions, except number of counterparties)\nInvestment Grade $ 559.0 $ 156.2 $ 402.8 3 $ 200.1\nSplit Rating 13.4 — 13.4 1 13.4\nNo External Ratings:\nInternal Investment Grade 16.6 — 16.6 2 8.6\nInternal Noninvestment Grade 116.6 65.0 51.6 2 42.4\nTotal as of June 30, 2024 $ 705.6 $ 221.2 $ 484.4\nAll exposure in the table above relates to AEPSC and AEPEP as AEPSC is agent for and transacts on behalf of certain AEP\nsubsidiaries, including the Registrant Subsidiaries and AEPEP is agent for and transacts on behalf of other AEP subsidiaries.\nIn addition, AEP is exposed to credit risk related to participation in RTOs. For each of the RTOs in which AEP participates,\nthis risk is generally determined based on the proportionate share of member gross activity over a specified period of time.\nValue at Risk (VaR) Associated with Risk Management Contracts\nManagement uses a risk measurement model, which calculates VaR, to measure AEP’s commodity price risk in the risk\nmanagement portfolio. The VaR is based on the variance-covariance method using historical prices to estimate volatilities and\ncorrelations and assumes a 95% confidence level and a one-day holding period. Based on this VaR analysis, as of June 30,\n2024, a near term typical change in commodity prices is not expected to materially impact net income, cash flows or financial\ncondition.\nManagement calculates the VaR for both a trading and non-trading portfolio. The trading portfolio consists primarily of\ncontracts related to energy trading and marketing activities. The non-trading portfolio consists primarily of economic hedges\nof generation and retail supply activities.\n39\nThe following tables show the end, high, average and low market risk as measured by VaR for the periods indicated:\nVaR Model\nTrading Portfolio\nSix Months Ended Twelve Months Ended\nJune 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nEnd High Average Low End High Average Low\n(in millions) (in millions)\n$ 0.5 $ 1.7 $ 0.3 $ 0.1 $ 0.2 $ 0.9 $ 0.2 $ 0.1\nVaR Model\nNon-Trading Portfolio\nSix Months Ended Twelve Months Ended\nJune 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nEnd High Average Low End High Average Low\n(in millions) (in millions)\n$ 24.9 $ 98.6 $ 23.8 $ 8.3 $ 17.7 $ 32.7 $ 16.4 $ 6.1\nManagement back-tests VaR results against performance due to actual price movements. Based on the assumed 95%\nconfidence interval, the performance due to actual price movements would be expected to exceed the VaR at least once every\n20 trading days.\nAs the VaR calculation captures recent price movements, management also performs regular stress testing of the trading\nportfolio to understand AEP’s exposure to extreme price movements. A historical-based method is employed whereby the\ncurrent trading portfolio is subjected to actual, observed price movements from the last several years in order to ascertain\nwhich historical price movements translated into the largest potential MTM loss. Management then researches the underlying\npositions, price movements and market events that created the most significant exposure and reports the findings to the Risk\nExecutive Committee, Regulated Risk Committee or Competitive Risk Committee as appropriate.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAEP is exposed to interest rate market fluctuations in the normal course of business operations. Prior to 2022, interest rates\nremained at low levels and the Federal Reserve maintained the federal funds target range at 0.0% to 0.25% for much of 2021.\nDuring 2022 and 2023, the Federal Reserve approved 11 rate increases for a cumulative total of 5.25% increase. AEP has\noutstanding short and long-term debt which is subject to variable rates. AEP manages interest rate risk by limiting variable-\nrate exposures to a percentage of total debt, by entering into interest rate derivative instruments and by monitoring the effects\nof market changes in interest rates. For the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, a 100 basis point change in the\nbenchmark rate on AEP’s variable rate debt would impact pretax interest expense annually by $25 million and $53 million,\nrespectively.\n40\n- THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK -\nAMERICAN ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY, INC.

following:\n• A $12 million reduction in the Excess ADIT regulatory liability at I&M as a result of I&M's Michigan base case\ntreatment of stand-alone NOLCs.\n• A $12 million decrease due to a decrease in pretax book income.\nSix Months Ended June 30, 2024 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2023\nThe major components of the decrease in Revenues were as follows:\n• Retail Revenues

of 2024 Compared to Second Quarter of 2023\nThe major components of the increase in Revenues were as follows:\n• Retail Revenues increased $28 million primarily due to:\n• An $85 million increase in rider revenues.\n• A $14 million increase in weather-related usage driven by a 129% increase in cooling degree days offset by a 38%\ndecrease in heating degree days.\n• A $6 million increase in weather-normalized revenues in the residential class, partially offset by the industrial class.\nThese increases were partially offset by:\n• A $76 million decrease due to lower customer participation in OPCo’s SSO, partially offset by higher prices.\n• Off-system Sales decreased $6 million primarily due to:\n• A $4 million decrease in sales at OVEC driven by lower volume.\n• A $2 million decrease due to 2023 PJM settlements related to winter storm Elliott.\n• Other Revenues decreased $1 million due to the following:\n• A $17 million decrease in recoverable sales of renewable energy credits.\nThis decrease was partially offset by:\n• A $13 million increase due to third-party Legacy Generation Resource Rider revenue related to the recovery of\nOVEC costs.\n82\nExpenses and Other and Income Tax Expense changed between years as follows:\n• Purchased Electricity for Resale expenses decreased $83 million primarily due to the following:\n• A $90 million decrease in recoverable auction purchases primarily due to lower volumes driven by lower customer\nparticipation in OPCo’s SSO.\n• A $19 million decrease in recoverable alternative energy rider expenses.\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\n• A $27 million increase in recoverable OVEC costs.\n• Purchased Electricity from AEP Affiliates expenses increased $14 million primarily due to increased recoverable\npurchases in OPCo’s SSO auction.\n• Other Operation and Maintenance expenses increased $34 million primarily due to the following:\n• A $17 million increase in transmission expenses primarily due to:\n• An $11 million increase in recoverable PJM expenses.\n• A $7 million increase in vegetation management expenses.\n• A $15 million increase in employee-related expenses due to the voluntary severance program.\n• A $10 million increase in distribution expenses primarily related to recoverable storm restoration costs and\nrecoverable vegetation management expenses.\n• Asset Impairments and Other Related Charges increased $53 million primarily due to Federal EPA revised CCR rules.\n• Depreciation and Amortization expenses increased $34 million primarily due to a higher depreciable base and an\nincrease in recoverable rider depreciable assets.\n• Taxes Other Than Income Taxes increased $23 million primarily due to higher property taxes driven by additional\ninvestments in transmission and distribution assets and higher tax rates.\n• Income Tax Expense decreased $14 million primarily due to a decrease in pretax book income.\nSix Months Ended June 30, 2024 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2023\nThe major components of the increase in Revenues were as follows:\n• Retail Revenues increased $3 million primarily due to:\n• A $174 million increase in rider revenues.\n• A $30 million increase in weather-related usage driven by a 129% increase in cooling degree days.\nThese increases were partially offset by:\n• A $202 million decrease due to lower customer participation in OPCo’s SSO, partially offset by higher prices.\n• Off-system Sales decreased $10 million primarily due to 2023 PJM settlements related to winter storm Elliott.\n• Other Revenues increased $14 million due to the following:\n• A $23 million increase due to third-party Legacy Generation Resource Rider revenue related to the recovery of\nOVEC costs.\nThis increase was partially offset by:\n• An $11 million decrease in recoverable sales of renewable energy credits.\nExpenses and Other and Income Tax Expense changed between years as follows:\n• Purchased Electricity for Resale expenses decreased $217 million primarily due to the following:\n• A $262 million decrease in recoverable auction purchases primarily due to lower volumes driven by lower customer\nparticipation in OPCo’s SSO, partially offset by higher prices.\n• A $16 million decrease in recoverable alternative energy rider expenses.\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\n• A $62 million increase in recoverable OVEC costs.\n• Purchased Electricity from AEP Affiliates expenses increased $61 million primarily due to increased recoverable\npurchases in OPCo’s SSO auction.\n• Other Operation and Maintenance expenses increased $71 million primarily due to the following:\n• A $44 million increase in transmission expenses primarily due to:\n• A $37 million increase in recoverable PJM expenses.\n• A $10 million increase in vegetation management expenses.\n• A $26 million increase in distribution expenses primarily due to recoverable storm restoration

decreased $9 million primarily due to a decrease in property taxes.\n• Interest Expense decreased $22 million primarily due to the following:\n• A $31 million decrease due to the recognition of debt carrying charges as a result of the IRS PLR received regarding\nthe treatment of stand-alone NOLCs in retail rate making.\nThis decrease was partially offset by:\n• A $7 million increase in carrying charges on storm-related regulatory assets due to a prior year settlement agreement in\nLouisiana.\n• Income Tax Benefit increased $174 million primarily due to the following:\n• A $109 million increase due to a reduction in Excess ADIT regulatory liabilities as a result of the IRS PLR received\nregarding the treatment of stand-alone NOLCs in retail rate making.\n• A $33 million increase due to a decrease in pretax book income.\n• A $32 million increase due to the reversal of a regulatory liability related to the merchant portion of Turk Plant Excess\nADIT as a result of the APSC's March 2024 denial of SWEPCo's request to allow the merchant portion of the Turk\nPlant to serve Arkansas customers.\n101\nSOUTHWESTERN ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY CONSOLIDATED\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING MATTERS\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.\nGeneral\nThe unaudited condensed financial statements and footnotes were prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial\ninformation and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the SEC. Accordingly, they do not\ninclude all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete annual financial statements.\nIn the opinion of management, the unaudited condensed interim financial statements reflect all normal and recurring accruals\nand adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the net income, financial position and cash flows for the interim periods for\neach Registrant. Net income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 is not necessarily indicative of results that may\nbe expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. The condensed financial statements are unaudited and should be read in\nconjunction with the audited 2023 financial statements and notes thereto, which are included in the Registrants’ Annual Reports\non Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on February 26, 2024.\nEarnings Per Share (EPS) (Applies to AEP)\nBasic EPS is calculated by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of\ncommon shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is calculated by adjusting the weighted-average outstanding\ncommon shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock awards.\nThe following table presents AEP’s basic and diluted EPS calculations included on the statements of income:\nThree Months Ended June 30,\n2024 2023\n(in millions, except per share data)\n$/share $/share\nEarnings Attributable to AEP Common Shareholders $ 340.3 $ 521.2\nWeighted-Average Number of Basic AEP Common Shares\nOutstanding 528.9 $ 0.64 514.9 $ 1.01\nWeighted-Average Dilutive Effect of Stock-Based Awards 1.2 — 1.3 —\nWeighted-Average Number of Diluted AEP Common\nShares Outstanding 530.1 $ 0.64 516.2 $ 1.01\nSix Months Ended June 30,\n2024 2023\n(in millions, except per share data)\n$/share $/share\nEarnings Attributable to AEP Common Shareholders $ 1,343.4 $ 918.2\nWeighted-Average Number of Basic AEP Common Shares\nOutstanding 527.7 $ 2.55 514.5 $ 1.78\nWeighted-Average Dilutive Effect of Stock-Based Awards 1.2 (0.01) 1.4 —\nWeighted-Average Number of Diluted AEP Common\nShares Outstanding 528.9 $ 2.54 515.9 $ 1.78\nThere were no antidilutive shares outstanding as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n109\nRestricted Cash (Applies to AEP, AEP Texas and APCo)\nRestricted Cash primarily includes funds held by trustees for the payment of securitization bonds.\nReconciliation of Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash reported within the balance sheets\nthat sum to the total of the same amounts shown on the statements of cash flows:\nJune 30, 2024\nAEP AEP Texas APCo\n(in millions)\nCash and Cash Equivalents $ 202.5 $ 0.1 $ 4.0\nRestricted Cash 45.4 29.4 15.9\nTotal Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash $ 247.9 $ 29.5 $ 19.9\nDecember 31, 2023\nAEP AEP Texas APCo\n(in millions)\nCash and Cash Equivalents $ 330.1 $ 0.1 $ 5.0\nRestricted Cash 48.9 34.0 14.9\nTotal Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash $ 379.0 $ 34.1 $ 19.9\nRevision of Previously Presented Cash Flow Amounts (Applies to I&M)\nIn the second quarter of 2024, management identified and corrected an error in I&M’s previously issued second\nquarter 2023 10-Q Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Specifically, management did not\nappropriately eliminate the acquisition of nuclear fuel which remained in accounts payable as of June 30, 2023. The\nerror resulted in an overstatement of cash flows from Operating Activities and an offsetting overstatement of cash\nflows used for the Acquisitions of Nuclear Fuel in the Investing Activities section of the Statements of Cash Flows.\nThe error also resulted in an understatement of the supplemental disclosure Acquisition of Nuclear Fuel Included in\nCurrent Liabilities. Management concluded the error was not material to I&M’s previously issued second quarter\n2023 financial statements. However, management determined the previously issued financial statements should be\nrevised. The impact of the error is reflected in the table below:\nSix Months Ended June 30, 2023\nAs Reported Adjustments As Revised\n(in millions)\nOPERATING ACTIVITIES\nAccounts Payable $ 46.8 $ (72.0) $ (25.2)\nNet Cash Flows from Operating Activities $ 501.7 $ (72.0) $ 429.7\nINVESTING ACTIVITIES\nAcquisitions of Nuclear Fuel $ (73.9) $ 72.0 $ (1.9)\nNet Cash Flows Used for Investing Activities $ (382.2) $ 72.0 $ (310.2)\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION\nAcquisition of Nuclear Fuel Included in Current Liabilities $ (36.0) $ 72.0 $ 36.0\n110\n2. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.\nManagement reviews the FASB’s standard-setting process and the SEC’s rulemaking activity to determine the relevance, if any,\nto the Registrants’ business. The following standards/rules will impact the Registrants’ financial statements.\nSEC Climate Disclosure Rule\nOn March 6, 2024, the SEC adopted final rules that require Registrants to disclose certain climate-related information in\nregistration statements and annual reports. The final rules require Registrants to disclose, among other things, material climate-\nrelated risks, activities to mitigate such risks and information about Registrant’s board of directors oversight and management’s\nrole in managing material climate-related risks. The final rules also require the Registrants to provide information related to\nany climate-related targets or goals that are material to Registrant’s business, results of operations, or financial condition. A\nmajority of the reporting requirements are applicable to the fiscal year beginning in 2025, with the addition of assurance\nreporting for GHG emissions starting in 2029 for large accelerated filers. Litigation challenging the new rules was filed by\nmultiple parties in multiple jurisdictions, which have been consolidated and assigned to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nEighth Circuit. On April 4, 2024, the SEC issued an order staying the final climate disclosure rules pending the completion of\njudicial review at the Court of Appeals. The Registrants are currently evaluating the impact of the final rules on their respective\nconsolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nASU 2023-09 “Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” (ASU 2023-09)\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, to address investors’ suggested enhancements to (a) better understand an\nentity’s exposure to potential changes in jurisdictional tax legislation and the ensuing risks and opportunities, (b) assess income\ntax information that affects cash flow forecasts and capital allocation decisions and (c) identify potential opportunities to\nincrease future cash flows.\nThe new standard requires an annual rate reconciliation disclosure of the following categories regardless of materiality: state\nand local income tax net of federal income tax effect, foreign tax effects, effect of changes in tax laws or rates enacted in the\ncurrent period, effect of cross-border tax laws, tax credits, changes in valuation allowances, nontaxable or nondeductible items\nand changes in unrecognized tax benefits.\nThe new standard also requires an annual disclosure of the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated\nby federal, state and foreign taxes and by individual jurisdictions that are equal to or greater than 5 percent of total income taxes\npaid. Disclosure of income (loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (benefit) disaggregated between\ndomestic and foreign jurisdictions and income tax expense (benefit) from continuing operations disaggregated by federal, state\nand foreign jurisdictions is required.\nThe new standard removes the requirement to disclose the cumulative amount of each type of temporary difference when a\ndeferred tax liability is not recognized because of the exceptions to comprehensive recognition of deferred taxes related to\nsubsidiaries and corporate joint ventures.\nThe amendments in the new standard may be applied on either a prospective or retrospective basis for public business entities\nfor fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted. Management has not yet made a decision to\nearly adopt the amendments to this standard or how to apply them.\n111\nASU 2023-07 “Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (ASU 2023-07)\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, to address investors’ observations that there is limited information\ndisclosed about segment expenses and to better understand expense categories and amounts included in segment profit or loss.\nThe new standard requires annual and interim disclosure of (a) the categories and amounts of significant segment expenses\n(determined by management using both qualitative and quantitative factors) that are regularly provided to the CODM and\nincluded within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, (b) the amounts and a qualitative description of “other segment\nitems”, defined as the difference between reported segment revenues less the significant segment expenses and each reported\nmeasure of segment profit or loss disclosed, (c) reportable segment profit or loss and assets that are currently only required\nannually, (d) the CODM’s title and position, and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment\nprofit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources and (e) a requirement that entities with a\nsingle reportable segment provide all disclosures required by ASU 2023-07 and all existing segment disclosures in Topic 280.\nAdditionally, this new standard allows disclosure of one or more of additional profit or loss measures if the CODM uses more\nthan one measure provided that at least one of the disclosed measures is determined in a manner “most consistent with the\nmeasurement principles under GAAP”.

RATE MATTERS\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.\nAs discussed in the 2023 Annual Report, the Registrants are involved in rate and regulatory proceedings at the FERC and their\nstate commissions. The Rate Matters note within the 2023 Annual Report should be read in conjunction with this report to gain\na complete understanding of material rate matters still pending that could impact net income, cash flows and possibly financial\ncondition. The following discusses ratemaking developments in 2024 and updates the 2023 Annual Report.\nRegulated Generating Units (Applies to AEP, PSO and SWEPCo)\nCompliance with extensive environmental regulations requires significant capital investment in environmental monitoring,\ninstallation of pollution control equipment, emission fees, disposal costs and permits. Management continuously evaluates cost\nestimates of complying with these regulations in balance with reliability and other factors, which has resulted in, and in the\nfuture may result in, a proposal to retire generating facilities earlier than their currently estimated useful lives.\nManagement is seeking or will seek regulatory recovery, as necessary, for any net book value remaining when the plants are\nretired. To the extent the net book value of these generation assets is not deemed recoverable, it could reduce future net income\nand cash flows and impact financial condition.\nRegulated Generating Units that have been Retired\nSWEPCo\nIn December 2021, the Dolet Hills Power Station was retired. As part of the 2020 Texas Base Rate Case, the PUCT authorized\nrecovery of SWEPCo’s Texas jurisdictional share of the Dolet Hills Power Station through 2046, but denied SWEPCo the\nability to earn a return on this investment resulting in a disallowance of $12 million in 2021. See the “2020 Texas Base Rate\nCase” section below for additional information. As part of the 2021 Arkansas Base Rate Case, the APSC authorized recovery\nof SWEPCo’s Arkansas jurisdictional share of the Dolet Hills Power Station through 2027, but denied SWEPCo the ability to\nearn a return on this investment resulting in a disallowance of $2 million in the second quarter of 2022. Also, the APSC did not\nrule on the prudency of the early retirement of the Dolet Hills Power Station, which will be addressed in a future proceeding.\nAs part of the 2020 Louisiana Base Rate Case, the LPSC authorized the recovery of SWEPCo’s Louisiana share of the Dolet\nHills Power Station, through a separate rider, through 2032, but did not rule on the prudency of the early retirement of the plant,\nwhich is being addressed in a separate proceeding. In April 2024, the LPSC approved a unanimous settlement agreement filed\nby SWEPCo, LPSC staff and certain intervenors that resolved the prudency of the retirement of the Dolet Hills Power Station\nand resulted in a disallowance of $14 million in the first quarter of 2024.\nIn March 2023, the Pirkey Plant was retired. As part of the 2020 Louisiana Base Rate Case, the LPSC authorized the recovery\nof SWEPCo’s Louisiana jurisdictional share of the Pirkey Plant, through a separate rider, through 2032. As part of the 2021\nArkansas Base Rate Case, the APSC granted SWEPCo regulatory asset treatment. In the 2024 SWEPCo Arkansas formula rate\nfiling, the Arkansas staff recommended that the APSC provide a return of, but not a return on, the Arkansas jurisdictional share\nof the Pirkey Plant. SWEPCo will request recovery including a weighted average cost of capital carrying charge through a\nfuture proceeding. In July 2023, Texas ALJs issued a proposal for decision that concluded the decision to retire the Pirkey\nPlant was prudent. In September 2023, the PUCT rejected the ALJs’ proposal for decision concluding the retirement of the\nPirkey Plant was prudent. In the open meeting, the commissioners expressed their concerns that the analysis in support of\nSWEPCo’s decision to retire the Pirkey Plant was not robust enough and that SWEPCo should have re-evaluated the decision\nfollowing Winter Storm Uri. The treatment of the cost of recovery of the Pirkey Plant is expected to be addressed in a future\nrate case. As of June 30, 2024, the Texas jurisdictional share of the net book value of the Pirkey Plant was $68 million. To the\nextent any portion of the Texas jurisdictional share of the net book value of the Pirkey Plant is not recoverable, it could reduce\nfuture net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nRegulated Generating Units to be Retired\nPSO\nIn 2014, PSO received final approval from the Federal EPA to close Northeastern Plant, Unit 3, in 2026. The plant was\noriginally scheduled to close in 2040. As a result of the early retirement date, PSO revised the useful life of Northeastern Plant,\nUnit 3, to the projected retirement date of 2026 and the incremental depreciation is being deferred as a regulatory asset. As\nordered by the OCC, as part of the 2022 Oklahoma Base Rate Case, PSO will continue to recover Northeastern Plant, Unit 3\nthrough 2040.\n115\nSWEPCo\nIn November 2020, management announced that it will cease using coal at the Welsh Plant in 2028. As a result of the\nannouncement, SWEPCo began recording a regulatory asset for accelerated depreciation.\nThe table below summarizes the net book value including CWIP, before cost of removal and materials and supplies, as of\nJune 30, 2024, of generating facilities planned for early retirement:\nAccelerated Projected\nNet Book Depreciation Cost of Removal Retirement Current Authorized Annual\nPlant Value Regulatory Asset Regulatory Liability Date Recovery Period Depreciation (a)\n(dollars in millions)\nNortheastern Plant, Unit 3 $ 122.8 $ 173.6 $ 20.9 (b) 2026 (c) $ 15.1\nWelsh Plant, Units 1 and 3 344.9 145.4 57.7 (d) 2028 (e) (f) 39.9\n(a) Represents the amount of annual depreciation that has been collected from customers over the prior 12-month period.\n(b) Includes Northeastern Plant, Unit 4, which was retired in 2016. Removal of Northeastern Plant, Unit 4, will be performed with the removal of\nNortheastern Plant, Unit 3, after retirement.\n(c) Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 is currently being recovered through 2040.\n(d) Includes Welsh Plant, Unit 2, which was retired in 2016. Removal of Welsh Plant, Unit 2, will be performed with the removal of Welsh Plant, Units 1\nand 3, after retirement.\n(e) Represents projected retirement date of coal assets, units are being evaluated for conversion to natural gas after 2028.\n(f) Unit 1 is being recovered through 2027 in the Louisiana jurisdiction and through 2037 in the Arkansas and Texas jurisdictions. Unit 3 is being\nrecovered through 2032 in the Louisiana jurisdiction and through 2042 in the Arkansas and Texas jurisdictions.\nDolet Hills Power Station and Related Fuel Operations (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo)\nIn December 2021, the Dolet Hills Power Station was retired. While in operation, DHLC provided 100% of the fuel supply to\nDolet Hills Power Station. The remaining book value of Dolet Hills Power Station non-fuel related assets are recoverable by\nSWEPCo through rate riders. As of June 30, 2024, SWEPCo’s share of the net investment in the Dolet Hills Power Station was\n$80 million, including materials and supplies, net of cost of removal collected in rates. Fuel costs incurred by the Dolet Hills\nPower Station are recoverable by SWEPCo through active fuel clauses and are subject to prudency determinations by the\nvarious commissions. After closure of the DHLC mining operations and the Dolet Hills Power Station, additional reclamation\nand other land-related costs incurred by DHLC and Oxbow will continue to be billed to SWEPCo and included in existing fuel\nclauses. As of June 30, 2024, SWEPCo had a net under-recovered fuel balance of $39 million, inclusive of costs related to the\nDolet Hills Power Station billed by DHLC, but excluding impacts of the February 2021 severe winter weather event.\nIn March 2021, the LPSC issued an order allowing SWEPCo to recover up to $20 million of fuel costs in 2021 and defer\napproximately $35 million of additional costs with a recovery period to be determined at a later date. In August 2022, the\nLPSC staff filed testimony recommending fuel disallowances of up to $55 million, including denial of recovery of the\n$35 million deferral, with refunds to customers over five years. In February 2024, an ALJ issued a final recommendation\nwhich included a proposed $55 million refund to customers and the denial of recovery of the $35 million deferral. SWEPCo\nfiled a motion to present oral arguments with the LPSC to dispute the ALJ’s recommendations. In April 2024, the LPSC\napproved a unanimous settlement agreement filed by SWEPCo, LPSC staff and certain intervenors that resolved the fuel\nrecovery dispute and resulted in a fuel disallowance of $11 million. The remaining $24 million regulatory asset balance will be\nrecovered over three years with interest.\nIn March 2021, the APSC approved fuel rates that provide recovery of $20 million for the Arkansas share of the 2021 Dolet\nHills Power Station fuel costs over five years through the existing fuel clause.\nIn September 2023, the PUCT approved an unopposed settlement agreement that provides recovery of $48 million of Oxbow\nmine related costs through 2035.\nIf any of these costs are not recoverable or customer refunds are required, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and\nimpact financial condition.\n116\nPirkey Plant and Related Fuel Operations (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo)\nIn March 2023, the Pirkey Plant was retired. SWEPCo is recovering, or will seek recovery of, the remaining net book value of\nPirkey Plant non-fuel costs. As of June 30, 2024, SWEPCo’s share of the net investment in the Pirkey Plant was $184 million,\nincluding materials and supplies, net of cost of removal. See the “Regulated Generating Units that have been Retired” section\nabove for additional information. Fuel costs are recovered through active fuel clauses and are subject to prudency\ndeterminations by the various commissions. As of March 31, 2023, SWEPCo fuel deliveries, including billings of all fixed\ncosts, from Sabine ceased. Additionally, as of June 30, 2024, SWEPCo had a net under-recovered fuel balance of $39 million,\ninclusive of costs related to the Pirkey Plant billed by Sabine, but excluding impacts of the February 2021 severe winter\nweather event. Remaining operational, reclamation and other land-related costs incurred by Sabine will be billed to SWEPCo\nand included in existing fuel clauses.\nIn July 2023, the LPSC ordered that a separate proceeding be established to review the prudence of the decision to retire the\nPirkey Plant, including the costs included in fuel for years starting in 2019 and after. The LPSC established a procedural\nschedule stating staff and intervenor testimony is due in November 2024 and a hearing is scheduled for March 2025.\nIn September 2023, the PUCT approved an unopposed settlement agreement that provides recovery of $33 million of Sabine\nrelated fuel costs through 2035.\nIf any of these costs are not recoverable or customer refunds are required, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and\nimpact financial condition.\nRegulatory Assets Pending Final Regulatory Approval (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo)\nAEP\nJune 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nNoncurrent Regulatory Assets (in mill ions)\nRegulatory Assets Currently Earning a Return\nWelsh Plant, Units 1 and 3 Accelerated Depreciation $ 145.4 $ 125.6\nPirkey Plant Accelerated Depreciation 117.9 114.4\nUnrecovered Winter Storm Fuel Costs (a) 83.8 97.2\nOther Regulatory Assets Pending Final Regulatory Approval 15.1 49.8\nRegulatory Assets Currently Not Earning a Return\nStorm-Related Costs 395.0 408.9\nPlant Retirement Costs – Asset Retirement Obligation Costs (b) 334.7 25.9\nNOLC Costs 75.3 —\nOther Regulatory Assets Pending Final Regulatory Approval 76.2 52.6\nTotal Regulatory Assets Pending Final Regulatory Approval $ 1,243.4 $ 874.4\n(a) Includes $37 million of unrecovered winter storm fuel costs recorded as a current regulatory asset as of June 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively.

The 2024 AEP Texas base rate case described below could result in a refund to customers\nif AEP Texas incurs a disallowance of the transmission or distribution investment on which an interim increase was based.\nManagement is unable to determine a range of potential losses, if any, that are reasonably possible of occurring. A revenue\ndecrease, including a refund of interim transmission and distribution rates, could reduce future net income and cash flows and\nimpact financial condition.\n2024 AEP Texas Base Rate Case\nIn February 2024, AEP Texas filed a request with the PUCT for a $164 million annual base rate increase over its adjusted test\nyear revenues which include interim transmission and distribution rate updates. AEP Texas’s request is based upon a proposed\n10.6% ROE with a capital structure of 55% debt and 45% common equity. The rate case seeks a prudence determination on all\ncapital additions placed in service during the period January 1, 2019 through September 30, 2023. In July 2024, AEP Texas\nfiled an unopposed settlement agreement with the PUCT. The settlement agreement includes a proposed annual revenue\nincrease of $70 million based upon a 9.76% ROE with a capital structure of 57.5% debt and 42.5% common equity. In\naddition, the settlement agreement approves the prudency of capital investments placed in service for the period January 1,\n2019 through September 30, 2023 and the associated $1.2 billion of interim revenues collected on those capital investments.\nAn order is expected in the second half of 2024. If any costs in the settlement agreement are not approved for recovery, it could\nreduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nAPCo and WPCo Rate Matters (Applies to AEP and APCo)\nENEC (Expanded Net Energy Cost) Filings\nIn January 2024, the WVPSC issued an order resolving APCo’s and WPCo’s (the Companies) 2021-2023 ENEC cases. In the\norder, the WVPSC: (a) disallowed $232 million in ENEC under-recovered costs as of February 28, 2023 ($136 million related\nto APCo) and (b) approved the recovery of $321 million of ENEC under-recovered costs as of February 28, 2023 ($174 million\nrelated to APCo) plus a 4% carrying charge rate over a ten-year recovery period starting September 1, 2024. In February 2024,\nthe Companies filed briefs with the West Virginia Supreme Court to initiate an appeal of this order. The West Virginia\nSupreme Court will hear oral arguments in September 2024 and will issue a future decision on the appeal.\nIn April 2024, the Companies submitted their annual ENEC update filing with the WVPSC proposing a $58 million annual\nincrease in ENEC rates when compared to existing ENEC rates. The Companies proposed that this ENEC rate change would\nbecome effective September 1, 2024 and would include the recovery of $321 million of ENEC under-recovered costs as of\nFebruary 28, 2023 over a ten-year period. In July 2024, intervenors and staff filed testimony with the WVPSC, which did not\nrecommend any disallowances. If any costs included in this filing are not approved for recovery, it could reduce future net\nincome and cash flows and impact financial condition.\n2023 Virginia Base Rate Case\nIn March 2024, APCo filed a request with the Virginia SCC for a $95 million annual increase in base rates based upon a\nproposed 10.8% ROE and a proposed capital structure of 51% debt and 49% common equity. The requested increase in base\nrates is primarily due to incremental rate base, proposed capital structure changes including an increase in ROE and proposed\nincreases in distribution and generation operation and maintenance expenses. In June 2024, APCo submitted an amendment to\nits Virginia base case filing with an updated request to increase annual base rates by $78 million. In July 2024, intervenors\nsubmitted testimony recommending a $14 million decrease in base rates based upon a 9.5% ROE. Staff testimony is due in\nAugust 2024 and a hearing is scheduled for September 2024. An order will be issued in the fourth quarter of 2024. If any costs\nincluded in this filing are not approved for recovery, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial\ncondition.\nETT Rate Matters (Applies to AEP)\nETT Interim Transmission Rates\nAEP has a 50% equity ownership interest in ETT. Predominantly all of ETT’s revenues are based on interim rate changes that\ncan be filed twice annually and are subject to review and possible true-up in the next base rate proceeding. Through June 30,\n2024, AEP’s share of ETT’s cumulative revenues that are subject to a prudency review is approximately $1.8 billion. A base\nrate review could produce a refund to customers if ETT incurs a disallowance of the transmission investment on which an\ninterim increase was based. A revenue decrease, including a refund of interim transmission rates, could reduce future net\n120\nincome and cash flows and impact financial condition. Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses, if any,\nthat are reasonably possible of occurring. ETT is required to file for a comprehensive rate review no later than February 1,\n2025, during which the $1.8 billion of cumulative revenues above will be subject to review.\nI&M Rate Matters (Applies to AEP and I&M)\nMichigan Power Supply Cost Recovery (PSCR)\n2020 PSCR Reconciliation\nIn February 2023, the MPSC issued an order in I&M’s 2020 PSCR Reconciliation determining that the Michigan Code of\nConduct pricing provisions apply to both the OVEC Inter-Company Power Agreement (ICPA) and I&M’s Rockport Plant UPA\nwith AEGCo. The MPSC’s decision included a $1 million disallowance of 2020 purchase power costs associated with the\nOVEC ICPA with no disallowance related to I&M's Rockport UPA with AEGCo. I&M appealed the MPSC’s decision as it\nrelates to the OVEC ICPA disallowance to the Michigan Supreme Court. In July 2024, the Michigan Supreme Court declined\nto hear I&M’s appeal.\n2021 PSCR Reconciliation\nIn April 2023, I&M received intervenor testimony in I&M’s 2021 PSCR Reconciliation for the 12-month period ending\nDecember 31, 2021 recommending disallowances of purchased power costs of $18 million associated with the OVEC ICPA\nand the Rockport Plant UPA with AEGCo that were alleged to be above market in applying the MPSC’s Code of Conduct rules.\nMichigan staff submitted testimony in I&M’s 2021 PSCR Reconciliation with no recommended disallowances for PSCR costs\nincurred, including those associated with the OVEC ICPA and the Rockport Plant UPA with AEGCo. Michigan staff also\nrecommended several options to address I&M’s shortfall in achieving Michigan’s annual one percent energy waste reduction\nsavings level, resulting in potential future disallowed costs of up to approximately $14 million. In June 2023, Michigan staff\nsubmitted rebuttal testimony to update their calculation of the 2021 market proxy price resulting in a recommended\ndisallowance of approximately $1 million related to the OVEC ICPA.\nIn April 2024, the MPSC issued an order on I&M’s 2021 PSCR Reconciliation that: (a) disallowed $1 million of purchased\npower costs associated with the OVEC ICPA that the MPSC concluded were above market, (b) disallowed $10 million of\npurchased power costs under the Rockport Plant UPA with AEGCo that the MPSC concluded were “energy only” and above\nmarket and (c) disallowed $497 thousand of PSCR costs due to I&M’s shortfall in achieving Michigan’s one percent energy\nwaste reduction savings level in 2020. In May 2024, I&M filed a petition with the MPSC requesting a rehearing of the 2021\nPSCR Reconciliation to: (a) address the method in which the disallowance of the purchased power costs under the Rockport\nPlant UPA with AEGCo was calculated, (b) explain why the disallowance was not appropriate and (c) explain how the MPSC-\nordered disallowance was inconsistent with the previous MPSC orders approving Rockport Plant costs.\n2022 PSCR Reconciliation\nIn January 2024, I&M received staff testimony in I&M’s 2022 PSCR Reconciliation for the 12-month period ending December\n31, 2022 recommending disallowances of purchased power costs of $2 million associated with the OVEC ICPA that were\nalleged to be above market in applying the MPSC’s Code of Conduct rules. Similar to the 2021 PSCR Reconciliation,\nMichigan staff also recommended several options to address I&M’s shortfall in achieving Michigan’s annual one percent\nenergy waste reduction savings level, resulting in potential future disallowed costs of up to approximately $6 million. In June\n2024, an ALJ issued a Proposal for Decision (PFD) on I&M’s 2022 PSCR Reconciliation that recommended: (a) a $2 million\ndisallowance of purchased power costs associated with the OVEC ICPA and (b) a disallowance of PSCR costs due to I&M’s\nshortfall in achieving Michigan’s one percent energy waste reduction savings level in 2022 consistent with the manner of the\n2021 PSCR Reconciliation disallowance. An MPSC order on I&M’s 2022 PSCR Reconciliation is expected in the fourth\nquarter of 2024. If any PSCR costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial\ncondition.\n2023 PSCR Reconciliation\nIn March 2024, I&M submitted its 2023 PSCR Reconciliation to the MPSC. The MPSC issued a procedural schedule with\nintervenor testimony due in October 2024. If any PSCR costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash\nflows and impact financial condition.\n121\n2023 Indiana Base Rate Case\nIn August 2023, I&M filed a request with the IURC for a $116 million annual increase in Indiana base rates based upon a 2024\nforecasted test year, a proposed 10.5% ROE and a proposed capital structure of 48.8% debt and 51.2% common equity. I&M\nproposed that the annual increase in base rates be implemented in two steps, with the first increase effective in mid-2024,\nfollowing an IURC order, and the second increase effective in January 2025. The proposed annual increase includes, but is not\nlimited to, a $41 million increase related to depreciation expense, driven by increased depreciation rates and increased capital\ninvestments, and a $15 million increase related to storm expenses. I&M’s Indiana base case filing requested recovery of certain\nhistorical period regulatory asset balances and proposed deferral accounting for certain future investments and tax related\nissues, including CAMT expense and PTCs related to the Cook Plant.\nIn December 2023, I&M and intervenors reached a settlement agreement that was submitted to the IURC recommending a\nphased-in increase in Indiana rates with a $28 million annual increase effective upon an IURC order and the remaining\n$34 million annual increase effective in January 2025 subject to I&M’s level of electric plant in service as of December 31,\n2024 in comparison to I&M’s 2024 forecasted test year. The recommended revenue increase includes: (a) a 9.85% ROE, (b) a\ntwo-step update of I&M’s Indiana capital structure with a capital structure of 50% for both debt and common equity effective\nupon an IURC order and a January 2025 update based on I&M’s actual capital structure as of December 31, 2024 with common\nequity not to exceed 51.2%, (c) a $25 million increase related to depreciation expense and (d) an $11 million increase related to\nstorm expenses. In addition, I&M also agreed to withdraw its proposal to defer CAMT and Cook Plant PTCs.\nIn May 2024, the IURC issued an order approving the settlement agreement with minor modifications.\n2023 Michigan Base Rate Case\nIn September 2023, I&M filed a request with the MPSC for a $34 million annual increase in Michigan base rates based upon a\n2024 forecasted test year, a proposed 10.5% ROE and a capital structure of 49.4% debt and 50.6% common equity. The\nproposed annual increase includes an $11 million annual increase in depreciation expense driven by increased capital\ninvestment. I&M’s Michigan base case filing requests recovery of certain historical period regulatory asset balances and\nproposes deferral accounting for certain future investments and tax related issues, including CAMT expense and PTCs related\nto the Cook Plant.\nIn July 2024, the MPSC issued a final order approving an annual base rate increase of $17 million based on a 9.86% ROE and a\ncapital structure of 52% debt and 48% common equity. The MPSC also ordered that Michigan jurisdictional Cook Plant PTCs\nwill be reflected as a deferral in I&M’s PSCR reconciliation and rejected I&M’s request to defer Michigan jurisdictional\nCAMT.\nKPCo Rate Matters (Applies to AEP)\nInvestigation of the Service, Rates and Facilities of KPCo\nIn June 2023, the KPSC issued an order directing KPCo to show cause why it should not be subject to Kentucky statutory\nremedies, including fines and penalties, for failure to provide adequate service in its service territory. The KPSC’s show cause\norder did not make any determination regarding the adequacy of KPCo’s service. In July 2023, KPCo filed a response to the\nshow cause order demonstrating that it has provided adequate service. In December 2023 and February 2024, KPCo and\ncertain intervenors filed testimony with the KPSC. In February 2024, KPCo filed a motion to strike and exclude intervenor\ntestimony. In March 2024, the KPSC denied KPCo’s February 2024 motion. The June 2024 hearing with the KPSC was\npostponed and has not yet been rescheduled. If any fines or penalties are levied against KPCo relating to the show cause order,\nit could reduce net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\n122\n2023 Kentucky Base Rate and Securitization Case\nIn June 2023, KPCo filed a request with the KPSC for a $94 million net annual increase in base rates based upon a proposed\n9.9% ROE with the increase to be implemented no earlier than January 2024. In conjunction with its June 2023 filing, KPCo\nfurther requested to finance through the issuance of securitization bonds, approximately $471 million of regulatory assets.\nKPCo’s proposal did not address the disposition of its 50% interest in Mitchell Plant, which will be addressed in the future. As\nof June 30, 2024, the net book value of KPCo’s share of the Mitchell Plant, before cost of removal including CWIP and\ninventory, was $565 million. If any of these costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and\nimpact financial condition.\nIn November 2023, KPCo filed an uncontested settlement agreement with the KPSC, that included an annual base rate increase\nof $75 million, based upon a 9.75% ROE. Settlement parties agreed that the KPSC should approve KPCo’s securitization\nrequest, and that the approximately $471 million regulatory assets requested for securitization are comprised of prudently\nincurred costs.\nIn January 2024, the KPSC issued an order modifying the November 2023 uncontested settlement agreement and approving an\nannual base rate increase of $60 million based upon a 9.75% ROE effective with billing cycles mid-January 2024. The order\nreduced KPCo’s base rate revenue requirement by $14 million to allow recovery of actual test year PJM transmission costs\ninstead of KPCo’s requested annual level of costs based on PJM 2023 projected transmission revenue requirements. In\nFebruary 2024, KPCo filed an appeal with the Commonwealth of Kentucky Franklin Circuit Court, challenging among other\naspects of the order, the $14 million base rate revenue requirement reduction.\nIn January 2024, consistent with the November 2023 uncontested settlement agreement, the KPSC issued a financing order\napproving KPCo’s request to securitize certain regulatory assets balances as of the time securitization bonds are issued and\nconcluding that costs requested for recovery through securitization were prudently incurred. The KPSC’s financing order\nincludes certain additional requirements related to securitization bond structuring, marketing, placement and issuance that were\nnot reflected in KPCo’s proposal. As a result, in January 2024, KPCo filed a request for rehearing with the KPSC to clarify\ncertain aspects of these additional requirements. In February 2024, the KPSC denied KPCo’s rehearing requests. In\naccordance with Kentucky statutory requirements and the financing order, the issuance of the securitized bonds is subject to\nfinal review by the KPSC after bond pricing. KPCo expects to proceed with the securitized bond issuance process and to\ncomplete the securitization process in the second half of 2024, subject to market conditions. As of June 30, 2024, regulatory\nasset balances expected to be recovered through securitization total $481 million and include: (a) $293 million of plant\nretirement costs, (b) $79 million of deferred storm costs related to 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 major storms, (c) $48 million of\ndeferred purchased power expenses, (d) $60 million of under-recovered purchased power rider costs and (e) $1 million of\ndeferred issuance-related expenses including KPSC advisor expenses. If any of these costs are not recoverable, it could reduce\nfuture net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nFuel Adjustment Clause (FAC) Review\nIn December 2023, KPCo received intervenor testimony in its FAC review for the two-year period ending October 31, 2022,\nrecommending a disallowance ranging from $44 million to $60 million of its total $432 million purchased power cost\nrecoveries as a result of proposed modifications to the ratemaking methodology that limits purchased power costs recoverable\nthrough the FAC. A hearing was held in February 2024 and an order is expected in the second half of 2024 If any fuel costs\nare not recoverable or refunds are ordered, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nRockport Offset Recovery\nIn January 2024, KPCo filed an application with the KPSC seeking to recover an allowed cost (Rockport Offset) of $41 million\nin accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement in the 2017 Kentucky Base Rate Case permitting KPCo to use the\nlevel of non-fuel, non-environmental Rockport Plant UPA expense included in base rates to earn its authorized ROE in 2023\nsince the Rockport UPA ended in December 2022. An estimated Rockport Offset of $23 million was recovered through a rider,\nsubject to true-up, during the 12-months ended December 2023. In February 2024, the KPSC issued an order allowing KPCo to\ncollect the remaining $18 million through interim rates, subject to refund, over twelve months starting in March 2024. In April\n2024, KPCo submitted to the KPSC a request for decision on the record. An order is expected in the second half of 2024.\nThrough the second quarter of 2024, the Rockport Offset true-up is reflected in revenues to the extent amounts have been billed\nto customers, as KPCo has not met the requirements of alternative revenue recognition in accordance with the accounting\nguidance for “Regulated Operations”. If the Rockport Offset is not recoverable or refunds are ordered, it could reduce future\nnet income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\n123\nOPCo Rate Matters (Applies to AEP and OPCo)\nOVEC Cost Recovery Audits\nIn December 2021, as part of OVEC cost recovery audits pending before the PUCO, intervenors filed positions claiming that\ncosts incurred by OPCo during the 2018-2019 audit period were imprudent and should be disallowed. In May 2022,\nintervenors filed for rehearing on the 2016-2017 OVEC cost recovery audit period claiming the PUCO’s April 2022 order to\nadopt the findings of the audit report were unjust, unlawful and unreasonable for multiple reasons, including the position that\nOPCo recovered imprudently incurred costs. In June 2022, the PUCO granted rehearing on the 2016-2017 audit period for\npurposes of further consideration.\nIn May 2023, as part of the OVEC cost recovery audits pending before the PUCO, intervenors filed positions claiming that\ncosts incurred by OPCo during the 2020 audit period were imprudent and should be disallowed. A hearing was held in\nNovember 2023. In the first quarter of 2024, post-hearing briefs were filed by the parties and the case currently awaits a\ndecision on the merits.\nManagement disagrees with the intervenors’ claims and is unable to predict the impact of these disputes. If any costs are\ndisallowed or refunds are ordered, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nOhio ESP Filings\nIn January 2023, OPCo filed an application with the PUCO to approve an ESP that included proposed rate adjustments,\nproposed new riders and the continuation and modification of certain existing riders, including the DIR, effective June 2024\nthrough May 2030. The proposal includes a return on common equity of 10.65% on capital costs for certain riders. In June\n2023, intervenors filed testimony opposing OPCo’s plan for various new riders and modifications to existing riders, including\nthe DIR. In September 2023, OPCo and certain intervenors filed a settlement agreement with the PUCO addressing the ESP\napplication. The settlement included a four year term from June 2024 through May 2028, an ROE of 9.7% and continuation of\na number of riders including the DIR subject to revenue caps. In April 2024, the PUCO issued an order approving the\nsettlement agreement. In May 2024, intervenors filed an application for rehearing with the PUCO on the approved settlement\nagreement and in response OPCo filed an opposition to rehearing. In June 2024, the PUCO denied the intervenors’ application\nfor rehearing.\nPSO Rate Matters (Applies to AEP and PSO)\n2024 Oklahoma Base Rate Case\nIn January 2024, PSO filed a request with the OCC for a $218 million annual base rate increase based upon a 10.8% ROE with\na capital structure of 48.9% debt and 51.1% common equity. PSO requested an expanded transmission cost recovery rider and\na mechanism to recover generation costs necessary to comply with SPP’s 2023 increased capacity planning reserve margin\nrequirements. PSO’s request includes the 155 MW Rock Falls Wind Facility and reflects recovery of Northeastern Plant, Unit\n3 through 2040.\nIn July 2024, OCC staff and various intervenors filed testimony. The OCC staff recommended a $115 million annual base rate\nincrease based upon a 9.3% ROE while intervenors recommended an annual base rate increase ranging from $19 million to\n$113 million based on an ROE ranging from 9.0% to 9.6%. The OCC staff also recommended a $62 million disallowance of\ncertain capital investments. In addition, a certain intervenor recommended the OCC reject PSO’s request to recover the Rock\nFalls Wind Facility through base rates, but allow PSO to retain PTCs and energy revenues up to the Rock Falls Wind Facility\nannual revenue requirement. A hearing is scheduled for September 2024 and an order is expected in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nIf any costs included in this filing are not approved for recovery, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact\nfinancial condition.\nSWEPCo Rate Matters (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo)\n2012 Texas Base Rate Case\nIn 2012, SWEPCo filed a request with the PUCT to increase annual base rates primarily due to the completion of the Turk\nPlant. In 2013, the PUCT issued an order affirming the prudence of the Turk Plant but determined that the Turk Plant’s Texas\njurisdictional capital cost cap established in a previous Certificate of Convenience and Necessity case also limited SWEPCo’s\nrecovery of AFUDC in addition to limits on its recovery of cash construction costs.\nUpon rehearing in 2014, the PUCT reversed its initial ruling and determined that AFUDC was excluded from the Turk Plant’s\nTexas jurisdictional capital cost cap. As a result, SWEPCo reversed $114 million of a previously recorded regulatory\ndisallowance in 2013. In 2017, the Texas District Court upheld the PUCT’s 2014 order and intervenors filed appeals with the\nTexas Third Court of Appeals.\n124\nIn August 2021, the Texas Third Court of Appeals reversed the Texas District Court judgment affirming the PUCT’s order on\nAFUDC, concluding that the language of the PUCT’s original 2008 order intended to include AFUDC in the Texas\njurisdictional capital cost cap and remanded the case to the PUCT for future proceedings. In November 2021, SWEPCo and the\nPUCT submitted Petitions for Review with the Texas Supreme Court. In October 2022, the Texas Supreme Court denied the\nPetitions for Review submitted by SWEPCo and the PUCT. In December 2022, SWEPCo and the PUCT filed requests for\nrehearing with the Texas Supreme Court. In June 2023, the Texas Supreme Court denied SWEPCo’s request for rehearing and\nthe case was remanded to the PUCT for future proceedings. In October 2023, SWEPCo filed testimony with the PUCT in the\nremanded proceeding recommending no refund or disallowance.\nOn December 14, 2023, the PUCT approved a preliminary order stating the PUCT will not address SWEPCo’s request that\nwould allow the PUCT to find cause to allow SWEPCo to exceed the Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap in the current remand\nproceeding. As a result of the PUCT’s approval of the preliminary order, SWEPCo believes it is probable the PUCT will\ndisallow capitalized AFUDC in excess of the Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap and recorded a pretax, non-cash disallowance\nof $86 million. Such determination may reduce SWEPCo’s future revenues by approximately $15 million on an annual basis.\nOn December 21, 2023, SWEPCo filed a motion with the PUCT for reconsideration of the preliminary order. In January 2024,\nthe PUCT denied the motion for reconsideration of the preliminary order.\nThe PUCT’s December 2023 approval of the preliminary order determined that it will address, in the ongoing PUCT remand\nproceeding, any potential revenue refunds to customers that may be required by future PUCT orders. In January 2024, the\nPUCT established a procedural schedule for the remand proceeding. On March 1, 2024, SWEPCo filed supplemental direct\ntestimony with the PUCT in response to the December 2023 preliminary order. On March 8, 2024, intervenors and the PUCT\nstaff filed a motion with the PUCT to strike portions of SWEPCo’s October 2023 direct testimony and March 2024\nsupplemental direct testimony. On March 19, 2024, The ALJ granted portions of the motion, which included removal of\ntestimony supporting SWEPCo’s position that refunds were not appropriate. On March 28, 2024, SWEPCo filed an appeal of\nthe ALJ decision with the PUCT. In April 2024, intervenors and PUCT staff submitted testimony recommending customer\nrefunds through December 2023 ranging from $149 million to $197 million, including carrying charges, with refund periods\nranging from 18 months to 48 months. In May 2024, the PUCT denied SWEPCo’s appeal of the ALJ’s March 2024 decision.\nIn the second quarter of 2024, based on the PUCT’s decision, SWEPCo recorded a one-time, probable revenue refund provision\nof $160 million, including interest, associated with revenue collected from February 2013 through December 2023. The\n$160 million revenue refund provision represents management’s best estimate based on the range of probable refunds between\n$104 million and $197 million, including interest. In June 2024, SWEPCo and parties to the remand proceeding reached an\nagreement in principle that would resolve all issues in the case. The settlement is expected to be filed and considered by the\nPUCT in the third quarter of 2024.\n2016 Texas Base Rate Case\nIn 2016, SWEPCo filed a request with the PUCT for a net increase in Texas annual revenues of $69 million based upon a 10%\nROE. In January 2018, the PUCT issued a final order approving a net increase in Texas annual revenues of $50 million based\nupon a 9.6% ROE, effective May 2017. The final order also included: (a) approval to recover the Texas jurisdictional share of\nenvironmental investments placed in-service, as of June 30, 2016, at various plants, including Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3, (b)\napproval of recovery of, but no return on, the Texas jurisdictional share of the net book value of Welsh Plant, Unit 2, (c)\napproval of $2 million in additional vegetation management expenses and (d) the rejection of SWEPCo’s proposed transmission\ncost recovery mechanism.\nAs a result of the final order, in 2017 SWEPCo: (a) recorded an impairment charge of $19 million, which included $7 million\nassociated with the lack of return on Welsh Plant, Unit 2 and $12 million related to other disallowed plant investments, (b)\nrecognized $32 million of additional revenues, for the period of May 2017 through December 2017, that was surcharged to\ncustomers in 2018 and (c) recognized an additional $7 million of expenses consisting primarily of depreciation expense and\nvegetation management expense, offset by the deferral of rate case expense. SWEPCo implemented new rates in February\n2018 billings. The $32 million of additional 2017 revenues was collected during 2018. In March 2018, the PUCT clarified and\ncorrected portions of the final order, without changing the overall decision or amounts of the rate change. The order has been\nappealed by various intervenors related to limiting SWEPCo’s recovery of AFUDC on Turk Plant and recovery of Welsh Plant,\nUnit 2. If certain parts of the PUCT order are overturned, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial\ncondition.\n125\n2020 Texas Base Rate Case\nIn October 2020, SWEPCo filed a request with the PUCT for a $105 million annual increase in Texas base rates based upon a\nproposed 10.35% ROE. The request would move transmission and distribution interim revenues recovered through riders into\nbase rates. Eliminating these riders would result in a net annual requested base rate increase of $90 million primarily due to\nincreased investments. SWEPCo subsequently filed a request with the PUCT lowering the requested annual increase in Texas\nbase rates to $100 million, which would result in an $85 million net annual base rate increase after moving the proposed riders\nto rate base.\nIn January 2022, the PUCT issued a final order approving an annual revenue increase of $39 million based upon a 9.25% ROE.\nThe order also includes: (a) rates implemented retroactively back to March 18, 2021, (b) $5 million of the proposed increase\nrelated to vegetation management, (c) $2 million annually to establish a storm catastrophe reserve and (d) the creation of a rider\nto recover the Dolet Hills Power Station as if it were in rate base until its retirement at the end of 2021 and starting in 2022 the\nremaining net book value to be recovered as a regulatory asset through 2046. As a result of the final order, SWEPCo recorded\na disallowance of $12 million in 2021 associated with the lack of return on the Dolet Hills Power Station. In February 2022,\nSWEPCo filed a motion for rehearing with the PUCT challenging several errors in the order, which include challenges of the\napproved ROE, the denial of a reasonable return or carrying costs on the Dolet Hills Power Station and the calculation of the\nTexas jurisdictional share of the storm catastrophe reserve. In April 2022, the PUCT denied the motion for rehearing. In May\n2022, SWEPCo filed a petition for review with the Texas District Court seeking judicial review of the several errors challenged\nin the PUCT’s final order.\n2021 Louisiana Storm Cost Filing\nIn 2020, Hurricanes Laura and Delta caused power outages and extensive damage to the SWEPCo service territories, primarily\nimpacting the Louisiana jurisdiction. Following both hurricanes, the LPSC issued orders allowing Louisiana utilities, including\nSWEPCo, to establish regulatory assets to track and defer expenses associated with these storms. In February 2021, severe\nwinter weather impacted the Louisiana jurisdiction and in March 2021, the LPSC approved the deferral of incremental storm\nrestoration expenses related to the winter storm. In March 2023, SWEPCo and the LPSC staff filed a joint stipulation and\nsettlement agreement with the LPSC, which confirmed the prudency of $150 million of deferred incremental storm restoration\nexpenses. The agreement also authorized an interim carrying charge at a rate of 3.125% through March 2024. In April 2023,\nthe LPSC issued an order approving the stipulation and settlement agreement. In July 2023, SWEPCo submitted additional\ninformation in phase two of this proceeding to obtain a financing order and prudency review of capital investment. In April\n2024, SWEPCo and the LPSC staff filed a joint uncontested stipulation and settlement agreement with the LPSC requesting\nsecuritization of storm costs, including a storm reserve. In July 2024, the LPSC issued an order approving the joint uncontested\nstipulation and settlement agreement, including approval to securitize $343 million, which includes $180 million for storm costs\nand a $150 million storm reserve.\nFebruary 2021 Severe Winter Weather Impacts in SPP\nIn February 2021, severe winter weather had a significant impact in SPP, resulting in significantly increased market prices for\nnatural gas power plants to meet reliability needs for the SPP electric system. For the time period of February 9, 2021 to\nFebruary 20, 2021, SWEPCo’s natural gas expenses and purchases of electricity still to be recovered from customers are shown\nin the table below:\nApproved Recovery Approved Carrying\nJurisdiction June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Period Charge\n(in millions)\nArkansas $ 45.0 $ 54.2 6 years (a)\nLouisiana 83.8 97.2 (b) (b)\nTexas 87.9 101.9 5 years 1.65%\nTotal $ 216.7 $ 253.3\n(a) SWEPCo is permitted to record carrying costs on the unrecovered balance of fuel costs at a weighted-cost of capital approved\nby the APSC. The APSC will conclude an audit of these costs in 2024. A hearing was held in June 2024.\n(b) In March 2021, the LPSC approved a special order granting a temporary modification to the FAC and shortly after SWEPCo\nbegan recovery of its Louisiana jurisdictional share of these fuel costs based on a five-year recovery period inclusive of an\ninterim carrying charge equal to the prime rate. The special order states the fuel and purchased power costs incurred will be\nsubject to a future LPSC audit.\nIf SWEPCo is unable to recover any of the costs relating to the extraordinary fuel and purchases of electricity, or obtain\nauthorization of a reasonable carrying charge on these costs, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact\nfinancial condition.\n126\nPSO and SWEPCo Rate Matters (Applies to AEP, PSO and SWEPCo)\nNorth Central Wind Energy Facilities\nThe NCWF are subject to various regulatory performance requirements, including a Net Capacity Factor (NCF) guarantee. The\nNCF guarantee will be measured in MWhs across all facilities on a combined basis for each five year period for the first thirty\nfull years of operation. The first NCF guarantee five year period began in April 2022. Certain wind turbines have experienced\nperformance issues related to defects covered by the manufacturer’s warranty. These performance issues have prompted PSO\nand SWEPCo to file a lawsuit against the manufacturer in an attempt to find a resolution on the matter. If regulatory\nperformance requirements, such as the NCF guarantee, are not met, PSO and SWEPCo may recognize a regulatory liability to\nrefund retail customers. Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that is reasonably possible of occurring.\nFERC Rate Matters\nIndependence Energy Connection Project (Applies to AEP)\nIn 2016, PJM approved the Independence Energy Connection Project (IEC) and included it in its Regional Transmission\nExpansion Plan to alleviate congestion. Transource Energy has an ownership interest in the IEC, which is located in Maryland\nand Pennsylvania. In June 2020, the Maryland Public Service Commission approved a Certificate of Public Convenience and\nNecessity to construct the portion of the IEC in Maryland. In May 2021, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission\n(PAPUC) denied the IEC certificate for siting and construction of the portion in Pennsylvania. Transource Energy appealed the\nPAPUC ruling in Pennsylvania state court and challenged the ruling before the United States District Court for the Middle\nDistrict of Pennsylvania. In May 2022, the Pennsylvania state court issued an order affirming the PAPUC decision as to state\nlaw claims. In December 2023, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania granted summary\njudgment in favor of Transource Energy, finding that the PAPUC decision violated federal law and the United States\nConstitution. In January 2024, the PAPUC filed an appeal of the district court’s grant of summary judgment with the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Additional regulatory proceedings before the PAPUC are expected to resume in\nthe fourth quarter of 2024 or in 2025.\nIn September 2021, PJM notified Transource Energy that the IEC was suspended to allow for the regulatory and related appeals\nprocess to proceed in an orderly manner without breaching milestone dates in the project agreement. At that time, PJM stated\nthat the IEC has not been cancelled and remains necessary to alleviate congestion. PJM continues to evaluate reliability and\nmarket efficiency in the area. As of June 30, 2024, AEP’s share of IEC capital expenditures was approximately $94 million,\nlocated in Total Property, Plant and Equipment - Net on AEP’s balance sheets. The FERC has previously granted abandonment\nbenefits for this project, allowing the full recovery of prudently incurred costs if the project is cancelled for reasons outside the\ncontrol of Transource Energy. If any of the IEC costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and\nimpact financial condition.\nRequest to Update AEGCo Depreciation Rates (Applies to AEP and I&M)\nIn October 2022, AEP, on behalf of AEGCo, submitted proposed revisions to AEGCo’s depreciation rates for its 50%\nownership interest in Rockport Plant, Unit 1 and Unit 2, reflected in the UPA between AEGCo and I&M. The proposed\ndepreciation rates for these assets reflect an estimated 2028 retirement date for the Rockport Plant. AEGCo’s previous FERC-\napproved depreciation rates for Rockport Plant, Unit 1 were based upon a December 31, 2028 estimated retirement date while\nAEGCo’s previous FERC-approved depreciation rates for Rockport Plant, Unit 2 leasehold improvements were based upon a\nDecember 31, 2022 estimated retirement date in conjunction with the termination of the Rockport Plant, Unit 2 lease.\nIn December 2022, the FERC issued an order approving the proposed AEGCo Rockport depreciation rates effective January 1,\n2023, subject to further review and a potential refund. In August 2023, AEGCo reached a settlement agreement with the FERC\ntrial staff that resolved all issues set for hearing. In September 2023, the settlement agreement was certified to the FERC as\nuncontested. In March 2024, the FERC issued an order approving the uncontested settlement agreement. The results of the\norder did not have a material impact on financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nFERC 2021 PJM and SPP Transmission Formula Rate Challenge (Applies to AEP, AEPTCo, APCo, I&M, PSO and\nSWEPCo)\nThe Registrants transitioned to stand-alone treatment of NOLCs in its PJM and SPP transmission formula rates beginning with\nthe 2022 projected transmission revenue requirements and 2021 true-up to actual transmission revenue requirements, and\nprovided notice of this change in informational filings made with the FERC. Stand-alone treatment of the NOLCs for\ntransmission formula rates increased the annual revenue requirements for years 2024, 2023, 2022 and 2021 by $52 million,\n$60 million, $69 million and $78 million, respectively.\n127\nIn January 2024, the FERC issued two orders granting formal challenges by certain unaffiliated customers related to stand-\nalone treatment of NOLCs in the 2021 Transmission Formula Rates of the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within PJM\nand SPP. The FERC directed the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within PJM and SPP to provide refunds with interest\non all amounts collected for the 2021 rate year, and for such refunds to be reflected in the annual update for the next rate year.\nIn February 2024, AEPSC on behalf of the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within PJM and SPP filed requests for\nrehearing. In March 2024, the FERC denied AEPSC’s requests for rehearing of the January 2024 orders by operation of law\nand stated it may address the requests for rehearing in future orders. In March 2024, AEPSC submitted refund compliance\nreports to the FERC, which preserve the non-finality of the FERC’s January 2024 orders pending further proceedings on\nrehearing and appeal. In April 2024, AEPSC made filings with the FERC which request that the FERC: (a) reopen the record\nso that the FERC may take the IRS PLRs received in April 2024 regarding the treatment of stand-alone NOLCs in ratemaking\ninto evidence and consider them in substantive orders on rehearing and (b) stay its January 2024 orders and related compliance\nfilings and refunds to provide time for consideration of the April 2024 IRS PLRs. In May 2024, AEPSC filed a petition for\nreview with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit seeking review of the FERC’s January 2024\nand March 2024 decisions. In July 2024, the FERC issued orders approving AEPSC’s request to reopen the record for the\nlimited purpose of accepting into the record the IRS PLRs and establish additional briefing procedures. AEPSC is required to\nfile briefs with the FERC in the third quarter of 2024.\nAs a result of the January 2024 FERC orders, the Registrants’ balance sheets reflect a liability for the probable refund of all\nNOLC revenues included in transmission formula rates for years 2024, 2023, 2022 and 2021, with interest. The Registrants\nhave not yet been directed to make cash refunds related to the 2024, 2023 or 2022 rate years. The probable refunds to affiliated\nand nonaffiliated customers are reflected as Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities on the balance sheets, with the\nexception of amounts expected to be refunded within one year which are reflected in Other Current Liabilities. Refunds\nprobable to be received by affiliated companies, resulting in a reduction to affiliated transmission expense, were deferred as an\nincrease to Regulatory Liabilities or a reduction to Regulatory Assets on the balance sheets where management expects that\nrefunds would be returned to retail customers through authorized retail jurisdiction rider mechanisms.\nRequest to Update SWEPCo Generation Depreciation Rates (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo)\nIn October 2023, SWEPCo filed an application to revise its generation wholesale customer’s contracts to reflect an increase in\nthe annual revenue requirement of approximately $5 million for updated depreciation rates and allow for the return on and of\nFERC customers jurisdictional share of regulatory assets associated with retired plants. In November 2023, certain intervenors\nfiled a motion with the FERC protesting and recommending the rejection of SWEPCo’s filings. In December 2023, the FERC\nissued an order approving the proposed rates effective January 1, 2024, subject to further review and refund and established\nhearing and settlement proceedings. If SWEPCo is unable to recover the remaining regulatory assets associated with retired\nplants, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\n128\n5. COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.\nThe Registrants are subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the\nRegistrants’ business activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the\nenvironment. The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against the Registrants cannot be\npredicted. Management accrues contingent liabilities only when management concludes that it is both probable that a liability\nhas been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When\nmanagement determines that it is not probable, but rather reasonably possible that a liability has been incurred at the date of the\nfinancial statements, management discloses such contingencies and the possible loss or range of loss if such estimate can be\nmade. Any estimated range is based on currently available information and involves elements of judgment and significant\nuncertainties. Any estimated range of possible loss may not represent the maximum possible loss exposure. Circumstances\nchange over time and actual results may vary significantly from estimates.\nFor current proceedings not specifically discussed below, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising\nfrom such proceedings would have a material effect on the financial statements. The Commitments, Guarantees and\nContingencies note within the 2023 Annual Report should be read in conjunction with this report.\nGUARANTEES\nLiabilities for guarantees are recorded in accordance with the accounting guidance for “Guarantees.” There is no collateral held\nin relation to any guarantees. In the event any guarantee is drawn, there is no recourse to third-parties unless specified below.\nLetters of Credit (Applies to AEP, AEP Texas and APCo)\nStandby letters of credit are entered into with third-parties. These letters of credit are issued in the ordinary course of business\nand cover items such as natural gas and electricity risk management contracts, construction contracts, insurance programs,\nsecurity deposits and debt service reserves.\nIn March 2024, AEP increased its $4 billion revolving credit facility to $5 billion and extended the due date from March 2027\nto March 2029. Also, in March 2024, AEP extended the due date of its $1 billion revolving credit facility from March 2025 to\nMarch 2027. AEP may issue up to $1.2 billion as letters of credit under these revolving credit facilities on behalf of\nsubsidiaries. As of June 30, 2024, no letters of credit were issued under either revolving credit facility.\nAn uncommitted facility gives the issuer of the facility the right to accept or decline each request made under the facility. AEP\nissues letters of credit on behalf of subsidiaries under six uncommitted facilities totaling $450 million. The Registrants’\nmaximum future payments for letters of credit issued under the uncommitted facilities as of June 30, 2024 were as follows:\nCompany Amount Maturity\n(in millions)\nAEP $ 244.5 July 2024 to July 2025\nAEP Texas 1.8 July 2025\nAPCo 6.3 July 2024\nIndemnifications and Other Guarantees\nContracts\nThe Registrants enter into certain types of contracts which require indemnifications. Typically these contracts include, but are\nnot limited to, sale agreements, lease agreements, purchase agreements and financing agreements. Generally, these agreements\nmay include, but are not limited to, indemnifications around certain tax, contractual and environmental matters. With respect to\nsale agreements, exposure generally does not exceed the sale price. As of June 30, 2024, there were no material liabilities\nrecorded for any indemnifications.\nAEPSC conducts power purchase-and-sale activity on behalf of APCo, I&M, KPCo and WPCo, who are jointly and severally\nliable for activity conducted on their behalf. AEPSC also conducts power purchase-and-sale activity on behalf of PSO and\nSWEPCo, who are jointly and severally liable for activity conducted on their behalf.\n129\nMaster Lease Agreements (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo)\nThe Registrants lease certain equipment under master lease agreements. Under the lease agreements, the lessor is guaranteed a\nresidual value up to a stated percentage of the equipment cost at the end of the lease term. If the actual fair value of the leased\nequipment is below the guaranteed residual value at the end of the lease term, the Registrants are committed to pay the\ndifference between the actual fair value and the residual value guarantee. Historically, at the end of the lease term the fair value\nhas been in excess of the amount guaranteed. As of June 30, 2024, the maximum potential loss by the Registrants for these\nlease agreements assuming the fair value of the equipment is zero at the end of the lease term was as follows:\nMaximum\nCompany Potential Loss\n(in millions)\nAEP $ 44.6\nAEP Texas 10.6\nAPCo 5.9\nI&M 4.2\nOPCo 7.0\nPSO 4.4\nSWEPCo 5.1\nENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCIES (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo)\nFederal EPA’s Revised CCR Rule\nIn April 2024, the Federal EPA finalized revisions to the CCR Rule to expand the scope of the rule to include inactive\nimpoundments at inactive facilities (“legacy CCR surface impoundments”) as well as to establish requirements for currently\nexempt solid waste management units that involve the direct placement of CCR on the land (“CCR management units”). The\nFederal EPA is requiring that owners and operators of legacy surface impoundments comply with all of the existing CCR Rule\nrequirements applicable to inactive CCR surface impoundments at active facilities, except for the location restrictions and liner\ndesign criteria. The rule establishes compliance deadlines for legacy surface impoundments to meet regulatory requirements,\nincluding a requirement to initiate closure within five years after the effective date of the final rule. The rule requires\nevaluations to be completed at both active facilities and inactive facilities with one or more legacy surface impoundments.\nClosure may be accomplished by applying an impermeable cover system over the CCR material (“closure in place”) or the CCR\nmaterial may be excavated and placed in a compliant landfill (“closure by removal”). Groundwater monitoring and other\nanalysis over the next three years will provide additional information on the planned closure method. AEP evaluated the\napplicability of the rule to current and former plant sites and recorded incremental ARO in the second quarter of 2024, as shown\nin the table below, based on initial cost estimates primarily reflecting compliance with the rule through closure in place and\nfuture groundwater monitoring requirements pursuant to the CCR Rule.\nIncrease in Generation Increase in Regulatory Charged to Operating\nRegistrant Increase in ARO Property (a) Assets (b) Expenses (c)\n(in millions)\nAPCo $ 312.2 $ 75.6 $ 236.6 $ —\nI&M 85.7 — 72.3 13.4\nOPCo 52.9 — — 52.9\nPSO 33.7 33.7 — —\nSWEPCo 23.8 23.8 — —\nNon-Registrants 166.1 43.8 46.1 76.2\nTotal $ 674.4 $ 176.9 $ 355.0 $ 142.5\n(a) ARO is related to a legacy CCR surface impoundment or CCR management unit at an operating generation facility.\n(b) ARO is related to a legacy CCR surface impoundment or CCR management unit at a retired generation facility and recognition of a\nregulatory asset in accordance with the accounting guidance for “Regulated Operations” is supported.\n(c) ARO is related to a legacy CCR surface impoundment or CCR management unit and recognition of a regulatory asset in accordance\nwith the accounting guidance for “Regulated Operations” is not yet supported.\n130\nAs further groundwater monitoring and other analysis is performed, management expects to refine the assumptions and\nunderlying cost estimates used in recording the ARO. These refinements may include, but are not limited to, changes in the\nexpected method of closure, changes in estimated quantities of CCR at each site, the identification of new CCR management\nunits, among other items. These future changes could have a material impact on the ARO and materially reduce future net\nincome and cash flows and further impact financial condition.\nAEP will seek cost recovery through regulated rates, including proposal of new regulatory mechanisms for cost recovery where\nexisting mechanisms are not applicable. The rule could have an additional, material adverse impact on net income, cash flows\nand financial condition if AEP cannot ultimately recover these additional costs of compliance. In June 2024, a third-party filed\na petition for review of the rule with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Management is also evaluating potential\nlegal challenges to the revised rule.\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (Superfund) and State Remediation\nBy-products from the generation of electricity include materials such as ash, slag, sludge, low-level radioactive waste and\nSNF. Coal combustion by-products, which constitute the overwhelming percentage of these materials, are typically treated and\ndeposited in captive disposal facilities or are beneficially utilized. In addition, the generation plants and transmission and\ndistribution facilities have used asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls and other hazardous and non-hazardous materials. The\nRegistrants currently incur costs to dispose of these substances safely. For remediation processes not specifically discussed,\nmanagement does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such remediation processes would have a material effect\non the financial statements.\nNUCLEAR CONTINGENCIES (Applies to AEP and I&M)\nI&M owns and operates the Cook Plant under licenses granted by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. I&M has a significant\nfuture financial commitment to dispose of SNF and to safely decommission and decontaminate the plant. The licenses to\noperate the two nuclear units at the Cook Plant expire in 2034 and 2037. Management is currently evaluating applying for\nlicense extensions for both units. The operation of a nuclear facility also involves special risks, potential liabilities and specific\nregulatory and safety requirements. By agreement, I&M is partially liable, together with all other electric utility companies that\nown nuclear generation units, for a nuclear power plant incident at any nuclear plant in the U.S. Should a nuclear incident\noccur at any nuclear power plant in the U.S., the resultant liability could be substantial.\nOPERATIONAL CONTINGENCIES\nInsurance and Potential Losses\nThe Registrants maintain insurance coverage normal and customary for electric utilities, subject to various deductibles. The\nRegistrants also maintain property and casualty insurance that may cover certain physical damage or third-party injuries caused\nby cybersecurity incidents. Insurance coverage includes all risks of physical loss or damage to nonnuclear assets, subject to\ninsurance policy conditions and exclusions. Covered property generally includes power plants, substations, facilities and\ninventories. Excluded property generally includes transmission and distribution lines, poles and towers. The insurance\nprograms also generally provide coverage against loss arising from certain claims made by third-parties and are in excess of\nretentions absorbed by the Registrants. Coverage is generally provided by a combination of the protected cell of EIS and/or\nvarious industry mutual and/or commercial insurance carriers.\nIn July 2024, the Registrants renewed insurance programs including coverage for wildfire liability. Some potential losses or\nliabilities may not be insurable or the amount of insurance carried may not be sufficient to meet potential losses and liabilities,\nincluding, but not limited to, liabilities relating to a cybersecurity incident, wildfire related liabilities or damage to the Cook\nPlant and costs of replacement power in the event of an incident at the Cook Plant. Future losses or liabilities, if they occur,\nwhich are not completely insured, unless recovered from customers, could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact\nfinancial condition.\nLitigation Related to Ohio House Bill 6 (HB 6) (Applies to AEP and OPCo)\nIn 2019, Ohio adopted and implemented HB 6 which benefits OPCo by authorizing rate recovery for certain costs including\nrenewable energy contracts and OVEC’s coal-fired generating units. OPCo engaged in lobbying efforts and provided testimony\nduring the legislative process in connection with HB 6. In July 2020, an investigation led by the U.S. Attorney’s Office\nresulted in a federal grand jury indictment of an Ohio legislator and associates in connection with an alleged racketeering\nconspiracy involving the adoption of HB 6. After AEP learned of the criminal allegations against the Ohio legislator and others\nrelating to HB 6, AEP, with assistance from outside advisors, conducted a review of the circumstances surrounding the passage\nof the bill. Management does not believe that AEP was involved in any wrongful conduct in connection with the passage of\nHB 6.\n131\nIn August 2020, an AEP shareholder filed a putative class action lawsuit in the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of\nOhio against AEP and certain of its officers for alleged violations of securities laws. In December 2021, the district court\nissued an opinion and order dismissing the securities litigation complaint with prejudice, determining that the complaint failed\nto plead any actionable misrepresentations or omissions. The plaintiffs did not appeal the ruling.\nIn January 2021, an AEP shareholder filed a derivative action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio\npurporting to assert claims on behalf of AEP against certain AEP officers and directors. In February 2021, a second AEP\nshareholder filed a similar derivative action in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, Ohio. In April 2021, a third\nAEP shareholder filed a similar derivative action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio and a fourth AEP\nshareholder filed a similar derivative action in the Supreme Court for the State of New York, Nassau County. These derivative\ncomplaints allege the officers and directors made misrepresentations and omissions similar to those alleged in the putative\nsecurities class action lawsuit filed against AEP. The derivative complaints (collectively, the “Derivative Actions”) together\nassert claims for: (a) breach of fiduciary duty, (b) waste of corporate assets, (c) unjust enrichment, (d) breach of duty for insider\ntrading and (e) contribution for violations of sections 10(b) and 21D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and seek monetary\ndamages and changes to AEP’s corporate governance and internal policies among other forms of relief. The court entered a\nscheduling order in the New York state court derivative action staying the case other than with respect to briefing the motion to\ndismiss. AEP filed substantive and forum-based motions to dismiss in April 2022. In June 2022, the Ohio state court entered\nan order continuing the stays of that case until the final resolution of the consolidated derivative actions pending in Ohio federal\ndistrict court. In September 2022, the New York state court granted the forum-based motion to dismiss with prejudice and the\nplaintiff subsequently filed a notice of appeal with the New York appellate court. In January 2023, the New York plaintiff filed\na motion to intervene in the pending Ohio federal court action and withdrew his appeal in New York. The two derivative\nactions pending in federal district court in Ohio have been consolidated and the plaintiffs in the consolidated action filed an\namended complaint. AEP filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint and subsequently filed a brief in opposition to the\nNew York plaintiffs’ motion to intervene in the consolidated action in Ohio. In March 2023, the federal district court issued an\norder granting the motion to dismiss with prejudice and denying the New York plaintiffs’ motion to intervene. In April 2023,\none of the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit of the Ohio federal district court\norder dismissing the consolidated action and denying the intervention.\nIn March 2021, AEP received a litigation demand letter from counsel representing a purported AEP shareholder. The litigation\ndemand letter was directed to the Board of Directors of AEP (AEP Board) and contained factual allegations involving HB 6 that\nwere generally consistent with those in the derivative litigation filed in state and federal court. The shareholder that sent the\nletter has since withdrawn the litigation demand, which is now terminated and of no further effect. In April 2023, AEP received\na litigation demand letter from counsel representing the purported AEP shareholder who had filed the dismissed derivative\naction in New York state court and unsuccessfully tried to intervene in the consolidated derivative actions in Ohio federal court\nthe (“Litigation Demand”). The Litigation Demand is directed to the AEP Board and contains factual allegations involving HB\n6 that are generally consistent with those in the Derivative Actions. The Litigation Demand requested, among other things, that\nthe AEP Board undertake an independent investigation into alleged legal violations by certain current and former directors and\nofficers, and that AEP commence a civil action asserting claims similar to the claims asserted in the Derivative Actions. The\nAEP Board considered the Litigation Demand and formed a committee of the Board (the “Demand Review Committee”) to\ninvestigate, review, monitor and analyze the Litigation Demand and make a recommendation to the AEP Board regarding a\nreasonable and appropriate response to the same.\nIn April 2024, AEP reached an agreement with the four shareholders to fully and finally resolve the Derivative Actions and the\nLitigation Demand, and all claims asserted or that could have been asserted by any AEP shareholder based on the facts alleged,\nin the manner and upon the terms and conditions set forth in the settlement documents (the “Settlement”). In July 2024, the\nCourt preliminarily approved the Settlement. Subject to final approval by the Court, the Settlement includes a payment of\n$450 thousand for attorneys’ fees and the implementation of certain corporate governance changes outlined in the Settlement,\nmany of which have already been put in place. The Settlement does not include any admission of liability. In the event the\nSettlement is not approved by the Court or the Derivative Actions and the Litigation Demand are not otherwise settled or\ndismissed, the defendants will continue to defend against the Derivative Actions and the AEP Board will continue to act in\nresponse to the Litigation Demand as appropriate. Management does not believe the range of potential losses that is reasonably\npossible of occurring as a result of either the Derivative Actions or the Litigation Demand will have a material impact on results\nof operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nIn May 2021, AEP received a subpoena from the SEC’s Division of Enforcement seeking various documents, including\ndocuments relating to the passage of HB 6 and documents relating to AEP’s policies and financial processes and controls. In\nAugust 2022, AEP received a second subpoena from the SEC seeking various additional documents relating to its ongoing\ninvestigation. AEP is cooperating fully with the SEC’s investigation, which has included taking testimony from certain\nindividuals and inquiries regarding Empowering Ohio’s Economy, Inc., which is a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization, and\n132\nrelated disclosures. The SEC staff has advanced its discussions with certain parties involved in the investigation, including\nAEP, concerning the staff’s intentions regarding potential claims under the securities laws. AEP and the SEC are engaged in\ndiscussions about a possible resolution of the SEC’s investigation and potential claims under the securities laws. Any\nresolution or filed claims, the outcome of which cannot be predicted, may subject AEP to civil penalties and other remedial\nmeasures. Discussions are continuing and management does not believe the range of potential losses that is reasonably possible\nof occurring as a result of this investigation, or possible resolution thereof, will have a material impact on results of operations,\ncash flows or financial condition.\nClaims for Indemnification Made by Owners of the Gavin Power Station (Applies to AEP)\nIn November 2022, the Federal EPA issued a final decision denying Gavin Power LLC’s requested extension to allow a CCR\nsurface impoundment at the Gavin Power Station to continue to receive CCR and non-CCR waste streams after April 11, 2021\nuntil May 4, 2023 (the Gavin Denial). As part of the Gavin Denial, the Federal EPA made several assertions related to the CCR\nRule (see “Environmental Issues - CCR Rule” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations for additional information), including an assertion that the closure of the 300 acre unlined fly ash\nreservoir (FAR) is noncompliant with the CCR Rule in multiple respects. The Gavin Power Station was formerly owned and\noperated by AEP and was sold to Gavin Power LLC and Lightstone Generation LLC in 2017. Pursuant to the PSA, AEP\nmaintained responsibility to complete closure of the FAR in accordance with the closure plan approved by the Ohio EPA which\nwas completed in July 2021. The PSA contains indemnification provisions, pursuant to which the owners of the Gavin Power\nStation have notified AEP they believe they are entitled to indemnification for any damages that may result from these claims,\nincluding any future enforcement or litigation resulting from any determinations of noncompliance by the Federal EPA with\nvarious aspects of the CCR Rule consistent with the Gavin Denial. The owners of the Gavin Power Station have also sought\nindemnification for landowner claims for property damage allegedly caused by modifications to the FAR. Management does\nnot believe that the owners of the Gavin Power Station have any valid claim for indemnity or otherwise against AEP under the\nPSA. In addition, Gavin Power LLC, several AEP subsidiaries, and other parties have filed Petitions for Review of the Gavin\nDenial with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which in June 2024, were dismissed for lack of\njurisdiction. In January 2024, Gavin Power LLC also filed a complaint with the United States District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of Ohio, alleging various violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and asserting that the Federal EPA, through its\nprior inaction, has waived and is estopped from raising certain objections raised in the Gavin Denial. Management cannot\npredict the outcome of that litigation. Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that is reasonably possible\nof occurring.\nLitigation Regarding Justice Thermal Coal Contract (Applies to AEP and APCo)\nIn December 2023, APCo filed a suit in the Franklin County Ohio Court of Common Pleas seeking a declaratory judgment\nconfirming APCo’s right to terminate a long-term coal contract with Justice Thermal LLC (Justice Thermal) based on Justice\nThermal’s failure to perform under the contract. APCo terminated that contract in January 2024, and in April 2024, APCo filed\nan amended complaint seeking a declaration that the termination was proper and also seeking damages for Justice Thermal’s\nbreach of contract. Justice Thermal filed an answer and counterclaim in April 2024, contesting the validity of the contract\ntermination and asserting counterclaims. Justice Thermal’s counterclaims allege that APCo breached the contract, assert a\nclaim for fraud relating to APCo’s alleged fabrication of coal sample analyses, and seek damages. APCo will continue to\npursue its claims and defend against the counterclaims. Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that is\nreasonably possible of occurring.\n133\n6. ACQUISITIONS, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE AND DISPOSITIONS\nThe disclosures in this note apply to AEP unless indicated otherwise.\nACQUISITIONS\nRock Falls Wind Facility (Vertically Integrated Utilities Segment) (Applies to AEP and PSO)\nIn November 2022, PSO entered into an agreement to acquire the Rock Falls Wind Facility. In February 2023, the FERC\napproved PSO’s acquisition of the Rock Falls Wind Facility under Section 203 of the Federal Power Act. In March 2023, PSO\nacquired an ownership interest in the entity that owned Rock Falls during its development and construction for $146 million. In\naccordance with the guidance for “Business Combinations,” AEP management determined that the acquisition of the Rock Falls\nWind Facility represents an asset acquisition. The lease obligations related to Rock Falls were not material as at the time of\nacquisition.\nASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE\nPlanned Disposition of AEP OnSite Partners (Generation & Marketing Segment) (Applies to AEP)\nIn April 2023, AEP initiated a sales process for its ownership in AEP OnSite Partners. AEP OnSite Partners targets\nopportunities in distributed solar, combined heat and power, energy storage, waste heat recovery, energy efficiency, peaking\ngeneration and other energy solutions. As of June 30, 2024, AEP OnSite Partners owned projects located in 21 states, including\napproximately 103 MWs of installed solar capacity and two solar projects under construction totaling approximately 8 MWs.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the net book value of the assets and liabilities of AEP OnSite Partners was $341 million.\nIn May 2024, AEP signed an agreement to sell AEP OnSite Partners to a nonaffiliated third party. AEP has received clearance\nunder the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. The sale remains subject to FERC approval under Section\n203 of the Federal Power Act and is expected to close in the third quarter of 2024. AEP expects to receive cash proceeds of\napproximately $315 million, net of taxes and transaction costs.\nManagement concluded the assets in AEP OnSite Partners met the accounting requirements to be presented as Held for Sale in\nthe second quarter of 2024 based on the signing the sale agreement. Any changes to the book value or carrying value of these\nassets, or the anticipated sale price, could further reduce future net income and impact financial condition.\nIn May 2024, AEP ceased recognition of depreciation on the AEP OnSite Partners assets due to their classification as Held for\nSale on the balance sheets. The major classes of the assets and liabilities presented in Assets Held for Sale and Liabilities Held\nfor Sale on the balance sheets of AEP are shown in the following table:\nJune 30, 2024\n(in millions)\nASSETS\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net $ 309.2\nOther Classes of Assets that are not Major 54.4\nTotal Major Classes of Assets Held for Sale 363.6\nLoss on the Expected Sale of AEP OnSite Partners (net of $2.8 million of Income Tax Benefit) (10.4)\nAssets Held for Sale $ 353.2\nLIABILITIES\nOther Classes of Liabilities that are not Major $ 12.5\nLiabilities Held for Sale $ 12.5\n134\nDISPOSITIONS\nDisposition of the Competitive Contracted Renewables Portfolio (Generation & Marketing Segment) (Applies to AEP)\nIn February 2022, AEP management announced the initiation of a process to sell all or a portion of AEP Renewables’\ncompetitive contracted renewables portfolio (the portfolio) within the Generation & Marketing segment. In late January 2023,\nAEP received final bids from interested parties. In February 2023, AEP’s Board of Directors approved management’s plan to\nsell the portfolio and AEP signed an agreement with a nonaffiliated party. AEP recorded a pretax loss of $112 million\n($88 million after-tax) in the first quarter of 2023 as a result of reaching Held for Sale status and determining the carrying value\nof the portfolio exceeded the estimated fair value.\nIn August 2023, AEP completed the sale of the entire portfolio to the nonaffiliated party and received cash proceeds of\napproximately $1.2 billion, net of taxes and transaction costs.\nDisposition of NMRD (Generation & Marketing Segment) (Applies to AEP)\nIn December 2023, AEP and the joint owner signed an agreement to sell NMRD to a nonaffiliated third party and the sale was\ncompleted in February 2024. AEP received cash proceeds of approximately $107 million, net of taxes and transaction costs.\nThe transaction did not have a material impact on net income or financial condition.\n135\n7.

Other activities are insignificant. The Registrant Subsidiaries’ operations are managed on an\nintegrated basis because of the substantial impact of cost-based rates and regulatory oversight on the business process, cost\nstructures and operating results.\n140\nAEPTCo’s Reportable Segments\nAEPTCo Parent is the holding company of seven FERC-regulated transmission-only electric utilities. The seven State Transcos\nhave been identified as operating segments of AEPTCo under the accounting guidance for “Segment Reporting.” The State\nTranscos business consists of developing, constructing and operating transmission facilities at the request of the RTOs in which\nthey operate and in replacing and upgrading facilities, assets and components of the existing AEP transmission system as\nneeded to maintain reliability standards and provide service to AEP’s wholesale and retail customers. The State Transcos are\nregulated for rate-making purposes exclusively by the FERC and earn revenues through tariff rates charged for the use of their\nelectric transmission systems.\nAEPTCo’s CODM makes operating decisions, allocates resources to and assesses performance based on these operating\nsegments. The State Transcos operating segments all have similar economic characteristics and meet all of the criteria under\nthe accounting guidance for “Segment Reporting” to be aggregated into one operating segment. As a result, AEPTCo has one\nreportable segment. The remainder of AEPTCo’s activity is presented in AEPTCo Parent. While not considered a reportable\nsegment, AEPTCo Parent represents the activity of the holding company which primarily relates to debt financing activity and\ngeneral corporate activities.\nThe tables below present AEPTCo’s reportable segment income statement information for the three and six months ended June\n30, 2024 and 2023 and reportable segment balance sheet information as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2024\nReconciling AEPTCo\nState Transcos AEPTCo Parent Adjustments Consolidated\n(in millions)\nRevenues from:\nExternal Customers $ 97.0 $ — $ — $ 97.0\nSales to AEP Affiliates 377.8 — — 377.8\nOther Revenues 0.4 — — 0.4\nTotal Revenues $ 475.2 $ — $ — $ 475.2\nNet Income $ 175.2 $ 0.5 (a) $ — $ 175.7\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2023\nReconciling AEPTCo\nState Transcos AEPTCo Parent Adjustments Consolidated\n(in millions)\nRevenues from:\nExternal Customers $ 87.4 $ — $ — $ 87.4\nSales to AEP Affiliates 357.5 — — 357.5\nTotal Revenues $ 444.9 $ — $ — $ 444.9\nNet Income $ 174.2 $ 1.5 (a) $ — $ 175.7\n141\nSix Months Ended June 30, 2024\nReconciling AEPTCo\nState Transcos AEPTCo Parent Adjustments Consolidated\n(in millions)\nRevenues from:\nExternal Customers $ 194.0 $ — $ — $ 194.0\nSales to AEP Affiliates 761.2 — — 761.2\nOther Revenues 2.8 — — 2.8\nTotal Revenues $ 958.0 $ — $ — $ 958.0\nNet Income $ 356.9 $ — (a) $ — $ 356.9\nSix Months Ended June 30, 2023\nReconciling AEPTCo\nState Transcos AEPTCo Parent Adjustments Consolidated\n(in millions)\nRevenues from:\nExternal Customers $ 176.4 $ — $ — $ 176.4\nSales to AEP Affiliates 710.1 — — 710.1\nTotal Revenues $ 886.5 $ — $ — $ 886.5\nNet Income $ 335.8 $ 2.6 (a) $ — $ 338.4\nJune 30, 2024\nReconciling AEPTCo\nState Transcos AEPTCo Parent Adjustments Consolidated\n(in millions)\nTotal Assets $ 15,835.5 $ 5,942.2 (b) $ (5,991.5) (c) $ 15,786.2\nDecember 31, 2023\nReconciling AEPTCo\nState Transcos AEPTCo Parent Adjustments Consolidated\n(in millions)\nTotal Assets $ 15,120.6 $ 5,486.6 (b) $ (5,534.7) (c) $ 15,072.5\n(a) Includes the elimination of AEPTCo Parent’s equity earnings in the State Transcos.\n(b) Primarily relates to Notes Receivable from the State Transcos.\n(c) Primarily relates to the elimination of Notes Receivable from the State Transcos.\n142\n9. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise. For the periods presented, AEPTCo did not\nhave any derivative and hedging activity.\nOBJECTIVES FOR UTILIZATION OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\nAEPSC is agent for and transacts on behalf of certain AEP subsidiaries, including the Registrant Subsidiaries. AEPEP is agent\nfor and transacts on behalf of other AEP subsidiaries.\nThe Registrants are exposed to certain market risks as major power producers and participants in the electricity, capacity,\nnatural gas, coal and emission allowance markets. These risks include commodity price risks which may be subject to capacity\nrisk, interest rate risk and credit risk. These risks represent the risk of loss that may impact the Registrants due to changes in the\nunderlying market prices or rates. Management utilizes derivative instruments to manage these risks.\nSTRATEGIES FOR UTILIZATION OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO ACHIEVE OBJECTIVES\nRisk Management Strategies\nThe strategy surrounding the use of derivative instruments primarily focuses on managing risk exposures, future cash flows and\ncreating value utilizing both economic and formal hedging strategies. The risk management strategies also include the use of\nderivative instruments for trading purposes which focus on seizing market opportunities to create value driven by expected\nchanges in the market prices of the commodities. To accomplish these objectives, the Registrants primarily employ risk\nmanagement contracts including physical and financial forward purchase-and-sale contracts and, to a lesser extent, OTC swaps\nand options. Not all risk management contracts meet the definition of a derivative under the accounting guidance for\n“Derivatives and Hedging.” Derivative risk management contracts elected normal under the normal purchases and normal sales\nscope exception are not subject to the requirements of this accounting guidance.\nThe Registrants utilize power, capacity, coal, natural gas, interest rate and, to a lesser extent, heating oil, gasoline and other\ncommodity contracts to manage the risk associated with the energy business. The Registrants utilize interest rate derivative\ncontracts in order to manage the interest rate exposure associated with the commodity portfolio. For disclosure purposes, such\nrisks are grouped as “Commodity,” as these risks are related to energy risk management activities. The Registrants also utilize\nderivative contracts to manage interest rate risk associated with debt financing. For disclosure purposes, these risks are grouped\nas “Interest Rate.” The amount of risk taken is determined by the Commercial Operations, Energy Supply and Finance groups\nin accordance with established risk management policies as approved by the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors.\nThe following tables represent the gross notional volume of the Registrants’ outstanding derivative contracts:\nNotional Volume of Derivative Instruments\nJune 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nPrimary Risk AEP AEP\nExposure AEP Texas APCo I&M OPCo PSO SWEPCo AEP Texas APCo I&M OPCo PSO SWEPCo\n(in millions)\nCommodity:\nPower (MWhs) 339.4 — 51.5 12.6 2.1 11.5 9.8 246.8 — 16.8 5.9 2.2 4.1 2.9\nNatural Gas\n(MMBtus) 170.7 — 47.5 — — 48.0 19.9 151.6 — 37.3 — — 34.9 17.9\nHeating Oil and\nGasoline\n(Gallons) 6.0 1.5 0.8 1.0 1.0 0.6 0.7 6.5 1.8 1.0 0.6 1.2 0.7 0.9\nInterest Rate\n(USD) $ 69.6 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 80.1 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nInterest Rate on\nLong-term Debt\n(USD) $ 1,350.0 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 1,300.0 $ 150.0 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\n143\nFair Value Hedging Strategies (Applies to AEP)\nParent enters into interest rate derivative transactions as part of an overall strategy to manage the mix of fixed-rate and floating-\nrate debt. Certain interest rate derivative transactions effectively modify exposure to interest rate risk by converting a portion of\nfixed-rate debt to a floating-rate. Provided specific criteria are met, these interest rate derivatives may be designated as fair\nvalue hedges.\nCash Flow Hedging Strategies\nThe Registrants utilize cash flow hedges on certain derivative transactions for the purchase and sale of power (“Commodity”) in\norder to manage the variable price risk related to forecasted purchases and sales. Management monitors the potential impacts of\ncommodity price changes and, where appropriate, enters into derivative transactions to protect profit margins for a portion of\nfuture electricity sales and purchases. The Registrants do not hedge all commodity price risk.\nThe Registrants utilize a variety of interest rate derivative transactions in order to manage interest rate risk exposure. The\nRegistrants also utilize interest rate derivative contracts to manage interest rate exposure related to future borrowings of fixed-\nrate debt. The Registrants do not hedge all interest rate exposure.\nACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND THE IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe accounting guidance for “Derivatives and Hedging” requires recognition of all qualifying derivative instruments as either\nassets or liabilities on the balance sheets at fair value. The fair values of derivative instruments accounted for using MTM\naccounting or hedge accounting are based on exchange prices and broker quotes. If a quoted market price is not available, the\nestimate of fair value is based on the best information available including valuation models that estimate future energy prices\nbased on existing market and broker quotes and other assumptions. In order to determine the relevant fair values of the\nderivative instruments, the Registrants apply valuation adjustments for discounting, liquidity and credit quality.\nCredit risk is the risk that a counterparty will fail to perform on the contract or fail to pay amounts due. Liquidity risk\nrepresents the risk that imperfections in the market will cause the price to vary from estimated fair value based upon prevailing\nmarket supply and demand conditions. Since energy markets are imperfect and volatile, there are inherent risks related to the\nunderlying assumptions in models used to fair value risk management contracts. Unforeseen events may cause reasonable price\ncurves to differ from actual price curves throughout a contract’s term and at the time a contract settles. Consequently, there\ncould be significant adverse or favorable effects on future net income and cash flows if market prices are not consistent with\nmanagement’s estimates of current market consensus for forward prices in the current period. This is particularly true for\nlonger term contracts. Cash flows may vary based on market conditions, margin requirements and the timing of settlement of\nrisk management contracts.\nAccording to the accounting guidance for “Derivatives and Hedging,” the Registrants reflect the fair values of derivative\ninstruments subject to netting agreements with the same counterparty net of related cash collateral. For certain risk\nmanagement contracts, the Registrants are required to post or receive cash collateral based on third-party contractual\nagreements and risk profiles. AEP netted cash collateral received from third-parties against short-term and long-term risk\nmanagement assets in the amounts of $155 million and $46 million as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThere was no cash collateral received from third-parties netted against short-term and long-term risk management assets for the\nRegistrant Subsidiaries as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

sale contracts, as provided in the\naccounting guidance for “Derivatives and Hedging.” Derivative contracts that have been designated as normal purchases or\nnormal sales under that accounting guidance are not subject to MTM accounting treatment and are recognized on the statements\nof income on an accrual basis.\nThe accounting for the changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it qualifies for and has been\ndesignated as part of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship. Depending on the exposure,\nmanagement designates a hedging instrument as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge.\nFor contracts that have not been designated as part of a hedging relationship, the accounting for changes in fair value depends\non whether the derivative instrument is held for trading purposes. Unrealized and realized gains and losses on derivative\ninstruments held for trading purposes are included in revenues on a net basis on the statements of income. Unrealized and\nrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments not held for trading purposes are included in revenues or expenses on the\nstatements of income depending on the relevant facts and circumstances. Certain derivatives that economically hedge future\ncommodity risk are recorded in the same line item on the statements of income as that of the associated risk being hedged.\nHowever, unrealized and some realized gains and losses in regulated jurisdictions for both trading and non-trading derivative\ninstruments are recorded as regulatory assets (for losses) or regulatory liabilities (for gains) in accordance with the accounting\nguidance for “Regulated Operations.”\n149\nAccounting for Fair Value Hedging Strategies (Applies to AEP)\nFor fair value hedges (i.e. hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability or an identified portion thereof\nattributable to a particular risk), the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged\nitem associated with the hedged risk impacts net income during the period of change.\nAEP records realized and unrealized gains or losses on interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify for fair value hedge\naccounting treatment and any offsetting changes in the fair value of the debt being hedged in Interest Expense on the statements\nof income.\nThe following table shows the impacts recognized on the balance sheets related to the hedged items in fair value hedging\nrelationships:\nCumulative Amount of Fair Value Hedging\nAdjustment Included in the Carrying\nCarrying Amount of the Hedged Liabilities Amount of the Hedged Liabilities\nJune 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(in millions)\nLong-term Debt (a) (b) $ (876.8) $ (878.2) $ 70.4 $ 68.4\n(a) Amounts included within Noncurrent Liabilities line item Long-term Debt on the Balance Sheet.\n(b) Amounts include $(26) million and $(30) million as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, for the fair value\nhedge adjustment of hedged debt obligations for which hedge accounting has been discontinued.\nThe pretax effects of fair value hedge accounting on income were as follows:\nThree Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in millions)\nGain (Loss) on Interest Rate Contracts:\nFair Value Hedging Instruments (a) $ 18.2 $ (4.2) $ 1.8 $ 2.7\nFair Value Portion of Long-term Debt (a) (18.2) 4.2 (1.8) (2.7)\n(a) Gain (Loss) is included in Interest Expense on the statements of income.\nAccounting for Cash Flow Hedging Strategies (Applies to AEP, AEP Texas, APCo, I&M, PSO and SWEPCo)\nFor cash flow hedges (i.e. hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular\nrisk), the Registrants initially report the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as a component of Accumulated Other\nComprehensive Income (Loss) on the balance sheets until the period the hedged item affects net income.\nRealized gains and losses on derivative contracts for the purchase and sale of power designated as cash flow hedges are\nincluded in Total Revenues or Purchased Electricity, Fuel and Other Consumables Used for Electric Generation on the\nstatements of income or in Regulatory Assets or Regulatory Liabilities on the balance sheets, depending on the specific nature\nof the risk being hedged. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, AEP applied cash flow hedging to\noutstanding power derivatives and the Registrant Subsidiaries did not.\nThe Registrants reclassify gains and losses on interest rate derivative hedges related to debt financings from Accumulated Other\nComprehensive Income (Loss) on the balance sheets into Interest Expense on the statements of income in those periods in\nwhich hedged interest payments occur. During the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, AEP and AEP Texas applied\ncash flow hedging to outstanding interest rate derivatives and the other Registrant Subsidiaries did not. During the six months\nended June 30, 2024, AEP and AEP Texas applied cash flow hedging to outstanding interest rate derivatives and the other\nRegistrant Subsidiaries did not. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, AEP, AEP Texas, I&M, PSO and SWEPCo\napplied cash flow hedging to outstanding interest rate derivatives and the other Registrant Subsidiaries did not.\nFor details on effective cash flow hedges included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) on the balance sheets\nand the reasons for changes in cash flow hedges, see Note 3 - Comprehensive Income.\n150\nCash flow hedges included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) on the balance sheets were:\nImpact of Cash Flow Hedges on the Registrants’ Balance Sheets\nJune 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nPortion Expected to Portion Expected to\nAOCI be Reclassed to AOCI be Reclassed to\nGain (Loss) Net Income During Gain (Loss) Net Income During\nNet of Tax the Next Twelve Months Net of Tax the Next Twelve Months\nInterest Interest Interest Interest\nCommodity Rate Commodity Rate Commodity Rate Commodity Rate\n(in millions)\nAEP $ 103.7 $ 9.3 $ 35.5 $ 4.3 $ 104.9 $ (8.1) $ 38.3 $ 3.2\nAEP Texas — 6.6 — 0.7 — 0.5 — 0.2\nAPCo — 5.5 — 0.8 — 5.9 — 0.8\nI&M — (5.3) — (0.4) — (5.5) — (0.4)\nPSO — (0.2) — — — (0.2) — —\nSWEPCo — 1.2 — 0.3 — 1.3 — 0.3\nAs of June 30, 2024 the maximum length of time that AEP is hedging its exposure to variability in future cash flows related to\nforecasted transactions is 81 months.\nThe actual amounts reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) to Net Income can differ from the\nestimate above due to market price changes.\nCredit Risk\nManagement mitigates credit risk in wholesale marketing and trading activities by assessing the creditworthiness of potential\ncounterparties before entering into transactions with them and continuing to evaluate their creditworthiness on an ongoing\nbasis. Management uses credit agency ratings and current market-based qualitative and quantitative data as well as financial\nstatements to assess the financial health of counterparties on an ongoing basis.\nMaster agreements are typically used to facilitate the netting of cash flows associated with a single counterparty and may\ninclude collateral requirements. Collateral requirements in the form of cash, letters of credit and parental/affiliate guarantees\nmay be obtained as security from counterparties in order to mitigate credit risk. Some master agreements include margining,\nwhich requires a counterparty to post cash or letters of credit in the event exposure exceeds the established threshold. The\nthreshold represents an unsecured credit limit which may be supported by a parental/affiliate guaranty, as determined in\naccordance with AEP’s credit policy. In addition, master agreements allow for termination and liquidation of all positions in\nthe event of a default including a failure or inability to post collateral when required.\nCredit-Risk-Related Contingent Features\nCredit Downgrade Triggers (Applies to AEP, APCo, I&M, PSO and SWEPCo)\nA limited number of derivative contracts include collateral triggering events, which include a requirement to maintain certain\ncredit ratings. On an ongoing basis, AEP’s risk management organization assesses the appropriateness of these collateral\ntriggering events in contracts. The Registrants have not experienced a downgrade below a specified credit rating threshold that\nwould require the posting of additional collateral. The total exposure of AEP’s derivative contracts with collateral triggering\nevents in a net liability position was immaterial as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Registrant Subsidiaries had\nno derivative contracts with collateral triggering events in a net liability position as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n151\nCross-Acceleration Triggers\nCertain interest rate derivative contracts contain cross-acceleration provisions that, if triggered, would permit the counterparty\nto declare a default and require settlement of the outstanding payable. These cross-acceleration provisions could be triggered if\nthere was a non-performance event by the Registrants under any of their outstanding debt of at least $50 million and the lender\non that debt has accelerated the entire repayment obligation. On an ongoing basis, AEP’s risk management organization\nassesses the appropriateness of these cross-acceleration provisions in contracts. AEP had derivative contracts with cross-\nacceleration provisions in a net liability position of $97 million and $107 million and no cash collateral posted as of June 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. If a cross-acceleration provision would have been triggered, settlement at fair value\nwould have been required. The Registrant Subsidiaries’ derivative contracts with cross-acceleration provisions outstanding as\nof June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were not material.\nCross-Default Triggers (Applies to AEP, APCo, I&M, PSO and SWEPCo)\nIn addition, a majority of non-exchange traded commodity contracts contain cross-default provisions that, if triggered, would\npermit the counterparty to declare a default and require settlement of the outstanding payable. These cross-default provisions\ncould be triggered if there was a non-performance event by Parent or the obligor under outstanding debt or a third-party\nobligation that is $50 million or greater. On an ongoing basis, AEP’s risk management organization assesses the\nappropriateness of these cross-default provisions in the contracts. AEP had derivative contracts with cross-default provisions in\na net liability position of $233 million and $242 million and no cash collateral posted as of June 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, respectively, after considering contractual netting arrangements. If a cross-default provision would have been triggered,\nsettlement at fair value would have been required. APCo, PSO and SWEPCo had derivative contracts with cross-default\nprovisions in a net liability position of $13 million, $23 million and $10 million, respectively, and no cash collateral posted as\nof June 30, 2024. APCo, PSO and SWEPCo had derivative contracts with cross-default provisions in a net liability position of\n$22 million, $29 million and $15 million, respectively, and no cash collateral posted as of December 31, 2023. The other\nRegistrant Subsidiaries had no derivative contracts with cross-default provisions outstanding as of June 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023.\n152\n10. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants except AEPTCo unless indicated otherwise.\nFair Value Hierarchy and Valuation Techniques\nThe accounting guidance for “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the\ninputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for\nidentical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3\nmeasurement). Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is\ncategorized in Level 2. When quoted market prices are not available, pricing may be completed using comparable securities,\ndealer values, operating data and general market conditions to determine fair value. Valuation models utilize various inputs\nsuch as commodity, interest rate and, to a lesser degree, volatility and credit that include quoted prices for similar assets or\nliabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, market corroborated\ninputs (i.e. inputs derived principally from, or correlated to, observable market data) and other observable inputs for the asset or\nliability.\nFor commercial activities, exchange-traded derivatives, namely futures contracts, are generally fair valued based on unadjusted\nquoted prices in active markets and are classified as Level 1. Level 2 inputs primarily consist of OTC broker quotes in\nmoderately active or less active markets, as well as exchange-traded derivatives where there is insufficient market liquidity to\nwarrant inclusion in Level 1. Management verifies price curves using these broker quotes and classifies these fair values within\nLevel 2 when substantially all of the fair value can be corroborated. Management typically obtains multiple broker quotes,\nwhich are nonbinding in nature but are based on recent trades in the marketplace. When multiple broker quotes are obtained,\nthe quoted bid and ask prices are averaged. In certain circumstances, a broker quote may be discarded if it is a clear\noutlier. Management uses a historical correlation analysis between the broker quoted location and the illiquid locations. If the\npoints are highly correlated, these locations are included within Level 2 as well. Certain OTC and bilaterally executed\nderivative instruments are executed in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information. Illiquid transactions,\ncomplex structured transactions, FTRs and counterparty credit risk may require nonmarket-based inputs. Some of these inputs\nmay be internally developed or extrapolated and utilized to estimate fair value. When such inputs have a significant impact on\nthe measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized as Level 3. The main driver of contracts being classified as Level 3\nis the inability to substantiate energy price curves in the market. A portion of the Level 3 instruments have been economically\nhedged which limits potential earnings volatility.\nAEP utilizes its trustee’s external pricing service to estimate the fair value of the underlying investments held in the nuclear\ntrusts. AEP’s investment managers review and validate the prices utilized by the trustee to determine fair value. AEP’s\nmanagement performs its own valuation testing to verify the fair values of the securities. AEP receives audit reports of the\ntrustee’s operating controls and valuation processes.\nAssets in the nuclear trusts, cash and cash equivalents, other temporary investments restricted cash for securitized funding are\nclassified using the following methods. Equities are classified as Level 1 holdings if they are actively traded on\nexchanges. Items classified as Level 1 are investments in money market funds, fixed income and equity mutual funds and\nequity securities. They are valued based on observable inputs, primarily unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for\nidentical assets. Items classified as Level 2 are primarily investments in individual fixed income securities. Fixed income\nsecurities generally do not trade on exchanges and do not have an official closing price but their valuation inputs are based on\nobservable market data. Pricing vendors calculate bond valuations using financial models and matrices. The models use\nobservable inputs including yields on benchmark securities, quotes by securities brokers, rating agency actions, discounts or\npremiums on securities compared to par prices, changes in yields for U.S. Treasury securities, corporate actions by bond\nissuers, prepayment schedules and histories, economic events and, for certain securities, adjustments to yields to reflect changes\nin the rate of inflation. Other securities with model-derived valuation inputs that are observable are also classified as Level 2\ninvestments. Investments with unobservable valuation inputs are classified as Level 3 investments.\nFair Value Measurements of Long-term Debt (Applies to all Registrants)\nThe fair values of Long-term Debt are based on quoted market prices, without credit enhancements, for the same or similar\nissues and the current interest rates offered for instruments with similar maturities classified as Level 2 measurement\ninputs. These instruments are not marked-to-market. The estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that\ncould be realized in a current market exchange. The fair value of AEP’s Equity Units (Level 1) are valued based on publicly\ntraded securities issued by AEP.\n153\nThe book values and fair values of Long-term Debt are summarized in the following table:\nJune 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCompany Book Value Fair Value Book Value Fair Value\n(in millions)\nAEP $ 42,062.3 $ 37,897.1 $ 40,143.2 $ 37,325.7\nAEP Texas 6,489.7 5,779.1 5,889.8 5,400.7\nAEPTCo 5,861.5 4,867.6 5,414.4 4,796.9\nAPCo 5,672.0 5,267.7 5,588.3 5,390.1\nI&M 3,540.3 3,159.4 3,499.4 3,291.6\nOPCo 3,714.3 3,182.2 3,366.8 2,992.1\nPSO 2,385.2 2,084.5 2,384.6 2,154.3\nSWEPCo 3,648.3 3,114.4 3,646.9 3,209.7\nFair Value Measurements of Other Temporary Investments and Restricted Cash (Applies to AEP)\nOther Temporary Investments include marketable securities that management intends to hold for less than one year and\ninvestments by AEP’s protected cell of EIS.\nThe following is a summary of Other Temporary Investments and Restricted Cash:\nJune 30, 2024\nGross Gross\nUnrealized Unrealized Fair\nOther Temporary Investments and Restricted Cash Cost Gains Losses Value\n(in millions)\nRestricted Cash (a) $ 45.4 $ — $ — $ 45.4\nOther Cash Deposits (b) 21.9 — — 21.9\nFixed Income Securities – Mutual Funds (c) 166.2 — (7.2) 159.0\nEquity Securities – Mutual Funds 14.9 29.9 — 44.8\nTotal Other Temporary Investments and Restricted Cash $ 248.4 $ 29.9 $ (7.2) $ 271.1\nDecember 31, 2023\nGross Gross\nUnrealized Unrealized Fair\nOther Temporary Investments and Restricted Cash Cost Gains Losses Value\n(in millions)\nRestricted Cash (a) $ 48.9 $ — $ — $ 48.9\nOther Cash Deposits 13.9 — — 13.9\nFixed Income Securities – Mutual Funds (c) 165.9 — (6.2) 159.7\nEquity Securities – Mutual Funds 14.8 25.9 — 40.7\nTotal Other Temporary Investments and Restricted Cash $ 243.5 $ 25.9 $ (6.2) $ 263.2\n(a) Primarily represents amounts held for the repayment of debt.\n(b) Excludes Other Cash Deposits of $0.3 million classified as Assets Held for Sale on the balance sheets.

By rules or orders, the IURC, the MPSC and the FERC\nestablished investment limitations and general risk management guidelines. In general, limitations include:\n• Acceptable investments (rated investment grade or above when purchased).\n• Maximum percentage invested in a specific type of investment.\n• Prohibition of investment in obligations of AEP, I&M or their affiliates.\n• Withdrawals permitted only for payment of decommissioning costs and trust expenses.\nI&M maintains trust funds for each regulatory jurisdiction. Regulatory approval is required to withdraw decommissioning\nfunds. These funds are managed by an external investment manager that must comply with the guidelines and rules of the\napplicable regulatory authorities. The trust assets are invested to optimize the net of tax earnings of the trust giving\nconsideration to liquidity, risk, diversification and other prudent investment objectives.\nI&M records securities held in these trust funds in Spent Nuclear Fuel and Decommissioning Trusts on its balance sheets. I&M\nrecords these securities at fair value. I&M classifies debt securities in the trust funds as available-for-sale due to their long-term\npurpose.\nOther-than-temporary impairments for investments in debt securities are considered realized losses as a result of securities\nbeing managed by an external investment management firm. The external investment management firm makes specific\ninvestment decisions regarding the debt and equity investments held in these trusts and generally intends to sell debt securities\nin an unrealized loss position as part of a tax optimization strategy. Impairments reduce the cost basis of the securities which\nwill affect any future unrealized gain or realized gain or loss due to the adjusted cost of investment. I&M records unrealized\ngains, unrealized losses and other-than-temporary impairments from securities in these trust funds as adjustments to the\nregulatory liability account for the nuclear decommissioning trust funds and to regulatory assets or liabilities for the SNF\ndisposal trust funds in accordance with their treatment in rates. Consequently, changes in fair value of trust assets do not affect\nearnings or AOCI.\nThe following is a summary of nuclear trust fund investments:\nJune 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nGross Gross Other-Than- Gross Gross Other-Than-\nFair Unrealized Unrealized Temporary Fair Unrealized Unrealized Temporary\nValue Gains Losses Impairments Value Gains Losses Impairments\n(in millions)\nCash and Cash Equivalents $ 22.8 $ — $ — $ — $ 16.8 $ — $ — $ —\nFixed Income Securities:\nUnited States Government 1,267.8 13.8 (3.6) (26.6) 1,273.0 28.6 (3.9) (33.2)\nCorporate Debt 123.0 1.3 (7.0) (0.8) 132.1 4.8 (5.2) (8.6)\nState and Local Government 1.7 — — — 1.7 — — —\nSubtotal Fixed Income Securities 1,392.5 15.1 (10.6) (27.4) 1,406.8 33.4 (9.1) (41.8)\nEquity Securities - Domestic 2,798.7 2,214.0 (1.8) — 2,436.6 1,869.5 (0.9) —\nSpent Nuclear Fuel and\nDecommissioning Trusts $ 4,214.0 $ 2,229.1 $ (12.4) $ (27.4) $ 3,860.2 $ 1,902.9 $ (10.0) $ (41.8)\n155\nThe following table provides the securities activity within the decommissioning and SNF trusts:\nThree Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in millions)\nProceeds from Investment Sales $ 584.6 $ 688.7 $ 1,154.1 $ 1,206.3\nPurchases of Investments 598.6 697.0 1,187.1 1,233.3\nGross Realized Gains on Investment Sales 4.9 6.4 10.3 54.8\nGross Realized Losses on Investment Sales 4.2 3.7 5.4 12.3\nThe base cost of fixed income securities was $1.4 billion and $1.4 billion as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively.

As required by the accounting guidance for “Fair Value Measurements and\nDisclosures,” financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to\nthe fair value measurement. Management’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement\nrequires judgment and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value\nhierarchy levels.

In July 2024, AEP received notification that the Joint Committee on Taxation’s review of AEP’s refund\nclaim and associated IRS audit was final, resulting in no change and a refund of approximately $50 million. The refund is\nexpected to be received in the second half of 2024. Following the completion of this audit, IRS exam is closed through AEP's\n2020 filed tax return. There are currently no other tax years under IRS audit.\nAEP and subsidiaries file income tax returns in various state and local jurisdictions. These taxing authorities routinely examine\nthe tax returns, and AEP and subsidiaries are currently under examination in several state and local jurisdictions. Generally, the\nSOL have expired for tax years prior to 2017. In addition, management is monitoring and continues to evaluate the potential\nimpact of federal legislation and corresponding state conformity.\nFederal Legislation\nIn August 2022, President Biden signed H.R. 5376 into law, commonly known as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA.\nMost notably this budget reconciliation legislation created a 15% minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income\n(CAMT), extended and increased the value of PTCs and ITCs, added a nuclear and clean hydrogen PTC, an energy storage ITC\nand allowed the sale or transfer of tax credits to third-parties for cash. As further significant guidance from Treasury and the\nIRS is expected on the tax provisions in the IRA, AEP will continue to monitor any issued guidance and evaluate the impact on\nfuture net income, cash flows and financial condition.\nAEP and subsidiaries are applicable corporations for purposes of the CAMT in 2024. CAMT cash taxes are expected to be\npartially offset by regulatory recovery, the utilization of tax credits and additionally the cash inflow generated by the sale of tax\ncredits. The sale of tax credits are presented in the operating section of the statements of cash flows consistent with the\npresentation of cash taxes paid. AEP presents the loss on sale of tax credits through income tax expense.\nIn April 2024, the IRS issued final regulations related to the transfer of tax credits. In 2023, AEP, on behalf of PSO, SWEPCo\nand AEP Energy Supply, LLC, entered into transferability agreements with nonaffiliated parties to sell 2023 generated PTCs\nresulting in cash proceeds of approximately $174 million with $102 million received in 2023, $62 million received in the first\nquarter of 2024 and the remaining $10 million was received in the second quarter of 2024. In July 2024, AEP, on behalf of\nPSO and SWEPCo, entered into another transferability agreement with a nonaffiliated party to sell 2024 generated PTCs which\nwill result in approximately $100 million of cash proceeds, of which approximately $90 million is expected by the end of 2024\nand the remainder in 2025. AEP expects to continue to explore the ability to efficiently monetize its tax credits through third-\nparty transferability agreements.\nI&M’s Cook Plant qualifies for the transferable Nuclear PTC, which is available for tax years beginning in 2024 through 2032.\nThe Nuclear PTC is calculated based on electricity generated and sold to third-parties and is subject to a “reduction amount” as\nthe facility’s gross receipts increase above a certain threshold. Due to lack of guidance and uncertainty surrounding the\ncomputation of gross receipts, AEP and I&M are unable to estimate the amount of the Nuclear PTCs earned as of June 30, 2024\nand have not included any Nuclear PTCs in the annualized effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2024.\n167\n12. FINANCING ACTIVITIES\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants, unless indicated otherwise.\nCommon Stock (Applies to AEP)\nAt-the-Market (ATM) Program\nIn 2023, AEP filed a prospectus supplement and executed an Equity Distribution Agreement, pursuant to which AEP may sell,\nfrom time to time, up to an aggregate of $1.7 billion of its common stock through an ATM offering program, including an\nequity forward sales component. The compensation paid to the selling agents by AEP may be up to 2% of the gross offering\nproceeds of the shares.

AEPTCo’s\ncontractually-defined priority debt was 0.3% of consolidated tangible net assets as of June 30, 2024. The method for\ncalculating the consolidated tangible net assets is contractually-defined in the note purchase agreements.\nDividend Restrictions\nUtility Subsidiaries’ Restrictions\nParent depends on its utility subsidiaries to pay dividends to shareholders. AEP utility subsidiaries pay dividends to Parent\nprovided funds are legally available. Various financing arrangements and regulatory requirements may impose certain\nrestrictions on the ability of the subsidiaries to transfer funds to Parent in the form of dividends.\nAll of the dividends declared by AEP’s utility subsidiaries that provide transmission or local distribution services are subject to\na Federal Power Act requirement that prohibits the payment of dividends out of capital accounts in certain circumstances;\npayment of dividends is generally allowed out of retained earnings. The Federal Power Act also creates a reserve on earnings\nattributable to hydroelectric generation plants. Because of their ownership of such plants, this reserve applies to APCo and\nI&M.\nCertain AEP subsidiaries have credit agreements that contain covenants that limit their debt to capitalization ratio to 67.5%.\nThe method for calculating outstanding debt and capitalization is contractually-defined in the credit agreements.\nThe Federal Power Act restriction does not limit the ability of the AEP subsidiaries to pay dividends out of retained earnings.\nParent Restrictions (Applies to AEP)\nThe holders of AEP’s common stock are entitled to receive the dividends declared by the Board of Directors provided funds are\nlegally available for such dividends. Parent’s income primarily derives from common stock equity in the earnings of its utility\nsubsidiaries.\nPursuant to the leverage restrictions in credit agreements, AEP must maintain a percentage of debt to total capitalization at a\nlevel that does not exceed 67.5%. The method for calculating outstanding debt and capitalization is contractually-defined in the\ncredit agreements.\n170\nCorporate Borrowing Program (Applies to all Registrant Subsidiaries)\nAEP subsidiaries use a corporate borrowing program to meet their short-term borrowing needs. The corporate borrowing\nprogram includes a Utility Money Pool, which funds AEP’s utility subsidiaries; a Nonutility Money Pool, which funds certain\nAEP nonutility subsidiaries; and direct borrowing from AEP.

VOLUNTARY SEVERANCE PROGRAM\nIn April 2024, management announced a voluntary severance program designed to achieve a reduction in the size of AEP’s\nworkforce and help offset increasing operating expenses due to inflation and high interest costs in order to keep electricity costs\naffordable for customers. Approximately 7,400 of AEP’s 16,800 employees were eligible to participate in the program.\nApproximately 1,000 employees have chosen to take the voluntary severance package and substantially all will terminate\nemployment in July 2024. The severance program provides two weeks of base pay for every year of service with a minimum of\nfour weeks and a maximum of 52 weeks of base pay.\nAEP recorded a charge to expense in the second quarter of 2024 related to this voluntary severance program:\nAEP\nAEP Texas AEPTCo APCo I&M OPCo PSO SWEPCo\n(in millions)\nSeverance Expense Incurred $ 122.0 $ 19.8 $ 10.7 $ 26.5 $ 14.8 $ 14.8 $ 10.1 $ 16.9\nThese expenses are primarily included in Other Operation and Maintenance on the statements of income and Other Current\nLiabilities on the balance sheets. Severance payments to participants through June 30, 2024 were immaterial. The Registrants\nexpect to pay substantially all of the severance benefits in the third quarter of 2024. The voluntary severance program did not\ntrigger any material curtailment or settlement accounting considerations under the accounting guidance for “Compensation -\nRetirement Benefits”.\n175\n14. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES\nThe disclosures in this note apply to AEP unless indicated otherwise.\nThe accounting guidance for “Variable Interest Entities” is a consolidation model that considers if a company has a variable\ninterest in a VIE. A VIE is a legal entity that possesses any of the following conditions: the entity’s equity at risk is not\nsufficient to permit the legal entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, equity owners are\nunable to direct the activities that most significantly impact the legal entity’s economic performance (or they possess\ndisproportionate voting rights in relation to the economic interest in the legal entity), or the equity owners lack the obligation to\nabsorb the legal entity’s expected losses or the right to receive the legal entity’s expected residual returns. Entities are required\nto consolidate a VIE when it is determined that they have a controlling financial interest in a VIE and therefore, are the primary\nbeneficiary of that VIE, as defined by the accounting guidance for “Variable Interest Entities.” In determining whether AEP is\nthe primary beneficiary of a VIE, management considers whether AEP has the power to direct the most significant activities of\nthe VIE and is obligated to absorb losses or receive the expected residual returns that are significant to the VIE. Management\nbelieves that significant assumptions and judgments were applied consistently.\nAEP holds ownership interests in businesses with varying ownership structures. Partnership interests and other variable\ninterests are evaluated to determine if each entity is a VIE, and if so, whether or not the VIE should be consolidated into AEP’s\nfinancial statements. AEP has not provided material financial or other support that was not previously contractually required to\nany of its consolidated VIEs. If an entity is determined not to be a VIE, or if the entity is determined to be a VIE and AEP is\nnot deemed to be the primary beneficiary, the entity is accounted for under the equity method of accounting.\nConsolidated Variable Interests Entities\nThe Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes a detailed discussion of the Registrants’\nconsolidated VIEs.\nThe balances below represent the assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs.

The Registrants did not have material\ncontract assets as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nWhen the Registrants receive consideration, or such consideration is unconditionally due from a customer prior to transferring\ngoods or services to the customer under the terms of a sales contract, they recognize a contract liability on the balance sheets in\nthe amount of that consideration. Revenue for such consideration is subsequently recognized in the period or periods in which\nthe remaining performance obligations in the contract are satisfied.

Disclosure controls and procedures are\ndefined as controls and other procedures of the Registrants that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed\nby the Registrants in the reports that they file or submit under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and\nreported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without\nlimitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Registrants in the reports\nthat they file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Registrants’ management, including\nthe principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosure. As of June 30, 2024, these officers concluded that the disclosure controls and\nprocedures in place are effective and provide reasonable assurance that the disclosure controls and procedures accomplished\ntheir objectives.\nThere was no change in the Registrants’ internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and\n15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the second quarter of 2024 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, the Registrants’ internal control over financial reporting.\n188\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nFor a discussion of material legal proceedings, see “Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies,” of Note 5 incorporated\nherein by reference.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes a detailed discussion of risk factors. As of\nJune 30, 2024, the risk factors appearing in AEP’s 2023 Annual Report are supplemented and updated as follows:\nThe occurrence of one or more wildfires could cause tremendous loss, impact the market value and credit ratings of our\nsecurities and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. (Applies to all Registrants)\nMore frequent and severe drought conditions, extreme swings in amount and timing of precipitation, changes in vegetation,\nunseasonably warm temperatures, very low humidity, stronger winds and other factors have increased the duration of the\nwildfire season and the potential impact of an event. AEP’s infrastructure is aging and poses risks to safety and system\nreliability and wildfire mitigation initiatives may not be successful or effective in preventing or reducing wildfire-related events.\nWildfires can occur even when effective mitigation procedures are followed. Despite AEP’s wildfire mitigation initiatives, a\nwildfire could be ignited, spread and cause damages, which would subject AEP to significant liability. Other potential risks\nassociated with wildfires include the inability to secure sufficient insurance coverage, uninsured losses or losses in excess of\ncurrent insurance coverage, increased costs of insurance, regulatory recovery risk, litigation risk, and the potential for a credit\ndowngrade and subsequent additional costs to access capital markets.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nNone.\nItem 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities\nNone.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nItem 5. Other Information\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2024, none of the Company’s directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934) adopted, terminated or modified a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1\ntrading arrangement (as such terms are defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Act of 1933).\n189\nItem 6.

Operating earnings for third-quarter 2024 were $985 million or $1.85 per share, compared\nwith operating earnings of $924 million or $1.77 per share in third-quarter 2023.\n1\nOperating earnings is a non-GAAP measure representing GAAP earnings excluding special\nitems. On a year-to-date basis, the variance between GAAP and operating earnings is $0.03 per share. A\nfull reconciliation of GAAP earnings to operating earnings for the quarter and year to date is included in\nthe tables at the end of this news release.\n“Our results this quarter were driven by our continued investments to improve service and\nenhance the energy system to meet the needs of our customers and communities. Based on our\nprogress so far this year, we are tightening our 2024 earnings guidance range and maintaining the $5.63\nmidpoint,” said Bill Fehrman, AEP president and chief executive officer.\n“We are committed to providing best-in-class service, driving operational excellence and\nexercising financial discipline to improve results and create more value for our customers, investors and\nall stakeholders. AEP has a strong foundation and significant growth opportunities ahead, and we are\nconfident in our ability to execute our strategy and deliver on our promises. This confidence is reflected in\nour new 6%-8% long-term growth rate and expanded capital investment plan of $54 billion over the next\nfive years, along with our commitment to a strong balance sheet.\n“The foundation of our 2025 earnings guidance range is based on robust growth in our regulated\nbusinesses as we invest in a reliable, resilient grid and new generation opportunities to serve\nunprecedented load growth. The range also reflects lower contributions from our Generation & Marketing\nsegment due to the reduced scope of activities in this segment going forward,” Fehrman said.\n“Commercial load has increased more than 10% year-over-year through the third quarter, and our\nupdated sales projections show that pace accelerating. We expect commercial load to grow an average\nof 20% annually over the next three years based on customer contracts signed so far. In fact, we now\nhave financial agreements from customers for 20 gigawatts of commercial and industrial load additions\nthrough the end of the decade, primarily in Ohio, Texas and Indiana.\n“We continue to work with our regulators to ensure costs are fairly allocated so we can keep\ncustomer rates affordable and make sure all customers benefit from the investments needed to support\nthe growth of data processors and other economic development projects,” he said.\n“We recently implemented leadership and alignment changes to streamline our corporate\nstructure, move decision making closer to customers and ensure the businesses that drive our revenue\nhave the support they need to improve performance. We also continue to engage our employees to\nidentify process improvements and efficiencies that will reposition the company to support sustainable\ngrowth and customer affordability,” Fehrman added.\n2\nSUMMARY OF RESULTS BY SEGMENT\n$ in millions\nGAAP Earnings 3Q 24 3Q 23 Change YTD 24 YTD 23 Change\nVertically Integrated Utilities (a) 571.5 512.5 59.0 1,198.0 1,051.6 146.4\nTransmission & Distribution Utilities (b) 245.2 206.0 39.2 542.3 508.4 33.9\nAEP Transmission Holdco (c) 214.7 202.9 11.8 624.1 580.8 43.3\nGeneration & Marketing (d) 93.3 130.7 (37.4) 226.1 (59.3) 285.4\nAll Other (165.1) (98.4) (66.7) (287.5) (209.6) (77.9)\nTotal GAAP Earnings (Loss) 959.6 953.7 5.9 2,303.0 1,871.9 431.1\nOperating Earnings (non-GAAP) 3Q 24 3Q 23 Change YTD 24 YTD 23 Change\nVertically Integrated Utilities (a) 572.4 520.0 52.4 1,117.5 1,045.6 71.9\nTransmission & Distribution Utilities (b) 245.2 206.0 39.2 610.8 488.2 122.6\nAEP Transmission Holdco (c) 214.7 202.9 11.8 632.3 580.9 51.4\nGeneration & Marketing (d) 99.2 92.8 6.4 225.6 204.1 21.5\nAll Other (146.1) (97.9) (48.2) (268.4) (241.2) (27.2)\nTotal Operating Earnings (non-GAAP) 985.4 923.8 61.6 2,317.8 2,077.6 240.2\nA full reconciliation of GAAP earnings with operating earnings is included in tables at the end of this news release.\na.

Operating\nearnings could differ from GAAP earnings for matters such as impairments, divestitures or changes in\naccounting principles. AEP management is not able to forecast if any of these items will occur or any\namounts that may be reported for future periods. Therefore, AEP is not able to provide a corresponding\nGAAP equivalent for 2024 earnings guidance.\nReflecting special items recorded through the third quarter, the estimated earnings per share on a\nGAAP basis would be $5.55 to $5.65 per share.

AEP uses operating\nearnings as the primary performance measurement when communicating with analysts and investors\nregarding its earnings outlook and results. The company uses operating earnings data internally to\nmeasure performance against budget, to report to AEP’s Board of Directors and also as an input in\ndetermining performance-based compensation under the company’s employee incentive compensation\nplans.\n4\nABOUT AEP\nOur team at American Electric Power is committed to improving our customers’ lives with reliable,\naffordable power.

Financial AEP reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). AEP\nsupplements the reporting of financial information determined in accordance with GAAP with certain non-GAAP financial\nMeasures measures, including operating earnings (non-GAAP) and FFO to Total Debt (non-GAAP). Operating earnings exclude certain\ngains and losses and other specified items, including mark-to-market adjustments from commodity hedging activities and other\nitems as set forth in the reconciliation in the Appendix. FFO to Total Debt is adjusted for capital and operating leases, pension,\ncapitalized interest, adjustments related to hybrid debt and changes in working capital. Operating earnings could differ from\nGAAP earnings for matters such as impairments, divestitures, or changes in accounting principles. AEP management is not able\nto forecast if any of these items will occur or any amounts that may be reported for future periods. Therefore, AEP is not able to\nprovide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for earnings guidance. Reflecting special items recorded through the third quarter of\n2024, the estimated earningsper shareon a GAAP basis would be $5.55to $5.65per share.\nThis information is intended to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of period over period financial results and provide an\nindication of AEP’s baseline operating performance by excluding items that are considered by management to be not directly\nrelated to the ongoing operations of the business. In addition, this information is among the primary indicators management uses\nas a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets and planning and forecasting\nof futureperiods.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other\ncompanies’ presentations. AEP has provided these non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental information and in addition to\nthe financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures should not be\ndeemed more useful than, a substitute for, or an alternative to the most comparable GAAP measures provided in the materials\npresented. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are provided in the\nappendicesand supplementalschedulesto this presentation.\n3rd Quarter 2024 Earnings Release Presentation 3\nBusiness Highlights for 3rd Quarter 2024\n3rd Quarter 2024 Results\n(cid:127) Reported 3rd quarter 2024 operating earnings of $1.85 per share\n(cid:127) Narrowed 2024 operating earnings guidance range to $5.58-$5.68, maintained $5.63 midpoint\n(cid:127) Realized commercial load growth of 7.9% in 3rd quarter and 10.1% YTD\n(cid:127) Committed to supporting large loads with fair cost allocation to all customers, evidenced through AEP’s proactive\nfiling at FERC and tariff filings in Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio and West Virginia\n(cid:127) Achieved positive regulatory developments:\n Base case approved in AEP Texas\n Base cases progressing in Oklahoma, Virginia and West Virginia\n Formula rates updated in Arkansas and Louisiana\n New RFPs filed in September 2024 to support load growth in I&M\nStrategic Focus Areas and Outlook\n(cid:127) Execute strategy to drive stakeholder value as we focus on growth and financial strength, customer service, and\nregulatory integrity\n(cid:127) Introduce 2025 operating earnings guidance range of $5.75-$5.95\n(cid:127) Announce robust load additions of 20 GW supported by customer commitments through 2029; updated load\nforecasts for 2025-2027\n(cid:127) Unveil new long-term operating earnings growth rate of 6%-8% off 2025 base year, reinforced by a balanced\n$54B 5-year capital plan, all while keeping customer rates affordable\n(cid:127) Maintain strong balance sheet with FFO/Debt in the targeted range of 14%-15%\n3rd Quarter 2024 Earnings Release Presentation 4\nInvestment Profile\nOperating EPS Guidance Range and Long-Term Growth Outlook\nDriving Long-term\nEPS Growth Outlook\n$8\n$7\nInvestment growth in wires $5.75 - $5.951\n$6 $5.58 - $5.68\nand regulated new\n$5\ngeneration investments\n$4\ndrive attractive long-term\n$3\nreturns $2\n$1\n1AEP’s earnings range in 2025 is expected to grow 4% off\nG&M $0.51\n2024.

Operating earnings for third-quarter 2024 were $985 million or $1.85 per share, compared with operating earnings of $924 million or $1.77 per share in third-quarter 2023.\n\nOperating earnings is a non-GAAP measure representing GAAP earnings excluding special items. On a year-to-date basis, the variance between GAAP and operating earnings is $0.03 per share. A full reconciliation of GAAP earnings to operating earnings for the quarter and year to date is included in the tables at the end of this news release.\n\n\"Our results this quarter were driven by our continued investments to improve service and enhance the energy system to meet the needs of our customers and communities. Based on our progress so far this year, we are tightening our 2024 earnings guidance range and maintaining the $5.63 midpoint,\" said Bill Fehrman, AEP president and chief executive officer.\n\n\"We are committed to providing best-in-class service, driving operational excellence and exercising financial discipline to improve results and create more value for our customers, investors and all stakeholders. AEP has a strong foundation and significant growth opportunities ahead, and we are confident in our ability to execute our strategy and deliver on our promises. This confidence is reflected in our new 6%-8% long-term growth rate and expanded capital investment plan of $54 billion over the next five years, along with our commitment to a strong balance sheet.\n\n\"The foundation of our 2025 earnings guidance range is based on robust growth in our regulated businesses as we invest in a reliable, resilient grid and new generation opportunities to serve unprecedented load growth. The range also reflects lower contributions from our Generation & Marketing segment due to the reduced scope of activities in this segment going forward,\" Fehrman said.\n\n\"Commercial load has increased more than 10% year-over-year through the third quarter, and our updated sales projections show that pace accelerating. We expect commercial load to grow an average of 20% annually over the next three years based on customer contracts signed so far. In fact, we now have financial agreements from customers for 20 gigawatts of commercial and industrial load additions through the end of the decade, primarily in Ohio, Texas and Indiana.\n\n\"We continue to work with our regulators to ensure costs are fairly allocated so we can keep customer rates affordable and make sure all customers benefit from the investments needed to support the growth of data processors and other economic development projects,\" he said.\n\n\"We recently implemented leadership and alignment changes to streamline our corporate structure, move decision making closer to customers and ensure the businesses that drive our revenue have the support they need to improve performance. We also continue to engage our employees to identify process improvements and efficiencies that will reposition the company to support sustainable growth and customer affordability,\" Fehrman added.\n\n## SUMMARY OF RESULTS BY SEGMENT\n\n$ in millions\n\nThird QuarterYear-to-Date\n\n**GAAP Earnings** | **3Q 24** | **3Q 23** | **Change** | **YTD 24** | **YTD 23** | **Change**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nVertically Integrated Utilities (a) | 571.5 | 512.5 | 59.0 | 1,198.0 | 1,051.6 | 146.4  \nTransmission & Distribution Utilities (b) | 245.2 | 206.0 | 39.2 | 542.3 | 508.4 | 33.9  \nAEP Transmission Holdco (c) | 214.7 | 202.9 | 11.8 | 624.1 | 580.8 | 43.3  \nGeneration & Marketing (d) | 93.3 | 130.7 | (37.4) | 226.1 | (59.3) | 285.4  \nAll Other | (165.1) | (98.4) | (66.7) | (287.5) | (209.6) | (77.9)  \n**Total GAAP Earnings (Loss)** | **959.6** | **953.7** | **5.9** | **2,303.0** | **1,871.9** | **431.1**  \n**Operating Earnings (non-GAAP)** | **3Q 24** | **3Q 23** | **Change** | **YTD 24** | **YTD 23** | **Change**  \nVertically Integrated Utilities (a) | 572.4 | 520.0 | 52.4 | 1,117.5 | 1,045.6 | 71.9  \nTransmission & Distribution Utilities (b) | 245.2 | 206.0 | 39.2 | 610.8 | 488.2 | 122.6  \nAEP Transmission Holdco (c) | 214.7 | 202.9 | 11.8 | 632.3 | 580.9 | 51.4  \nGeneration & Marketing (d) | 99.2 | 92.8 | 6.4 | 225.6 | 204.1 | 21.5  \nAll Other | (146.1) | (97.9) | (48.2) | (268.4) | (241.2) | (27.2)  \n**Total Operating Earnings (non-GAAP)** | **985.4** | **923.8** | **61.6** | **2,317.8** | **2,077.6** | **240.2**  \nA full reconciliation of GAAP earnings with operating earnings is included in tables at the end of this news release. a.

Operating earnings could differ from GAAP earnings for matters such as impairments, divestitures or changes in accounting principles. AEP management is not able to forecast if any of these items will occur or any amounts that may be reported for future periods. Therefore, AEP is not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for 2024 earnings guidance.\n\nReflecting special items recorded through the third quarter, the estimated earnings per share on a GAAP basis would be $5.55 to $5.65 per share. See the table below for a full reconciliation of 2024 earnings guidance. \n\n## 2024 EPS Guidance Reconciliation\n\nEstimated EPS on a GAAP basis | $5.55 | to | $5.65  \n---|---|---|---  \nMark-to-Market impact of commodity hedging activities | (0.09)  \nRemeasurement of Excess ADIT Regulatory Liability | (0.09)  \nImpact of NOLC on Retail Rate Making | (0.50)  \nDisallowance - Dolet Hills Power Station | 0.02  \nProvision for Refund - Turk Plant | 0.24  \nSale of AEP OnSite Partners | 0.02  \nSeverance Charges | 0.18  \nFederal EPA Coal Combustion Residuals Rule | 0.21  \nSEC Matter Loss Contingency | 0.04  \nOperating EPS Guidance | $5.58 | to | $5.68  \n  \n## WEBCAST\n\nAEP's quarterly discussion with financial analysts and investors will be broadcast live over the internet at 9 a.m. Eastern today at [http://www.aep.com/webcasts](http://www.aep.com/webcasts/).

The company's operating earnings, a non-GAAP measure representing GAAP earnings excluding special items as described in the news release and charts, provide another representation for investors to evaluate the performance of the company's ongoing business activities. AEP uses operating earnings as the primary performance measurement when communicating with analysts and investors regarding its earnings outlook and results. The company uses operating earnings data internally to measure performance against budget, to report to AEP's Board of Directors and also as an input in determining performance-based compensation under the company's employee incentive compensation plans.\n\n## ABOUT AEP\n\nOur team at American Electric Power is committed to improving our customers' lives with reliable, affordable power.

Although AEP and each of its Registrant Subsidiaries believe that their expectations are based on reasonable assumptions, any such statements may be influenced by factors that could cause actual outcomes and results to be materially different from those projected. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are: changes in economic conditions, electric market demand and demographic patterns in AEP service territories; the impact of pandemics and any associated disruption of AEP's business operations due to impacts on economic or market conditions, costs of compliance with potential government regulations, electricity usage, supply chain issues, customers, service providers, vendors and suppliers; the economic impact of increased global trade tensions including the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and the adoption or expansion of economic sanctions or trade restrictions; inflationary or deflationary interest rate trends; volatility and disruptions in the financial markets precipitated by any cause, including failure to make progress on federal budget or debt ceiling matters, particularly developments affecting the availability or cost of capital to finance new capital projects and refinance existing debt; the availability and cost of funds to finance working capital and capital needs, particularly if expected sources of capital, such as proceeds from the sale of assets or subsidiaries, do not materialize, and during periods when the time lag between incurring costs and recovery is long and the costs are material; decreased demand for electricity; weather conditions, including storms and drought conditions, and AEP's ability to recover significant storm restoration costs; limitations or restrictions on the amounts and types of insurance available to cover losses that might arise in connection with natural disasters or operations; the cost of fuel and its transportation, the creditworthiness and performance of fuel suppliers and transporters and the cost of storing and disposing of used fuel, including coal ash and spent nuclear fuel; the availability of fuel and necessary generation capacity and the performance of generation plants; AEP's ability to recover fuel and other energy costs through regulated or competitive electric rates; the ability to transition from fossil generation and the ability to build or acquire renewable generation, transmission lines and facilities (including the ability to obtain any necessary regulatory approvals and permits) when needed at acceptable prices and terms, including favorable tax treatment, and to recover those costs; new legislation, litigation and government regulation, including changes to tax laws and regulations, oversight of nuclear generation, energy commodity trading and new or heightened requirements for reduced emissions of sulfur, nitrogen, mercury, carbon, soot or particulate matter and other substances that could impact the continued operation, cost recovery, and/or profitability of generation plants and related assets; the impact of federal tax legislation on results of operations, financial condition, cash flows or credit ratings; the risks associated with fuels used before, during and after the generation of electricity and the byproducts and wastes of such fuels, including coal ash and spent nuclear fuel; timing and resolution of pending and future rate cases, negotiations and other regulatory decisions, including rate or other recovery of new investments in generation, distribution and transmission service and environmental compliance; resolution of litigation or regulatory proceedings or investigations; AEP's ability to constrain operation and maintenance costs; prices and demand for power generated and sold at wholesale; changes in technology, particularly with respect to energy storage and new, developing, alternative or distributed sources of generation; AEP's ability to recover through rates any remaining unrecovered investment in generation units that may be retired before the end of their previously projected useful lives; volatility and changes in markets for coal and other energy-related commodities, particularly changes in the price of natural gas; the impact of changing expectations and demands of customers, regulators, investors and stakeholders, including heightened emphasis on environmental, social and governance concerns; changes in utility regulation and the allocation of costs within regional transmission organizations, including ERCOT, PJM and SPP; changes in the creditworthiness of the counterparties with contractual arrangements, including participants in the energy trading market; actions of rating agencies, including changes in the ratings of debt; the impact of volatility in the capital markets on the value of the investments held by AEP's pension, other postretirement benefit plans, captive insurance entity and nuclear decommissioning trust and the impact of such volatility on future funding requirements; accounting standards periodically issued by accounting standard-setting bodies; other risks and unforeseen events, including wars and military conflicts, the effects of terrorism (including increased security costs), embargoes, wildfires, cyber security threats and other catastrophic events; and the ability to attract and retain the requisite work force and key personnel.\n\nMEDIA CONTACT: Tammy Ridout Director, External Communications 614/716-2347\n\nANALYSTS CONTACT: Darcy Reese Vice President, Investor Relations 614/716-2614\n\n### Other News Releases\n\nNovember 22, 2024\n\n### [I&M and Stakeholders File Large Load Settlement to Advance Grid Reliability and Support Economic Growth ](/news/releases/read/9883/IM-and-Stakeholders-File-Large-Load-Settlement-to-Advance-Grid-Reliability-and-Support-Economic-Growth-)\n\n[Read more](/news/releases/read/9883/IM-and-Stakeholders-File-Large-Load-Settlement-to-Advance-Grid-Reliability-and-Support-Economic-Growth-)\n\nNovember 14, 2024\n\n### [AEP Leveraging Fuel Cell Technology to Power Data Center Growth](/news/releases/read/9866/AEP-Leveraging-Fuel-Cell-Technology-to-Power-Data-Center-Growth)\n\n_This customer-focused effort is the largest utility fuel cell initiative in the country_\n\nAEP is offering large customers a custom solution to support their growing energy needs with fuel cell technology.
