(NASDAQ: ENTG), today reported its financial results for the Company’s third quarter ended September 28, 2024.\n\nBertrand Loy, Entegris’ president and chief executive officer, said: “The team delivered margins and non-GAAP EPS within our guidance range, despite third quarter sales coming in below expectations, with revenue growth excluding divestitures of 7 percent year-on-year.”\n\nMr. Loy added: “2024 is a transition year for the semiconductor industry. The market recovery is taking longer than anticipated and 2024 continues to be a year of limited technology transitions. Customers with significant exposure to AI applications are performing well, but the rest of the industry continues to be challenged. In this environment, we remain focused on maintaining strong profitability while continuing to fund critical investments that further improve our technology leadership and position us to benefit as market demand accelerates.”\n\n“Looking ahead, we remain confident about the growth prospects for the semi industry and Entegris. The technology roadmaps continue to be opportunity-rich for Entegris as our customers drive for more complex device architectures and further miniaturization,” he said. “The resulting process complexity is making our expertise in materials science and materials purity increasingly valuable to our customers. This is expected to fuel our market outperformance and incremental content per wafer opportunities, as new nodes ramp in memory and advanced logic in the years to come.”\n\n**Quarterly Financial Results Summary**\n\n(in thousands, except percentages and per share data)  \n---  \n**GAAP Results**| **Sep 28, 2024**| **Sep 30, 2023**| **Jun 29, 2024**  \nNet sales| $807,694| $888,239| $812,652  \nGross margin - as a % of net sales| 46.0%| 41.3%| 46.2%  \nOperating margin - as a % of net sales| 16.9%| 13.2%| 16.0%  \nNet income| $77,582| $33,212| $67,696  \nDiluted earnings per common share| $0.51| $0.22| $0.45  \n**Non-GAAP Results**| **Sep 28, 2024**| **Sep 30, 2023**| **Jun 29, 2024**  \nAdjusted gross margin - as a % of net sales| 46.0%| 41.4%| 46.2%  \nAdjusted operating margin - as a % of net sales| 23.0%| 22.0%| 22.0%  \nAdjusted EBITDA - as a % of net sales| 28.8%| 26.5%| 27.8%  \nDiluted non-GAAP earnings per common share| $0.77| $0.68| $0.71  \n  \n**Fourth Quarter Outlook**\n\nFor the Company’s guidance for the fourth quarter ending December 31, 2024, the Company expects sales of $810 million to $840 million. The midpoint of this guidance range represents an 8% year-on-year increase, excluding the impact of divestitures. GAAP net income of $75 million to $86 million and diluted earnings per common share is expected to be between $0.49 and $0.56. On a non-GAAP basis, the Company expects diluted earnings per common share to range from $0.75 to $0.82, reflecting net income on a non-GAAP basis in the range of $114 million to $125 million. The Company also expects adjusted EBITDA of approximately 28.5% to 29.5% of sales.\n\n**Segment Results**\n\nThe Company currently operates in three segments:\n\n**Materials Solutions (MS):** MS provides materials-based solutions, such as chemical mechanical planarization slurries and pads, deposition materials, process chemistries and gases, formulated cleans, etchants and other specialty materials that enable our customers to achieve better device performance and faster time to yield, while providing for lower total cost of ownership.\n\n**Microcontamination Control (MC):** MC offers advanced filtration solutions that improve customers’ yield, device reliability and cost by filtering and purifying critical liquid chemistries and gases used in semiconductor manufacturing processes and other high-technology industries.\n\n**Advanced Materials Handling (AMH):** AMH develops solutions that improve customers’ yields by protecting critical materials during manufacturing, transportation, and storage including products that monitor, protect, transport and deliver critical liquid chemistries, wafers, and other substrates for a broad set of applications in the semiconductor, life sciences and other high-technology industries.\n\nOn October 30, 2024, Entegris realigned its operating structure to combine the MC and AMH segments, resulting in two reportable segments: the MS segment and the combined MC / AMH segment. As the realignment occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2024, Entegris has presented the results for its three reporting segments through Q3 2024. Beginning in the fourth quarter, Entegris will provide recasted financial information for the two segment structure.\n\n**Third-Quarter Results**\n\nEntegris will hold a conference call to discuss its results for the third quarter on Monday, November 4, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Participants should dial 800-579-2543 or +1 785-424-1789, referencing confirmation ID: ENTGQ324. Participants are asked to dial in 10 minutes prior to the start of the call.

Adjusted Net Sales, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Segment Profit, Adjusted Operating Income, non-GAAP Net Income, non-GAAP Adjusted Operating Margin and diluted non-GAAP Earnings Per Common Share, together with related measures thereof, are considered “non-GAAP financial measures” under the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company provides supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to better understand and manage its business and believes these measures provide investors and analysts additional and meaningful information for the assessment of the Company’s ongoing results. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures to assist in the evaluation of the performance of its business segments and to make operating decisions. Management believes that the Company’s non-GAAP measures help indicate the Company’s baseline performance before certain gains, losses or other charges that may not be indicative of the Company’s business or future outlook, and that non-GAAP measures offer a more consistent view of business performance. The Company believes the non-GAAP measures aid investors’ overall understanding of the Company’s results by providing a higher degree of transparency for such items and providing a level of disclosure that will help investors generally understand how management plans, measures and evaluates the Company’s business performance. Management believes that the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides greater consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors’ understanding of the Company’s historical operating trends by providing an additional basis for comparisons to prior periods. The reconciliations of GAAP net sales to Adjusted Net Sales (excluding divestitures), GAAP gross profit to Adjusted Gross Profit, GAAP segment profit to Adjusted Operating Income, GAAP net income to Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted EBITDA, GAAP net income and diluted earnings per common share to non-GAAP Net Income and diluted non-GAAP Earnings Per Common Share and GAAP outlook to non-GAAP outlook are included elsewhere in this release.\n\n**Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis news release contains “forward-looking statements.” The words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “project,” “should,” “may,” “will,” “would” or the negative thereof and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements.

(NASDAQ: ENTG), today reported its financial results for the Company’s third quarter ended September 28, 2024.\n\nBertrand Loy, Entegris’ president and chief executive officer, said: “The team delivered margins and non-GAAP EPS within our guidance range, despite third quarter sales coming in below expectations, with revenue growth excluding divestitures of 7 percent year-on-year.”\n\nMr. Loy added: “2024 is a transition year for the semiconductor industry. The market recovery is taking longer than anticipated and 2024 continues to be a year of limited technology transitions. Customers with significant exposure to AI applications are performing well, but the rest of the industry continues to be challenged. In this environment, we remain focused on maintaining strong profitability while continuing to fund critical investments that further improve our technology leadership and position us to benefit as market demand accelerates.”\n\n“Looking ahead, we remain confident about the growth prospects for the semi industry and Entegris. The technology roadmaps continue to be opportunity-rich for Entegris as our customers drive for more complex device architectures and further miniaturization,” he said. “The resulting process complexity is making our expertise in materials science and materials purity increasingly valuable to our customers. This is expected to fuel our market outperformance and incremental content per wafer opportunities, as new nodes ramp in memory and advanced logic in the years to come.”\n\n**Quarterly Financial Results Summary**\n\n(in thousands, except percentages and per share data)  \n---  \n**GAAP Results**| **Sep 28, 2024**| **Sep 30, 2023**| **Jun 29, 2024**  \nNet sales| $807,694| $888,239| $812,652  \nGross margin - as a % of net sales| 46.0%| 41.3%| 46.2%  \nOperating margin - as a % of net sales| 16.9%| 13.2%| 16.0%  \nNet income| $77,582| $33,212| $67,696  \nDiluted earnings per common share| $0.51| $0.22| $0.45  \n**Non-GAAP Results**| **Sep 28, 2024**| **Sep 30, 2023**| **Jun 29, 2024**  \nAdjusted gross margin - as a % of net sales| 46.0%| 41.4%| 46.2%  \nAdjusted operating margin - as a % of net sales| 23.0%| 22.0%| 22.0%  \nAdjusted EBITDA - as a % of net sales| 28.8%| 26.5%| 27.8%  \nDiluted non-GAAP earnings per common share| $0.77| $0.68| $0.71  \n  \n**Fourth Quarter Outlook**\n\nFor the Company’s guidance for the fourth quarter ending December 31, 2024, the Company expects sales of $810 million to $840 million. The midpoint of this guidance range represents an 8% year-on-year increase, excluding the impact of divestitures. GAAP net income of $75 million to $86 million and diluted earnings per common share is expected to be between $0.49 and $0.56. On a non-GAAP basis, the Company expects diluted earnings per common share to range from $0.75 to $0.82, reflecting net income on a non-GAAP basis in the range of $114 million to $125 million. The Company also expects adjusted EBITDA of approximately 28.5% to 29.5% of sales.\n\n**Segment Results**\n\nThe Company currently operates in three segments:\n\n**Materials Solutions (MS):** MS provides materials-based solutions, such as chemical mechanical planarization slurries and pads, deposition materials, process chemistries and gases, formulated cleans, etchants and other specialty materials that enable our customers to achieve better device performance and faster time to yield, while providing for lower total cost of ownership.\n\n**Microcontamination Control (MC):** MC offers advanced filtration solutions that improve customers’ yield, device reliability and cost by filtering and purifying critical liquid chemistries and gases used in semiconductor manufacturing processes and other high-technology industries.\n\n**Advanced Materials Handling (AMH):** AMH develops solutions that improve customers’ yields by protecting critical materials during manufacturing, transportation, and storage including products that monitor, protect, transport and deliver critical liquid chemistries, wafers, and other substrates for a broad set of applications in the semiconductor, life sciences and other high-technology industries.\n\nOn October 30, 2024, Entegris realigned its operating structure to combine the MC and AMH segments, resulting in two reportable segments: the MS segment and the combined MC / AMH segment. As the realignment occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2024, Entegris has presented the results for its three reporting segments through Q3 2024. Beginning in the fourth quarter, Entegris will provide recasted financial information for the two segment structure.\n\n**Third-Quarter Results**\n\nEntegris will hold a conference call to discuss its results for the third quarter on Monday, November 4, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Participants should dial 800-579-2543 or +1 785-424-1789, referencing confirmation ID: ENTGQ324. Participants are asked to dial in 10 minutes prior to the start of the call.

Adjusted Net Sales, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Segment Profit, Adjusted Operating Income, non-GAAP Net Income, non-GAAP Adjusted Operating Margin and diluted non-GAAP Earnings Per Common Share, together with related measures thereof, are considered “non-GAAP financial measures” under the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company provides supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to better understand and manage its business and believes these measures provide investors and analysts additional and meaningful information for the assessment of the Company’s ongoing results. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures to assist in the evaluation of the performance of its business segments and to make operating decisions. Management believes that the Company’s non-GAAP measures help indicate the Company’s baseline performance before certain gains, losses or other charges that may not be indicative of the Company’s business or future outlook, and that non-GAAP measures offer a more consistent view of business performance. The Company believes the non-GAAP measures aid investors’ overall understanding of the Company’s results by providing a higher degree of transparency for such items and providing a level of disclosure that will help investors generally understand how management plans, measures and evaluates the Company’s business performance. Management believes that the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides greater consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors’ understanding of the Company’s historical operating trends by providing an additional basis for comparisons to prior periods. The reconciliations of GAAP net sales to Adjusted Net Sales (excluding divestitures), GAAP gross profit to Adjusted Gross Profit, GAAP segment profit to Adjusted Operating Income, GAAP net income to Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted EBITDA, GAAP net income and diluted earnings per common share to non-GAAP Net Income and diluted non-GAAP Earnings Per Common Share and GAAP outlook to non-GAAP outlook are included elsewhere in this release.\n\n**Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis news release contains “forward-looking statements.” The words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “project,” “should,” “may,” “will,” “would” or the negative thereof and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements.

(NASDAQ: ENTG), today reported its financial results for the Company’s third quarter ended September 28, 2024.\n\nBertrand Loy, Entegris’ president and chief executive officer, said: “The team delivered margins and non-GAAP EPS within our guidance range, despite third quarter sales coming in below expectations, with revenue growth excluding divestitures of 7 percent year-on-year.”\n\nMr. Loy added: “2024 is a transition year for the semiconductor industry. The market recovery is taking longer than anticipated and 2024 continues to be a year of limited technology transitions. Customers with significant exposure to AI applications are performing well, but the rest of the industry continues to be challenged. In this environment, we remain focused on maintaining strong profitability while continuing to fund critical investments that further improve our technology leadership and position us to benefit as market demand accelerates.”\n\n“Looking ahead, we remain confident about the growth prospects for the semi industry and Entegris. The technology roadmaps continue to be opportunity-rich for Entegris as our customers drive for more complex device architectures and further miniaturization,” he said. “The resulting process complexity is making our expertise in materials science and materials purity increasingly valuable to our customers. This is expected to fuel our market outperformance and incremental content per wafer opportunities, as new nodes ramp in memory and advanced logic in the years to come.”\n\n**Quarterly Financial Results Summary**\n\n(in thousands, except percentages and per share data)  \n---  \n**GAAP Results**| **Sep 28, 2024**| **Sep 30, 2023**| **Jun 29, 2024**  \nNet sales| $807,694| $888,239| $812,652  \nGross margin - as a % of net sales| 46.0%| 41.3%| 46.2%  \nOperating margin - as a % of net sales| 16.9%| 13.2%| 16.0%  \nNet income| $77,582| $33,212| $67,696  \nDiluted earnings per common share| $0.51| $0.22| $0.45  \n**Non-GAAP Results**| **Sep 28, 2024**| **Sep 30, 2023**| **Jun 29, 2024**  \nAdjusted gross margin - as a % of net sales| 46.0%| 41.4%| 46.2%  \nAdjusted operating margin - as a % of net sales| 23.0%| 22.0%| 22.0%  \nAdjusted EBITDA - as a % of net sales| 28.8%| 26.5%| 27.8%  \nDiluted non-GAAP earnings per common share| $0.77| $0.68| $0.71  \n  \n**Fourth Quarter Outlook**\n\nFor the Company’s guidance for the fourth quarter ending December 31, 2024, the Company expects sales of $810 million to $840 million. The midpoint of this guidance range represents an 8% year-on-year increase, excluding the impact of divestitures. GAAP net income of $75 million to $86 million and diluted earnings per common share is expected to be between $0.49 and $0.56. On a non-GAAP basis, the Company expects diluted earnings per common share to range from $0.75 to $0.82, reflecting net income on a non-GAAP basis in the range of $114 million to $125 million. The Company also expects adjusted EBITDA of approximately 28.5% to 29.5% of sales.\n\n**Segment Results**\n\nThe Company currently operates in three segments:\n\n**Materials Solutions (MS):** MS provides materials-based solutions, such as chemical mechanical planarization slurries and pads, deposition materials, process chemistries and gases, formulated cleans, etchants and other specialty materials that enable our customers to achieve better device performance and faster time to yield, while providing for lower total cost of ownership.\n\n**Microcontamination Control (MC):** MC offers advanced filtration solutions that improve customers’ yield, device reliability and cost by filtering and purifying critical liquid chemistries and gases used in semiconductor manufacturing processes and other high-technology industries.\n\n**Advanced Materials Handling (AMH):** AMH develops solutions that improve customers’ yields by protecting critical materials during manufacturing, transportation, and storage including products that monitor, protect, transport and deliver critical liquid chemistries, wafers, and other substrates for a broad set of applications in the semiconductor, life sciences and other high-technology industries.\n\nOn October 30, 2024, Entegris realigned its operating structure to combine the MC and AMH segments, resulting in two reportable segments: the MS segment and the combined MC / AMH segment. As the realignment occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2024, Entegris has presented the results for its three reporting segments through Q3 2024. Beginning in the fourth quarter, Entegris will provide recasted financial information for the two segment structure.\n\n**Third-Quarter Results**\n\nEntegris will hold a conference call to discuss its results for the third quarter on Monday, November 4, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

Adjusted Net Sales, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Segment Profit, Adjusted Operating Income, non-GAAP Net Income, non-GAAP Adjusted Operating Margin and diluted non-GAAP Earnings Per Common Share, together with related measures thereof, are considered “non-GAAP financial measures” under the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company provides supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to better understand and manage its business and believes these measures provide investors and analysts additional and meaningful information for the assessment of the Company’s ongoing results. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures to assist in the evaluation of the performance of its business segments and to make operating decisions. Management believes that the Company’s non-GAAP measures help indicate the Company’s baseline performance before certain gains, losses or other charges that may not be indicative of the Company’s business or future outlook, and that non-GAAP measures offer a more consistent view of business performance. The Company believes the non-GAAP measures aid investors’ overall understanding of the Company’s results by providing a higher degree of transparency for such items and providing a level of disclosure that will help investors generally understand how management plans, measures and evaluates the Company’s business performance. Management believes that the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides greater consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors’ understanding of the Company’s historical operating trends by providing an additional basis for comparisons to prior periods. The reconciliations of GAAP net sales to Adjusted Net Sales (excluding divestitures), GAAP gross profit to Adjusted Gross Profit, GAAP segment profit to Adjusted Operating Income, GAAP net income to Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted EBITDA, GAAP net income and diluted earnings per common share to non-GAAP Net Income and diluted non-GAAP Earnings Per Common Share and GAAP outlook to non-GAAP outlook are included elsewhere in this release.\n\n**Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis news release contains “forward-looking statements.” The words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “project,” “should,” “may,” “will,” “would” or the negative thereof and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements.
