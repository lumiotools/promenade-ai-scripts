(the “Company”) (Nasdaq: ALLK), a biotechnology company developing antibodies for the treatment of allergic, inflammatory and proliferative diseases, today provided a business update and reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Recent Allakos Events**\n\n  * Reported safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) results from the Phase 1 trial of subcutaneous (SC) AK006 in healthy volunteers. \n    * Bioavailability of subcutaneous AK006 was approximately 77%.\n    * Subcutaneous administered AK006 showed an estimated half-life of 12-22 days.\n    * Consistent with the IV formulation, skin biopsies taken from subcutaneous AK006 treated healthy volunteers showed high levels of receptor occupancy confirming AK006 reaches skin tissue mast cells.\n    * The 720 mg dose of AK006 showed 98% receptor occupancy at day 113 suggesting the potential for infrequent dosing.\n    * Single and multiple doses of IV AK006 and single dose subcutaneous AK006 up to 720 mg were well tolerated with a favorable safety profile.\n  * Completed enrollment of over 30 patients in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 trial of intravenous (IV) AK006 in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria. Data from these patients expected in early Q1 of 2025.\n\n\n\n**Upcoming Allakos Anticipated Milestones**\n\n  * Report randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled data on over 30 patients from the Phase 1 trial of AK006 in patients with CSU in early Q1 of 2025.\n\n\n\n**Cash Guidance**\n\nAllakos ended the third quarter of 2024 with $92.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Allakos’ financial outlook, restructuring activities and estimated cash runway as reported by the Company in January 2024 remain unchanged. The Company reiterates that it expects the restructuring activities will extend the cash runway into mid-2026 and to end 2024 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments in its previously stated $81 to $86 million guidance range. The Company has substantially completed its exit of the lirentelimab development program.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nAllakos ended the third quarter of 2024 with $92.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments resulting in a net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and investments of $30.4 million during the third quarter of 2024. Approximately $18 million of this third quarter decrease was paid in connection with exiting the lirentelimab development program.\n\nResearch and development expenses were $10.9 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $36.7 million in the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of $25.8 million. This quarter over quarter decrease is attributed to $16.4 million of lower contract research and development costs, primarily due to halting lirentelimab development and includes a $4.6 million decrease relating to a change in estimated manufacturing costs upon resolution of the related work orders with the vendor, $5.7 million of decreased compensation costs and a $3.7 million decrease in other research and development expenses.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $8.9 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $11.5 million for the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of $2.6 million. The quarter over quarter change included $2.4 million of decreased compensation costs and $0.2 million of decreased other general and administrative expenses.\n\nAllakos reported a net loss of $18.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $45.6 million in the third quarter of 2023. Net loss per basic and diluted share was $0.21 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $0.52 in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**About Allakos**\n\nAllakos is a clinical stage biotechnology company developing therapeutics that target immunomodulatory receptors present on immune effector cells involved in allergy, inflammatory and proliferative diseases. Activating these immunomodulatory receptors allows for the direct targeting of cells involved in disease pathogenesis and, in the setting of allergy and inflammation, has the potential to result in broad inhibition of inflammatory cells. The Company’s most advanced product candidate is AK006. AK006 targets Siglec-6, an inhibitory receptor expressed on mast cells. Mast cells are widely distributed in the body and play a central role in the inflammatory response. Inappropriately activated mast cells have been identified as key drivers in a number of severe diseases affecting the gastrointestinal tract, eyes, skin, lungs and other organs. In preclinical studies, AK006 appears to provide deep mast cell inhibition and, in addition to its inhibitory activity, reduce mast cell numbers.

(Nasdaq: ALLK), a biotechnology company developing AK006 for the treatment of mast cell-driven diseases, today announced results from the Phase 1 study of subcutaneous AK006 in healthy volunteers. AK006 is a Siglec-6 monoclonal antibody that selectively inhibits mast cells. Inappropriate activation of mast cells has been identified as a pathogenic driver of multiple diseases, including chronic spontaneous urticaria, food allergy and asthma.\n\n**Phase 1 Study Results of Subcutaneous AK006 in Healthy Volunteers**\n\n  * Bioavailability of subcutaneous AK006 was approximately 77%.\n  * Subcutaneous administered AK006 showed an estimated half-life of 12-22 days.\n  * Consistent with the IV formulation, skin biopsies taken from subcutaneous AK006 treated healthy volunteers showed high levels of receptor occupancy confirming AK006 reaches skin tissue mast cells. \n    * The 720 mg dose of AK006 showed 98% receptor occupancy at day 113 suggesting the potential for infrequent dosing.\n  * Single and multiple doses of IV AK006 and single dose subcutaneous AK006 up to 720 mg were well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile. In the safety profile to date: \n    * There were no serious adverse events (SAEs) in subjects on AK006.\n    * There were no treatment emergent adverse events leading to discontinuation of AK006.\n    * There were no dose limiting toxicities.\n    * The most common adverse events (≥10%) occurring more frequently in subjects on AK006 were headache and dysmenorrhea, all of which were mild-to-moderate in severity.\n\n\n\n**Phase 1 AK006 Study in Healthy Volunteers and in Patients with Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria **\n\nAK006 is being studied in an ongoing Phase 1 single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) trial that includes a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled CSU arm (NCT06072157). In June 2024 the company reported data from the SAD and MAD IV cohorts of the study. The data announced today are from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled SAD subcutaneous cohorts of the study. In these cohorts, healthy volunteers were randomized 6:2 to receive doses of subcutaneous AK006 or placebo. Two dosed levels, 150 mg and 720 mg, of subcutaneous AK006 were tested. The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single subcutaneous doses of AK006 in healthy volunteers, establish the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous AK006, and to explore Siglec-6 receptor occupancy on mast cells in skin biopsy samples.\n\nIn the CSU arm of the Phase 1 study, up to 60 adult patients with antihistamine refractory CSU (including patients with prior biologics treatment), will be randomized 2:1 to receive 720 mg of IV AK006 or placebo once every four weeks (Q4W). The primary efficacy analysis will be the change in the urticaria activity score (UAS7) at week 14. Data from approximately 30 patients is expected in early Q1 of 2025.\n\n**About AK006**\n\nAK006 is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody which activates the inhibitory receptor Siglec-6. Siglec-6 is found on the surface of mature mast cells and offers a way to selectively target mast cells. In preclinical experiments, AK006 inhibits IgE-dependent and IgE-independent mast cell activation including activation through IgE, MRGPRX2 and KIT receptors. In these experiments, AK006 drives deep mast cell inhibition and, in addition to its inhibitory activity, can reduce mast cell numbers via antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis in the presence of activated macrophages.\n\n**About Allakos**\n\nAllakos is a clinical stage biotechnology company developing therapeutics that target immunomodulatory receptors present on immune effector cells involved in allergy, inflammatory and proliferative diseases. Activating these immunomodulatory receptors allows for the direct targeting of cells involved in disease pathogenesis and, in the setting of allergy and inflammation, has the potential to result in broad inhibition of inflammatory cells. The Company’s most advanced antibody in ongoing clinical development is AK006. AK006 targets Siglec-6, an inhibitory receptor expressed on mast cells.

(the “Company”) (Nasdaq: ALLK), a biotechnology company developing antibodies for the treatment of allergic, inflammatory and proliferative diseases, today provided a business update and reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**Recent Allakos Events**\n\n  * Initiated the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 trial of intravenous (IV) AK006 in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria.\n  * Completed dosing in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled subcutaneous (SC) AK006 cohort in healthy volunteers.\n  * Reported safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) results from the Phase 1 trial of IV AK006 in healthy volunteers.\n  * Presented preclinical data at the 2024 European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Annual Congress on mast cell inhibition with AK006.\n\n\n\n**Upcoming Allakos Anticipated Milestones**\n\n  * Report safety, PK, and PD results from the Phase 1 trial of SC AK006 in healthy volunteers in Q3 2024.\n  * Report randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled data from the Phase 1 trial of AK006 in patients with CSU at year end 2024.\n\n\n\n**Cash Guidance** Allakos ended the second quarter of 2024 with $123.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Allakos’ financial outlook, restructuring activities and estimated cash runway as reported by the Company in January 2024 remain unchanged. The Company reiterates that the restructuring activities will extend the cash runway into mid-2026 and continues to expect to end 2024 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments in the range of $81 to $86 million. The Company reiterates that an estimated $30 million of closeout, severance and other costs will be paid in 2024 in connection with exiting the lirentelimab development program, of which we have spent $13 million to date in the first six months of 2024. Approximately $1 million of these payments were made in the second quarter of 2024.\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results** Allakos ended the second quarter of 2024 with $123.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments resulting in a net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and investments of $16.2 million during the second quarter of 2024.\n\nResearch and development expenses were $19.4 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to $27.3 million in the second quarter of 2023, a decrease of $7.9 million. This quarter over quarter decrease is attributed to $2.5 million of lower contract research and development costs, primarily due to halting lirentelimab development, $2.5 million of decreased compensation costs and a $2.9 million decrease in other research and development expenses.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $9.2 million for the second quarter of 2024 compared to $10.5 million for the second quarter of 2023, a decrease of $1.3 million. The quarter over quarter change included $0.7 million of decreased compensation costs and $0.6 million of decreased other general and administrative expenses.\n\nAllakos reported a net loss of $26.7 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to $35.1 million in the second quarter of 2023. Net loss per basic and diluted share was $0.30 for the second quarter of 2024 compared to $0.41 in the second quarter of 2023.\n\n**About Allakos**Allakos is a clinical stage biotechnology company developing therapeutics that target immunomodulatory receptors present on immune effector cells involved in allergy, inflammatory and proliferative diseases. Activating these immunomodulatory receptors allows for the direct targeting of cells involved in disease pathogenesis and, in the setting of allergy and inflammation, has the potential to result in broad inhibition of inflammatory cells. The Company’s most advanced product candidate is AK006. AK006 targets Siglec-6, an inhibitory receptor expressed on mast cells. Mast cells are widely distributed in the body and play a central role in the inflammatory response. Inappropriately activated mast cells have been identified as key drivers in a number of severe diseases affecting the gastrointestinal tract, eyes, skin, lungs and other organs. In preclinical studies, AK006 appears to provide deep mast cell inhibition and, in addition to its inhibitory activity, reduce mast cell numbers.
