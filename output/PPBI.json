(NASDAQ: PPBI) (the “Company” or “Pacific Premier”), the holding company of Pacific Premier Bank (the “Bank”), reported net income of $36.0 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2024, compared with net income of $41.9 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2024, and net income of $46.0 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023. \n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, the Company’s return on average assets (“ROAA”) was 0.79%, return on average equity (“ROAE”) was 4.91%, and return on average tangible common equity (“ROATCE”) (1) was 7.63%, compared to 0.90%, 5.76%, and 8.92%, respectively, for the second quarter of 2024, and 0.88%, 6.43%, and 10.08%, respectively, for the third quarter of 2023. Total assets were $17.91 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $18.33 billion at June 30, 2024, and $20.28 billion at September 30, 2023. \n\nSteven R. Gardner, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President of the Company, commented, “We delivered solid results in the third quarter with net income of $36.0 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.37. Our relationship managers and their branch banking colleagues' consistent efforts to generate new business opportunities while deepening existing client relationships contributed to an increase in non-interest-bearing deposits, which comprised 32% of total deposits at quarter-end. We leveraged these positive core deposit trends to further reduce higher-cost wholesale funding sources by decreasing brokered deposits by $184 million and repaying a $200 million FHLB (‘Federal Home Loan Bank’) term advance. \n\n“Third quarter asset quality remained strong, as total delinquencies decreased to 0.08% of loans and non-performing assets decreased to 0.22% of total assets. This performance positions us among the strongest in the industry in terms of asset quality. \n\n“Beginning in the second half of 2022, we proactively prioritized capital accumulation over balance sheet growth in light of the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, while at the same time continuing to provide best-in-class service to our clients. As a result, our peer-leading capital ratios have created significant optionality for our organization to pursue organic and strategic growth opportunities that can enhance long-term franchise value. \n\n“As the interest rate outlook has become more favorable, we are seeing incrementally better demand for new credit and have taken steps to bolster our loan production, as such, our loan pipeline has increased and we continue to build momentum heading into the fourth quarter. We are well-positioned to accelerate new originations in the coming quarters and we expect to stabilize the loan portfolio as we move into 2025.

The decrease in net interest income was primarily attributable to lower average loan balances and a higher cost of funds as borrowers continued deploying excess cash reserves to pay down and pay off higher-yielding commercial loan balances. \n\nThe net interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 10 basis points to 3.16%, from 3.26% in the prior quarter. The decrease was primarily due to a higher cost of funds. \n\nNet interest income for the third quarter of 2024 decreased $18.7 million, or 12.5%, compared to the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was attributable to lower average interest-earning asset balances and a higher cost of funds, partially offset by lower average interest-bearing liabilities balances and higher yields on average interest-earning assets, all the result of the prolonged higher interest rate environment in the past twelve months and the Company's strategy to prioritize capital accumulation. \n\n**PACIFIC PREMIER BANCORP, INC.

The decrease in provision for credit losses compared to the second quarter of 2024 was largely attributable to the decrease in loan balances and changes in the loan composition, partially offset by increases associated with economic forecasts. \n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**September 30,** |  **June 30,** |  **September 30,**  \n(Dollars in thousands) |  **2024** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**Provision for credit losses**  \nProvision for loan losses  |  $  |  (249  |  )  |  $  |  1,756  |  $  |  2,517   \nProvision for unfunded commitments  |  760  |  (505  |  )  |  1,386   \nProvision for held-to-maturity securities  |  (25  |  )  |  14  |  15   \nTotal provision for credit losses  |  $  |  486  |  $  |  1,265  |  $  |  3,918   \n  \n_Noninterest Income_\n\nNoninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $18.9 million, an increase of $645,000 from the second quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily due to a $748,000 increase in other income largely attributable to a $1.0 million decrease in Community Reinvestment Act (\"CRA\") investment loss. \n\nNoninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 increased $316,000 compared to the third quarter of 2023.

The increase was primarily due to a $3.9 million increase in legal and professional services, driven by the prior quarter's $4.0 million insurance claim receivable that decreased the expense during the period. \n\nNoninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 decreased by $540,000 compared to the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to an $809,000 decrease in other expense, a $775,000 decrease in marketing expense, and a $668,000 decrease in compensation and benefits, partially offset by a $1.7 million increase in deposit expense due to higher deposit administration service fees and a $737,000 increase in legal and professional services. \n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**September 30,** |  **June 30,** |  **September 30,**  \n(Dollars in thousands) |  **2024** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**Noninterest expense**  \nCompensation and benefits  |  $  |  53,400  |  $  |  53,140  |  $  |  54,068   \nPremises and occupancy  |  10,899  |  10,480  |  11,382   \nData processing  |  7,777  |  7,754  |  7,517   \nOther real estate owned operations, net  |  1  |  —  |  (4  |  )   \nFDIC insurance premiums  |  1,922  |  1,873  |  2,324   \nLegal and professional services  |  4,980  |  1,078  |  4,243   \nMarketing expense  |  860  |  1,724  |  1,635   \nOffice expense  |  1,046  |  1,077  |  1,079   \nLoan expense  |  734  |  840  |  476   \nDeposit expense  |  12,474  |  12,289  |  10,811   \nAmortization of intangible assets  |  2,762  |  2,763  |  3,055   \nOther expense  |  4,790  |  4,549  |  5,599   \nTotal noninterest expense  |  $  |  101,645  |  $  |  97,567  |  $  |  102,185   \n  \n_Income Tax_\n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, income tax expense totaled $11.7 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 24.5%, compared with income tax expense of $13.9 million and an effective tax rate of 24.9% for the second quarter of 2024, and income tax expense of $16.0 million and an effective tax rate of 25.8% for the third quarter of 2023. \n\n**BALANCE SHEET HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n_Loans_\n\nLoans held for investment totaled $12.04 billion at September 30, 2024, a decrease of $454.9 million, or 3.6%, from June 30, 2024, and a decrease of $1.24 billion, or 9.3%, from September 30, 2023. The decrease from June 30, 2024 was primarily due to lower loan production and fundings, increased prepayments and maturities, as well as a decrease in credit line draws, reflecting borrowers' continued preferences to utilize excess cash reserves to reduce outstanding debt. \n\nNew origination activity during the third quarter of 2024 decreased compared to the second quarter of 2024, and increased compared to the third quarter of 2023. New loan commitments totaled $104.1 million, and new loan fundings totaled $39.4 million, compared with $150.7 million in loan commitments and $58.6 million in new loan fundings for the second quarter of 2024, and $67.8 million in loan commitments and $25.6 million in new loan fundings for the third quarter of 2023. \n\nAt September 30, 2024, the total loan-to-deposit ratio was 83.1%, compared to

The year-over-year increase reflects higher rates on new originations and the repricing of loans as a result of the increases in benchmark interest rates. \n\nThe following table presents the composition of loan commitments originated during the quarters indicated: \n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**September 30,** |  **June 30,** |  **September 30,**  \n(Dollars in thousands) |  **2024** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**Investor loans secured by real estate**  \nCRE non-owner-occupied  |  $  |  5,200  |  $  |  3,818  |  $  |  2,900   \nMultifamily  |  8,730  |  6,026  |  3,687   \nConstruction and land  |  1,494  |  16,820  |  17,400   \nTotal investor loans secured by real estate  |  15,424  |  26,664  |  23,987   \n**Business loans secured by real estate(1) **  \nCRE owner-occupied  |  13,307  |  2,623  |  —   \nSBA secured by real estate (2) |  1,000  |  —  |  —   \nTotal business loans secured by real estate  |  14,307  |  2,623  |  —   \n**Commercial loans** (2)  \nCommercial and industrial  |  64,267  |  109,679  |  40,399   \nSBA non-real estate secured  |  —  |  1,281  |  406   \nTotal commercial loans  |  64,267  |  110,960  |  40,805   \n**Retail loans**  \nSingle family residential (3) |  8,945  |  7,698  |  3,019   \nConsumer  |  1,137  |  2,721  |  —   \nTotal retail loans  |  10,082  |  10,419  |  3,019   \nTotal loan commitments  |  $  |  104,080  |  $  |  150,666  |  $  |  67,811   \n  \n(1) |  Loans to businesses that are collateralized by real estate where the operating cash flow of the business is the primary source of repayment.   \n---|---  \n(2) |  Loans to businesses where the operating cash flow of the business is the primary source of repayment.   \n(3) |  Single family residential includes home equity lines of credit, as well as second trust deeds.   \n  \nThe weighted average interest rate on new loan commitments was 8.43% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 8.58% in the second quarter of 2024, and 8.01% in the third quarter of 2023. \n\n_Allowance for Credit Losses_\n\nAt September 30, 2024, our allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) on loans held for investment was $181.2 million, a decrease of $2.6 million from June 30, 2024 and a decrease of $6.9 million from September 30, 2023.

The decrease in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior quarter was primarily the result of $123.6 million in principal payments, amortization and accretion, and redemptions, partially offset by $113.3 million in purchases, primarily AFS U.S. Treasury securities, as well as an improvement of $10.2 million in AFS investment securities mark-to-market unrealized loss. \n\nThe decrease in investment securities from September 30, 2023 was the result of $1.52 billion in sales of AFS investment securities, primarily related to the investment securities portfolio repositioning during the fourth quarter of 2023, and $646.8 million in principal payments, amortization and accretion, and redemptions, partially offset by $1.27 billion in purchases of AFS and HTM investment securities and a decrease of $277.0 million in AFS securities mark-to-market unrealized loss. \n\n_Deposits_\n\nAt September 30, 2024, total deposits were $14.48 billion, a decrease of $146.7 million, or 1.0%, from June 30, 2024, and a decrease of $1.53 billion, or 9.5%, from September 30, 2023. The decrease from the prior quarter was primarily driven by reductions of $184.2 million in brokered certificates of deposit, as well as $39.1 million in money market and savings, partially offset by an increase of $66.4 million in retail certificates of deposit and $23.0 million in noninterest-bearing checking. \n\nThe decrease from September 30, 2023 was attributable to decreases of $1.14 billion in noninterest-bearing checking, $927.2 million in brokered certificates of deposit, and $68.1 million in money market and savings, partially offset by an increase of $447.0 million in retail certificates of deposit and $164.9 million in interest-bearing checking. \n\nAt September 30, 2024, non-maturity deposits (1)  totaled $12.21 billion, or 84.3% of total deposits, a decrease of $29.0 million, or 0.2%, from June 30, 2024, and a decrease of $1.05 billion, or 7.9%, from September 30, 2023. \n\nThe decrease from the third quarter of 2023 was attributable to clients utilizing their deposits to prepay or pay down loans, reduced funding needs, as well as redeploying funds into higher-yielding alternatives due to elevated benchmark interest rates. \n\nAt September 30, 2024, maturity deposits totaled $2.27 billion, a decrease of $117.8 million, or 4.9%, from June 30, 2024, and a decrease of $480.1 million, or 17.4%, from September 30, 2023. The decrease in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior quarter was primarily driven by the decrease of $184.2 million in brokered certificates of deposit, a direct result of the planned maturity and reduction of higher-costing brokered time deposits, partially offset by an increase of $66.4 million in retail certificates of deposit. The decrease from September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by decreases in brokered certificates of deposit, partially offset by increases of retail certificates of deposit. \n\nThe weighted average cost of total deposits for the third quarter of 2024 was 1.84%, compared to 1.73% for the second quarter of 2024, and 1.50% for the third quarter of 2023, both increases principally driven by higher pricing across deposit categories. The weighted average cost of non-maturity deposits (1) for the third quarter of 2024 was 1.27%, compared to 1.17% for the second quarter of 2024, and 0.89% for the third quarter of 2023. \n\nAt September 30, 2024, the end-of-period weighted average rate of total deposits was 1.80%, compared to 1.81% at June 30, 2024, and 1.52% at September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the end-of-period weighted average rate of non-maturity deposits was 1.26%, compared to 1.25% at June 30, 2024, and 0.96% at September 30, 2023. \n\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company’s FDIC-insured deposits as a percentage of total deposits was 60%, and the insured and collateralized deposits comprised 66% of total deposits, relatively consistent with 61% and 67%, respectively, at June 30, 2024, and 62% and 66%, respectively, at September 30, 2023. \n\n____________________ \n\n(1) |  Reconciliations of the non–GAAP measures are set forth at the end of this press release.   \n---|---  \n  \nThe following table presents the composition of deposits as of the dates indicated. \n\n**September 30,** |  **June 30,** |  **September 30,**  \n---|---|---  \n(Dollars in thousands) |  **2024** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**Deposit accounts**  \nNoninterest-bearing checking  |  $  |  4,639,077  |  $  |  4,616,124  |  $  |  5,782,305   \nInterest-bearing:   \nChecking  |  2,763,353  |  2,776,212  |  2,598,449   \nMoney market/savings  |  4,805,516  |  4,844,585  |  4,873,582   \nTotal non-maturity deposits (1) |  12,207,946  |  12,236,921  |  13,254,336   \nRetail certificates of deposit  |  1,972,962  |  1,906,552  |  1,525,919   \nWholesale/brokered certificates of deposit  |  300,019  |  484,181  |  1,227,192   \nTotal maturity deposits  |  2,272,981  |  2,390,733  |  2,753,111   \nTotal deposits  |  $  |  14,480,927  |  $  |  14,627,654  |  $  |  16,007,447   \nCost of deposits  |  1.84  |  %  |  1.73  |  %  |  1.50  |  %   \nCost of non-maturity deposits (1) |  1.27  |  1.17  |  0.89   \nNoninterest-bearing deposits as a percent of total deposits  |  32.0  |  31.6  |  36.1   \nNon-maturity deposits (1) as a percent of total deposits  |  84.3  |  83.7  |  82.8   \n  \n(1) |  Reconciliations of the non–GAAP measures are set forth at the end of this press release.   \n---|---  \n  \n_Borrowings_\n\nAt September 30, 2024, total borrowings amounted to $272.3 million, a decrease of $259.8 million from June 30, 2024, and a decrease of $859.4 million from September 30, 2023. Total borrowings at September 30, 2024 were comprised of $272.3 million of subordinated debt. The decrease in borrowings at September 30, 2024 as compared to June 30, 2024 was due to the early redemption of a $200.0 million FHLB term advance and the maturity of $60.0 million in subordinated debentures during the quarter. The decrease in borrowings at September 30, 2024 as compared to September 30, 2023 was due to a decrease of $800.0 million in FHLB term advances and the maturity of $60.0 million in subordinated debentures. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, our unused borrowing capacity was $8.83 billion, which consists of available lines of credit with FHLB and other correspondent banks, as well as access through the Federal Reserve Bank's discount window, which was not utilized during the third quarter of 2024. \n\n_Capital Ratios_\n\nAt September 30, 2024, our common stockholders' equity was $2.94 billion, or 16.44% of total assets, compared with $2.92 billion, or 15.95%, at June 30, 2024, and $2.86 billion, or 14.08%, at September 30, 2023.

There can be no assurance that future developments affecting the Company will be the same as those anticipated by management. The Company cautions readers that a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, such forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: the strength of the United States (\"U.S.\") economy in general and the strength of the local economies in which we conduct operations; adverse developments in the banking industry and the potential impact of such developments on customer confidence, liquidity, and regulatory responses to these developments; the effects of, and changes in, trade, monetary, and fiscal policies and laws, including interest rate policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; interest rate, liquidity, economic, market, credit, operational, and inflation risks associated with our business, including the speed and predictability of changes in these risks; our ability to attract and retain deposits and access to other sources of liquidity, particularly in a rising or high interest rate environment, and the quality and composition of our deposits; business and economic conditions generally and in the financial services industry, nationally and within our current and future geographic markets, including the tight labor market, ineffective management of the U.S. Federal budget or debt, or turbulence or uncertainty in domestic or foreign financial markets; the effect of acquisitions we have made or may make, including, without limitation, the failure to achieve the expected revenue growth and/or expense savings from such acquisitions, and/or the failure to effectively integrate an acquisition target into our operations; the timely development of competitive new products and services and the acceptance of these products and services by new and existing customers; possible impairment charges to goodwill, including any impairment that may result from increased volatility in our stock price; the impact of changes in financial services policies, laws, and regulations, including those concerning taxes, banking, securities, and insurance, and the application thereof by regulatory bodies; compliance risks, including any increased costs of monitoring, testing, and maintaining compliance with complex laws and regulations; the effectiveness of our risk management framework and quantitative models; the effect of changes in accounting policies and practices or accounting standards, as may be adopted from time-to-time by bank regulatory agencies, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other accounting standards setters; possible credit-related impairments of securities held by us; changes in the level of our nonperforming assets and charge-offs; the impact of governmental efforts to restructure the U.S. financial regulatory system; the impact of recent or future changes in the FDIC insurance assessment rate or the rules and regulations related to the calculation of the FDIC insurance assessment amount, including any special assessments; changes in consumer spending, borrowing, and savings habits; the effects of concentrations in our loan portfolio, including commercial real estate and the risks of geographic and industry concentrations; the possibility that we may reduce or discontinue the payments of dividends on our common stock; the possibility that we may discontinue, reduce or otherwise limit the level of repurchases of our common stock we may make from time to time pursuant to our stock repurchase program; changes in the financial performance and/or condition of our borrowers; changes in the competitive environment among financial and bank holding companies and other financial service providers; geopolitical conditions, including acts or threats of terrorism, actions taken by the United States or other governments in response to acts or threats of terrorism, and/or military conflicts, including the war between Russia and Ukraine, Israel and Hamas, and overall tension in the Middle East, and trade tensions, all of which could impact business and economic conditions in the United States and abroad; public health crises and pandemics and their effects on the economic and business environments in which we operate, including on our credit quality and business operations, as well as the impact on general economic and financial market conditions; cybersecurity threats and the cost of defending against them; climate change, including the enhanced regulatory, compliance, credit, and reputational risks and costs; natural disasters, earthquakes, fires, and severe weather; unanticipated regulatory or legal proceedings; and our ability to manage the risks involved in the foregoing. Additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements are discussed in the Company's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC and available at the SEC’s Internet site ([http://www.sec.gov](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&esheet=54141519&newsitemid=20241024034222&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&index=3&md5=0ebd6838d988b2fbb3db0dda58731e0f)). \n\nThe Company undertakes no obligation to revise or publicly release any revision or update to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date on which such statements were made. \n\n**PACIFIC PREMIER BANCORP, INC.

Management believes cost of non-maturity deposits is a useful measure to assess the Company's deposit base, including its potential volatility.   \n---  \n**Three Months Ended**  \n**September 30,** |  **June 30,** |  **September 30,**  \n(Dollars in thousands) |  **2024** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nTotal deposits interest expense  |  $  |  67,898  |  $  |  64,229  |  $  |  62,718   \nLess: certificates of deposit interest expense  |  23,202  |  21,115  |  13,398   \nLess: brokered certificates of deposit interest expense  |  5,484  |  6,506  |  19,174   \nNon-maturity deposit expense  |  $  |  39,212  |  $  |  36,608  |  $  |  30,146   \nTotal average deposits  |  $  |  14,655,478  |  $  |  14,941,573  |  $  |  16,543,917   \nLess: average certificates of deposit  |  1,944,685  |  1,830,516  |  1,439,531   \nLess: average brokered certificates of deposit  |  448,820  |  542,699  |  1,611,726   \nAverage non-maturity deposits  |  $  |  12,261,973  |  $  |  12,568,358  |  $  |  13,492,660   \nCost of non-maturity deposits  |  1.27  |  %  |  1.17  |  %  |  0.89  |  %   \n  \n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241024034222r1&sid=q4-prod&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nPacific Premier Bancorp, Inc.

We offer a full suite of products and services to a wide range of businesses. Our organic growth initiatives are focused\nprimarily on new and existing small- and middle-market business clients and to a lesser extent consumers. Our strategy is to leverage\ntechnology, apply our disciplined approach to business development, and provide best-in-class client service to reinforce our\nrelationship-based business banking model and deepen our existing client relationships.

Treasury management products and services are core to our commercial banking business, and we have developed\na comprehensive suite of products and service to meet the needs of our clients.

We believe\nthere are accretive opportunities to leverage our commercial banking relationships to expand the reach of our consumer banking\nproducts and services to new consumer clients, including commercial client employees, residents surrounding our 58 branch offices, and\nother key demographics.

Our primary lending business continues to focus on\nsmall- and medium-sized businesses and corporations through commercial business loans, lines of credit, Small Business Administration (“SBA”)\nloans, commercial real estate loans, agribusiness loans, and construction loans. Given our emphasis on risk management, during 2023, the level of\nnew loan originations moderated compared to 2022, a direct result of continued uncertainty in the operating environment.\nThe graphic below shows the new loans held for investment originations for each quarter beginning with the fourth quarter of 2021 and\nending with the fourth quarter of 2023:\n• Commercial and Industrial (“C&I”). We originate C&I loans secured by various business assets, including inventory, receivables,\nmachinery, and equipment. Loan types include revolving lines of credit, term loans, seasonal loans, and loans secured by liquid collateral\nsuch as cash deposits or marketable securities. At December 31, 2023, C&I loans, totaled $2.11 billion, constituting 15.9% of our gross\nloans held for investment. At December 31, 2023, we had commitments to extend additional credit on C&I loans up to $1.43 billion.\n• Commercial Owner-Occupied Real Estate Lending. We originate business loans secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate\n(“CRE”), such as light industrial buildings, mixed-use commercial properties, and small office locations for professional services located\nin our primary market areas. These loans are underwritten and analyzed based on the businesses cash flows. While real estate\nsecures these loans, real estate cash flows are not the primary source of repayment. At December 31, 2023, we had $2.50 billion of\nowner-occupied CRE secured loans, constituting 18.8% of our gross loans held for investment.\n8\nTable of Contents\n• Commercial Non-Owner-Occupied Real Estate Lending.

At\nDecember 31, 2023, we had $2.42 billion of non-owner-occupied CRE secured loans, constituting 18.2% of our gross loans held for\ninvestment.\n• Multifamily Residential Lending.

We do not originate traditional first lien home mortgage loans. We originate a limited number of consumer loans\n(generally for existing banking customers), which consist primarily of home equity lines of credit, small balance personal unsecured\nloans, and savings account secured loans. At December 31, 2023, retail loans totaled $74.7 million, constituting less than 1% of our\ngross loans held for investment.\nOur Loan Portfolio\nThe graphic below shows the diversification of our loans held for investment totaling $13.29 billion as of December 31, 2023 by loan type:\n9\nTable of Contents\nWe also have a granular and geographically diverse set of lending relationships.

The loans are stratified by number of units and physical location below:\n(1) Based on state of primary real property collateral if available, otherwise borrower address is used. All California information is for respective county.\nCreating Stockholder Value through Strategic Growth\nWe have a long history of creating value for stockholders through successfully executing transactions in a timely and effective manner. We\nhave been able to complete system conversions, branch consolidations, and staffing adjustments efficiently through the vast majority of our\ntransactions. Successful execution of this strategy has allowed us to realize the combined operational synergies and benefits to our organization\nquickly.\n11\nTable of Contents\nThe following chart depicts the increase in our tangible book value per share, which has more than doubled since 2013, reflecting successful\nexecution of our overall growth strategy:\nFor additional details, see “Non-GAAP measures” presented under Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations.\nLiquidity\nDeposits as a Primary Funding Source. Deposits represent our primary source of funds for our lending and investing activities. We have\ndeveloped a diverse and stable customer base that has an average relationship tenure of 12.8 years as of December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2023,\nour total commercial and consumer deposits were $15.00 billion, comprised of approximately 157,000 accounts and cash held in 29,000 custodial\naccounts. Non-maturity deposits as a percentage of total deposits was 84.7% as of December 31, 2023. Through our commercial banking teams, 58\nbranches, electronic banking, and call-center delivery channels, we offer a broad array of deposit and treasury management products and services. In\naddition, we are able to generate deposits through our specialty business lines. Our HOA & Property Banking division oversaw approximately\n38,400 client accounts and $2.43 billion in deposits, Pacific Premier Trust division had $16.9 billion in assets under custody with approximately\n34,600 client accounts and $1.20 billion in deposits, and our Commerce Escrow division oversaw approximately $333.7 million in deposits at\nDecember 31, 2023. Additionally, we have access to brokered deposits to supplement our deposit levels.\nThe Bank is a member of the IntraFi Network (“IntraFi”), which allows banking customers to access FDIC insurance protection on deposits\nthat exceed the FDIC insurance limit while receiving reciprocal deposits from other FDIC-insured banks. These reciprocal deposits acquired by the\nBank through IntraFi, including both the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (“CDARS”) and Insured Cash Service (“ICS”) programs,\noffer protection to depositors by fully insuring deposits with other network banks, thereby helping the Bank retain the full amount of the deposits on\nits balance sheet. It also enhances the Company’s funding stability.\n12\nTable of Contents\nThe charts below show our deposit mix as of December 31, 2023 and our average cost of total deposits compared to the period-end Federal\nFunds Rate for each quarter beginning with the first quarter of 2022 and ending with the fourth quarter of 2023. This period represents the recent\ninterest rate cycle when the Federal Reserve began increasing the target Federal Funds Rate in March 2022.\nSecurities Portfolio. A key part of our liquidity management strategy is investing in liquid, highly-rated municipal, mortgage-backed,\nagency, and U.S. Treasury securities. At December 31, 2023, our available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities totaled $1.14 billion, or 6% of total assets,\nwith an effective duration of 0.7 years and approximately 93% of investments with a credit rating of “A1 - A3” or higher. In November 2023, we\nelected to reposition our AFS securities portfolio by selling $1.26 billion of securities for an after-tax realized loss of $182.3 million. With this\ntransaction, we generated significant liquidity, which in turn, enabled us to reduce higher-cost wholesale funding sources by $817.0 million during\nthe fourth quarter of 2023. This reduction was through both a $617.0 million decrease in brokered deposit balances and a $200.0 million prepayment\nof an FHLB term advance. The securities portfolio repositioning produced immediate results in the fourth quarter of 2023, benefiting net interest\nincome and our net interest margin, while also resulting in capital ratios that remain among the strongest in the industry.\nAccess to Short-Term Borrowings. We strategically utilize short-term borrowings to manage our liquidity. The Bank maintains a line of\ncredit with the FHLB that provides for advances totaling up to 30% of the Bank’s total assets. In addition, as of December 31, 2023, the Bank has\nunsecured lines of credit with seven correspondent banks for a total amount of $390.0 million, access through the Federal Reserve Bank’s discount\nwindow to borrow $2.93 billion secured by investment securities and qualifying loans, as well as access through the Bank Term Funding Program\n(“BTFP”) to borrow $953.5 million, which will be discontinued as of March 11, 2024. The Corporation also has access to short-term borrowings\nthrough a $25.0 million line of credit it maintains with another bank.\n13\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity Position. We have built our organization to be dynamic and adaptable to various operating environments. At different points in an\neconomic cycle, we will enhance our liquidity position when we believe it to be appropriate. Our available liquidity at December 31, 2023, totaled\napproximately $9.91 billion, consisting of $1.23 billion of on-balance sheet liquidity and $8.68 billion of additional borrowing capacity. We believe\nwe have a well-diversified and granular customer base with low-cost transaction deposits that represents our relationship-based business model. The\ntotal liquidity coverage ratio of 1.9x to uninsured and uncollateralized deposits(1) as of December 31, 2023, is depicted below:\n*The Federal Reserve's BTFP is anticipated to expire as scheduled on March 11, 2024\n(1) Uninsured and uncollateralized deposits estimated as total deposits less federally-insured deposits, $732.6 million of collateralized municipal deposits, and $70.0 million of privately\ninsured deposits\nStrategically Accessing the Debt Capital Markets. We have a history of strategically and successfully accessing the capital markets to\nsupplement our liquidity and capital. Most recently, in June 2020, the Corporation issued $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.375%\nfixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2030 in an underwritten public offering. This offering followed the Corporation’s May 2019 issuance of\n$125.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2029 in an underwritten public offering. Prior to\nthat, the Corporation accessed the debt capital markets in 2014 with an issuance of $60 million aggregate principal amount of 5.75% subordinated\nnotes due 2024 in a private placement consummated in 2014. We had an aggregate amount of subordinated indebtedness of approximately $331.8\nmillion as of December 31, 2023.\nCapital\nCapital Levels. We continue to emphasize a risk management approach to capital management. Given the uncertain environment in the\nfinancial services industry since the pandemic, we have made capital accumulation a priority, and as of December 31, 2023, our capital ratios\nmeaningfully increased compared to December 31, 2022 and 2021, ranking in the top quartile of the Keefe, Bruyette and Woods (“KBW”) Nasdaq\nRegional Banking Index.\n14\nTable of Contents\nDividend and Share Repurchase Programs. In light of our growth over the last two decades, we have enhanced our ability to generate\ncapital through earnings. As a result, in January 2019, we announced the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend, which originated at $0.22 per share.\nSince then, we have increased the quarterly cash dividend amount four times, resulting in an annual cash dividend of $1.32 per share in 2023. In\nJanuary 2024, the Company announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.33 per share.\nEnterprise Risk Management\nWe place significant emphasis on risk management as an integral component of our corporate governance and organizational culture. We\nbelieve that our emphasis on risk management is critical to achieving our strategic goals and objectives.\nBoard Oversight of Enterprise Risk Management. Our Board has established an Enterprise Risk Committee to oversee the design and\nimplementation of our enterprise risk management program. Our Enterprise Risk Committee’s primary purposes are to (i) monitor and review our\nenterprise risk management framework and risk appetite for credit, market, liquidity, operational, information technology and information security,\ncompliance and legal, strategic, and reputation risks, and (ii) monitor and review the adequacy of our enterprise risk management functions.\nEnterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) Framework. Our management is responsible for the design, implementation, and maintenance of\nour ERM framework, which is designed to facilitate prudent risk-taking in pursuit of our strategic, business, and financial objectives, and to guide\ndecisions regarding the appropriate balance between risk and return considerations. Our Board approves our risk appetite statement, which sets forth\nthe amount and type of risks we are willing to accept. Our ERM framework provides the context for aligning our risk-taking activities with our risk\nappetite, including establishment of a risk-aware culture. We maintain policies and procedures that provide for risk identification, assessment,\nmeasuring, monitoring, and reporting. Tools applied in managing risk include, among others, limits and thresholds, underwriting and operating\nstandards, and delegated authority levels.\n15\nTable of Contents\nWe have adopted a three-line defense model to control risk-taking. Our first line of defense – our business lines and support functions –\nidentifies, assesses, monitors, and manages risk in these areas in accordance with established policies and procedures. Our second line of defense –\nindependent risk management, including ERM, information security, internal loan review, BSA/AML and compliance functions – oversees the risk\nmanagement activities of the first line of defense, and provides effective challenge to management’s decisions. Our third line of defense – Internal\nAudit – provides independent assurance to the Audit Committee of the Board on the design and effectiveness of our internal controls.\nCredit Risk Management and Underwriting Standards. We have adopted credit policies that establish guidelines for originating loans,\nmanaging our credit-related objectives, risk tolerance and portfolio concentration thresholds, and complying with applicable regulatory and statutory\nrequirements. Through these credit policies, we aim to strike a balance between our credit quality standards and our desire to maintain a prudent\nlevel of flexibility for our employees to structure loans that achieve our clients’ objectives. Our credit policies are maintained by Credit\nAdministration, which is led by our Chief Credit Officer, who reports directly to our Chief Risk Officer. Our credit policies are reviewed by the\nBoard at least annually.\nWe believe that our commitment to prudent credit risk management and underwriting standards allowed us to successfully navigate various\nperiods of economic volatility. The graphics below show our non-performing assets, past due loans, classified loans, and net charge-offs, each as a\npercentage of total loans, for the fourth quarter in 2022 and each quarter in 2023.\nAs a California state-chartered commercial bank, we are subject to Section 1481 of the California Financial Code (the “Financial Code”),\nwhich establishes the rules that limit the aggregate amount of secured and unsecured loans to a single borrower and its related interests to 25% and\n15%, respectively, of unimpaired capital and surplus. The eligibility of the personal property or collateral held as security is based on California\nregulations. Our credit policies establish internal lending limits below our $834.6 million legal lending limit for secured loans and $500.8 million\nlegal lending limit for unsecured loans as of December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2023, our largest aggregate outstanding balance of loans to one\nborrower was $269.4 million, primarily comprised of an asset-based line of credit.\n16\nTable of Contents\nESG Program Framework and Oversight. We are committed to integrating ESG considerations across our business practices and\noperations. Our priority is to mitigate risk and improve performance, while optimizing positive impact on our business, society, and the environment.\nOur commitment to ESG begins at the top with our Board of Directors. To assist in this effort, the Board has tasked the Nominating and Governance\nCommittee (composed entirely of independent directors) with responsibility for overseeing the Company’s ESG strategy, policies, and related\nprogram, including climate-related risk. While the Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for overall strategies, policies, and\ninitiatives related to ESG, specific aspects of ESG are also overseen by other Board committees. For example, the Compensation Committee reviews\nand approves objectives relevant to named executive officers’ short-term incentive compensation, including consideration of strategic objectives that\nmay include ESG-related initiatives. Climate and other ESG-related risks are integrated into our ERM framework, and the Enterprise Risk\nManagement Committee reviews and discusses the results of our enterprise-wide Risk and Control Self-Assessment (“RCSA”), which we use to\nidentify, assess, and report on risk exposures and the strength of our controls. The Audit Committee reviews ESG-related disclosures contained in our\nannual and quarterly reports. In addition, our full Board regularly receives reporting updates on our ESG program, initiatives, and progress.\nClimate Risk Management\nWe recognize the significant potential impact climate change may have on us, our clients, employees, shareholders, and the communities we\nserve. We are cognizant of our responsibility to better understand the impact of our operations on global climate change, and are taking steps to help\nensure our organization operates in a manner consistent with responsible environmental stewardship.\nPhysical Climate Risk. We are susceptible to losses and disruptions caused by fire (particularly in California, where we have a significant\nportion of our offices/branches), power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, and other extreme weather conditions.\nClimate change may contribute to or exacerbate these conditions. Our integrated business continuity management and disaster recovery programs\noversee enterprise resilience and provide crisis management and oversight to ensure employee, technology, and workspace resilience.\nThe increasing severity and frequency of physical climate risk events can also have an adverse impact on our borrowers. Some of these risks\nare partially addressed through insurance requirements. As the impact of climate change broadens, we will continue to assess and manage our\nexposure, layer additional climate-related factors to the analysis of credit requests of our real estate properties, and monitor insurance premiums and\navailability.\nTransition Climate Risk. Our borrowers are also susceptible to risks arising from the transition to a low-carbon economy, including policy\nchanges, energy costs, and shifts in market and customer sentiment. At this time, we have limited exposure to sectors with the highest transition risk\nlevels including oil, gas, and coal mining. However, we are aware that the effect of changing regulation and evolving consumer preferences may\naffect our depositors and borrowers in the future, creating credit, operational, strategic, and reputational risks for the Bank. We are working to further\nunderstand the risks and opportunities facing our clients, and we are growing our knowledge and capacity to support their transition toward a low\ncarbon economy.\nClimate-Related Risk Identification, Assessment, and Oversight. Emerging risks such as climate risk are currently identified and assessed\nby our ERM team. Climate-related risks are incorporated in our enterprise-wide RCSA, which is a process we use to identify, assess, and report on\nrisk exposures and the strength of controls. The RCSA also provides the basis for prioritizing risks and risk mitigation activities across business areas\nand risk categories. Results of the RCSA are used to drive management action plans and report key risks to executive management, the Enterprise\nRisk Committee, and the Board.\n17\nTable of Contents\nClimate-Related Financial Risk Management. We have established a cross-functional climate risk working group to oversee the Bank’s\napproach to manage climate-related risks. The climate risk working group is a cross-functional team that includes representation from the Bank’s\ncredit team and ESG & corporate responsibility team. A senior officer from the portfolio management and underwriting group who reports to the\nChief Credit Officer leads and coordinates all climate-related credit risk efforts, and the group is actively monitored and advised by both the Chief\nCredit Officer and the Chief Risk Officer.\nHuman Capital Resource Management\nOur culture is embodied in our Success Attributes: Achieve, Communicate, Improve, Integrity, and Urgency. We have managed our\norganization through significant challenges and delivered strong financial results, while at the same time supporting the well-being of our employees.\nWe believe in the value of teamwork and the power of diversity. We expect and encourage participation and collaboration, and we understand that we\nneed each other to be successful. We value accountability because it is essential to our success, and we accept responsibility to hold ourselves and\nothers accountable for meeting stakeholder commitments and achieving exceptional standards of performance.\nStaffing Model. Our goal is to provide our staff with careers instead of jobs. The majority of our staff are regular full-time employees. We\nalso employ a small population of part-time employees. As of December 31, 2023, we had 1,345 full-time equivalent employees.\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion. We believe that diversity of thought and experiences results in better outcomes for all of our stakeholders\nand empowers our employees to make more meaningful contributions within our Company and communities. We do not and will not tolerate\ndiscrimination in any form with respect to any aspect of employment. We developed a detailed strategy that incorporates our current initiatives and\nreflects our ongoing efforts to foster a more diverse, inclusive, and equitable workplace with target areas in workforce demographics, recruitment,\ntraining and education, and career development. Senior management reports to the Board on our diversity and inclusion initiatives on a regular basis.\nWe recognize that maintaining these standards requires constant effort, and we continue to explore (and where appropriate, adopt and invest in)\ninitiatives that will help ensure an environment where all employees are treated with dignity and respect.\nAs of December 31, 2023, 51% of the Company’s employees in vice president and above roles were female and 47% of employees in vice\npresident and above roles were from a minority group. At the management level, 57% of our managers were female and 43% of our managers were\nfrom a minority group. Aggregate percentage of women in our entire workforce was 60% and aggregate percentage of minority in our entire\nworkforce was 57%.\nEmployee Engagement. We value the voice of our employees and encourage feedback and continual improvement. Partnering with Gallup,\nwe conduct our annual employee engagement survey, reaffirming our commitment to ongoing assessment and improvement.\nHealth & Safety. We offer a health and well-being program that provides resources supporting health, financial, community, social,\nemotional, purpose, and career well-being. We also strive to provide each employee with a safe and healthy work environment. Our health and safety\nprogram consists of policies, procedures, and guidelines, and mandates all tasks be conducted in a safe and efficient manner complying with all local,\nstate, and federal safety and health regulations, and special safety concerns.

We also\ncompete in several broader regional and national markets through our HOA Banking, SBA, Franchise Lending, CRE and multifamily lines of\nbusiness, Commerce Escrow division, and our Pacific Premier Trust division.\nThe banking business is highly competitive. We compete for loans, deposits, 1031 exchange escrow services, self-directed IRA custodial\nservices, and employees, among other things. Our most direct competition for loans comes from larger regional and national banks, diversified\nfinance companies, and community banks that target the same customers as we do. In recent years, competition has increased from institutions not\nsubject to the same regulatory restrictions as domestic banks and bank holding companies. Those competitors include nonbank specialty lenders,\ninsurance companies, private investment funds, investment banks, financial technology companies, and other financial and non-financial institutions.\nThe trend has been exacerbated in the current higher interest rate environment in 2023 as customer preferences continue to evolve.\n19\nTable of Contents\nCompetition is based on a number of factors, including interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits, underwriting standards, loan\ncovenants, required guarantees, the scope and type of banking and financial services offered, including online and digital banking, customer service,\ntimely adoption of technological changes, and regulatory compliance. Many of our competitors are larger companies that offer a broader range of\nfinancial services and have substantial capital, technological, and marketing resources. Some of our competitors have substantial market positions\nand have access to a lower cost of capital or a less expensive source of funds. Because of economies of scale, our larger, nationwide competitors may\noffer loan pricing that is more attractive than what we are willing to offer.\nEconomic factors, along with legislative and technological changes, will have an ongoing impact on the competitive environment within the\nfinancial services industry. We work to anticipate and adapt to dynamic competitive conditions whether it is by developing and marketing innovative\nproducts and services, adopting or developing new technologies that differentiate our products and services, cross marketing, or providing highly\npersonalized banking services.\nWe differentiate ourselves in the marketplace through the quality of service we provide to borrowers while striving to maintain competitive\ninterest rates, loan fees, and other loan terms. We emphasize personalized relationship banking services and the efficient decision-making of our\nlending business units. We compete effectively based on our in-depth knowledge of our borrowers' industries and their business needs based upon\ninformation received from our borrowers' key decision-makers, analysis by our experienced professionals, and interaction between these two groups;\nour breadth of loan product offerings and flexible and creative approach to structuring products that meet our borrowers' business and timing needs;\nand our dedication to superior client service. However, we can provide no assurance as to the effectiveness of these efforts on our future business or\nresults of operations. Overall, our continued ability to anticipate and adapt to changing conditions and sufficiently enhance our services and banking\nproducts positions us to successfully compete in the marketplace.\nStock Information\nThe Corporation’s common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “PPBI.” There are 150 million\nauthorized shares of the Corporation’s common stock, with approximately 95.9 million shares issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2023.

Bank holding companies, such as the Corporation, and banks, such as the Bank, are subject to extensive regulation and supervision\nby federal and state regulators. Various requirements and restrictions under state and federal law affect our operations, including reserves against\ndeposits, ownership of deposit accounts, loans, investments, mergers and acquisitions, borrowings, dividends, locations of branch offices, and capital\nrequirements. The following is a summary of certain statutes and rules applicable to us. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the\nparticular statute and regulatory provision referred to below and is not intended to be an exhaustive description of all applicable statutes and\nregulations.\nAs a bank holding company, the Corporation is subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve. We are required to file with the\nFederal Reserve quarterly and annual reports and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require pursuant to the BHCA. The Federal\nReserve may conduct examinations of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. The Corporation is also a bank holding company within the\nmeaning of the Financial Code. As such, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are subject to examination by, and may be required to file reports with,\nthe DFPI.\nUnder changes made by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”), a bank holding company\nmust act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank.\nIn order to fulfill its obligations as a source of strength, the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a\ntroubled subsidiary bank. In addition, the Federal Reserve may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if\nthe bank holding company fails to commit resources to a subsidiary bank or if it undertakes actions that the Federal Reserve believes might\njeopardize the bank holding company’s ability to commit resources to such subsidiary bank. The Federal Reserve also has the authority to require a\nbank holding company to terminate any activity or to relinquish control of a nonbank subsidiary (other than a nonbank subsidiary of a bank) upon the\nFederal Reserve’s determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness and stability of any bank subsidiary\nof the bank holding company.\nAs a California state-chartered commercial bank and member of the Federal Reserve System, the Bank is subject to supervision, periodic\nexamination, and regulation by the DFPI and the Federal Reserve. The Bank’s deposits are insured by the FDIC through the Deposit Insurance Fund\n(“DIF”), with federal deposit insurance coverage of $250,000 per depositor for all insured depository institutions (“IDIs”). As a result of this deposit\ninsurance function, the FDIC also has certain supervisory authority and powers over the Bank as well as all other FDIC insured institutions. If, as a\nresult of an examination of the Bank, the regulators should determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings,\nmanagement, liquidity, or other aspects of the Bank’s operations are unsatisfactory or that the Bank or our management is violating or has violated\nany law or regulation, various remedies are available to the regulators. Such remedies include the power to enjoin unsafe or unsound practices, to\nrequire affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially\nenforced, to direct an increase in capital, to restrict growth, to assess civil monetary penalties, to remove officers and directors, and ultimately,\nrequest the FDIC terminate the Bank’s deposit insurance. As a California-chartered commercial bank, the Bank is also subject to certain provisions\nof California law.\n21\nTable of Contents\nLegislative and regulatory initiatives, which necessarily impact the regulation of the financial services industry, are introduced from time to\ntime. We cannot predict whether or when potential legislation or new regulations will be enacted, and if enacted, the effect that new legislation or\nany implemented regulations and supervisory policies would have on our financial condition and results of operations. The Dodd-Frank Act, by way\nof example, contains a comprehensive set of provisions designed to govern the practices and oversight of financial institutions and other participants\nin the financial markets. The Dodd-Frank Act made extensive changes in the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies. Some\nof the changes brought about by the Dodd-Frank Act have been modified by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act\nof 2018, signed into law on May 24, 2018. The Dodd-Frank Act has increased the regulatory burden and compliance costs of the Company.\nMoreover, bank regulatory agencies can be more aggressive in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations, which could result in an\nincreased issuance of enforcement actions to financial institutions requiring action to address credit quality, liquidity and risk management, and\ncapital adequacy, as well as other safety and soundness concerns.\nActivities of Bank Holding Companies. The activities of bank holding companies are generally limited to the business of banking,\nmanaging, or controlling banks, and other activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to banking or managing or\ncontrolling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Bank holding companies that qualify and register as “financial holding companies” are also able\nto engage in certain additional financial activities, such as merchant banking, and securities and insurance underwriting, subject to limitations set\nforth in federal law. We are not at this date a “financial holding company.”\nThe BHCA requires a bank holding company to obtain prior approval of the Federal Reserve before: (i) taking any action that causes a bank\nto become a controlled subsidiary of the bank holding company; (ii) acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of voting shares of any bank or\nbank holding company, if the acquisition results in the acquiring bank holding company having control of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of\nany class of voting securities of such bank or bank holding company, unless such bank or bank holding company is majority-owned by the acquiring\nbank holding company before the acquisition; (iii) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of a bank; or (iv) merging or consolidating with\nanother bank holding company.\nPermissible Activities of the Bank. Because California permits commercial banks chartered by the state to engage in any activity\npermissible for national banks, the Bank can form subsidiaries to engage in activates “closely related to banking” or “nonbanking” activities and\nexpanded financial activities. However, to form a financial subsidiary, the Bank must be well capitalized and would be subject to the same capital\ndeduction, risk management and affiliate transaction rules as applicable to national banks. Generally, a financial subsidiary is permitted to engage in\nactivities that are “financial in nature” or incidental thereto, even though they are not permissible for the national bank to conduct directly within the\nbank. The definition of “financial in nature” includes, among other items, underwriting, dealing in, or making a market in securities, including, for\nexample, distributing shares of mutual funds. The subsidiary may not, however, engage as principal in underwriting insurance (other than credit life\ninsurance), issue annuities, or engage in real estate development, investment, or merchant banking.\nIncentive Compensation. Federal banking agencies have issued guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the\nincentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive\nrisk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, is based upon the\nkey principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking\nbeyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management,\nand (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors. In\naccordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal banking agencies prohibit incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate\nrisk taking by covered financial institutions (generally institutions, like us, that have over $1 billion in assets) and are deemed to be excessive, or that\nmay lead to material losses.\n22\nTable of Contents\nThe Federal Reserve will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of\nbanking organizations, such as the Company, that are not “large, complex banking organizations.” These reviews will be tailored to each\norganization based on the scope and complexity of the organization’s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The\nfindings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization’s\nsupervisory ratings, which can affect the organization’s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against\na banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the\norganization’s safety and soundness, and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.\nThe scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators’ policies on executive compensation may continue to evolve in the near future. It\ncannot be determined at this time whether compliance with such policies will adversely affect the Company’s ability to hire, retain, and motivate its\nkey employees.\nCapital Requirements. Bank holding companies and banks are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by state and\nfederal agencies. These agencies may establish higher minimum requirements if, for example, a banking organization previously has received special\nattention or has a high susceptibility to interest rate risk. Risk-based capital requirements determine the adequacy of capital based on the risk inherent\nin various classes of assets and off-balance sheet items. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve must apply consolidated capital\nrequirements to depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent than those currently applied to depository institutions. The Dodd-\nFrank Act additionally requires capital requirements to be countercyclical so that the required amount of capital increases in times of economic\nexpansion and decreases in times of economic contraction, consistent with safety and soundness.\nUnder federal regulations, bank holding companies and banks must meet certain risk-based capital requirements. Effective as of January 1,\n2015, Basel III required financial institutions to maintain a minimum “capital conservation buffer” on top of each of the minimum risk-based capital\nratios to avoid restrictions on capital distributions such as dividends and equity repurchases and other payments such as discretionary bonuses to\nexecutive officers.\nAs the minimum capital conservation buffer fully phased-in on January 1, 2019, Basel III subjects banks to the following risk-based capital\nrequirements:\n• a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% capital conservation buffer, or 7%;\n• a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer, or 8.5%;\n• a minimum ratio of Total (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer, or\n10.5%; and\n• a minimum leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to balance sheet exposures plus certain off-balance sheet\nexposures.\nThe Basel III final framework provides for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the\nrequirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in non-\nconsolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the\naggregate exceed 15% of CET1. Basel III also includes, as part of the definition of CET1 capital, a requirement that banking institutions include the\namount of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), which primarily consists of unrealized gains and losses on AFS securities, which\nare not required to be treated as other-than-temporary impairment, net of tax, in calculating regulatory capital. Banking institutions had the option to\nopt out of including AOCI in CET1 capital if they elected to do so in their first regulatory report following January 1, 2015. As permitted by Basel\nIII, the Company and the Bank have elected to exclude AOCI from CET1.\n23\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, goodwill and most intangible assets are deducted from Tier 1 capital. For purposes of applicable total risk-based capital\nregulatory guidelines, Tier 2 capital (sometimes referred to as “supplementary capital”) is defined to include, subject to limitations: perpetual\npreferred stock not included in Tier 1 capital, intermediate-term preferred stock and any related surplus, certain hybrid capital instruments, perpetual\ndebt and mandatory convertible debt securities, allowance for credit losses, and intermediate-term subordinated debt instruments. The maximum\namount of qualifying Tier 2 capital is 100% of qualifying Tier 1 capital. For purposes of determining total capital under federal guidelines, total\ncapital equals Tier 1 capital, plus qualifying Tier 2 capital, minus investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, reciprocal holdings of bank holding\ncompany capital securities, and deferred tax assets and other deductions.\nWe had outstanding subordinated debentures in the aggregate amount of $331.8 million, as of December 31, 2023. Of this amount, $271.9\nmillion qualifies as Tier 2 capital for the Company.\nBasel III changed the manner of calculating risk-weighted assets. New methodologies for determining risk-weighted assets in the general\ncapital rules are included, including revisions to recognition of credit risk mitigation, including a greater recognition of financial collateral and a\nwider range of eligible guarantors. They also include risk weighting of equity exposures and past due loans; and higher (greater than 100%) risk\nweighting for certain commercial real estate exposures that have higher credit risk profiles, including higher loan-to-value (“LTV”) and equity\ncomponents. In particular, loans categorized as “high-volatility commercial real estate” loans (“HVCRE loans”), as defined pursuant to applicable\nfederal regulations, are required to be assigned a 150% risk weighting, and require additional capital support.\nIn addition to the uniform risk-based capital guidelines and regulatory capital ratios that apply across the industry, the regulators have the\ndiscretion to set individual minimum capital requirements for specific institutions at rates significantly above the minimum guidelines and ratios.\nFuture changes in regulations or practices could further reduce the amount of capital recognized for purposes of capital adequacy. Such a change\ncould affect our ability to grow and could restrict the amount of profits, if any, available for the payment of dividends.\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal banking agencies to adopt capital requirements that address the risks that the activities\nof an institution pose to the institution and the public and private stakeholders, including risks arising from certain enumerated activities.\nIn December 2017, the Basel Committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory\nreforms (the standards are commonly referred to as “Basel IV”). Among other things, these standards revise the Basel Committee’s standardized\napproach for credit risk (including recalibrating risk weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain “unconditionally cancellable\ncommitments,” such as unused credit card lines of credit) and provides a new standardized approach for operational risk capital. Under the Basel\nframework, these standards generally became effective on January 1, 2022, with an aggregate output floor phasing in through January 1, 2027. Under\nthe current U.S. capital rules, operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches institutions, and not to the\nCorporation or the Bank. The impact of Basel IV on us will depend on the manner in which it is implemented by the federal bank regulators.\nIn 2018, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a variety of proposals and made statements concerning regulatory capital standards.\nThese proposals touched on such areas as commercial real estate exposure, credit loss allowances under generally accepted accounting principles,\nand capital requirements for covered swap entities, among others. Public statements by key agency officials have also suggested a revisiting of\ncapital policy and supervisory approaches on a going-forward basis. In July 2019, the federal bank regulators adopted a final rule that simplifies the\ncapital treatment for certain deferred tax assets, mortgage servicing assets, investments in non-consolidated financial entities and minority interests\nfor banking organizations, such as the Corporation and the Bank, that are not subject to the advanced approaches requirements. The adoption of these\nregulations and supervisory approaches did not have an material impact on the Corporation’s or the Bank’s capital ratios, earnings, shareholder’s\nequity, or its ability to pay dividends, effect stock repurchases or pay discretionary bonus to executive officers.\n24\nTable of Contents\nIn February 2019, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies approved a final rule modifying their regulatory capital rules and providing an\noption to phase-in over a three-year period the Day 1 adverse regulatory capital effects of Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) accounting\nstandard. Additionally, in March 2020, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that provides banking organizations an\noption to delay the estimated CECL impact on regulatory capital for an additional two years for a total transition period of up to five years to provide\nregulatory relief to banking organizations to better focus on supporting lending to creditworthy households and businesses in light of recent strains\non the U.S. economy as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The capital relief in the interim is calibrated to approximate the difference in\nallowances under CECL relative to the incurred loss methodology for the first two years of the transition period using a 25% scaling factor. The\ncumulative difference at the end of the second year of the transition period is then phased in to regulatory capital at 25% per year over a three-year\ntransition period. The final rule was adopted and became effective in September 2020. The Company implemented the CECL model commencing\nJanuary 1, 2020 and elected to phase in the full effect of CECL on regulatory capital over the five-year transition period.\nPrompt Corrective Action Regulations. The federal banking regulators are required to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to\ncapital-deficient institutions. Federal banking regulations define, for each capital category, the levels at which institutions are “well capitalized,”\n“adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” and “critically undercapitalized.” Under applicable regulations, the\nBank was “well capitalized,” which means it had a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5% or higher; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or\nhigher; a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or higher; a leverage ratio of 5.0% or higher; and was not subject to any written agreement, order, or\ndirective requiring it to maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.\nAs noted above, Basel III integrates the capital requirements into the prompt corrective action category definitions. The following capital\nrequirements have applied to the Bank since January 1, 2015.\nCommon Equity\nTotal Risk-Based Tier 1 Risk-Based Tier 1 (CET1) Tangible Equity Supplemental\nCapital Category Capital Ratio Capital Ratio Capital Ratio Leverage Ratio to Assets Leverage Ratio\nWell Capitalized 10% or greater 8% or greater 6.5% or greater 5% or greater n/a n/a\nAdequately Capitalized 8% or greater 6% or greater 4.5% or greater 4% or greater n/a 3% or greater\nUndercapitalized Less than 8% Less than 6% Less than 4.5% Less than 4% n/a Less than 3%\nSignificantly Undercapitalized Less than 6% Less than 4% Less than 3% Less than 3% n/a n/a\nCritically Undercapitalized n/a n/a n/a n/a Less than 2% n/a\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Bank and Corporation exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and exceeded the minimum CET 1, Tier 1,\nand total capital ratio, inclusive of the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer, of 7.0%, 8.5%, and 10.5%, respectively. See Note 2 – Regulatory\nCapital Requirements and Other Regulatory Matters of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for a discussion of the Bank’s and Corporation’s capital ratios.\nAn institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is\ndetermined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. An\ninstitution’s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations, and the capital category may not\nconstitute an accurate representation of the institution’s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes.\n25\nTable of Contents\nIn the event an institution becomes “undercapitalized,” it must submit a capital restoration plan. The capital restoration plan will not be\naccepted by the regulators unless each company having control of the undercapitalized institution guarantees the subsidiary’s compliance with the\ncapital restoration plan up to a certain specified amount. Any such guarantee from a depository institution’s holding company is entitled to a priority\nof payment in bankruptcy. The aggregate liability of the holding company of an undercapitalized bank is limited to the lesser of 5% of the\ninstitution’s assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount necessary to cause the institution to be “adequately capitalized.” The bank\nregulators have greater power in situations where an institution becomes “significantly” or “critically” undercapitalized or fails to submit a capital\nrestoration plan. In addition to requiring undercapitalized institutions to submit a capital restoration plan, bank regulations contain broad restrictions\non certain activities of undercapitalized institutions including asset growth, acquisitions, branch establishment, and expansion into new lines of\nbusiness. With certain exceptions, an IDI is prohibited from making capital distributions, including dividends, and is prohibited from paying\nmanagement fees to control persons if the institution would be undercapitalized after any such distribution or payment.\nAs an institution’s capital decreases, the regulators’ enforcement powers become more severe. A significantly undercapitalized institution is\nsubject to mandated capital raising activities, restrictions on interest rates paid and transactions with affiliates, removal of management, and other\nrestrictions. A regulator has limited discretion in dealing with a critically undercapitalized institution and is virtually required to appoint a receiver or\nconservator.\nBanks with risk-based capital and leverage ratios below the required minimums may also be subject to certain administrative actions,\nincluding the termination of deposit insurance upon notice and hearing, or a temporary suspension of insurance without a hearing in the event the\ninstitution has no tangible capital.\nIn addition to the federal regulatory capital requirements described above, the DFPI has authority to take possession of the business and\nproperties of a bank in the event that the tangible stockholders’ equity of a bank is less than the greater of (i) 4% of the bank’s total assets or (ii) $1.0\nmillion.\nDividends. It is the Federal Reserve’s policy that bank holding companies, such as the Corporation, should generally pay dividends on\ncommon stock only out of income available over the past year, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s\nexpected future needs and financial condition. It is also the Federal Reserve’s policy that bank holding companies should not maintain dividend\nlevels that undermine their ability to be a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. Additionally, in consideration of the current financial and\neconomic environment, the Federal Reserve has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has\ndiscouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong. Our annualized common\nequity cash dividend was $1.32 per share in 2023, consistent with $1.32 per share in 2022. On January 27, 2024, the Corporation's Board of\nDirectors declared a $0.33 per share dividend, payable on February 16, 2024 to stockholders of record on February 9, 2024. The Corporation\nanticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future, although there can be no assurance that payment of such dividends will\ncontinue or that they will not be reduced. The payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Corporation’s Board of\nDirectors and will depend on the Corporation’s operating results and financial condition, regulatory limitations, economic and operating environment\noutlook, tax considerations, and other factors. Interest on deposits will be paid prior to payment of dividends on the Corporation’s common stock.\n26\nTable of Contents\nThe Bank’s ability to pay dividends to the Corporation is subject to restrictions set forth in the Financial Code. The Financial Code provides\nthat a bank may not make a cash distribution to its stockholders in excess of the lesser of a bank’s (1) retained earnings; or (2) net income for its last\nthree fiscal years, less the amount of any distributions made by the bank or by any majority-owned subsidiary of the bank to the stockholders of the\nbank during such period. However, a bank may, with the approval of the DFPI, make a distribution to its stockholders in an amount not exceeding\nthe greatest of (a) its retained earnings; (b) its net income for its last fiscal year; or (c) its net income for its current fiscal year. In the event that bank\nregulators determine that the stockholders’ equity of a bank is inadequate or that the making of a distribution by the bank would be unsafe or\nunsound, the regulators may order the bank to refrain from making a proposed distribution. The payment of dividends could, depending on the\nfinancial condition of a bank, be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice.\nApproval of the Federal Reserve is required for payment of any dividend by a state chartered bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve,\nsuch as the Bank, if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its retained net income for that year\ncombined with its retained net income for the preceding two years. In addition, a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater\nthan its undivided profits without regulatory and shareholder approval. The Bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividend that\nwould cause it to become undercapitalized.\nThe Corporation’s ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to the guidance set forth in Federal Reserve’s Supervision and Regulations\nletter 09-4 (“SR 09-4”). SR 09-4 heightens expectations that a BHC will inform and consult with Federal Reserve supervisory staff sufficiently in\nadvance of declaring and paying a dividend that could raise safety and soundness concerns (e.g., declaring and paying a dividend that exceeds\nearnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid). BHC should serve as a source of managerial and financial strength to its subsidiary\nbanks, and, consistent with this premise, hold capital commensurate with its overall risk profile. The board of directors of a BHC should assess\ncarefully, among other things, capital adequacy and ensure that the dividend level is prudent relative to the organization’s financial position and is\nnot based on overly optimistic earnings scenarios. As a general matter, the board of directors of a BHC should inform the Federal Reserve and should\neliminate, defer, or significantly reduce the BHC’s dividends if (1) the BHC’s net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of\ndividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (2) the BHC’s prospective rate of earnings retention is not\nconsistent with the BHC’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (3) the BHC will not meet, or is in danger of not\nmeeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. Failure to do so could result in a supervisory finding that the organization is operating in an\nunsafe and unsound manner.\nFDIC Insurance of Certain Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC. The Bank is an FDIC insured financial institution whereby the FDIC\nprovides deposit insurance for a certain maximum dollar amount per customer. The Bank, as is true for all FDIC insured banks, is subject to deposit\ninsurance assessments as determined by the FDIC.\nUnder the FDIC’s risk-based deposit premium assessment system, the assessment rates for an IDI are determined by an assessment rate\ncalculator, which is based on a number of elements that measure the risk each institution poses to the DIF. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, the\ncalculated assessment rate is applied to average consolidated assets less the average tangible equity of the IDI during the assessment period to\ndetermine the dollar amount of the quarterly assessment. Under the current system, premiums are assessed quarterly and could increase if, for\nexample, criticized loans and leases and/or other higher risk assets increase or balance sheet liquidity decreases. In addition, the FDIC can impose\nspecial assessments in certain instances. Deposit insurance assessments fund the DIF.\n27\nTable of Contents\nOn October 18, 2022, the FDIC adopted a final rule that increased initial base deposit insurance assessment rates by 2 basis points,\nbeginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. Due to the decline in the DIF reserve ratio below the statutory minimum of 1.35% as of\nJune 30, 2020, caused by extraordinary growth in insured deposits during the first and second quarters of 2020, the FDIC established a Restoration\nPlan in September 2020 to restore the DIF reserve ratio to meet or exceed the statutory minimum of 1.35% within eight years. This 2020 plan did not\ninclude an increase in the deposit insurance assessment rate. On June 21, 2022, however, the FDIC adopted an Amended Restoration Plan and notice\nof proposed rulemaking to increase the deposit insurance assessment rates as it was otherwise at risk of not reaching the statutory minimum by the\nstatutory deadline of September 30, 2028. The proposed rule was adopted as final without change.\nAlso, in the final rule adopted on October 18, 2022, the FDIC incorporated Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2022-02, Financial\nInstruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures in the risk-based deposit insurance assessment\nsystem applicable to all large and highly complex IDIs. In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, which eliminates accounting guidance for\ntroubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) and introduces new disclosures and enhances existing disclosures concerning certain loan refinancings and\nrestructurings when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The FDIC final rule amends the assessment regulations to include a new term,\n“modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty,” in two financial measures—the underperforming assets ratio and the higher-risk assets\nratio—used to determine deposit insurance assessments for large and highly complex IDIs. This final rule was effective January 1, 2023, and\napplicable to the first quarterly assessment period of 2023.\nOn November 16, 2023, the FDIC adopted a final rule on special assessment to recover the losses to the DIF from the protection of\nuninsured depositors following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank, Santa Clara, CA, and Signature Bank, New York, NY during March 2023. The\nassessment base for the special assessment is equal to an IDI’s estimated uninsured deposits, reported for the quarter that ended December 31, 2022,\nadjusted to exclude the first $5 billion in estimated uninsured deposits from the IDI, or for IDIs that are part of a holding company with one or more\nsubsidiary IDIs, at the banking organization level. The FDIC will collect the special assessment at an annual rate of approximately 13.4 basis points,\nover eight quarterly assessment periods. The FDIC retains the ability to cease collection early, extend the special assessment collection period, and\nimpose a final shortfall special assessment to collect the difference between actual losses and the amounts collected after the receiverships for Silicon\nValley Bank and Signature Bank terminate. The final rule will be effective April 1, 2024, with the first collection for the special assessment reflected\non the invoice for the first quarterly assessment period of 2024 with a payment date of June 28, 2024.\nBased on the current FDIC insurance assessment methodology, our FDIC insurance premium expense was $11.4 million for 2023, $5.8\nmillion for 2022, and $5.3 million in 2021. FDIC insurance premium expense in 2023 includes $2.1 million for the FDIC special assessment.\nTransactions with Related Parties. Depository institutions are subject to the restrictions contained in the Federal Reserve Act (the “FRA”)\nwith respect to loans to directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders. Under the FRA, loans to directors, executive officers, and\nstockholders who own more than 10% of a depository institution and certain affiliated entities of any of the foregoing, may not exceed, together with\nall other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated entities, the institution’s loans-to-one-borrower limit as discussed in the above section.\nFederal regulations also prohibit loans above amounts prescribed by the appropriate federal banking agency to directors, executive officers, and\nstockholders who own more than 10% of an institution, and their respective affiliates, unless such loans are approved in advance by a majority of the\nboard of directors of the institution. Any “interested” director may not participate in the voting. The proscribed loan amount, which includes all other\noutstanding loans to such person, as to which such prior board of director approval is required, is the greater of $25,000, or 5%, of capital and\nsurplus up to $500,000. The Federal Reserve also requires that loans to directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders be made on terms\nsubstantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to non-executive employees of the bank and must not involve more than the normal risk\nof repayment. There are additional limits on the amount a bank can loan to an executive officer.\n28\nTable of Contents\nTransactions between a bank and its “affiliates” are quantitatively and qualitatively restricted under Sections 23A and 23B of the FRA.\nSection 23A restricts the aggregate amount of covered transactions with any individual affiliate to 10% of the capital and surplus of the financial\ninstitution. The aggregate amount of covered transactions with all affiliates is limited to 20% of the institution’s capital and surplus. Certain\ntransactions with affiliates are required to be secured by collateral in an amount and of a type described in Section 23A, and the purchase of low\nquality assets from affiliates are generally prohibited. Section 23B generally provides that certain transactions with affiliates, including loans and\nasset purchases, must be on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to the\ninstitution as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies. The Federal Reserve has promulgated\nRegulation W, which codifies prior interpretations under Sections 23A and 23B of the FRA and provides interpretive guidance with respect to\naffiliate transactions. Affiliates of a bank include, among other entities, a bank’s holding company and companies that are under common control\nwith the bank. The Corporation is considered to be an affiliate of the Bank.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act generally enhanced the restrictions on transactions with affiliates under Section 23A and 23B of the FRA, including an\nexpansion of the definition of “covered transactions” and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered\ncredit transactions must be satisfied. Insider transaction limitations are expanded through the strengthening of loan restrictions to insiders and the\nexpansion of the types of transactions subject to the various limits, including derivatives transactions, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase\nagreements, and securities lending or borrowing transactions. Restrictions are also placed on certain asset sales to and from an insider to an\ninstitution, including requirements that such sales be on market terms and, in certain circumstances, approved by the institution’s board of directors.\nSafety and Soundness Standards. The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines designed to assist the federal banking agencies in\nidentifying and addressing potential safety and soundness concerns before capital becomes impaired. The guidelines set forth operational and\nmanagerial standards relating to: (i) internal controls, information systems, and internal audit systems; (ii) loan documentation; (iii) credit\nunderwriting; (iv) asset growth; (v) earnings; and (vi) compensation, fees, and benefits.\nIn addition, the federal banking agencies have also adopted safety and soundness guidelines with respect to asset quality and for evaluating\nand monitoring earnings to ensure that earnings are sufficient for the maintenance of adequate capital and reserves. These guidelines provide six\nstandards for establishing and maintaining a system to identify problem assets and prevent those assets from deteriorating. Under these standards, an\nIDI should: (i) conduct periodic asset quality reviews to identify problem assets; (ii) estimate the inherent losses in problem assets and establish\nreserves that are sufficient to absorb estimated losses; (iii) compare problem asset totals to capital; (iv) take appropriate corrective action to resolve\nproblem assets; (v) consider the size and potential risks of material asset concentrations; and (vi) provide periodic asset quality reports with adequate\ninformation for management and the Board to assess the level of asset risk.\nFair and Responsible Banking and the Community Reinvestment Act. We consistently seek to maintain an integrated and comprehensive\napproach to compliance with all applicable federal and state consumer protection laws, regulations, and guidance through policies and programs\ndesigned to promote equality, fairness, and responsibility in all of our product and service offerings.\n29\nTable of Contents\nFair and Responsible Banking - Fair and responsible banking concepts are core and fundamental to how we conduct our business. All\nemployees are expected to treat everyone fairly, consistently, and equitably without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex, gender\nidentity, marital status, sexual orientation, disability, familial status, veteran status, income derived from any public assistance program, or an\napplicant’s exercise of any right under the Consumer Protection Act. We offer our products and services in an honest, transparent, and responsible\nmanner that include, but is not limited to:\n• Responsible marketing and advertising • Product/service development and oversight\n• Sales practices • Servicing and debt collection practices\n• Complaint management • Whistleblower program\n• Privacy of information • Employee training\nSenior management level committees provide additional compliance related oversight along with our comprehensive internal policies,\nprocedures, and management reporting mechanisms that provide results regularly to our Board of Directors.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act - The Bank is subject to the regulatory requirements and reporting related to the Community Reinvestment Act\n(“CRA”). Federal banking regulators evaluate the record of a financial institution in meeting the credit needs of their local communities, including\nlow- and moderate-income neighborhoods. A bank’s compliance with its CRA obligations is based on a performance-based evaluation system, which\nbases CRA ratings on an institution’s lending, service, and investment performance, resulting in a rating by the appropriate bank regulator of\n“outstanding,” “satisfactory,” “needs to improve,” or “substantial noncompliance.” Based on its last CRA examination in July 2021, the Bank\nreceived an “outstanding” rating. The federal banking agencies may take compliance with fair lending laws and practices, including CRA into\naccount when regulating and supervising other activities.\nOn October 24, 2023, the federal regulatory agencies jointly issued a final rule to strengthen and modernize regulations implementing the\nCRA. Most of the rule’s requirements will be applicable beginning January 1, 2026. The remaining requirements, including the data reporting\nrequirements, will be applicable on January 1, 2027. We have begun efforts to evaluate the impact of the new rule and to develop a strategy to ensure\ncompliance.\nBank Secrecy Act and Money Laundering Control Act. In 1970, Congress passed the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act,\notherwise known as the Bank Secrecy Act (the “BSA”), which established requirements for recordkeeping and reporting by banks and other financial\ninstitutions. The BSA was designed to prevent criminals from using financial institutions to hide or launder money by identifying the source, volume,\nand movement of currency and other monetary instruments into, out of, and within the U.S. in order to help detect and prevent money laundering\nconnected with drug trafficking, terrorism, and other criminal activities. The primary tools used to implement BSA requirements is the filing of\nCurrency Transaction Reports and Suspicious Activity Reports. Today, the BSA requires that all banking institutions develop and provide for the\ncontinued administration of a program reasonably designed to assure and monitor compliance with certain recordkeeping and reporting requirements\nregarding both domestic and international currency transactions. These programs must, at a minimum, provide for a system of internal controls to\nassure ongoing compliance, provide for independent testing of the compliance program and such systems, designate individuals responsible for such\ncompliance, and provide appropriate personnel training.\n30\nTable of Contents\nUSA PATRIOT Act. Under the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct\nTerrorism Act, commonly referred to as the “USA Patriot Act” or the “Patriot Act,” financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified\nfinancial transactions and account relationships, as well as enhanced due diligence standards intended to detect and prevent the use of the U.S.\nfinancial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities. The Patriot Act requires financial institutions, including banks, to establish\nanti-money laundering programs, including employee training and independent audit requirements, meet minimum standards specified by the act,\nfollow minimum standards for customer identification and maintenance of customer identification records, and regularly compare customer lists\nagainst lists of suspected terrorists, terrorist organizations, and money launderers. The costs or other effects of the compliance burdens imposed by\nthe Patriot Act or future anti-terrorist, homeland security, or anti-money laundering legislation or regulation cannot be predicted with certainty.\nVolcker Rule. On December 10, 2013, the federal regulators adopted final regulations to implement the proprietary trading and private fund\nprohibitions of the Volcker Rule under the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the final regulations, banking entities are generally prohibited, subject to\nsignificant exceptions from: (i) short-term proprietary trading as principal in securities and other financial instruments, and (ii) sponsoring or\nacquiring or retaining an ownership interest in private equity and hedge funds. Revisions to the Volcker Rule in 2019, that become effective in 2020,\nsimplifies and streamlines the compliance requirements for banks that do not have significant trading activities. In 2020, the OCC, Federal Reserve,\nFDIC, SEC, and Commodity Futures Trading Commission finalized further amendments to the Volcker Rule. The amendments include new\nexclusions from the Volcker Rule’s general prohibitions on banking entities investing in and sponsoring private equity funds, hedge funds, and\ncertain other investment vehicles (collectively “covered funds”). The amendments in the final rule, which became effective on October 1, 2020,\nclarify and expand permissible banking activities and relationships under the Volcker Rule.\nConsumer Laws and Regulations. The Bank is also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers\nin transactions with banks. These laws include, among others: Truth in Lending Act; Truth in Savings Act; Electronic Funds Transfer Act; Expedited\nFunds Availability Act; Equal Credit Opportunity Act; Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act; Fair Housing Act; Fair Credit Reporting Act; Fair\nDebt Collection Act; Home Mortgage Disclosure Act; Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act; laws regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices;\nand usury laws. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must\ndeal with customers when taking deposits or making loans to such customers. The Bank must comply with the applicable provisions of these\nconsumer protection laws and regulations as part of their ongoing customer relations. Many states and local jurisdictions have consumer protection\nlaws analogous, and in addition, to those listed above. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could give rise to regulatory sanctions,\ncustomer rescission rights, action by state and local attorneys general, and civil or criminal liability.\nPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB has broad authority to regulate and supervise the retail consumer financial products and services\nactivities of banks and various nonbank providers. The CFPB has authority to promulgate regulations, issue orders, guidance and policy statements,\nconduct examinations and bring enforcement actions with regard to consumer financial products and services. With assets exceeding $10 billion\nsince 2019, the Bank is subject to examination for consumer compliance by the CFPB. The creation of the CFPB by the Dodd-Frank Act has led to,\nand is likely to continue to lead to, enhanced and strengthened enforcement of consumer financial protection laws.\n31\nTable of Contents\nFederal law currently contains extensive customer privacy protection provisions. Under these provisions, a financial institution must provide\nto its customers, at the inception of the customer relationship and annually thereafter, the institution’s policies and procedures regarding the handling\nof customers’ nonpublic personal financial information. These provisions also provide that, except for certain limited exceptions, a financial\ninstitution may not provide such personal information to unaffiliated third parties unless the institution discloses to the customer that such\ninformation may be so provided and the customer is given the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure. In June 2018, the California legislature\npassed the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”), which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA, which covers businesses that\nobtain or access personal information on California resident consumers, grants consumers enhanced privacy rights and control over their personal\ninformation, and imposes significant requirements on covered companies with respect to consumer data privacy rights. We expect this trend of state-\nlevel activity to continue, and are continually monitoring developments in other states in which we operate.\nFederal and State Taxation\nThe Corporation and the Bank report their income on a consolidated basis using the accrual method of accounting and are subject to federal\nand state income taxation in the same manner as other corporations with some exceptions. For 2023, 2022, and 2021, the Company was subject to a\nfederal income tax rate of 21.00%. State income tax rates the Company is subject to varies, based on jurisdiction. Most of the Company’s\napportionment is attributable to California, which has a state income tax rate of 10.84%. The Company is currently not under examination in any\nmajor taxing jurisdiction.\n32\nTable of Contents\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOwnership of our common stock involves certain risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. You\nshould carefully consider the risks described below, as well as all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional risks\nand uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of these risks\nactually occurs, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nGENERAL ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS RISKS\nThe economic environment could pose significant challenges for the Company and could adversely affect our financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nOur financial condition and results of operations are dependent on the U.S. economy, generally, and markets we serve, specifically. We\nprimarily serve markets in California, and major metropolitan areas in Washington, Oregon, Arizona, and Nevada, though certain of our products and\nservices are offered nationwide. Financial stress on our customers as a result of an uncertain future economic environment could have an adverse\neffect on the Company’s customers and their ability to repay their loans, which could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition,\nand results of operations. A weakening of these conditions in the markets in which we operate would likely have an adverse effect on us and others in\nthe financial institutions industry. For example, a deterioration in economic conditions in our markets could drive losses beyond that which is\nprovided for in our allowance for credit losses. We may also face the following risks in connection with these events:\n• economic conditions that negatively affect real estate values, the profitability of business operations, and the job market may result in the\ndeterioration of the credit quality of our loan portfolio, and such deterioration in credit quality could have a negative impact on our\nbusiness;\n• a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us, particularly in light of the current higher interest rate\nenvironment;\n• a decrease in deposit balances, including low-cost and noninterest-bearing deposits, and changes in our interest rate mix toward higher-\ncost deposits;\n• a decrease in net interest income derived from our lending and deposit gathering activities;\n• a decrease in the value of our loans or other assets secured by collateral such as commercial or residential real estate;\n• a decrease in consumer confidence levels and adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates\non loans and other credit facilities;\n• the processes we use to estimate our allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) under the CECL methodology requires the use of complex\njudgments, including forecasts of economic conditions, which are difficult to estimate, and adverse economic conditions or expected\neconomic conditions may require us to provide for a significantly greater ACL;\n• our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may become less effective in controlling charge-offs; and\n• reduced volumes of transactions that impact certain of our lines of business, such as transactions utilizing escrow services and 1031\nexchange transactions.\nIn the wake of actions by government authorities and other parties to mitigate health risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and\nfiscal and monetary policy measures used to mitigate the adverse effects of the pandemic on individual households and businesses, a number of\nmacroeconomic challenges emerged, including without limitation inflation, supply chain issues, and labor market disruptions. Although inflation\nlevels abated significantly in 2023, inflation, to the extent it persists, poses risk to the economy overall, and could pose direct or indirect challenges\nto our clients and to our business. Elevated inflation can impact our business customers through loss of purchasing power for their customers, leading\nto lower sales. Rising inflation can also increase input and inventory costs for our customers, forcing them to raise their prices or lower their\nprofitability. Supply chain disruption, also leading to inflation, can delay our customers’ shipping ability, or timing on receiving inputs for their\n33\nTable of Contents\nproduction or inventory. Inflation can lead to higher wages for our business customers, increasing costs. All of these inflationary risks for our\nbusiness customer base can be financially detrimental, leading to increased likelihood that the customer may become delinquent or otherwise default\non a loan. To the extent such conditions exist or worsen, we could experience adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nFinancial markets may be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, other geopolitical risk, and trade\ntensions. Military conflicts include military actions between Russia and Ukraine, Israel and Hamas, overall tension and conflict in the Middle East,\nand terrorism. Geopolitical risk is generally rising, with shipping incidents in the Red Sea causing losses and disruption to commercial shipping\nroutes. In addition, trade tensions between the U.S. and China, the two largest global economies, increases economic uncertainty.\nAdverse economic conditions in California, Washington, Oregon, Arizona, and/or Nevada, may cause us to suffer higher default rates on\nour loans and reduce the value of the assets we hold as collateral.\nOur business activities and credit exposure are concentrated in California, and to a lesser extent the Western U.S., including Washington,\nOregon, Arizona, and Nevada. Difficult economic conditions in these markets may cause us to incur losses associated with higher default rates and\ndecreased collateral values in our loan portfolio. In addition, demand for our products and services may decline. Declines in the real estate market\ncould hurt our business because if real estate values were to decline, the collateral for our loans would provide less security. As a result, our ability to\nrecover on defaulted loans by selling the underlying real estate would be diminished, and we would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted\nloans. The majority of our loans, approximately 59% of the aggregate outstanding principal as of December 31, 2023, are secured, at least in part, by\nreal estate located within California.\nWhile customer confidence in the banking system has improved considerably since the first half of 2023, risk related to disintermediation\nand uninsured deposits remain, and could continue to have a material effect on the Company’s operations and/or stock price.\nThe high-profile bank failures in the first half of 2023 generated significant market volatility among publicly-traded bank holding companies\nand, in particular, regional banks like Pacific Premier. The industry has stabilized since these failures and the customer confidence in the safety and\nsoundness of smaller regional banks has improved considerably. Nevertheless, risks remain that customers may choose to invest in higher yielding\nand higher-rated short-term fixed income securities or maintain deposits with larger more systematically important financial institutions, all of which\ncould materially and adversely impact our liquidity, loan funding capacity, net interest margin, capital, and results of operations. In addition, the\nbanking operating environments and public trading prices of banking institutions can be highly correlated, in particular during times of stress, which\ncould adversely impact the trading prices of our common stock and potentially, our results of operations. Separately, banking regulators have\nannounced a more stringent supervisory posture after the bank failures.\nHealth crises have in the past, and could in the future, materially and adversely affect our business and our customers, counterparties,\nemployees, and third-party service providers.\nPandemics, epidemics, or other health crises, including COVID-19, have had and could have repercussions that could impact household,\nbusiness, economic, and market conditions, including in California and the Western U.S. where we conduct most of our business. These events have\ncaused and could in the future, cause us to implement measures to combat such health crises, including restrictions impacting individual, including\nour current and potential investors and customers, and the manner in which business continues to operated. Additionally, our operations may be\nimpacted by the need to close certain offices and limit how customers conduct business through our branch network. Health crises could impact our\nbusiness, capital, liquidity, financial position, results of operations, and business prospects due to the potential effect on our customers, employees,\nand third-party service providers. In addition, health crises can lead to lingering impacts on economies and markets, for example, the unprecedented\nextent of economic stimulus during the COVID-19 pandemic that caused and/or exacerbated inflationary pressures.\n34\nTable of Contents\nMARKET RISKS\nInterest rate changes, which are beyond our control, could harm our profitability.\nOur profitability depends to a large extent upon net interest income, which is the difference between interest income and dividends we earn\non interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and interest expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.\nAny change in general market interest rates, whether as a result of changes in the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve or otherwise, may have a\nsignificant effect on net interest income and prepayments on our loans. After maintaining its federal funds rate target in a range of 0% to 0.25% from\nMarch 2020 until March 2022, as part of its efforts to combat inflation, the FOMC raised the federal funds target to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%\nbetween March 2022 and December 2022 and further continued the monetary tightening campaign throughout 2023 raising the benchmark rate to a\nrange of 5.25% to 5.5%. Additionally, the FOMC began shrinking its balance sheet in June 2022 by reducing its holdings of Treasury and mortgage-\nbacked securities. The actions of the FOMC have helped inflation trend down from near highs in early 2022 but it still remains above the FOMC’s\n2% target. The Federal Reserve has indicated that the target rate may have reached its peak but continues to monitor the economic data to support\nrate cuts in 2024 and beyond. The myriad of Federal Reserve commentary has continued to complicate investors’ outlook, fueling volatility in the\nmarkets and a consensus on the timing of potential rate cuts for 2024. As a result, the economic outlook for 2024 will continue to be highly\nuncertain.\nOur assets and liabilities may react differently to changes in overall interest rates or conditions. In general, higher interest rates are associated\nwith a lower volume of loan originations while lower interest rates are usually associated with higher loan originations. During the rising interest rate\nenvironment, adjustable rate loan holders have been motivated to pay off loans. Further, if interest rates decline, our fixed, higher-rate loans may be\nrefinanced at lower rates or paid off and our investments may be prepaid earlier than expected. If that occurs, we may have to redeploy the loan or\ninvestment proceeds into lower yielding assets, which might also decrease our income. Additionally, the ratio of fixed to floating rate loans has an\nimpact on the Bank’s income in a rising rate environment. The Bank closely monitors this ratio in assessing go-forward strategies with respect to\nloan originations. Additionally, the mixture of fixed to variable rate investment securities has an impact on the Bank’s earnings in a rising rate\nenvironment. Accordingly, changes in levels of market interest rates could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, loan origination\nvolumes, net interest margin, results of operations, and profitability. Changes in interest rates also have a significant impact on the carrying value of\ncertain of our assets, including loans, real estate, and investment securities, on our balance sheet.\nWe may incur debt in the future, and that debt may also be sensitive to interest rates. Further, federal monetary policy significantly affects\ncredit conditions for us, as well as for our borrowers, particularly as implemented by the Federal Reserve, primarily through open market operations\nin U.S. government securities, the federal funds rate target, the discount rate for bank borrowings, and reserve requirements. A material change in\nany of these conditions could have a material impact on us or our customers (including borrowers), and therefore on our results of operations.\nThe Company’s modeling of its sensitivity to changes in interest rates is low in a rising interest rate environment and low-to-moderate in a\nfalling rate environment based on the current profile of the Company’s loan portfolio and deposits. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative\nDisclosures About Market Risk. If the interest rates on our loans increase comparably faster than the interest rate on our interest-bearing demand\ndeposits, money market, and savings deposits, our core deposit balances may decrease as customers use those funds to repay higher cost loans. In\naddition, if we need to offer additional interest-bearing demand deposit products or higher interest rates on our current interest-bearing demand,\nmoney market, or savings deposit accounts in order to maintain current customers or attract new customers, our interest expense will increase,\nperhaps materially. Furthermore, if we fail to offer competitive rates sufficient to retain these accounts, our core deposits may decrease, which would\nrequire us to seek alternative, higher cost funding sources or risk slowing our future asset growth. In these circumstances, our net interest income\nmay decrease, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. As interest rates rise, our existing customers who have\nadjustable rate loans may see their loan\n35\nTable of Contents\npayments increase and, as a result, may experience difficulty repaying those loans, which in turn could lead to higher losses for us. Increasing\ndelinquencies, nonaccrual loans, and defaults lead to higher loan loss provisions, and potentially greater eventual losses that would lower our current\nprofitability and capital ratios.\nWe use derivative financial instruments, primarily consisting of interest rate swaps, to limit our exposure to interest rate risk. No hedging\nstrategy can completely protect us, and the derivative financial instruments we elect may not have the effect of reducing our interest rate risk. Poorly\ndesigned strategies, inaccurate assumptions, improperly executed transactions, or the failure of a counterparty to fulfill its obligations could serve to\nincrease our risks and losses. In addition, hedging strategies involve transaction and other costs. Our hedging strategies and the derivatives that we\nuse may not adequately offset the risks of interest rate volatility and could result in or magnify losses, which could have an adverse effect on our\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the fair value of our investment securities may reduce our stockholders’ equity and net income.\nAt December 31, 2023, $1.14 billion of our securities were classified as AFS with an aggregate net unrealized loss of $36.0 million. We\nincrease or decrease stockholders’ equity by the amount of change from the unrealized gain or loss (the difference between the estimated fair value\nand the amortized cost) of our AFS securities portfolio, net of the related tax, under the category of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nTherefore, a decline in the estimated fair value of this portfolio will result in a decline in reported stockholders’ equity, book value per common\nshare, and tangible book value per common share. This decrease will occur even though the securities are not sold. In the case of debt securities, if\nthese securities are never sold and there are no credit impairments, the decrease will be recovered over the life of the securities. In the case of equity\nsecurities, which have no stated maturity, the declines in fair value may or may not be recovered over time.\nAt December 31, 2023, we had stock holdings in the FHLB totaling $19.4 million, $75.2 million in FRB stock, and $4.7 million in other\nstock. The stock held by us is evaluated for impairment under applicable accounting standards. In 2023, we did not recognize an impairment charge\nrelated to our stock holdings. There can be no assurance that future negative changes to the financial condition of the issuers may require us to\nrecognize an impairment charge with respect to such stock holdings.\nCREDIT RISKS\nWe may suffer losses in our loan portfolio, and those losses may exceed our allowance for credit losses.\nOur total nonperforming assets amounted to $25.1 million, or 0.13% of our total assets, at December 31, 2023. We had $17.6 million of net\nloan charge-offs and reported a provision expense for loans losses of $14.4 million in 2023. If increases in our nonperforming assets occur in the\nfuture, our net loan charge-offs and/or provision for credit losses may also increase, which may have an adverse effect upon our financial condition\nand results of operations.\nWe seek to mitigate the risks inherent in our loan portfolio by adhering to specific underwriting practices. These practices generally include\nguarantor and business capacity, obtaining full and/or partial personal guarantees from borrowers, history and prospects, analysis of a borrower’s\navailable cash flow, cash flow projections (when appropriate), valuation of collateral based on reports of independent appraisers, and other metrics.\nAlthough we believe that our underwriting criteria are appropriate for the various kinds of loans we make, we may incur losses on loans that meet\nour underwriting criteria but subsequently deteriorate, and these losses may exceed the amounts set aside as reserves in our ACL under the CECL\nmethodology.\nWe estimate credit losses using the CECL methodology, which incorporates the use of and is reliant on reasonable and supportable forecasts\nof economic conditions and variables. As of December 31, 2023, economic variables that have significant influence in the model for determining\nACL include, without limitation: changes in the U.S. unemployment rate, U.S. real GDP growth, CRE prices, and interest rates. Changes in one or\nmore of these economic variables could have an impact on our ACL determination. Please refer to Item 7. Management’s\n36\nTable of Contents\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. Because the CECL\nmethodology is more dependent on future economic forecasts, assumptions, and models than the previous accounting standards, it may result in\nincreases and add volatility to our ACL and future provisions for loan losses. The forecasts, assumptions, and models required by CECL are based\nupon third-party forecasts, subject to management’s review and adjustment in light of information currently available. Although we maintain an ACL\nat a level that we believe is adequate to absorb future expected credit losses under the CECL methodology, our ACL may not be adequate to absorb\nactual credit losses. Changes in economic, operating, and other conditions, including a sharp decline in real estate values as well as lower or higher\ninterest rates (or a persistently higher-for-longer interest rate environment), which are beyond our control, may cause our actual loan losses to exceed\nour current allowance estimates, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve and the DFPI, as part of their supervisory function, periodically review our credit loss reserves. Either\nagency may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or to recognize further loan losses, based on their judgments, which may be different\nfrom those of our management and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nConcentrations within our loan portfolio could result in increased credit risk in a challenging economy. For example, our focus on\ncommercial lending and the concentration on small- and middle-market business customers, who can have heightened vulnerability to economic\nconditions.\nWhile our loan portfolio is diversified across business sectors, it is concentrated in CRE and commercial business loans. As of December 31,\n2023, our investor and business loans secured by real estate, including multifamily and CRE loans, amounted to $11.12 billion, or 83.7% of our total\nloan portfolio, and our commercial business loans amounted to $2.12 billion, or 16.0% of our total loan portfolio. At such date, our largest\noutstanding C&I loan balance was $264.1 million, which also belonged to our largest borrower relationship, and our largest outstanding CRE loan\nbalance was $88.9 million. CRE and commercial business loans are in some respects considered riskier than single-family residential loans because\nthey have larger balances to a single borrower or group of related borrowers. CRE and commercial business loans involve risks because the\nborrowers’ abilities to repay the loans typically depend primarily on the successful operation of the businesses or the properties securing the loans.\nMost of the Company’s commercial business loans are made to small- or middle-market business customers who may have a heightened\nvulnerability to economic conditions. CRE valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business\nclimate, economic conditions, interest rates, and in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property.\nDeterioration of our borrowers’ businesses may hinder their ability to repay their loans with us, which may increase our nonperforming assets, net\nloan charge-offs, and/or our provision for credit losses. In addition, as part of our proactive approach to credit risk management, we may determine\nto sell deteriorating loans at a discount. Increases in our nonperforming assets, net loan charge-offs, our provision for credit losses, and/or the sale of\ndeteriorating loans, in each case in our commercial business and/or CRE loan portfolios, may adversely affect our financial condition and results of\noperations.\nIn addition, federal and state banking regulators are examining CRE lending activity with increasingly heightened scrutiny and may require\nbanks with higher levels of CRE loans to implement more stringent underwriting, internal controls, risk management policies, and portfolio stress\ntesting. Because a significant portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of CRE loans, the banking regulators may require us to maintain higher\nlevels of capital than we would otherwise be expected to maintain, which could impact our business strategy, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\n37\nTable of Contents\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RISKS\nWe are subject to liquidity risk, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nEffective liquidity management is essential for the operation of our business. Although we have implemented strategies to maintain sufficient\nand diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned, as well as unanticipated, changes in assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet commitments\nunder various economic conditions, an inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sales of investment securities and other sources\ncould have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired\nby factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity\nsources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market disruption, a decrease in the borrowing capacity assigned to our\npledged assets by our secured creditors, or adverse regulatory action against us. Deterioration in economic conditions and the loss of confidence in\nfinancial institutions may increase our cost of funding and limit our access to some of our customary sources of liquidity, including, but not limited\nto, inter-bank borrowings and borrowings from the Federal Reserve and FHLB. Our ability to acquire deposits or borrow, and the possibility of\ndeposit outflows, could also be impaired by various stress environments and other factors that are not specific to us, including a severe disruption of\nthe financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry generally as a result of conditions\nfaced by banking organizations in the domestic and international credit markets. Other factors, for example a cybersecurity breach that is specific to\nus, could also impair our ability to acquire or retain deposits.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future and such capital may not be available when needed or at all.\nWe are required by federal and state regulators to maintain adequate levels of capital. We may need to raise additional capital in the future to\nmeet regulatory or other internal requirements. As a publicly traded company, a likely source of additional funds is the capital markets, accomplished\ngenerally through the issuance of equity, both common and preferred stock, and the issuance of debt. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed,\nwill depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and our financial performance.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that access to such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Any occurrence that may\nlimit our access to the capital markets, such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers or counter-parties participating in the capital markets,\nmay materially and adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our liquidity. Further, if we need to raise capital in\nthe future, we may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would then have to compete with those\ninstitutions for investors. The inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a materially adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to capital adequacy standards and liquidity rules, and a failure to meet these standards could adversely affect our\nfinancial condition.\nThe Corporation and the Bank are each subject to capital adequacy and liquidity rules and other regulatory requirements specifying\nminimum amounts and types of capital that must be maintained. From time to time, the regulators implement changes to these regulatory capital\nadequacy and liquidity rules. If we fail to meet these minimum capital and liquidity rules and other regulatory requirements, we may be restricted in\nthe types of activities we may conduct and may be prohibited from taking certain capital actions, such as paying dividends, making payments on\nother capital instruments, paying executive bonuses, and repurchasing or redeeming the Corporation’s common stock.\n38\nTable of Contents\nRISK RELATED TO RISK MANAGEMENT\nWe are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity, data privacy, and fraud.\nWe collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers, business partners,\nand personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in the ordinary course of our business. The Company is continuously\nenhancing and expanding our digital products and services, which often include storing, transmitting, and processing confidential client, employee,\nmonetary, and business information. Despite instituted safeguards and monitoring our information systems, our network, digital platforms, or third-\nparty services could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, cyber-attacks by hackers, or breaches due to employee error or misconduct, or other\ndisruptions such as computer viruses, malicious software, ransomware, phishing schemes, fraud activities, and hardware or software failures..\nWe have robust preventive, detective, and administrative safeguards and security controls to help protect, identify, and mitigate against the\ndisruptions of our operations, the intentional and unintentional misappropriation or corruption of our information systems and information, and a\nmaterial event. However, the legal, regulatory, and threat landscape regarding information security, cybersecurity, and data privacy is dynamic,\nincreasingly demanding, and challenging. Cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of controls, processes, and practices\ndesigned to protect systems, computers, software, data, client information, and networks against the threat of security breaches, fraud, cyber-attacks,\nransomware, social engineering, and computer malware attacks, damage, or unauthorized access remain a priority for the Company. As risks\nassociated with cybersecurity threats constantly evolve and become more sophisticated generally, we may be required to incur significant costs to\nenhance, modify, and refine our protective measures against these evolving threats and to respond to such threats.\nOur risk and exposure to cyber threats to our information systems, as well as those of our third-party vendors, remain heightened because of,\namong other things, the evolving nature of these threats, the continuation of a remote work environment for our employees and service providers,\nand our plans to continue to implement and expand digital banking services, expand operations, and use third-party information systems that include\ncloud-based infrastructure, platforms, and software. The measures that we implement to reduce and mitigate these risks may not be effective, and\nthere can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns, intrusions, incidents, or breaches of our or our third-party vendors’ information\nsystems. Security breaches, cybersecurity incidents, or loss of information may result in business interruptions, exposure of proprietary or\nconfidential information, data corruption, fines and penalties, potential liabilities from regulatory or third-party investigations, litigation costs,\nremediation costs, diversion of management attention, and the negative impact on our reputation and loss of clients’ confidence. During 2023, we\nexperienced a compromise to our data in the custody of a third-party vendor we use for certain tax and regulatory compliance services. The incident\ndid not impact our own information systems. For further information regarding this incident, please see our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on\nJuly 25, 2023. Client disclosure and notification and credit monitoring expenses resulting from the incident were borne by the third party. We\nincurred other expenses related to the incident, including fees of advisors, which in the aggregate were not material.\nIn addition, the Company’s clients and vendors rely on technology and systems unmanaged by the Company, such as networking devices,\nserver infrastructure, personal computers, smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices, to contact and conduct business with the Company. If the\ndevices of the Company’s clients or vendors become the target of a cyber-attack, or security breach, it may result in business interruptions or\nunauthorized access to, misuse of, or loss of confidential client, employee, monetary, or business information. Threat actors using improperly\nobtained personal or financial information of consumers can attempt to obtain loans, lines of credit, or other financial products from the Company, or\nattempt to fraudulently persuade the Company’s employees, clients, or other users of the Company’s systems to disclose confidential information in\norder to gain improper access to the Company’s information and information systems. We also face additional costs when our customers become the\nvictims of cyber-attacks. For example, various retailers have reported that they have been the victims of a cyber-attack in which large amounts of\ntheir clients’ data, including debit and credit card information, is obtained. Our clients may be the victims of phishing scams, providing\ncybercriminals access to their accounts, or credit or debit card information. In these situations, we incur costs to replace compromised cards and\naddress fraudulent transaction activities affecting our clients.\n39\nTable of Contents\nBoth internal and external fraud and theft are risks. If confidential client, employee, monetary, or business information were to be\nmishandled or misused, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage, and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse\ncould include, for example, if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of\nour systems, employees, or counterparties, or if such information were to be intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties, or if our\nown employees abused their access to financial systems to commit fraud against our clients and the Company. These activities can occur in\nconnection with the origination of loans and lines of credit, ACH transactions, wire transactions, ATM transactions, and checking transactions, and\nresult in financial losses, as well as reputational damage.\nIn addition, the growing reliance on artificial intelligence (“AI”) technologies by vendors, business partners, and technology solutions or\napplications introduces additional risks, including but not limited to: Algorithmic Bias that may result in unintended discriminatory outcomes and\nharm our reputation, loss of proprietary and confidential information through use of AI technologies, unauthorized access or breaches of data could\ncompromise the integrity of our systems with AI dependency, evolving regulations and legal frameworks surrounding AI may pose challenges\nleading to legal and financial consequences for non-compliance, and protecting the intellectual property associated with AI technologies may be\nchallenging, and unauthorized use or infringement by third parties could bring harm to our competitive position or reputation.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing risks could result in a reduced ability to operate our business, additional costs, potential liability to\nclients, and reputational harm, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nWe rely on certain third parties to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations, such as data processing and\nstorage, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, internet connections, telecommunications, and network\naccess. Even though we have a vendor risk management program to help us carefully select and monitor the performance of third parties, we do not\ncontrol their actions. The failure of a third-party to perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements for any reason could be disruptive to our\noperations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Replacing these third parties\ncould also create significant delays and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties introduces additional risks to our business operations.\nA natural or man-made disaster or recurring energy shortage, especially in California, could harm our business.\nWe are based in Irvine, California and, at December 31, 2023, approximately 59% of the aggregate outstanding principal of our loans was\ntied to businesses or secured at least in part by real estate located in California. In addition, the computer systems that operate our internal computer\nnetwork, our internet websites, and some of their back-up systems are located in Atlanta, Georgia and Las Vegas, Nevada. Historically, California has\nbeen vulnerable to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, wildfires, floods, mudslides, and droughts. Certain of these natural disasters may be\nexacerbated by changing climate conditions.\nNatural or man-made disasters and recurring energy shortages may cause operational disruptions and damage to both our properties and the\nproperties securing our loans. Such disasters could harm our operations directly through interference with communications, including the\ninterruption or loss of our information technology structure and websites, which could prevent us from gathering deposits, originating loans, and\nprocessing and controlling our flow of business, as well as through the destruction of facilities and our operational, financial, and management\ninformation systems. The measures we have implemented to mitigate the risk of business interruption may not protect us fully from the effects of a\ndisaster. A natural or man-made disaster or recurring energy shortages may also impair the value of our largest class of assets, our loan portfolio.\nUninsured or underinsured disasters may reduce borrowers’ ability to repay mortgage loans. Disasters or recurring energy shortages may diminish\nthe profitability of our business customers and reduce their ability to repay business loans. Disasters may also reduce the value of the real estate\nsecuring our loans, impairing our ability to recover on defaulted loans through\n40\nTable of Contents\nforeclosure and making it more likely that we would suffer losses on defaulted loans. California has also experienced water shortages, which, if they\nrecur, could impair the value of the real estate or hinder the operations of businesses, including agricultural businesses, in those areas affected. The\noccurrence of natural and man-made disasters or energy shortages could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nClimate change could have a material negative impact on the Company and clients.\nThe Company’s business, as well as the operations and activities of our clients, could be negatively impacted by climate change. Climate\nchange presents both immediate and long-term risks to the Company and its clients, and these risks are expected to increase over time. Climate\nchange presents multi-faceted risks, including: operational risk from the physical effects of climate events on the Company and its clients’ facilities\nand other assets; credit risk from borrowers with significant exposure to climate risk; transition risks associated with the transition to a less carbon-\ndependent economy; and reputational risk from stakeholder concerns about our practices related to climate change, the Company’s carbon footprint,\nand the Company’s business relationships with clients and vendors who operate in carbon-intensive industries.\nFederal and state banking regulators and supervisory authorities, investors, and other stakeholders have increasingly viewed financial\ninstitutions as important in helping to address the risks related to climate change both directly and with respect to their clients, which may result in\nfinancial institutions coming under increased pressure regarding the disclosure and management of their climate risks and related lending and\ninvestment activities. Given that climate change could impose systemic risks upon the financial sector, for example through disruptions in economic\nactivity resulting from the physical impacts of climate change or changes in policies as the economy transitions to a less carbon-intensive\nenvironment, the Company may become subject to new or heightened regulatory requirements related to climate change, such as requirements\nrelating to operational resiliency or stress testing for various climate stress scenarios. New or increased regulations could result in increased\ncompliance costs or capital requirements. Changes in regulations and customer preferences and behaviors could negatively affect our growth or force\nus to alter our business strategies, including whether and on what terms and conditions we will engage in certain activities or offer certain products\nor services and which growth industries and customers we pursue. Additionally, our reputation and customer relationships may be damaged due to\nour practices related to climate change, including our involvement, or our customers’ involvement, in certain industries or projects associated with\ncausing or exacerbating climate change, as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to\nconsiderations relating to climate change. Ongoing legislative or regulatory developments and changing climate risk management and related\npractices may result in higher regulatory, compliance and credit risks and costs.\nWith the increased importance and focus on climate change, we are making efforts to enhance our governance of climate change-related\nrisks and integrate climate considerations into our risk governance framework. Nonetheless, the risks and expectations associated with climate\nchange are rapidly evolving, and some of the risks are difficult to assess due to limited data and other uncertainties. We could experience increased\nexpenses resulting from strategic planning, litigation, and technology and market changes, and reputational harm as a result of negative public\nsentiment, regulatory scrutiny, and reduced investor and stakeholder confidence due to our response to climate change and our climate change\nstrategy, which, in turn, could have a material negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE RISKS\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations are subject to various laws and regulations, as well as regulatory oversight by various federal and state authorities. Federal\nand state banking regulators have significant discretion and authority to prevent or remedy what they perceive to be unsafe or unsound practices or\nviolations of laws or regulations by financial institutions and bank holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement\nduties. Such\n41\nTable of Contents\ndiscretion and authority have been an area of focus after the regional bank failures in 2023, and regulators are expected to increase their exercise of\nregulatory authority and requirement of remedial actions. The exercise of regulatory authority by one or more of these agencies could have a\nnegative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, in order to conduct certain activities, including acquisitions, we are\nrequired to obtain regulatory approval. There is no assurance that any required approvals will be obtained, or obtained without conditions or on a\ntimeframe acceptable to the Company.\nThe laws, rules, and regulations applicable to us are subject to regular modification and change. Regulations affecting banks and other\nfinancial institutions, such as the Dodd-Frank Act, are continuously reviewed and change frequently. The ultimate effect of such changes cannot be\npredicted. Compliance with such regulations and laws may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities. Further,\npersonnel changes in elected and appointed government officials, may result in an evolving regulatory agenda, which could increase bank regulation\nand associated costs of regulatory compliance, and introduce new risks, complexities, and uncertainties. There can be no assurance that laws, rules,\nand regulations will not be proposed or adopted in the future, which could (i) make compliance much more difficult or expensive, (ii) restrict our\nability to originate, modify, broker, or sell loans or accept certain deposits, (iii) restrict our ability to collect on defaulted loans or foreclose on\nproperty securing loans, (iv) further limit or restrict the amount of commissions, interest, or other charges earned on loans originated or sold by us, or\n(v) otherwise materially and adversely affect our business or prospects for business. These risks could affect our deposit acquisition and the\nperformance and value of our loan and investment securities portfolios, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of\noperations.\nBanking regulators have announced a more stringent supervisory posture after several bank failures in the first half of 2023. This heightened\nregulatory focus brings other meaningful risks to us and smaller regional banks that may be held to higher standards in the past, and may need to\nexpend greater management time and resources to adequately satisfy those standards. In addition, the banking operating environment and public\ntrading prices of banking institutions can be highly correlated, in particular during times of stress, which could adversely impact the trading prices of\nour common stock and potentially, our results of operations.\nFederal and state regulatory agencies, including the FRB, the DFPI, and the CFPB, periodically monitor and conduct examinations of our\nbusiness, including compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a regulatory agency was to determine in its discretion that\nthe financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, or other aspects of our operations had become\nunsatisfactory, or that the Company or its management was in violation of any law or regulation, it could take a number of different remedial actions\nas it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin “unsafe or unsound” practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any\nconditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital,\nto restrict our growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against the Bank or our officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is\nconcluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance. If we\nbecome subject to such regulatory actions, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation may be negatively impacted.\nRegulations relating to privacy, information security, and data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we collect and use\npersonal information, and adversely affect our business opportunities.\nWe are subject to a dynamic regulatory landscape with evolving laws and regulations governing privacy, information security, and data\nprotection, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Compliance with these requirements includes, among other things, privacy disclosure processes,\nmaintenance of a robust information security program with stringent controls. The intricate nature of these laws and their constant evolution\nintroduces the potential for change, which could lead us to incur substantial costs and have a significant impact on our current and planned privacy,\ndata protection, and information security-related practices.\nIn addition to the risks from the collection, use, retention, security, and transfer of data, we are also subject to specific obligations relating to\ninformation considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as the California\n42\nTable of Contents\nConsumer Privacy Act of 2018, which came into effect on January 1, 2020, and bolstered by amendments contained in the California Privacy Act\neffective January 1, 2023. The original California Consumer Privacy Act, as enlarged and amended, provides businesses, employees, and consumers\nprivacy rights regarding the use and sharing practices associated with their collected data, allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with\nthird parties, and allows consumers to pursue litigation for certain non-compliance activities.\nOur regulators also hold us responsible for privacy and data protection obligations performed by our third-party service providers while\nproviding services to us, as well as disclosures and notifications during a cyber or information security incident. The introduction of new laws or\nmodification of existing laws not only increase our costs of compliance but also present challenges to our privacy-related enforcement activities and\nbusiness operations. This may be in the form of increased technology costs, potential income reduction and could restrict our ability to provide\ncertain products and services. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection, and information security laws could trigger significant regulatory\nor governmental investigations and we can be liable for associated investigatory expense, litigation costs, fines, sanctions, and damage to our\nreputation. Such outcomes could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO COMPETITION\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to our success.\nOur employees are our most important resource. Competition for qualified personnel is intense in many areas of the financial services\nindustry. We endeavor to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees to assist in executing our\ngrowth, acquisition, and business strategies. We also seek to retain proven, experienced senior employees with superior talent, augmented from time\nto time by external hires, to provide continuity of succession of our executive management team. Losses of or changes in our current executive\nofficers or other key personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could materially and adversely affect our\nfinancial condition and results of operations. The Company’s ability to continue to compete effectively also depends in large part on our ability to\nattract new employees and retain and motivate existing employees, while managing compensation and other costs.\nWe face strong competition from financial services companies and other companies that offer banking services, which could materially\nand adversely affect our business.\nThe financial services industry has become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory, and technological changes and\ncontinued banking consolidation, which may increase in connection with current economic, market, and political conditions. We face substantial\ncompetition in all phases of our operations from a variety of competitors, including national banks, regional banks, community banks, and financial\ntechnology (or \"fintech\") companies. We also face a growing risk associated with disintermediation, as more clients and prospective clients invest\ndirectly in U.S. Treasury securities, which carry high rates of return in the current environment and are considered as safe if not safer than FDIC-\ninsured deposits. In addition, we compete against institutions that offer money market mutual funds, including funds that maintain a large percentage\nof their holdings in U.S. Treasury securities, offering relative safety at higher interest rates to customers. With the rise of U.S. Treasury rates, we\nhave been competing directly with U.S. Treasury securities and the investment funds that emphasize them.\nMany of our competitors offer the same banking services that we offer, and our success depends on our ability to adapt our products and\nservices to evolving industry standards. In addition to product and service offerings, we compete on a number of other factors, including financial\nand other terms, underwriting standards, technological capabilities, brand, and reputation. Increased competition in our market may result in reduced\nnew loan production and/or decreased deposit balances or less favorable terms on loans and leases and/or deposit accounts. We also face competition\nfrom many other types of financial institutions, including without limitation, nonbank specialty lenders, insurance companies, private investment\nfunds, investment banks, and other financial intermediaries, some with significantly greater resources, more locations, and longer operating histories.\nIn addition,\n43\nTable of Contents\ncompetition has increased in recent years from institutions not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as domestic banks and bank holding\ncompanies. As competition in the financial services industry intensifies, our ability to market our products and services may be adversely affected. If\nwe are unable to attract and retain banking customers, we may be unable to grow or maintain the levels of our loans and deposits and our results of\noperations and financial condition may be adversely affected as a result. Ultimately, we may not be able to compete successfully against current and\nfuture competitors.\nThe financial services industry, including the banking sector, is undergoing rapid technological change as a result of changes in\ncustomer behavior, competition, and the legal and regulatory framework, and we may not be able to compete effectively as a result of these\nchanges.\nThe financial services industry experiences continuous technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products\nand services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our\nfuture success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will\nsatisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors, however, have substantially greater\nresources to invest in technological improvements or are technology focused start-ups with internally developed cloud-native systems that offer\nimproved user interfaces and experiences. We may not be able to effectively bring to market new technology-driven products and services at the\nsame speed as certain competitors or fintech firms, or be as successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. In addition, we\ndepend on internal and outsourced technology to support all aspects of our business operations. Interruption or failure of these systems creates a risk\nof business loss as a result of adverse customer experiences and possible diminishing of our reputation, damage claims, or civil fines. Failure to\nsuccessfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry or to successfully implement core processing strategies\ncould have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the legal and regulatory framework under which we operate require us to update our information systems to ensure compliance.\nOur need to review and evaluate the impact of ongoing rule proposals, final rules and implementation guidance from regulators further complicates\nthe development and implementation of new information systems for our business. Also, recent regulatory guidance has focused on the need for\nfinancial institutions to perform increased due diligence and ongoing monitoring of third-party vendor relationships, thus increasing the scope of\nmanagement involvement and decreasing the efficiency otherwise resulting from our relationships with third-party technology providers. Given the\nsignificant number of ongoing regulatory reform initiatives, it is possible that we incur higher than expected information technology costs in order to\ncomply with current and impending regulations.\nRISKS RELATED TO STRATEGIC GROWTH\nAcquisitions may disrupt our business.\nWe have successfully completed eleven acquisitions since 2011. The success of future acquisitions we may consummate will depend on,\namong other things, our ability to realize the anticipated revenue enhancements and efficiencies and to combine our business with the business of the\ntarget institution in a manner that does not materially disrupt the existing customer relationships of either institution, or result in decreased revenues\nresulting from any loss of customers, and that permits growth opportunities to occur. If we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the\nanticipated benefits of future acquisitions may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. It is possible that the\nintegration process associated with an acquisition could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies\nin standards, controls, procedures, and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors, and\nemployees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions. Integration efforts could also divert management attention and resources. These\nintegration matters could have an adverse effect on the combined Company.\n44\nTable of Contents\nAcquisitions involve numerous other risks and uncertainties, including inaccurate financial and operational assumptions, incomplete or\nfailed due diligence, lower-than-expected performance, higher-than-expected costs, adverse market or other stakeholder reactions, changes in\nrelationships with customers or counterparties, unforeseen market shifts, the potential loss of key personnel, challenges with client retention, the\npossibility of litigation, and uncertainties or potential delays related to regulatory approvals.\nAcquisitions may dilute stockholder value.\nHistorically, we have utilized equity securities as a substantial portion of the transaction consideration in our acquisitions. Future mergers or\nacquisitions, if any, may involve cash, debt or equity securities as transaction consideration. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium\nover book and market values, and, therefore, some possible dilution of our stock’s tangible book value and net income per common share may occur\nin connection with any future transaction. We cannot say with any certainty that we will be able to consummate, or if consummated, successfully\nintegrate any future acquisitions, or that we will not incur disruptions or unexpected expenses in integrating such acquisitions. Furthermore, failure to\nrealize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from pending or\nfuture acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the value of goodwill and intangible assets could reduce our earnings.\nWhen the Company acquires a business, a substantial portion of the purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to goodwill and other\nidentifiable intangible assets. The amount of the purchase price that is allocated to goodwill is determined by the excess of the purchase price over\nthe fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately $944.6 million of goodwill and\nintangible assets, which includes goodwill of approximately $901.3 million resulting from the acquisitions the Company has consummated since\n2011. The Company accounts for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”),\nwhich requires goodwill be tested for impairment at least annually, at the reporting unit level, or more frequently if events and circumstances lead\nmanagement to believe the value of goodwill may be impaired. GAAP also requires that intangible assets other than goodwill be tested for\nimpairment when events and circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable.\nIn testing goodwill for impairment, GAAP allows the Company to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than\nnot the carrying value of goodwill is impaired. The Company’s qualitative assessment considers known positive and negative factors, as well as any\nmitigating events and circumstances associated with each relevant factor that may be deemed to have an impact on the value of the Company. Such\nfactors may include various relevant economic, industry, market and company specific factors that may have an impact on the value of the Company.\nShould the Company’s qualitative assessment indicate the value of goodwill could be impaired, a quantitative assessment is then performed to\ndetermine whether there is impairment. GAAP also allows the Company, at its option, to unconditionally forego the qualitative assessment and\nproceed directly to a quantitative assessment. This assessment involves determining the fair value of the reporting unit (which in our case is the\nCompany) and comparing that fair value to the carrying value of the Company in order to quantify the amount of the deficiency, which the Company\nwould then recognize as impairment.\nFor intangible assets other than goodwill, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if the carrying value of such\nassets may not be recoverable. A quantitative assessment is followed to determine the amount of impairment in the event the carrying value of such\nassets are deemed not recoverable. Impairment is measured as the amount by which their carrying value exceeds their estimated fair value.\nThe estimation of fair values of goodwill and intangible assets involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity in the assumptions used.\nChanges in the local and national economy, including inflation, the federal and state legislative and regulatory environments for financial institutions,\nthe stock market, interest rates, and other external factors (such as natural disasters, pandemics, or significant world events) may occur from time to\ntime, often with great unpredictability, and may materially impact the fair value of the Company and publicly traded\n45\nTable of Contents\nfinancial institutions and result in an impairment charge at a future date. Internal factors, such as strategic decisions regarding loan and deposit\ngrowth and pricing, could also impact the fair value of goodwill. Please refer to Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. If we were to conclude that a future write-down of our goodwill\nor intangible assets is necessary, we would record the appropriate charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nRISKS FROM ACCOUNTING AND OTHER ESTIMATES\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates which, if incorrect, could cause\nunexpected losses in the future.\nWe have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets\nand liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period to\nprepare these consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Material estimates subject\nto change in the near term include, among other items, the allowance for credit losses, the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets, the\nfair value estimates of certain assets and liabilities, and the realization of deferred tax assets and liabilities. These estimates may be adjusted as more\ncurrent information becomes available, and any adjustment may be significant, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition\nand results of operations.\nThere are risks resulting from the extensive use of models in our business, and we rely on third parties for the provision of economic\nforecasts and other key inputs used in our models.\nWe rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values. We use models in such processes as measuring\ninterest rate and other market risks, predicting or estimating losses, assessing capital adequacy and calculating regulatory capital levels, as well as to\nestimate the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items. Inadequately designed or implemented models present the risk that our business\ndecisions based on information incorporating model output could be adversely affected due to the inaccuracy of that information. Models are often\nbased on historical experience to predict future outcomes, as a result new experiences or events which are not part of historical experience can\nsignificantly increase model imprecision and impact model reliability. In addition, we rely on model inputs that are provided by third parties. For\nexample, we rely on third parties to provide forecasts of key macroeconomic variables such as U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP growth.\nRISKS RELATED TO INVESTMENTS IN OUR SECURITIES\nDividends from the Bank are a primary source of the Corporation’s liquidity from which, among other things, dividends to stockholders\nmay be paid.\nOur ability to pay cash dividends to our stockholders is partially dependent upon receiving dividends from the Bank. The Bank’s ability to\npay dividends to us is subject to restrictions set forth in the Financial Code. The Financial Code provides that a bank may not make a cash\ndistribution to its stockholders in excess of the lesser of (1) a bank’s retained earnings and (2) a bank’s net income for its last three fiscal years, less\nthe amount of any distributions made by the bank or by any majority-owned subsidiary of the bank to the stockholders of the bank during such\nperiod. However, a bank may, with the approval of the DFPI, make a distribution to its stockholders in an amount not exceeding the greatest of (a) its\nretained earnings; (b) its net income for its last fiscal year; or (c) its net income for its current fiscal year. In the event that banking regulators\ndetermine that the stockholders’ equity of a bank is inadequate or that the making of a distribution by the bank would be unsafe or unsound, the\nregulators may order the bank to refrain from making a proposed distribution.\nApproval of the Federal Reserve is required for payment of any dividend by a state-chartered bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, such as the Bank, if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its retained net income for\nthat year combined with its retained net income\n46\nTable of Contents\nfor the preceding two years. In addition, a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits without\nregulatory and stockholder approval. The Bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividend that would cause it to become\nundercapitalized. A reduction or discontinuance of dividends from the Bank to the Corporation could have an adverse effect on our ability to pay\ndividends on our common stock, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, including the market price of our common\nstock.\nWe may reduce or discontinue the payment of dividends by the Corporation on, or repurchases of, our common stock.\nOur stockholders are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. In\naddition, in January 2021, our Board authorized us to repurchase up to 4,725,000 shares of our common stock, of which 4,245,056 shares remained\neligible to be repurchased as of December 31, 2023. We are not required to pay dividends on, or effect repurchases of, our common stock and may\nreduce or eliminate our common stock dividend and/or share repurchase program in the future.\nThe Corporation’s ability to pay dividends to our stockholders is subject to the restrictions set forth in Delaware law, by the Federal Reserve,\nand by certain covenants contained in our subordinated debentures. Notification to the Federal Reserve is also required prior to our declaring and\npaying a cash dividend to our stockholders during any period in which our quarterly and/or cumulative twelve-month net earnings are insufficient to\nfund the dividend amount, as was the case for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, among other requirements, in which case the\nFederal Reserve could object to our paying the proposed dividend in the amount contemplated. In addition, we may be restricted by applicable law or\nregulation or actions taken by our regulators, now or in the future, from paying dividends to, or repurchasing shares of our common stock from, our\nstockholders. We cannot provide assurance that we will continue paying dividends on, or repurchase shares of, our common stock at current levels or\nat all. A reduction or discontinuance of dividends on our common stock or our share repurchase program could have a material adverse effect on the\nmarket price of our common stock.\n47\nTable of Contents\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nInformation security is essential to our mission and our institutional strategic goal. Under the leadership of our Chief Information Security\nOfficer (“CISO”), we have developed and implemented a comprehensive risk-based information security program that meets regulatory requirements\nand encompasses a cybersecurity program that is based upon the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Cybersecurity\nFramework. This framework enables identification and evaluation of cybersecurity risks, enabling risk management decisions, and responding to\nemerging threats. The Information Security Program and all applicable cybersecurity policies, processes, and controls apply to all of our operations\nand all of our employees.\nAs part of our cybersecurity risk management strategy, we employ an in-depth, layered, and defensive approach that leverages people,\nprocesses, and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls. As such, our cybersecurity risk management program includes, but is not\nlimited to: regular employee cybersecurity training and communications; the use of preventative, detective, alerting, and defensive in-depth\ntechnologies; internal and third-party program oversight; policies and procedures regularly reviewed and designed with regulatory and industry\nguidance; an incident response plan to respond to cybersecurity incidents; and a threat intelligence program designed to assess the latest changes to\nthe threat landscape. In addition, cybersecurity policies, procedures, and controls have been developed and implemented to protect against\nunauthorized access to consumer and customer information and to safeguard the information that is exchanged with third parties in accordance with\napplicable laws and regulations.\nRisk Management\nIntegration with Overall Risk Management. Cybersecurity is a major component of our overall risk management approach. The Company’s\ncybersecurity risk management program is integrated into our overall enterprise risk management processes. This integration helps ensure that\ncybersecurity considerations are an integral part of our decision-making processes across the organization. Our risk management team works closely\nwith our Information Security and Information Technology departments to continuously evaluate and address cybersecurity risks in alignment with\nour business objectives and operational needs.\nWe continually evaluate cybersecurity risks as part of our overall risk management strategy. Cybersecurity risks are assessed, identified, and\nmanaged through various ongoing and scheduled processes, technologies, and techniques, including, but not limited to periodic IT Risk Assessments,\nvulnerability scanning, penetration testing, employee cybersecurity awareness testing, and threat intelligence analysis. The Company receives\ncybersecurity alerts and threat intelligence from OpenSource Intelligence (“OSINT”) threat intelligence feeds, the Financial Services Information\nSharing and Analysis Center (“FS-ISAC”), and government agencies, among other sources. The Company also continuously monitors its systems\nand networks. Management regularly reviews the evaluation of risks through these and other methods to mitigate risks and allocate resources in\nalignment with the overall risk management strategy.\nWe also consider employee education paramount and conduct regular cybersecurity education through a security awareness, training, and\neducation program that provides consistent and focused training to educate employees, raise awareness, and change behaviors. All employees are\ntrained at least annually about the importance of information security and data privacy. Security campaigns are launched to test the effectiveness of\nthe training provided and corporate communication bulletins are sent to employees on a periodic and as-needed basis.\n48\nTable of Contents\nWe have created and regularly update our Incident Response Plan, which guides our response to a cybersecurity incident and outlines\nprocesses for forensic analysis, crisis communications, and required notifications. Disclosure of significant cybersecurity incidents are reported\npromptly to senior leadership and the Board of Directors. We test our Incident Response Plan through tabletop exercises. The Bank also maintains a\nbusiness continuity program that addresses crisis management, business impact, and data and systems recovery.\nEngagement of Third Parties in Connection with Cybersecurity Processes. We regularly engage various third parties to assess, test, or assist\nwith the implementation of our cybersecurity processes. We engage independent third parties to conduct risk assessments, penetration tests,\nvulnerability scans, and tabletop exercises. Although our internal audit department is responsible for auditing our cybersecurity programs, we also\nengage an independent, external firm with expertise in information security to conduct annual audits of our cybersecurity program.\nThird Party Risk Management. We maintain a process to identify and evaluate cybersecurity risks and incidents related to key third-party\nservice providers. We assess key third-party service providers’ information security controls through an established due diligence process. We also\nrequire contracts with such service providers to maintain certain security controls to safeguard our data, and to notify the Company of cybersecurity\nincidents experienced by the service providers that affect our data.\nGovernance\nBoard Oversight. The Board of Directors maintains oversight responsibility over the enterprise risk management program, including risks\nrelated to cybersecurity threats and incidents, and approves the information security program. The Enterprise Risk Committee of the Board of\nDirectors (“Enterprise Risk Committee”) assists the Board in evaluating enterprise risks and performing the Board’s oversight responsibilities. As\npart of our integrated enterprise risk management process, cybersecurity risks and key metrics are evaluated by the Enterprise Risk Committee\nquarterly and reviewed by the full Board quarterly, and the Enterprise Risk Committee and the Board actively participate in discussions with\nmanagement and amongst themselves regarding cybersecurity risks and the overall risk management strategy. Our CISO, in coordination with our\nChief Information Officer (“CIO”) and Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”), briefs the Enterprise Risk Committee on a regular basis, typically quarterly,\nconcerning cybersecurity risks, the effectiveness of our cybersecurity risk management efforts, and updates and changes to our cybersecurity risk\nmanagement program. In addition, the CISO briefs the entire Board concerning the cybersecurity risk management program on an annual basis and\nas requested.\nManagement’s Role. The CISO is responsible for assessing, implementing and monitoring our Information Security Program and\ncybersecurity controls, and works closely with the CIO and the CRO in managing our Information Security Program. The CISO maintains a\ndedicated cybersecurity staff comprised of certified security professionals with expertise in various disciplines including threat detection, governance\nrisk and compliance, security architecture and engineering, incident response, and third-party risks. Our CISO regularly updates our management-\nlevel Enterprise Risk Management Committee concerning cybersecurity risks, and the effectiveness of our risk management efforts. The Enterprise\nRisk Management Committee is composed of members of executive management.\n49\nTable of Contents\nNotwithstanding our efforts at cybersecurity, no system of prevention is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in\npreventing or mitigating a cybersecurity incident that could have a material adverse effect on us. To date, we have not detected any material\ncybersecurity incident to our own systems. However, in July 2023, one of our third-party vendors experienced a cybersecurity incident due to a\npreviously unknown (i.e., zero-day) vulnerability in a popular file sharing software the vendor used called MOVEit Transfer. For further information\nregarding this incident, please see our Report on Form 8-K filed on July 25, 2023. At the time of our Form 8-K, we reported that “the Company\ncurrently believes this incident will not have a material adverse effect on its or the Bank’s business, operations, or financial results.” Since that\nReport, this incident has not had a material adverse effect on our or the Bank’s business, operations, or financial results. Future cybersecurity\nincidents could, however, materially affect our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for\nadditional information on how risks could materially affect the company.\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nThe Company’s headquarters is located in Irvine, California at 17901 Von Karman Avenue. As of December 31, 2023, our properties\nincluded 16 administrative offices and 58 branches throughout the Western U.S. in major metropolitan markets in California, Washington, Arizona,\nNevada, Texas, New Jersey, Nebraska, and Colorado. We owned 13 properties and leased the remaining properties. The lease terms are not\nindividually material and range from month-to-month to ten years from inception date.\nAll of our existing facilities are considered to be adequate for our present and anticipated future use. In the opinion of management, all\nproperties are adequately covered by insurance.\nFor additional information regarding properties of the Company, see Note 6 – Premises and Equipment of the notes to the consolidated\nfinancial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nThe Company is involved in legal proceedings occurring in the ordinary course of business.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to provide a better understanding of the\nsignificant changes in trends relating to the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and capital resources. This section should\nbe read in conjunction with the disclosures regarding “Forward-Looking Statements” set forth in Item I. Business-Forward Looking Statements, as\nwell as the discussion set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, including the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company’s financial condition and results of operations are presented for 2023 compared to 2022. Some tables include additional\nperiods to comply with disclosure requirements or to illustrate the trend of financial results for the periods presented in the financial statements. For a\ndiscussion of the Company’s results of operations for 2022 compared to 2021, financial condition for 2021, and other 2021 information not included\nherein, please refer to Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Annual Report\non Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on February 24, 2023.\nSummary\nOur principal business is attracting deposits from small- and middle-market businesses, corporations, and consumers, and investing those\ndeposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, primarily in commercial loans and various types of commercial real estate\nloans. The Company expects to fund substantially all of the loans that it originates or purchases through deposits, FHLB advances and other\nborrowings, and internally generated funds. Deposit flows and cost of funds are influenced by prevailing market rates of interest primarily on\ncompeting investments, account maturities, and the levels of savings in the Company’s market area. The Company generates the majority of its\nrevenues from interest income on loans that it originates and purchases, and income from investments in securities. The Company also provides its\nclients with financial products and services, which generate noninterest income such as service charges on customer accounts, trust custodial account\nfees, and escrow and exchange fees. The Company’s revenues are partially offset by interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings, the provision\nfor credit losses, and noninterest expenses, such as operating expenses. The Company’s operating expenses primarily consist of employee\ncompensation and benefit expenses, premises and occupancy expenses, data processing expenses, deposit expenses, and other general expenses. The\nCompany’s results of operations are also affected by prevailing economic conditions, competition, acquisitions, government policies, and other\nactions of regulatory agencies.\nRecent Developments\nWhile economic conditions have generally been favorable with lower levels of unemployment and increased economic activity, the strong\ndemand for goods and services in recent years, in conjunction with supply chain constraints, have contributed to higher prices for goods and services\nthroughout the U.S. economy, including within the Company’s market area. Inflation during recent years has resulted in higher prices for food,\nenergy, housing, and various supply chain inputs, including wages, among others. These inflationary pressures have persisted throughout 2022 and\n2023, and into 2024, resulting in higher costs for consumers and businesses. To address the persistent levels of inflation, the FOMC has taken steps\nsince March 2022 to tighten monetary policy through a cumulative 525 basis point increase to the Federal Funds Rate, as well as by reducing the size\nof the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. The FOMC has stated that it remains committed to monetary policy measures that are designed to bring\ninflation down. While increases in interest rates have generally resulted in higher levels of interest income for the banking industry, interest expense\nalso increased due to competition for deposits and higher borrowing costs for liquidity. Higher interest rates may also reduce economic activity\noverall or result in recessionary conditions in future periods. During the first half of 2023, high-profile bank failures created significant\n53\nTable of Contents\nindustry-wide market turmoil as well as concerns about the health of the overall banking system. Recent economic data indicates that the pace of\ninflation has moderated in recent months. However, the rate of inflation remains above the FOMC’s 2% target. The full extent of these measures,\nincluding future actions taken by the FOMC, on the Company’s business are uncertain. Should these ongoing economic pressures persist, we\nanticipate it could have an impact on the following:\n• Loan growth and interest income - If economic activity begins to wane, it may have an impact on our borrowers, the businesses they\noperate, and their financial condition. Our borrowers may have less demand for credit needed to invest in and expand their businesses, as\nwell as less demand for real estate and consumer loans. Such factors would place pressure on the level of interest-earning assets, which\nmay negatively impact our interest income.\n• Credit quality - Should there be a decline in economic activity, the markets we serve could experience increases in unemployment,\ndeclines in consumer confidence, and a reluctance on the part of businesses to invest in and expand their operations, among other things.\nSuch factors may result in weakened economic conditions, place strain on our borrowers, and ultimately impact the credit quality of our\nloan portfolio. We expect this could result in increases in the level of past due, nonaccrual, and classified loans, as well as higher net\ncharge-offs. While economic conditions have generally been favorable thus far, notwithstanding higher levels of inflation, there can be\nno assurance favorable economic conditions will continue. In addition, a higher interest rate environment may impact the ability of our\nborrowers with adjustable rate loans to meet their debt service requirements. As such, should we experience future deterioration in the\ncredit quality of our loan portfolio, it may contribute to the need for additional provisions for credit losses. Higher interest rates may also\nlower the rate of return on commercial real estate values which could result in higher charge-offs and provisions for credit losses.\n• ACL - The Company is required to record credit losses on certain financial assets in accordance with the CECL model stipulated under\nASC 326, which is highly dependent upon expectations of future economic conditions and requires management judgment. Should\nexpectations of future economic conditions deteriorate, the Company may be required to increase the ACL through additional provisions\nfor credit losses.\n• Impairment charges - If economic conditions deteriorate or headwinds within the banking industry persist, it could adversely impact the\nCompany’s operating results and/or the value of certain of our assets. As a result, the Company may be required to write-down the value\nof certain assets such as goodwill, intangible assets, or deferred tax assets when there is evidence to suggest their value has become\nimpaired or will not be realizable at a future date.\n• Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) - Unrealized gains and losses on AFS investment securities are recognized in\nstockholders’ equity as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). If economic conditions deteriorate, and/or if the interest rates\ncontinue to increase, the valuation of the Company’s AFS investment securities could be negatively impacted, which may lead to\nincreases in other comprehensive loss, the potential for credit losses, decreases to the Company’s stockholders’ equity, and declines in\nthe Company’s tangible book value per share. For additional information, see “Non-GAAP measures” presented under Item 7.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The Company’s held-to-maturity (“HTM”)\nsecurities are carried at amortized cost and changes in fair value are not recorded, however increases in interest rates may decrease the\nfair value of these investments and increase the unrealized losses embedded in these securities.\n• Deposits and deposit costs - Given the expectation for interest rates to remain elevated through restrictive monetary policy by the FOMC\nin the near future, it is likely that deposit costs will continue to increase. In connection with high-profile bank failures in the first half of\n2023, if adverse\n54\nTable of Contents\ndevelopments and significant market volatility continue in the banking sector, it may become more challenging for the Company to\nretain and attract deposit relationships.\n• Liquidity - Consistent with our approach to liquidity management, we may take certain actions to further enhance our liquidity, including\nbut not limited to, increasing our FHLB borrowings, increasing our brokered deposits, or obtaining borrowing from the Federal\nReserve’s discount window or the BTFP, which is anticipated to expire on March 11, 2024. Additional liquidity could be obtained by\nliquidating loans and AFS investment securities. In the event that we liquidate AFS securities having an unrealized loss position, those\nlosses would become realized. While the Company does not currently intend to sell HTM securities, if the Company were required to\nsell such securities to meet liquidity needs, it may realize the unrecognized losses of these securities.\nThe Company continues to focus on serving its customers and communities, maintaining the well-being of its employees, and executing its\nstrategic initiatives. The Company continues to monitor the economic environment and will make changes as appropriate.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement has established various accounting policies that govern the application of GAAP in the preparation of the Company’s financial\nstatements in Item 8 hereof. Certain accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that involve a significant level of\nestimation and uncertainty and are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities as well as the\nCompany’s results of operations; management considers these to be critical accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions management uses\nassociated with these policies are based on historical experience and other factors, which management believes to be reasonable under the\ncircumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the carrying\nvalue of the Company’s assets and liabilities as well as the Company’s results of operations in future reporting periods. The Company’s significant\naccounting policies are described in Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Off-Balance Sheet Commitments\nThe Company accounts for credit losses on loans and off-balance sheet commitments, such as unfunded loan commitments, in accordance\nwith ASC 326 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, which requires the Company to record an estimate of expected lifetime credit losses for loans\nand unfunded loan commitments at the time of origination or acquisition. The ACL is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to\nprovide for expected credit losses in the portfolio as of the date of the consolidated statements of financial condition. Estimating expected credit\nlosses requires management to use relevant forward-looking information, including the use of reasonable and supportable forecasts. The estimation\nprocess in determining the ACL involves a significant degree of judgement, requiring management to make numerous estimates and assumptions.\nThese estimates and assumptions are subject to change in future periods, which may have a material impact on the level of the ACL and the\nCompany’s results of operations.\nThe measurement of the ACL is performed by collectively evaluating loans with similar risk characteristics, as well as the individual\nevaluation of loans that are deemed to no longer possess characteristics similar to others in the loan portfolio. The Company measures the ACL on\ncommercial real estate loans and commercial loans through a discounted cash flow approach using a loan’s effective interest rate, while a historical\nloss rate methodology is used to determine the ACL on retail loans. The Company’s discounted cash flow methodology incorporates a probability of\ndefault and loss given default model, which is impacted by expectations of future economic conditions. The Company’s ACL methodology also\nincorporates estimates and assumptions concerning loan prepayments, future draws on revolving credit facilities, and the probability an unfunded\ncommitment will be drawn upon.\n55\nTable of Contents\nThe use of reasonable and supportable forecasts in the ACL methodology requires significant judgment, such as selecting forecast scenarios\nand related scenario-weighting, as well as determining the appropriate length of the forecast horizon. Management leverages economic projections\nfrom a reputable and independent third party to inform and provide its reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. Other internal and external\nindicators of economic forecasts may also be considered by management when developing forecast metrics. Forecasts of economic conditions and\nexpected credit losses are made over a two-year time horizon, before reverting to long-term average loss rates over a period of three years. Changes\nin economic forecasts, in conjunction with changes in loan specific attributes, have an impact on a loan’s probability of default and loss given\ndefault, which can drive changes in the determination of the ACL and can have a significant impact on the provision for credit losses.\nAlthough no one economic variable can fully demonstrate the sensitivity of the ACL calculation to changes in the economic variables used in\nthe ACL model, the Company, as of December 31, 2023, has identified certain economic variables that have significant influence in the Company’s\nmodel for determining the ACL. These key economic variables include changes in the U.S. unemployment rate, U.S. real GDP growth, CRE prices,\nand interest rates. However, to illustrate a hypothetical sensitivity analysis, management calculated a quantitative allowance using a 100% weighting\napplied to an adverse scenario of economic projections provided by our independent third party. This scenario includes, without limitation, the\nfollowing assumptions: supply chain issues worsen, increasing shortages of affected goods and pressuring prices; the military conflicts between\nRussian and Ukraine and Hamas and Israel continue, limiting the global supply of critical commodities; COVID-19 cases rise again, slowing growth\nin certain industries; and the combination of elevated inflation and increasing interest rates causes the economy to fall into recession in 2024. Under\nthis adverse scenario, as an example, the unemployment rate is estimated at 6.5% at the end of 2024, and represents a 2.5% higher unemployment\nestimate than the Baseline scenario projection of 4.0% for the same time period.\nTo demonstrate the sensitivity to key economic parameters, management calculated the difference between a 100% baseline weighting and a\n100% adverse scenario weighting for modeled results. This would result in an incremental quantitative impact to the ACL of approximately $33.4\nmillion at December 31, 2023. This resulting difference is not intended to represent an expected increase in ACL levels since (i) we may use a\nweighted approach applied to multiple economic scenarios for our ACL process, (ii) the highly uncertain economic environment, (iii) the difficulty in\npredicting inter-relationships between macroeconomic variables used in various economic scenarios, (iv) the loan portfolio experiences credit\nmigration as a result of adverse economic conditions, and (v) the sensitivity analysis does not account for any qualitative adjustments incorporated\nby us as part of our overall ACL framework.\nPlease also see “Allowance for Credit Losses” presented under Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations for additional discussion on assumptions concerning economic forecasts and economic variables used in the Company’s ACL\nmodel as well as the impact of those items on the Company’s ACL.\nThe Company’s ACL methodology also includes adjustments for qualitative factors where appropriate. Qualitative adjustments may be\nrelated to and include, but not limited to, factors such as: (i) management’s assessment of economic forecasts used in the model and how those\nforecasts align with management’s overall evaluation of current and expected economic conditions, (ii) organization specific risks such as credit\nconcentrations, collateral specific risks, regulatory risks, and external factors that may ultimately impact credit quality, (iii) potential model\nlimitations such as limitations identified through backtesting, and other limitations associated with factors such as underwriting changes, acquisition\nof new portfolios, changes in portfolio segmentation, and (iv) management’s overall assessment of the adequacy of the ACL, including an\nassessment of model data inputs used to determine the ACL.\n56\nTable of Contents\nAlthough management uses the best information available to derive estimates necessary to measure an appropriate level of the ACL, future\nadjustments to the ACL may be necessary due to economic, operating, regulatory, and other conditions that extend beyond the Company’s control. In\naddition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Company’s ACL. Such agencies may\nrequire the Company to recognize changes to the ACL based on judgments different from those of management. Further, as the size, complexity, and\ncomposition of the loan portfolio changes over time, such as through the acquisition of other financial institutions, new product offerings, client\ndemand for various types of credit, and changes in our geographic footprint, the Company may seek to make additional enhancements to its ACL\nmethodology. Such enhancements may have an impact on the level of the ACL in future periods.\nPlease also see Note 5 – Allowance for Credit Losses, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion\nconcerning the Company’s ACL methodology.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill arises from the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations and represent the excess of the fair value of the\nconsideration transferred, plus any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is deemed to have\nan indefinite life, is not subject to amortization, and instead is tested for impairment at least annually. The Company’s policy is to assess goodwill for\nimpairment in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or circumstances lead management to believe the value of goodwill may\nbe impaired. Impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level, which is considered the Company level as management has identified the\nCompany as its sole reporting unit as of the date of the consolidated statements of financial condition. Management’s assessment of goodwill is\nperformed in accordance with ASC 350-20 - Goodwill and Other - Goodwill, which allows the Company to first perform a qualitative assessment of\ngoodwill to determine if it is more likely than not the fair value of the Company’s equity is below its carrying value. However, GAAP also allows the\nCompany, at its option, to unconditionally forego the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to a quantitative assessment. When performing a\nqualitative assessment of goodwill, should the results of such analysis indicate it is more likely than not the fair value of the Company’s equity is\nbelow its carrying value, the Company then performs the quantitative assessment of goodwill to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and\ncompares it to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is below its carrying value, the Company would then recognize the amount of\nimpairment as the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the\nreporting unit. Impairment losses are recorded as a charge to noninterest expense.\nSignificant judgment is used in the assessment of goodwill, both in a qualitative assessment and a quantitative assessment. Assessments of\ngoodwill often require the use of fair value estimates, which are dependent upon various factors including estimates concerning the Company’s long-\nterm growth prospects. Imprecision in estimates can affect the estimated fair value of the reporting unit in a goodwill assessment. Additionally,\nvarious events or circumstances could have a negative effect on the estimated fair value of a reporting unit, including declines in business\nperformance, increases in credit losses, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, which may result in a material impairment charge\nto earnings in future periods.\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe Company assessed goodwill for impairment by performing a quantitative assessment with the assistance of an independent third-party,\nand the results of this assessment indicated the value of goodwill assets were not impaired. The Company uses a combination of an income approach\nand a market approach for its quantitative assessment. These valuation techniques consider several other factors beyond our market capitalization.\nThe Company considers such factors as the estimated future cash flows of our reporting unit based on internal long-term forecasts, assumptions\nconcerning potential synergies and other economic benefits, and the discount rate used to present value such cash flows to determine the fair value\nunder the income approach. The Company considers valuation metrics commonly used in the banking industry, including the selection of peer data\nutilized in the market approach. Changes to input assumptions used in the analysis could result in materially different valuations of goodwill. Also,\nthe selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower estimates of fair value. Judgment is applied in\ndetermining the weightings between the income approach and market approach in determining fair value.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nThe Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s\noperational performance and to enhance investors’ overall understanding of such financial performance. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is\na numerical measure of a company’s financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that exclude (or include) amounts that are included in\n(or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. However, these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures are supplemental and are not a substitute for an analysis based on GAAP measures and may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial\nmeasures that may be presented by other companies. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to\ngain an understanding of the operating results of our core business. The non-GAAP measures the Company uses include the following:\n• Tangible common equity amounts and ratios, tangible assets, and tangible book value per share: These figures represent total\nshareholders’ equity reduced by the amount of intangible assets, including goodwill. We believe that this information is important to\nshareholders as tangible equity is a measure that is consistent with the calculation of capital for bank regulatory purposes, which\nexcludes intangible assets from the calculation of risk-based ratios. Given that the use of these measures is prevalent among banking\nregulators, investors, and analysts, we disclose them in addition to equity-to-assets ratio, total assets, and book value per share,\nrespectively.\n• Adjusted return on average assets: This figure is calculated by excluding the net loss from investment securities repositioning during the\nfourth quarter of 2023, the FDIC special assessment, merger-related expense, and the related tax impact from net income. We believe\nthat the exclusion of such nonrecurring items from this financial measure provides useful information to gain an understanding of the\noperating results of our core business and a better comparison of financial performance.\n• Return on average tangible common equity: This figure is calculated by excluding amortization of intangible assets from net income and\nexcluding the average intangible assets and average goodwill from the average stockholders’ equity during the period. We believe that\nthe exclusion of such items from this financial measure provides useful information to gain an understanding of the operating results of\nour core business. The adjusted net income, adjusted return on average equity, and adjusted return on average tangible common equity\nfurther exclude the nonrecurring items to provide a better comparison to the financial results of prior periods.\n58\nTable of Contents\n• Adjusted earnings per share: We calculate the adjusted basic earnings per common share by dividing net income allocable to common\nshareholders, excluding the net loss from the investment securities repositioning during the fourth quarter of 2023, the FDIC special\nassessment, merger-related expense, and the related tax impact, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the\nreporting period, excluding outstanding participating securities. The adjusted diluted earnings per common share is computed by\ndividing net income allocable to common shareholders, excluding the net loss from investment securities repositioning, the FDIC special\nassessment, merger-related expense, and the related tax impact, by the weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding\nover the reporting period, adjusted to include the effect of potentially dilutive common shares based on adjusted net income, but\nexcludes awards considered participating securities. The computation of diluted earnings per common share excludes the impact of the\nassumed exercise or issuance of securities that would have an anti-dilutive effect. Management believes that the exclusion of such items\nfrom this financial measure provides useful information to gain an understanding of the operating results of our core business and a\nbetter comparison of financial performance.\n• Efficiency ratio: This figure represents the ratio of noninterest expense less other real estate owned operations, amortization of intangible\nassets, and merger-related expense to the sum of net interest income before provision for credit losses and total noninterest income, less\ngain/(loss) on sale of securities, other income - security recoveries on investment securities, gain/(loss) on sale of other real estate\nowned, and gain/(loss) from debt extinguishment. The adjusted efficiency ratio further excludes the FDIC special assessment to provide\na better comparison to the financial results of prior periods. We believe that the exclusion of such items from this financial measure\nprovides useful information to gain an understanding of the operating results of our core business.\n• Pre-provision net revenue: Pre-provision net revenue is calculated by excluding income tax, provision for credit losses, and merger-\nrelated expenses from net income. We believe that the exclusion of such items from this financial measure provides useful information to\ngain an understanding of the operating results of our core business and a consistent comparison to the financial results of prior periods.\nThe adjusted pre-provision net income further excludes the net loss from investment securities repositioning and the FDIC special\nassessment to provide a better comparison of financial performance.\n• Cost of non-maturity deposits is a non-GAAP financial measure derived from GAAP-based amounts. Cost of non-maturity deposits is\ncalculated as the ratio of non-maturity deposit interest expense to average non-maturity deposits. We calculate non-maturity deposit\ninterest expense by excluding interest expense for all certificates of deposit from total deposit expense, and we calculate average non-\nmaturity deposits by excluding all certificates of deposit from total deposits. We believe that the cost of non-maturity deposits is a useful\nmeasure to assess the Company's deposit base, including its potential volatility.\n59\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables provide

For 2023, we reported net income of $30.9 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared to net income of $283.7 million, or\n$2.98 per diluted share, for 2022. The decrease from 2022 was primarily due to a $255.6 million decrease in net gain from sales of investment\nsecurities, a $72.1 million decrease in net interest income, a $10.3 million increase in noninterest expense, and a $5.3 million increase in provision\nexpense, partially offset by a $97.4 million decrease in income tax expense in 2023.\nOur pre-provision net revenue, which excludes provision for credit losses, merger-related expense, where applicable, and income tax\nexpense from net income, was $44.2 million in 2023, compared to $389.2 million in 2022. The decrease in 2023 from 2022 was primarily due to a\n$255.6 million decrease in net gain from sales of investment securities, $72.1 million decrease in net interest income, and a $10.3 million increase in\nnoninterest expense. For additional details, see “Non-GAAP measures” presented under Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations.\nFor 2023, the Company’s return on average assets was 0.15%, return on average equity was 1.08%, and return on average tangible common\nequity was 2.09%. For 2022, the Company’s return on average assets was 1.32%, return on average equity was 10.18%, and return on average\ntangible common equity was 16.10%. For 2021, the Company’s return on average assets was 1.66%, return on average equity was 12.14%, and\nreturn on average tangible common equity was 19.30%. For additional details, see “Non-GAAP measures” presented under Item 7 - Management’s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe 2023 financial results were impacted by two nonrecurring items, a net loss of $254.1 million from the investment securities portfolio\nrepositioning transaction and a $2.1 million noninterest expense resulting from the FDIC special assessment during the fourth quarter of 2023.\nExcluding the loss from the investment securities repositioning and the FDIC special assessment, our adjusted results were as follows: net income of\n$214.6 million, or $2.26 per diluted share, pre-provision revenue of $300.3 million or 1.44% as a percent of average assets, return on average assets\nof 1.03%, return on average equity of 7.61%, and return on average tangible common equity of 11.95%. For additional details, see “Non-GAAP\nmeasures” presented under Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nNet Interest Income. Our primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned on loans,\ninvestment securities, and interest-earning balances with financial institutions (“interest-earning assets”) and the interest paid on deposits and\nborrowings (“interest-bearing liabilities”). Net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. Net\ninterest income is affected by changes in volume, mix, and rates of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as days in a period.\nFor 2023, net interest income totaled $625.0 million, a decrease of $72.1 million, or 10.34%, from 2022. This reflected increases in cost of\nfunds, an increase in average interest-bearing liabilities of $489.7 million, and a decrease in average interest-earning assets of $771.3 million,\npartially offset by higher yields on interest-earning assets. Net interest margin decreased 24 basis points to 3.29% in 2023 from 3.53% in 2022. The\ndecrease was primarily due to our cost of funds increasing 110 basis points, driven principally by higher rates paid on deposits and higher average\nwholesale/brokered certificates of deposit, partially offset by yields on interest-earning assets increasing 79 basis points, driven primarily by an\nincrease in market rates of interest, a favorable remix of earning-assets, and the deployment of excess liquidity into higher yielding earning assets.\nThe following table presents the average dollar amounts from selected balance sheet categories calculated from daily average balances and\nthe total dollar amount, including adjustments to yields and costs, of:\n• interest income earned from average interest-earning assets and the resultant yields; and\n• interest expense incurred from average interest-bearing liabilities and resultant costs, expressed as rates.\n66\nTable of Contents\nThe following table also sets forth our net interest income, net interest rate spread, and net interest rate margin for the periods indicated. The\nnet interest rate spread represents the difference between the yield on interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The net\ninterest rate margin reflects the ratio of net interest income as a percentage of interest-earning assets for the year.\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nAverage Average Average Average Average Average\n(Dollars in thousands) Balance Interest Yield/Cost Balance Interest Yield/Cost Balance Interest Yield/Cost\nAssets\nInterest-earning assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 1,437,074 $ 67,134 4.67 % $ 678,270 $ 12,691 1.87 % $ 904,159 $ 877 0.10 %\nInvestment securities 3,778,650 103,236 2.73 % 4,301,005 82,167 1.91 % 4,495,956 73,829 1.64 %\nLoans receivable, net (1)(2) 13,759,815 717,615 5.22 % 14,767,554 673,720 4.56 % 13,497,119 622,033 4.61 %\nTotal interest-earning assets 18,975,539 887,985 4.68 % 19,746,829 768,578 3.89 % 18,897,234 696,739 3.69 %\nNoninterest-earning assets 1,812,254 1,766,599 1,595,168\nTotal assets $ 20,787,793 $ 21,513,428 $ 20,492,402\nLiabilities and Equity\nInterest-bearing deposits:\nInterest checking $ 3,152,823 36,520 1.16 % $ 3,681,244 6,351 0.17 % $ 3,276,638 1,270 0.04 %\nMoney market 4,667,007 69,917 1.50 % 5,155,785 12,735 0.25 % 5,507,469 6,824 0.12 %\nSavings 360,546 915 0.25 % 433,156 391 0.09 % 393,332 251 0.06 %\nRetail certificates of deposit 1,385,531 48,237 3.48 % 944,963 6,498 0.69 % 1,248,956 3,332 0.27 %\nWholesale/brokered certificates of\ndeposit 1,434,563 61,858 4.31 % 520,652 14,118 2.71 % 29,645 140 0.47 %\nTotal interest-bearing deposits 11,000,470 217,447 1.98 % 10,735,800 40,093 0.37 % 10,456,040 11,817 0.11 %\nFHLB advances and other\nborrowings 798,667 27,255 3.41 % 574,320 13,131 2.29 % 24,947 99 0.40 %\nSubordinated debentures 331,534 18,244 5.50 % 330,885 18,242 5.51 % 410,067 22,449 5.47 %\nTotal borrowings 1,130,201 45,499 4.03 % 905,205 31,373 3.47 % 435,014 22,548 5.18 %\nTotal interest-bearing\nliabilities 12,130,671 262,946 2.17 % 11,641,005 71,466 0.61 % 10,891,054 34,365 0.32 %\nNoninterest-bearing deposits 5,564,887 6,859,141 6,527,259\nOther liabilities 247,946 224,739 275,496\nTotal liabilities 17,943,504 18,724,885 17,693,809\nStockholders’ equity 2,844,289 2,788,543 2,798,593\nTotal liabilities and equity $ 20,787,793 $ 21,513,428 $ 20,492,402\nNet interest income $ 625,039 $ 697,112 $ 662,374\nNet interest rate spread 2.51 % 3.28 % 3.37 %\nNet interest margin (3) 3.29 % 3.53 % 3.51 %\nCost of deposits (4) 1.31 % 0.23 % 0.07 %\nCost of funds (5) 1.49 % 0.39 % 0.20 %\nCost of non-maturity deposits (6) 0.78 % 0.12 % 0.05 %\nRatio of interest-earning assets to interest-bearing\nliabilities 156.43 % 169.63 % 173.51 %\n________________________________________________\n(1) Average balance includes loans held for sale and nonperforming loans and is net of deferred loan origination fees/costs and discounts/premiums, and the basis adjustments of certain loans included in fair\nvalue hedging relationships.\n(2) Interest income includes net discount accretion of $10.2 million, $21.7 million, and $36.7 million, for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\n(3) Represents net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets.\n(4) Represents annualized interest expense on deposits divided by the sum of average interest-bearing deposits and noninterest-bearing deposits.\n(5) Represents annualized total interest expense divided by the sum of average total interest-bearing liabilities and noninterest-bearing deposits.\n(6) Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures are presented under Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations.\n67\nTable of Contents\nChanges in our net interest income are a function of changes in volume and rates of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nChanges in net interest income that are not a function of changes in volume and rates of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are\nallocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate.

For 2023, the Company recorded a $10.1 million provision expense for credit losses, compared to a $4.8\nmillion provision expense in 2022. The provision expense for 2023 was comprised of an $14.4 million provision expense for loan losses, a $4.4\nmillion provision recapture for unfunded commitments, and an $83,000 provision expense for HTM investment securities. The provision expense for\nloans during 2023 was largely impacted by changes in economic forecasts, slightly higher loss rates and qualitative adjustments, offset by lower\nloans held for investment. The provision recapture for unfunded commitments in 2023 was primarily reflective of lower unfunded commitments,\npartially offset by changes in economic forecasts, and slightly higher overall loss rates. The provision expense for HTM investment securities in\n2023 was largely impacted by changes in economic forecasts.\nThe provision expense for 2022 included an $8.5 million provision expense for loan losses, a $3.6 million provision recapture for unfunded\ncommitments, and a $21,000 provision expense for HTM investment securities. The provision expense for loans was largely impacted by changes to\nthe overall size, composition, and asset quality trends of the loan portfolio. The recapture of the provision for unfunded commitments was reflective\nof favorable changes in the mix of unfunded commitments between various loan segments, as well as qualitative adjustments during 2022.\n68\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth the details of the provision for credit losses for the periods indicated:\nFor the Year Ended December 31, Variance 2023 vs. 2022\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 2021 $ %\nProvision for Credit Losses\nProvision for loan losses $ 14,423 $ 8,459 $ (67,069) $ 5,964 70.5 %\nProvision for unfunded commitments (4,377) (3,648) (3,829) (729) 20.0 %\nProvision for HTM securities 83 21 22 62 295.2 %\nTotal provision for credit losses $ 10,129 $ 4,832 $ (70,876) $ 5,297 109.6 %\nNoninterest (Loss) Income. For 2023, noninterest loss totaled $173.9 million, a decrease of $262.7 million, or 296.0%, from noninterest\nincome of $88.7 million for 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a $255.6 million decrease in net gain from sales of investment securities,\nprimarily due to the net loss of $254.1 million from the investment securities repositioning transaction during the fourth quarter of 2023, a $2.8\nmillion decrease in net gain from loan sales, a $2.5 million decrease in trust custodial account fees, and a $2.3 million decrease in escrow and\nexchange fee income. These decreases were partially offset by a $959,000 increase in earnings on bank owned life insurance. See “-Financial\nCondition - Investment Securities” for additional information with respect to the securities repositioning transaction.\nDuring 2023, we sold $121.1 million of loans, compared to 2022 in which we sold $75.8 million of loans. In 2023, total loans sold included\n$1.9 million in SBA and U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) loans, with an average price of 103.9%, for a net gain of $74,000, and $119.2\nmillion in other loans for a net gain of $341,000, compared with sales of $54.4 million in SBA and USDA loans, with an average price of 103.9% for\na net gain of $3.2 million, and other loans for a net gain of $23,000 in 2022.\nThe following table presents the components of noninterest income for the periods indicated:\nFor the Year Ended December 31, Variance 2023 vs. 2022\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 2021 $ %\nNoninterest Income\nLoan servicing income $ 1,958 $ 1,664 $ 2,121 $ 294 17.7 %\nService charges on deposit accounts 10,620 10,698 9,219 (78) (0.7)%\nOther service fee income 1,213 1,351 1,566 (138) (10.2)%\nDebit card interchange fee income 3,485 3,628 3,489 (143) (3.9)%\nEarnings on bank owned life insurance 14,118 13,159 11,299 959 7.3 %\nNet gain from sales of loans 415 3,238 4,428 (2,823) (87.2)%\nNet (loss) gain from sales of investment securities (253,927) 1,710 16,906 (255,637) (14949.5)%\nTrust custodial account fees 39,129 41,606 38,176 (2,477) (6.0)%\nEscrow and exchange fees 3,994 6,325 7,286 (2,331) (36.9)%\nOther income 5,077 5,369 13,360 (292) (5.4)%\nTotal noninterest (loss) income $ (173,918) $ 88,748 $ 107,850 $ (262,666) (296.0)%\n69\nTable of Contents\nNoninterest Expense. For 2023, noninterest expense totaled $407.0 million, an increase of $10.3 million, or 2.6%, from 2022. The increase\nin noninterest expense was primarily due to increases of $20.1 million in deposit expense driven by growth in HOA deposits and higher deposit\nearnings credit rates, $5.6 million in FDIC insurance premiums, which includes the $2.1 million FDIC special assessment, $3.0 million in data\nprocessing, and $1.2 million in legal and professional services. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $11.6 million in compensation\nand benefits attributable to lower staffing levels and lower incentives during 2023, $2.8 million in other expense, $1.7 million in loan expense, $1.7\nmillion in amortization of intangible assets, and $1.5 million in premises and occupancy expense.\nOur efficiency ratio was 56.0% for 2023, compared to 48.8% for 2022.

The Company recorded income tax expense of $3.2 million in 2023, compared to $100.6 million in 2022, and $120.9 million\nin 2021. Our effective tax rate was 9.4% for 2023, 26.2% for 2022, and 26.2% for 2021. The effective tax rate for each year differs from the 21%\nfederal statutory rate due to the impact of state taxes as well as various permanent tax differences, including tax-exempt income from municipal\nsecurities and loans, Bank owned life insurance income, tax benefits associated with low-income housing tax credit (“LIHTC”) investments, Section\n162(m) limitation on the deduction of executive compensation, and the exercise of stock options and vesting of other stock-based compensation.\nThe effective tax rate for 2023 decreased from 2022 primarily due to the effect of favorable permanent tax differences on a lower pre-tax\nbook income, driven by the balance sheet repositioning related to the Bank’s investment securities portfolio.\nSee Note 14 – Income Taxes of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 hereof for further discussion of income\ntaxes and an explanation of the factors that impact our effective tax rate.\n70\nTable of Contents\nFinancial Condition\nAt December 31, 2023, total assets of the Company were $19.03 billion, a decrease of $2.66 billion, or 12.3%, from $21.69 billion at\nDecember 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a $1.39 billion decrease in loans, a $1.12 billion decrease in investment securities, a $164.8\nmillion decrease in cash and cash equivalents, and a $70.0 million decrease in deferred income taxes, partially offset by a $115.1 million increase in\nother assets.\nTotal liabilities were $16.14 billion at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $2.75 billion, or 14.5%, from $18.89 billion at December 31, 2022.\nThe decrease was primarily due to decreases of $2.36 billion in deposits and $400.0 million in FHLB term advances.\nAt December 31, 2023, our stockholders’ equity amounted to $2.88 billion, an increase of $84.2 million from $2.80 billion at December 31,\n2022. The increase was primarily driven by $165.6 million in other comprehensive income from the realized loss, net of tax, resulting from the sale\nof AFS securities in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $30.9 million of net income, partially offset by $126.3 million in cash dividends in 2023.\nTo address the challenging dynamics from the rising interest rate environment, dislocation in credit, funding, and capital markets, industry-\nwide turmoil experienced during the first half of 2023, as well as rapid succession and heightened regulatory expectations, we took strategic actions\nduring 2023 to increase loan pricing and continued our commitment to conservative credit underwriting standards to manage the lower level of new\nloan demand, increase our deposit pricing to mitigate deposit outflows, further enhance our capital, and bolster our liquidity position by reducing the\nsize of the AFS securities portfolio and adding retail time deposits. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we proactively repositioned our securities\nportfolio to enhance our future earnings profile and provide additional liquidity as we navigate a challenging operating environment.\nThroughout the year, we responded quickly to the industry challenges and collaborated across business lines to meet clients’ needs, deepen\nour relationships with existing clients, and attract new clients to the Bank, generating meaningful growth in new deposit account openings while\nmaintaining pricing discipline. Additionally, as a result of our prudent and proactive capital, liquidity, and credit risk management, coupled with our\nability to opportunistically deploy liquidity generated from the securities portfolio repositioning, we were able to reduce brokered deposits and\nFHLB term borrowings during 2023 while also maintaining liquidity levels. During 2023, we did not utilize either the Federal Reserve's discount\nwindow or the BTFP. We continued to prioritize capital accumulation over balance sheet growth in light of the uncertain economic outlook. The\nstrength of our capital position provides us with greater optionality and flexibility in terms of balance sheet management.\nOur book value per share increased to $30.07 at December 31, 2023 from $29.45 at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2023, the\nCompany’s tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 10.72%, an increase from 8.88% at December 31, 2022. Our tangible book value per\nshare was $20.22 at December 31, 2023, compared to $19.38 at December 31, 2022. The increases in the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible\nassets and tangible book value per share at December 31, 2023 from the prior year-end were primarily driven by other comprehensive income and, to\nthe lesser extent, current year’s net income, partially offset by dividends paid in 2023. The decrease in tangible assets also contributed to the increase\nin tangible common equity ratio. For additional details, see “Non-GAAP measures” presented under Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nof Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n71\nTable of Contents\nInvestment Securities\nOur investment policy, as established by our Asset Liability Committee, attempts to provide and maintain liquidity, capital preservation,\ncomplement our lending activities, support our interest rate risk management strategies, and generate a favorable return on investments without\nincurring undue interest rate and credit risks. Specifically, our investment policy generally limits our investments to U.S. government securities,\nfederal agency-backed securities, U.S. government-sponsored enterprise (“GSE”) guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”), which are\nguaranteed by Fannie Mae (“FNMA”), Freddie Mac (“FHLMC”), Federal Farm Credit Banks (“FFCB”), or Ginnie Mae (“GNMA”), U.S. Treasury\nsecurities, municipal bonds, and corporate bonds, specifically bank debt notes. The Bank has designated all investment securities as AFS or HTM.\nDebt securities classified as AFS are carried at estimated fair value, and debt securities classified as HTM are carried at amortized cost, net of ACL.\nWe primarily use our investment portfolio for liquidity purposes, capital preservation, and to support our interest rate risk management\nstrategies. Our investment securities portfolio amounted to $2.87 billion at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $1.12 billion, or 28%, from $3.99\nbillion at December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily a result of sales of $1.57 billion of AFS securities at fair value with a net loss of $253.9\nmillion, as well as principal payments, fair value discounts from the AFS securities transferred to HTM, amortization, accretion, and redemptions of\n$349.5 million, partially offset by purchases of $784.9 million and a decrease in mark-to-market unrealized loss of $13.9 million in remaining AFS\nsecurities.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, we repositioned our securities portfolio by selling $1.26 billion of lower-yielding AFS securities at fair\nvalue, resulting in a net loss of $254.1 million, to enhance our future earnings profile and provide additional liquidity, reflecting the optionality we\nhave created within the franchise. We redeployed a portion of the sale proceeds into higher-yielding short-term AFS U.S. Treasury securities. In\ngeneral, the purchase of investment securities is primarily related to investing excess liquidity from our banking operations. During 2023, we have\nmaintained a meaningful portion of the AFS securities portfolio in highly liquid, short-term securities while also lowering the effective duration of\nthis portfolio to 0.7 years at December 31, 2023 from 3.1 years at December 31, 2022. This strategy enhances our interest rate sensitivity profile in\nthe current rate environment and provides us with the flexibility to quickly redeploy these funds into higher-yielding assets as opportunities arise.\nAt December 31, 2023, AFS securities and HTM securities were $1.14 billion and $1.73 billion, respectively, compared to $2.60 billion and\n$1.39 billion at December 31, 2022, respectively. AFS securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains or losses on these securities\nrecognized in stockholders’ equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. HTM securities are carried at amortized cost. During 2023,\nthe Company transferred $410.7 million of AFS collateralized mortgage obligations to HTM securities. The Company intends and has the ability to\nhold the securities transferred to maturity. The transfer of these securities was accounted for at fair value on the transfer date. These collateralized\nmortgage obligations had a net carrying amount of $360.3 million with a pre-tax unrealized loss of $50.4 million, which are accreted into interest\nincome as yield adjustments through earnings over the remaining term of the securities. The amortization of the related net after-tax unrealized losses\nreported in accumulated other comprehensive loss offsets the effect on interest income for the accretion of the unrealized losses associated with the\ntransferred securities. No gains or losses were recorded at the time of transfer. The AFS securities transferred to HTM were investment grade with no\ncredit-related issues as of the transfer date. The transfer of AFS securities to HTM was part of our management strategy to limit interest rate impact\nto AOCI. See Note 3 – Investment Securities of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n72\nTable of Contents\nThe ACL on investment securities is determined for both the AFS and HTM classifications of the investment portfolio in accordance with\nASC 326 and evaluated on a quarterly basis. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had an ACL of $126,000 and $43,000, respectively,\nfor HTM investment securities classified as municipal bonds. The Company recognized $83,000, $21,000, and $22,000 of provision for credit losses\nfor HTM investment securities during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The Company had no ACL for AFS\ninvestment securities at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nBelow is a breakdown of the investment security portfolio as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 by investment type and designation.\n2023 2022\nAmortized Fair Amortized Fair\n(Dollars in thousands) Cost Value % Portfolio Cost Value % Portfolio\nAFS investment securities:\nU.S. Treasury $ 538,899 $ 539,256 20.5 % $ 49,156 $ 47,017 1.3 %\nAgency 1,941 1,868 0.1 % 485,331 431,438 11.7 %\nCorporate 481,499 446,343 17.0 % 586,652 542,548 14.7 %\nCollateralized mortgage obligations 153,701 152,604 5.8 % 829,928 764,229 20.6 %\nMortgage-backed securities — — — % 953,678 815,781 22.0 %\nTotal AFS investment securities 1,176,040 1,140,071 43.4 % 2,904,745 2,601,013 70.3 %\nHTM investment securities:\nMunicipal bonds 1,146,244 940,576 35.8 % 1,148,055 890,626 24.1 %\nCollateralized mortgage obligations 334,997 326,992 12.5 % — — — %\nMortgage-backed securities 232,157 201,669 7.7 % 231,692 198,071 5.4 %\nOther 16,269 16,269 0.6 % 8,399 8,399 0.2 %\nTotal HTM investment securities 1,729,667 1,485,506 56.6 % 1,388,146 1,097,096 29.7 %\nTotal investment securities $ 2,905,707 $ 2,625,577 100.0 % $ 4,292,891 $ 3,698,109 100.0 %\nThe following table sets forth the fair value of AFS and the amortized cost of HTM investment securities as well as the weighted average\nyields on our investment security portfolio by contractual maturity as of the date indicated.

The decrease was a result of lower loan originations due to our disciplined approach around credit risk management and loan\npricing along with lower loan demand, particularly in our CRE and multifamily business, as well as higher loan maturities and prepayments as\nclients continue to deploy excess cash to pay down debt. The commercial line average utilization rate for the year ended December 31, 2023\ndecreased to 37% from 40% for the year ended December 31, 2022. In 2023, the decrease in loans was largely attributed to decreases in most\nsegments of our loan portfolio, particularly in multifamily loans of $466.7 million, C&I loans of $370.3 million, CRE owner-occupied loans of\n$240.8 million, CRE non-owner-occupied loans of $238.5 million, and franchise loans of $158.6 million, partially offset by an increase in\nconstruction and land loans of $73.5 million. The decline in loans in 2023 reflects the strategic actions we have taken to maintain a disciplined\napproach to our loan production and pricing in order to manage our balance sheet and capital position, as well as prudent credit underwriting\nstandards to manage the lower level of new loan demand, and focus on bringing high quality banking relationships into the organization.\nThe total end of period weighted average interest rate on loans, excluding fees and discounts, as of December 31, 2023 was 4.87%,\ncompared to 4.61% at December 31, 2022. The year-over-year increase reflects the impact from higher rates on new originations and the repricing of\nloans as a result of the increases in benchmark interest rates.\nLoans held for sale primarily represents the guaranteed portion of SBA loans, which the Bank originates for sale. At December 31, 2023, the\nBank had no loans held for sale, compared to $2.6 million at December 31, 2022.\n75\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio in dollar amounts and as a percentage of the portfolio at the dates\nindicated:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nWeighted Weighted\nPercent Average Percent Average\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount of Total Interest Rate Amount of Total Interest Rate\nInvestor loans secured by real estate\nCRE non-owner-occupied $ 2,421,772 18.2 % 4.72 % $ 2,660,321 18.1 % 4.51 %\nMultifamily 5,645,310 42.5 % 3.97 % 6,112,026 41.6 % 3.86 %\nConstruction and land 472,544 3.5 % 9.08 % 399,034 2.7 % 8.24 %\nSBA secured by real estate 36,400 0.3 % 9.37 % 42,135 0.3 % 7.61 %\nTotal investor loans secured by real estate 8,576,026 64.5 % 4.49 % 9,213,516 62.7 % 4.25 %\nBusiness loans secured by real estate\nCRE owner-occupied 2,191,334 16.5 % 4.36 % 2,432,163 16.6 % 4.22 %\nFranchise real estate secured 304,514 2.3 % 4.77 % 378,057 2.6 % 4.75 %\nSBA secured by real estate 50,741 0.4 % 9.02 % 61,368 0.4 % 7.45 %\nTotal business loans secured by real estate 2,546,589 19.2 % 4.50 % 2,871,588 19.6 % 4.36 %\nCommercial loans\nCommercial and industrial 1,790,608 13.5 % 7.07 % 2,160,948 14.7 % 6.32 %\nFranchise non-real estate secured 319,721 2.4 % 5.01 % 404,791 2.8 % 4.91 %\nSBA non-real estate secured 10,926 0.1 % 9.90 % 11,100 0.1 % 7.83 %\nTotal commercial loans 2,121,255 16.0 % 6.78 % 2,576,839 17.6 % 6.11 %\nRetail loans\nSingle family residential 72,752 0.5 % 7.01 % 72,997 0.5 % 5.51 %\nConsumer 1,949 — % 6.66 % 3,284 — % 6.29 %\nTotal retail loans 74,701 0.5 % 7.00 % 76,281 0.5 % 5.53 %\nLoans held for investment before basis adjustment (1) 13,318,571 100.2 % 4.87 % 14,738,224 100.4 % 4.61 %\nBasis adjustment associated with fair value hedge (2) (29,551) (0.2)% (61,926) (0.4%)\nLoans held for investment 13,289,020 100.0 % 14,676,298 100.0 %\nAllowance for credit losses for loans held for investment (192,471) (195,651)\nLoans held for investment, net $ 13,096,549 $ 14,480,647\nTotal unfunded commitments $ 1,703,470 $ 2,489,203\nLoans held for sale, at lower of cost or fair value $ — $ 2,643\n______________________________\n(1) Includes net deferred origination fees of $74,000 and $1.9 million, and unaccreted fair value net purchase discounts of $43.3 million and $54.8 million as of December 31, 2023\nand 2022, respectively.\n(2) Represents the basis adjustment associated with the application of hedge accounting on certain loans.

When a borrower fails to make required payments on a loan and does not cure the delinquency within 30 days, we\nnormally initiate proceedings to pursue our remedies under the loan documents. For loans secured by real estate, we provide the required notices to\nthe borrower and make any required filings, and commence foreclosure proceedings if necessary. If the loan is not reinstated within the time\npermitted by law, we may sell the property at a foreclosure sale. At these foreclosure sales, we generally acquire title to the property. At\nDecember 31, 2023, loans delinquent 30 or more days as a percentage of total loans held for investment was 0.08%, compared to 0.30% at December\n31, 2022. The increase in delinquent loans during the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the decreases in loans that are 30 - 59 days\npast due and 90 days or more past due, largely driven by payoffs, charge-offs, and the return of loans to current status.\nThe following table sets forth delinquencies in the Company’s loan portfolio at the dates indicated:\n30 - 59 Days 60 - 89 Days 90 Days or More Total\n# of # of # of # of\n(Dollars in thousands) Loans Loan Balance Loans Loan Balance Loans Loan Balance Loans Loan Balance\nDecember 31, 2023\nInvestor loans secured by real estate\nCRE non-owner-occupied — $ — — $ — 1 $ 412 1 $ 412\nSBA secured by real estate — — — — 1 420 1 420\nTotal investor loans secured by real\nestate — — — — 2 832 2 832\nBusiness loans secured by real estate\nCRE owner-occupied — — — — 3 4,655 3 4,655\nFranchise real estate secured 1 292 — — — — 1 292\nSBA secured by real estate 1 137 — — — — 1 137\nTotal business loans secured by\nreal estate 2 429 — — 3 4,655 5 5,084\nCommercial loans\nCommercial and industrial 7 228 9 1,294 1 231 17 1,753\nFranchise non-real estate secured 7 1,559 — — — — 7 1,559\nSBA non-real estate secured 1 249 — — 2 558 3 807\nTotal commercial loans 15 2,036 9 1,294 3 789 27 4,119\nRetail loans\nSingle family residential 1 19 — — — — 1 19\nTotal retail loans 1 19 — — — — 1 19\nTotal 18 $ 2,484 9 $ 1,294 8 $ 6,276 35 $ 10,054\nDelinquent loans to loans held for\ninvestment 0.02 % 0.01 % 0.05 % 0.08 %\n79\nTable of Contents\n30 - 59 Days 60 - 89 Days 90 Days or More Total\n# of # of # of # of\n(Dollars in thousands) Loans Loan Balance Loans Loan Balance Loans Loan Balance Loans Loan Balance\nDecember 31, 2022\nInvestor loans secured by real estate\nCRE non-owner-occupied — $ — — $ — 2 $ 4,429 2 $ 4,429\nMultifamily 1 2,723 — — 2 6,057 3 8,780\nTotal investor loans secured by real\nestate 1 2,723 — — 4 10,486 5 13,209\nBusiness loans secured by real\nestate\nCRE owner-occupied 3 1,434 — — 4 6,555 7 7,989\nFranchise real estate secured 2 7,073 — — — — 2 7,073\nSBA secured by real estate — — 1 104 2 1,087 3 1,191\nTotal business loans secured by\nreal estate 5 8,507 1 104 6 7,642 12 16,253\nCommercial loans\nCommercial and industrial 9 4,657 9 81 4 3,908 22 8,646\nFranchise non-real estate secured 5 3,592 — — — — 5 3,592\nSBA non-real estate secured — — — — 1 589 1 589\nTotal commercial loans 14 8,249 9 81 5 4,497 28 12,827\nRetail loans\nSingle family residential 2 1,057 — — — — 2 1,057\nConsumer 1 2 — — — — 1 2\nTotal retail loans 3 1,059 — — — — 3 1,059\nTotal 23 $ 20,538 10 $ 185 15 $ 22,625 48 $ 43,348\nDelinquent loans to loans held for\ninvestment 0.14 % — % 0.16 % 0.30 %\nModified Loans to Troubled Borrowers\nOn January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2022-02, which introduces new reporting requirements for modifications of loans to\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty, which the Company also refers to as modified loans to troubled borrowers (“MLTB”). An MLTB arises\nfrom a modification made to a loan in response to a borrower’s financial difficulty, in order to alleviate temporary impairments in the borrower’s\nfinancial condition and/or constraints on the borrower’s ability to repay the loan, and to minimize potential losses to the Company. GAAP requires\nthat certain types of modifications be reported, which consist of the following:\n• Principal forgiveness\n• Interest rate reduction\n• Other-than-insignificant payment delay\n• Term extension\n• Any combination of the above\nSee Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the notes to the consolidated financial statements in\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion on MLTBs.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had two syndicated C&I participation loan modifications to one borrower experiencing financial\ndifficulty totaling $12.6 million, the modification of which involved other-than-insignificant payment delays. During the year ended December 31,\n2023, there were no MLTBs that had a payment default and had been modified within the 12 months preceding the payment default.\n80\nTable of Contents\nTroubled Debt Restructurings\nPrior to the Company’s adoption of ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) - Troubled Debt Restructurings and\nVintage Disclosures on January 1, 2023, the Company, in infrequent situations, would modify or restructure loans when the borrower was\nexperiencing financial difficulties by making a concession to the borrower. Such concessions typically were in the form of changes in the\namortization terms, reductions in the interest rates, acceptance of interest-only payments, and, in very few cases, reduction of the outstanding loan\nbalances. These loans were classified as troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”). ASU 2022-02 eliminated the concept of TDRs in current GAAP, and\ntherefore, beginning January 1, 2023, the Company no longer reports loans modified as TDRs following the Company’s adoption of ASU 2022-02\non January 1, 2023.\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company had five loans modified as TDRs totaling $16.1 million, which comprised of three CRE owner-\noccupied loans and one C&I loan totaling $5.1 million belonging to one borrower relationship with the terms modified due to bankruptcy, and a\nfranchise non-real estate secured loan for $11.0 million belonging to another borrower relationship with the terms modified for payment deferral.\nDuring 2022, the three CRE owner-occupied loans and one C&I loan classified as TDRs were in payment default and on nonaccrual status as\nDecember 31, 2022. The franchise non-real estate secured loan was performing in accordance with the restructured contractual terms and was\nreturned to accrual status as of December 31, 2022.\nCredit Quality\nWe separate our loans by type, and we segregate the loans into various risk grade categories of “Pass,” “Special Mention,” “Substandard,”\n“Doubtful,” or “Loss.” We use risk grades as a means of measuring risk for determining the valuation allowance for both asset groups and individual\nassets at a point in time. Risk grades are reviewed regularly with the Company’s Credit and Portfolio Review Committee, and the portfolio\nmanagement and risk grading process is reviewed on an ongoing basis by both an independent loan review function and periodic internal audits, as\nwell as by regulatory agencies during scheduled examinations. For additional information on the Company’s credit quality and credit risk grades, see\nNote 4 – Loans Held for Investment to the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nClassified loans consists of those with a credit risk rating of substandard, doubtful, or loss. Classified loans totaled $142.0 million, or 1.07%\nof loans held for investment, at December 31, 2023, compared with $149.3 million, or 1.02% of loans held for investment, at December 31, 2022. As\nof December 31, 2023, we had two non-relationship syndicated C&I participation loans to one lending relationship totaling $12.6 million on\nnonaccrual status, consisting of a $8.1 million loan classified as substandard and another $4.5 million loan classified as doubtful. These loans were\nmodified as MLTBs during the third quarter of 2023. Subsequent to the loan modification, all loans were paid current as of December 31, 2023.\nThere were no loans classified as doubtful as of December 31, 2022. During 2023, we closely monitored the systemic issues impacting our\nborrowers such as the industry-wide turmoil experienced in the first half of 2023, economic uncertainty, supply chain disruptions exacerbated by\ngeopolitical instability, inflationary pressures, higher interest rates as well as the trends in commercial real estate markets, including pressures on\nrents, vacancies, expenses and capitalization rates. We also continued our practice of proactively identifying and managing potentially weaker\ncredits.\n81\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables stratify the loan portfolio by the Company’s internal risk grading as of the dates indicated:\nCredit Risk Grades\nSpecial\n(Dollars in thousands) Pass Mention Substandard Doubtful Total\nDecember 31, 2023\nInvestor loans secured by real estate\nCRE non-owner-occupied $ 2,406,719 $ 6,966 $ 8,087 $ — $ 2,421,772\nMultifamily 5,633,682 11,628 — — 5,645,310\nConstruction and land 472,544 — — — 472,544\nSBA secured by real estate 28,271 — 8,129 — 36,400\nTotal investor loans secured by real estate 8,541,216 18,594 16,216 — 8,576,026\nBusiness loans secured by real estate\nCRE owner-occupied 2,117,985 34,480 38,869 — 2,191,334\nFranchise real estate secured 288,013 9,674 6,827 — 304,514\nSBA secured by real estate 45,586 619 4,536 — 50,741\nTotal business loans secured by real estate 2,451,584 44,773 50,232 — 2,546,589\nCommercial loans\nCommercial and industrial 1,651,102 81,250 53,714 4,542 1,790,608\nFranchise non-real estate secured 299,189 4,230 16,302 — 319,721\nSBA non-real estate secured 9,970 — 956 — 10,926\nTotal commercial loans 1,960,261 85,480 70,972 4,542 2,121,255\nRetail loans\nSingle family residential 72,752 — — — 72,752\nConsumer loans 1,949 — — — 1,949\nTotal retail loans 74,701 — — — 74,701\nLoans held for investment before basis adjustment (1) $ 13,027,762 $ 148,847 $ 137,420 $ 4,542 $ 13,318,571\nDecember 31, 2022\nInvestor loans secured by real estate\nCRE non-owner-occupied $ 2,647,607 $ 7,487 $ 5,227 $ — $ 2,660,321\nMultifamily 6,089,836 12,667 9,523 — 6,112,026\nConstruction and land 399,034 — — — 399,034\nSBA secured by real estate 33,161 — 8,974 — 42,135\nTotal investor loans secured by real estate 9,169,638 20,154 23,724 — 9,213,516\nBusiness loans secured by real estate\nCRE owner-occupied 2,363,719 2,351 66,093 — 2,432,163\nFranchise real estate secured 352,645 18,036 7,376 — 378,057\nSBA secured by real estate 55,865 118 5,385 — 61,368\nTotal business loans secured by real estate 2,772,229 20,505 78,854 — 2,871,588\nCommercial loans\nCommercial and industrial 2,093,726 31,273 35,949 — 2,160,948\nFranchise non-real estate secured 368,013 27,583 9,195 — 404,791\nSBA non-real estate secured 9,550 — 1,550 — 11,100\nTotal commercial loans 2,471,289 58,856 46,694 — 2,576,839\nRetail loans\nSingle family residential 72,992 — 5 — 72,997\nConsumer loans 3,257 — 27 — 3,284\nTotal retail loans 76,249 — 32 — 76,281\nLoans held for investment before basis adjustment (1) $ 14,489,405 $ 99,515 $ 149,304 $ — $ 14,738,224\n______________________________\n(1) Excludes the basis adjustment of $29.6 million and $61.9 million to the carrying amount of certain loans included in fair value hedging relationships at December 31, 2023 and 2022 .

Nonaccrual loans generally consist of loans that are 90 days or more past due and loans where, in the opinion of\nmanagement, there is reasonable doubt as to the collection of principal and interest.\nNonperforming assets decreased by $5.8 million to $25.1 million, or 0.13% of total assets, at December 31, 2023, compared to $30.9\nmillion, or 0.14% of total assets, at December 31, 2022.

The\nACL is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to provide for expected credit losses in the portfolio as of the date of the\nconsolidated statements of financial condition. Estimating expected credit losses requires management to use relevant forward-looking information,\nincluding the use of reasonable and supportable forecasts. The measurement of the ACL is performed by collectively evaluating loans with similar\nrisk characteristics. Loans that have been deemed by management to no longer possess similar risk characteristics are evaluated individually under a\ndiscounted cash flow approach, except those that have been deemed collateral dependent are evaluated individually based on the expected estimated\nfair value of the underlying collateral.\nThe Company measures the ACL on commercial real estate and commercial loans using a discounted cash flow approach, using the loan’s\neffective interest rate, while the ACL for retail loans is based on a historical loss rate model. The discounted cash flow methodology relies on several\nsignificant components essential to the development of estimates for future cash flows on loans and unfunded commitments. These components\nconsist of: (i) the estimated probability of default (“PD”), (ii) the estimated loss given default (“LGD”), which represents the estimated severity of\nthe loss when a loan is in default, (iii) estimates for prepayment activity on loans, and (iv) the estimated exposure to the Company at default\n(“EAD”). In the case of unfunded loan commitments, the Company incorporates estimates for utilization, based on historical loan data. PD and LGD\nfor investor loans secured by real estate loans are derived from a third party, using proxy loan information, and loan and property level attributes. PD\nfor both investor and business real estate loans, as well as commercial loans, is heavily impacted by current and expected economic conditions.\nForecasts for PDs and LGDs are made over a two-year period, which we believe is reasonable and supportable, and are based on economic scenarios.\nBeyond this point, PDs and LGDs revert to their historical long-term averages. The Company has reflected this reversion over a period of three years\nin the ACL model.\nThe Company’s ACL includes assumptions concerning current and future economic conditions using reasonable and supportable forecasts\nfrom an independent third party. These economic forecast scenarios are based on past events, current conditions, and the likelihood of future events\noccurring. Management periodically evaluates economic scenarios used in the Company’s ACL model, and thus the scenarios as well as the\nassumptions within those scenarios, and whether to use a weighted multiple scenario approach, can vary from one period to the next based on\nchanges in current and expected economic conditions, and due to the occurrence of specific events. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s ACL\nmodel used three weighted scenarios representing a base-case scenario, an upside scenario, and a downside scenario. The use of three weighted\nscenarios at December 31, 2023 is consistent with the approach used in the Company’s ACL model at December 31, 2022. The Company’s ACL\nmodel at December 31, 2023 includes assumptions concerning the interest rate environment, general uncertainty concerning future economic\nconditions, and the potential for future recessionary conditions. The Company has identified certain economic variables that have significant\ninfluence in the Company’s model for determining the ACL. These key economic variables include changes in the U.S. unemployment rate, U.S. real\nGDP growth, CRE prices, and interest rates.\n84\nTable of Contents\nThe Company considers the need for qualitative adjustments to the ACL on a quarterly basis. Qualitative adjustments may be related to and\ninclude, but not be limited to, factors such as (i) management’s assessment of economic forecasts used in the model and how those forecasts align\nwith management’s overall evaluation of current and expected economic conditions, (ii) organization-specific risks such as credit concentrations,\ncollateral-specific risks, regulatory risks, and external factors that may ultimately impact credit quality, (iii) potential model limitations such as\nlimitations identified through back-testing, and other limitations associated with factors such as underwriting changes, acquisition of new portfolios\nand changes in portfolio segmentation, and (iv) management’s overall assessment of the adequacy of the ACL, including an assessment of model\ndata inputs used to determine the ACL. Qualitative adjustments at December 31, 2023 served to increase or decrease the level of allocated ACL to\nthese segments of the loan portfolio: investor loans secured by real estate, business loans secured by real estate, and commercial loans.\nThe following charts quantify certain factors attributing to the changes in the ACL on loans held for investment for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022:\n______________________________\n(1) Certain factors attributing to the changes in the ACL for 2022 have been reclassified to conform to the 2023 presentation.\nAt December 31, 2023, the ACL on loans was $192.5 million, a decrease of $3.2 million from $195.7 million at December 31, 2022. The\ndecrease in the ACL for loans held for investment during 2023 was attributable to net charge-offs of $17.6 million, partially offset by $14.4 million\nin provision for credit losses. The provision for credit losses in 2023 was largely impacted by changes in economic forecasts, slightly higher loss\nrates, and changes in qualitative adjustments, offset by lower loans held for investment. Charge-offs during 2023 were largely attributed to two C&I\nlending relationships, two CRE non-owner-occupied lending relationships, one CRE owner-occupied lending relationship, and one multifamily\nlending relationship.\nThe decrease in the ACL during 2022 of $2.1 million was reflective of $10.6 million in net charge-offs, partially offset by $8.5 million in\nprovision for credit losses. The provision for credit losses in 2022 was largely impacted by changes to the overall size, composition, and asset quality\ntrends of the loan portfolio. Charge-offs during 2022 were largely attributed to one C&I lending relationship and two CRE non-owner-occupied\nlending relationships.\n85\nTable of Contents\nThe Company maintains an ACL for off-balance sheet commitments related to unfunded loans and lines of credit, which is included in other\nliabilities of the consolidated statements of financial condition. The allowance for off-balance sheet commitments was $19.3 million and\n$23.6 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decline in the allowance for off-balance sheet commitments in 2023 was attributed\nto a provision recapture for off-balance sheet commitments of $4.4 million, which was primarily related to a decrease in the balance of unfunded\ncommitments, changes in the mix of unfunded commitments between various loan segments, as well as qualitative adjustments during 2023.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company believes the ACL was adequate to cover current expected credit losses in the loan portfolio.\nHowever, no assurance can be given that we will not, in any particular period, sustain credit losses that exceed the amount reserved, or that\nsubsequent evaluation of our loan portfolio, in light of prevailing factors, including economic conditions that may adversely affect our market area or\nother circumstances, will not require significant increases in the ACL. In addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination\nprocess, periodically review our ACL and may require us to recognize changes to the ACL based on judgments different from those of management.\nShould any of the factors considered by management in evaluating the appropriate level of the ACL change, including the size and composition of\nthe loan portfolio, the credit quality of the loan portfolio, as well as forecasts of future economic conditions, the Company’s estimate of current\nexpected credit losses could also significantly change and affect the level of future provisions for credit losses.\n86\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth the Company’s ACL, its corresponding percentage of the loan category balance, and the percent of loan\nbalance to total loans held for investment in each of the loan categories listed as of the dates indicated:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nAllowance as a % of Loans in Allowance as a % of Loans in\n% of Category Category to % of Category Category to\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount Total Total Loans Amount Total Total Loans\nInvestor loans secured by real estate\nCRE non-owner-occupied $ 31,030 1.28 % 18.2 % $ 33,692 1.27 % 18.1 %\nMultifamily 56,312 1.00 % 42.5 % 56,334 0.92 % 41.6 %\nConstruction and land 9,314 1.97 % 3.5 % 7,114 1.78 % 2.7 %\nSBA secured by real estate 2,182 5.99 % 0.3 % 2,592 6.15 % 0.3 %\nTotal investor loans secured by real estate 98,838 1.15 % 64.5 % 99,732 1.08 % 62.7 %\nBusiness loans secured by real estate\nCRE owner-occupied 28,787 1.31 % 16.5 % 32,340 1.33 % 16.6 %\nFranchise real estate secured 7,499 2.46 % 2.3 % 7,019 1.86 % 2.6 %\nSBA secured by real estate 4,427 8.72 % 0.4 % 4,348 7.09 % 0.4 %\nTotal business loans secured by real estate 40,713 1.60 % 19.2 % 43,707 1.52 % 19.6 %\nCommercial loans\nCommercial and industrial 36,692 2.05 % 13.5 % 35,169 1.63 % 14.7 %\nFranchise non-real estate secured 15,131 4.73 % 2.4 % 16,029 3.96 % 2.8 %\nSBA non-real estate secured 458 4.19 % 0.1 % 441 3.97 % 0.1 %\nTotal commercial loans 52,281 2.46 % 16.0 % 51,639 2.00 % 17.6 %\nRetail loans\nSingle family residential 505 0.69 % 0.5 % 352 0.48 % 0.5 %\nConsumer loans 134 6.88 % — % 221 6.73 % — %\nTotal retail loans 639 0.86 % 0.5 % 573 0.75 % 0.5 %\nTotal (1) $ 192,471 1.45 % 100.0 % $ 195,651 1.33 % 100.0 %\n______________________________\n(1) Total loans utilized in the calculation of the ratio of ACL to total loans held for investment includes $29.6 million and $61.9 million of the basis adjustment of certain loans used in\nfair value hedging relationships for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

The decrease in\ndeposits was due to decreases of $1.37 billion in noninterest-bearing checking, $806.5 million in brokered certificates of deposit, $554.2 million in\nmoney market and savings, and $220.2 million in interest-bearing checking, partially offset by an increase of $598.1 million in retail certificates of\ndeposit.\nAt December 31, 2023, non-maturity deposits totaled $12.70 billion, or 84.70% of total deposits, a decrease of $2.15 billion, or 14.5% from\nDecember 31, 2022. The decrease was impacted by clients redeploying funds into higher yielding alternatives, prepaying or paying down loans, and\nshifting depositor behavior following the industry-wide turmoil experienced in the first half of 2023.\nAt December 31, 2023, maturity deposits totaled $2.29 billion, a decrease of $208.4 million, or 8.3%, from December 31, 2022. The\ndecrease was primarily driven by a reduction of $806.5 million in brokered certificates of deposit, offset in part by an increase of $598.1 million in\nretail certificates of deposit.\nThe following table sets forth the average balance of deposit accounts and the weighted average rates paid for the periods indicated:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nAverage Average Average Average\n(Dollars in thousands) Balance Cost Balance Cost\nDeposits\nNoninterest-bearing checking $ 5,564,887 — % $ 6,859,141 — %\nInterest-bearing checking 3,152,823 1.16 % 3,681,244 0.17 %\nMoney market 4,667,007 1.50 % 5,155,785 0.25 %\nSavings 360,546 0.25 % 433,156 0.09 %\nRetail certificates of deposit 1,385,531 3.48 % 944,963 0.69 %\nWholesale/brokered certificates of deposit 1,434,563 4.31 % 520,652 2.71 %\nTotal deposits $ 16,565,357 1.31 % $ 17,594,941 0.23 %\nThe increase in the weighted average cost of deposits in 2023 from 2022 was principally driven by higher pricing across all deposit product\ncategories in the rising interest rate environment and a greater mix of maturity deposits during 2023.\nThe total end-of-period weighted average interest rate of total deposits was 1.55%, an increase from 0.79% at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe increase was principally driven by the increase in deposit costs in the current the rate environment. At December 31, 2023, the end-of-period\nweighted average rate of non-maturity deposits was 1.04%, compared to 0.43% at December 31, 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Bank counted one client, a property management holding company, with deposits of $703.0 million, or 4.7%\nof total deposits, which was comprised of 5,791 HOA and other property management-related companies and 10,703 total deposit accounts. No other\nindividual depositor represented more than 1.2% of our total deposits, and our top 50 depositors represented 12.6% of our total deposits.\nOur ratio of loans to deposits was 88.6% and 84.6% at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n89\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth the estimated deposits exceeding the FDIC insurance limit:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022\nUninsured deposits $ 5,976,621 $ 5,756,162\nThe Bank is a member of the IntraFi Network, which allows our customers to access FDIC insurance protection on deposits that exceed the\nFDIC insurance limit while the Bank receives reciprocal deposits from other FDIC-insured banks. These reciprocal deposits acquired by the Bank\nthrough IntraFi, including both the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service CDARS and Insured Cash Service ICS programs, offer\nprotection to depositors by fully insuring deposits with other network banks.\nAt December 31, 2023 the Company’s FDIC-insured deposits as a percentage of total deposits was 60%. Insured and collateralized deposits\ncomprised 66% of total deposits at December 31, 2023, which includes federally-insured deposits, $732.6 million of collateralized municipal and\ntribal deposits, and $70.0 million of privately insured deposits.\nThe estimated aggregate amount of time deposits in excess of the FDIC insurance limit is $534.8 million at December 31, 2023 and $382.0\nmillion at December 31, 2022.

The Company has a variety of borrowing\nrelationships that it can draw upon to fund its activities. At December 31, 2023, total borrowings amounted to $931.8 million, a decrease of $399.4\nmillion, or 30.0%, from December 31, 2022. The decrease in borrowings at December 31, 2023 from December 31, 2022 was primarily due to\nredemptions of $400.0 million in term FHLB advances, partially offset by $638,000 amortization of subordinated debt issuance costs. As a result of\nour proactive liquidity management, we reduced FHLB borrowings by $400.0 million during 2023, and did not utilize either the Federal Reserve\nBank's discount window or the BTFP.\nAt December 31, 2023, total borrowings represented 4.9% of total assets and had an end-of-period weighted average rate of 3.93%,\ncompared with 6.1% of total assets and an end-of-period weighted average rate of 3.72% at December 31, 2022.\n90\nTable of Contents\nFHLB Advances\nThe FHLB system functions as a source of credit to financial institutions that are members. Advances are secured by certain real estate loans,\ninvestment securities, and the capital stock of the FHLB owned by the Company. Subject to the FHLB’s advance policies and requirements, these\nadvances can be requested for any business purpose in which the Company is authorized to engage. In granting advances, the FHLB considers a\nmember’s creditworthiness and other relevant factors. The Company has a line of credit with the FHLB, which provides for advances totaling up to\n30% of its assets. At December 31, 2023, the maximum amount we could borrow through the FHLB was $6.08 billion, of which $4.40 billion\nremained available for borrowing based on collateral pledged of $7.41 billion at carrying value in qualifying real estate loans. At December 31, 2023,\nthe Company had $600.0 million in term FHLB advances, compared to $1.00 billion in term FHLB advances at December 31, 2022.\nOther Borrowings\nThe Company maintains additional sources of liquidity at the Corporation level. The Corporation renewed the $25.0 million line of credit\nwith U.S. Bank that matured in September 2023 and extended the maturity date to September 25, 2024. At December 31, 2023 and December 31,\n2022, the Corporation had no outstanding balances against this line.\nThe Company maintains unsecured lines of credit to purchase federal funds totaling $390.0 million and access through the Federal Reserve\ndiscount window to borrow $2.93 billion based upon current pledged investment security collateral and a $953.5 million line with the BTFP, to be\nutilized as business needs dictate. It is anticipated that the BTFP will expire on March 11, 2024. Federal funds purchased are short-term in nature and\nutilized to meet short-term funding needs. The Company did not utilize either the Federal Reserve Bank's discount window or the BTFP during 2023.\nSubordinated Debentures\nAt December 31, 2023, total subordinated debentures amounted to $331.8 million with a weighted interest rate of 5.31%, compared to\n$331.2 million with a weighted interest rate of 5.32% at December 31, 2022. The decrease of $638,000, or 0.19%, was primarily driven by\namortization of debt issuance costs.\nFor additional information, see Note 13 – Subordinated Debentures of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe following table sets forth certain information regarding the Company’s borrowed funds at or for the years ended on the dates indicated:\n91\nTable of Contents\nAt or For the Year Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022\nFHLB Advances\nBalance outstanding at end of year $ 600,000 $ 1,000,000\nWeighted average interest rate at end of year 3.17 % 3.19 %\nAverage balance outstanding $ 798,630 $ 574,239\nWeighted average interest rate during the year 3.41 % 2.29 %\nMaximum amount outstanding at any month-end during the year $ 1,000,000 $ 1,000,000\nOther Borrowings\nBalance outstanding at end of year $ — $ —\nWeighted average interest rate at end of year — % — %\nAverage balance outstanding $ 37 $ 82\nWeighted average interest rate during the year 6.30 % 1.26 %\nMaximum amount outstanding at any month-end during the year $ — $ —\nSubordinated Debentures\nBalance outstanding at end of year $ 331,842 $ 331,204\nWeighted average interest rate at end of year 5.31 % 5.32 %\nAverage balance outstanding $ 331,534 $ 330,885\nWeighted average interest rate during the year 5.50 % 5.51 %\nMaximum amount outstanding at any month-end during the year $ 331,842 $ 331,204\nTotal Borrowings\nBalance outstanding at end of year $ 931,842 $ 1,331,204\nWeighted average interest rate at end of year 3.93 % 3.72 %\nAverage balance outstanding $ 1,130,201 $ 905,205\nWeighted average interest rate during the year 4.03 % 3.47 %\nMaximum amount outstanding at any month-end during the year $ 1,331,311 $ 1,331,204\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity Management\nOur primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans, FHLB advances and other borrowings, and income from\ninvestments, to meet our financial obligations, which arise primarily from the withdrawal of deposits, extension of credit, and payment of operating\nexpenses. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly\ninfluenced by market interest rates, economic conditions, and competition.\nThe Bank’s and Company’s Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for ensuring policies and procedures are in place that provide for the\nsafety and soundness management of assets and liabilities of the Bank, including liquidity management and interest rate risk policies to ensure these\npolicies are effectively implemented. At the management level, the Bank’s Asset Liability Committee establishes the liquidity guidelines and review\nits ongoing compliance with the policies approved by the Board.\n92\nTable of Contents\nThe objective of liquidity management is to ensure liquidity risk is monitored and controlled. Liquidity risk is the possibility that the\nCompany will not be able to fund present and future obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate\nfunding at a reasonable cost. The Bank and the Company have developed tools to appropriately identify, measure, monitor, and control funding and\nliquidity risk. These tools include daily, monthly, and quarterly reports and risk measures, cash flow projections, stress testing, and a formalized\nContingency Funding Plan (“CFP”) as primary tools for measuring and managing liquidity risk. The CFP provides a framework for the Company to\nevaluate increasingly severe illiquid situations and monitor the availability of funding over these scenarios and addresses the actions that the\nCompany would take in response to both a short-term and long-term funding crisis.\nWe seek to maintain a level of liquid assets to ensure a safe and sound operation. Our liquid assets are comprised of unrestricted cash, short-\nterm investments, and unpledged AFS investments securities. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, lending, and investing\nactivities during any given period. We endeavor to take a prudent, proactive approach to liquidity management, as evidenced by our balance-sheet-\noriented initiatives throughout 2023 and 2022.\nWe believe our level of liquid assets is sufficient to meet current anticipated funding needs. As part of our daily monitoring, we calculate a\nliquidity ratio by dividing the sum of cash balances plus unpledged available-for-sale securities by total deposits, excluding time deposits maturing\none year or more, plus FHLB advances maturing within one year. At December 31, 2023, our liquidity ratio was 13.5%, compared with 21.3% at\nDecember 31, 2022, which is above the Company’s minimum policy requirement of 10.0%. The Company regularly monitors liquidity, models\nliquidity stress scenarios to ensure that adequate liquidity is available, and has contingency funding plans in place, which are reviewed and tested on\na regular, recurring basis.\nAt December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents totaled $936.5 million, compared to $1.10 billion at December 31, 2022. If additional\nliquidity is needed or otherwise desired as part of our liquidity management strategy, we have additional sources of liquidity that can be accessed,\nincluding FHLB advances, federal fund lines, the Federal Reserve Board’s lending programs, brokered deposits, as well as loan and investment\nsecurities sales.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Bank had secured borrowing capacity with the FHLB allowing us to borrow up to 30% of the Bank’s total assets\nequating to a credit line of $6.08 billion, of which $4.40 billion remained available for borrowing based on collateral pledged by qualifying real\nestate loans with an aggregate carrying value of $7.41 billion. At December 31, 2023, our FHLB term borrowings totaled $600.0 million.\nAdditionally, we had a $2.93 billion line with the FRB discount window secured by investment securities as well as qualifying loans, a $953.5\nmillion line with the BTFP, which is anticipated to expire on March 11, 2024, unsecured lines of credit aggregating to $390.0 million with other\ncorrespondent banks from which to purchase federal funds, and AFS investment securities with the aggregate market value of $1.14 billion. Our\nunused borrowing capacity was $8.68 billion, and the combined readily available liquidity with cash and cash equivalents of $936.5 million, interest-\nbearing time deposits with financial institutions of $995,000, as well as short-term AFS U.S. Treasury securities of $294.9 million, totaled\napproximately $9.91 billion, with a coverage ratio of 191.5% to uninsured and uncollateralized deposits.\n93\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s primary source of funding is from our ability to generate low-cost commercial and consumer deposits, which totaled $15.00\nbillion as of December 31, 2023, comprised of approximately 157,000 deposit accounts and cash held in approximately 29,000 custodial accounts.\nThrough our commercial banking teams, 58 branches, electronic banking and call-center delivery channels, we offer a broad array of deposit and\ntreasury management products and services. In addition, we are able to generate low-cost deposits through our specialty business lines. Our Pacific\nPremier Trust division maintains balances of ancillary custodial client cash assets held in clients’ accounts as deposits at the Bank. Our Commerce\nEscrow division maintains balances of escrow funds and the sale proceeds of properties to be exchanged in tax-deferred 1031 exchanges as deposits\nat the Bank. In addition, our HOA & Property Banking division generates deposits through the specialized treasury and cash management deposit\nproducts we offer. The Bank’s participation in IntraFi’s CDARS and ICS programs provides our depositors with full deposit insurance coverage of\nexcess balances, while the Bank receives reciprocal deposits from other FDIC-insured banks, and helps the Bank to retain the full amount of the\ndeposits on its balance sheet, enhancing the Company’s funding stability. Our noninterest-bearing deposits as a percentage of total deposits was\n32.9% as of December 31, 2023, reflecting our strong client relationship model.\nA substantial portion of our loans were funded by our deposits, which amounted to $15.00 billion and $17.35 billion as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively. At December 31, 2023, the Company’s loan-to-deposit ratio was 88.6%, compared with 84.6% at December 31, 2022.\nThe increase was primarily associated with our deposits decreasing at a slightly higher rate relative to our loans decreasing during the\nperiod. Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in one year or less from December 31, 2023 totaled $2.18 billion and are comprised of\n$610.2 million in brokered certificates of deposit and $1.57 billion in retail certificates of deposit. We anticipate both reducing our higher cost\nbrokered deposits and that the majority of our retail certificates of deposit will renew or transfer to other deposit products of the Bank at prevailing\nrates, although no assurance can be given.\nTo the extent that 2023 deposit growth is not sufficient to satisfy our ongoing commitments to fund maturing and withdrawable deposits,\nrepay maturing borrowings, fund existing and future loans, or make investments, we may access funds through our FHLB borrowing arrangement,\nunsecured lines of credit, or other sources.\nThe Bank maintains liquidity guidelines in the Company’s Liquidity Policy that permits the purchase of brokered deposit funds, in an\namount not to exceed 15% of total deposits, or 12% of total assets, as a secondary source for funding. At December 31, 2023, the Company had\n$610.2 million in brokered deposits, which constituted 4.1% of total deposits and 3.2% of total assets. At December 31, 2022, the Company had\n$1.42 billion in brokered deposits, which constituted 8.2% of total deposits and 6.5% of total assets.\nThe Corporation is a corporate entity separate and apart from the Bank that must provide for its own liquidity. The Corporation’s primary\nsources of liquidity are dividends from the Bank. There are statutory and regulatory provisions that limit the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to\nthe Corporation. Management believes that such restrictions will not have a material impact on the ability of the Corporation to meet its ongoing\ncash obligations. During 2023, the Bank paid $199.7 million in dividends to the Corporation, compared to $131.2 million during 2022.\nThe Corporation maintains a line of credit with U.S. Bank with availability of $25.0 million that will expire on September 25, 2024. The\nCorporation anticipates renewing the line of credit upon expiration. This line of credit provides an additional source of liquidity at the Corporation\nlevel. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, the Corporation had no outstanding balances against this line of credit.\n94\nTable of Contents\nThe Financial Code provides that a bank may not make a cash distribution to its stockholders in excess of the lesser of a (i) bank’s retained\nearnings; or (ii) bank’s net income for its last three fiscal years, less the amount of any distributions made by the bank or by any majority-owned\nsubsidiary of the bank to the stockholders of the bank during such period. However, a bank may, with the approval of the DFPI, make a distribution\nto its stockholders in an amount not exceeding the greatest of (i) its retained earnings; (ii) its net income for its last fiscal year; or (iii) its net income\nfor its current fiscal year. In the event that the DFPI determines that the stockholders’ equity of a bank is inadequate or that the making of a\ndistribution by the bank would be unsafe or unsound, the DFPI may order the bank to refrain from making a proposed distribution. Under these\nprovisions, the amount available for distribution from the Bank to the Corporation was approximately $260.9 million at December 31, 2023.\nThe Corporation’s ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to the guidance set forth in Federal Reserve’s Supervision and Regulations\nletter 09-4 (“SR 09-4”). The BHC should serve as a source of managerial and financial strength to its subsidiary banks, and consistent with this\npremise, hold capital commensurate with its overall risk profile. The board of directors of a BHC should assess carefully, among other things, capital\nadequacy and ensure that the dividend level is prudent relative to the organization’s financial position and is not based on overly optimistic earnings\nscenarios. As a general matter, the board of directors of a BHC should inform the Federal Reserve and should eliminate, defer, or significantly reduce\nthe BHC’s dividends if (1) the BHC’s net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that\nperiod, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (2) the BHC’s prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the BHC’s capital\nneeds and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (3) the BHC will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory\ncapital adequacy ratios.\nDuring 2023, the Corporation declared dividends of $126.3 million, or $1.32 per share on its common stock. On January 27, 2024, the\nCompany's Board of Directors declared a $0.33 per share dividend, payable on February 16, 2024 to stockholders of record on February 9, 2024. The\nCorporation anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future, although there can be no assurance that payment of such\ndividends will continue or that they will not be reduced. The payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Board and\nwill depend on the Corporation’s financial condition and operating results, regulatory limitations, tax considerations, and other factors. Interest on\ndeposits will be paid prior to payment of dividends on the Corporation’s common stock.\nOn January 11, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, which authorized the repurchase of up to\n4,725,000 shares of its common stock, representing approximately 5% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock and\napproximately $150 million of common stock as of December 31, 2020 based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on December\n31, 2020. The stock repurchase program may be limited or terminated at any time without notice. See Part II, Item 5. Market for Registrant’s\nCommon Equity, Related Stockholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for additional information.\nMaterial cash requirement\nOur material cash requirements may include funding existing loan commitments, funding equity investments and affordable housing\npartnerships for LIHTC, withdrawal/maturity of existing deposits, repayment of borrowings, operating lease payments, and expenditures necessary\nto maintain current operations.\n95\nTable of Contents\nThe Company enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business as a source of funds for its asset growth and to meet\nrequired capital needs.

These transactions include off-balance sheet commitments, including commitments\nto extend credit and standby letters of credit, and commitments to fund investments that qualify for CRA credit. The following table presents a\nsummary of the Company’s commitments to extend credit by expiration period:\nAt December 31, 2023\n(Dollars in thousands) Less than 1 year More than 1 year Total\nLoan commitments to extend credit $ 1,116,829 $ 538,249 $ 1,655,078\nStandby letters of credit 48,392 — 48,392\nTotal $ 1,165,221 $ 538,249 $ 1,703,470\nSince many commitments to extend credit are expected to expire, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash\nrequirements. For further information, see Note 15 – Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Commitments, and Contingencies in the notes to the\nconsolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nCapital Requirements\nThe Corporation and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Failure to\nmeet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken,\ncould have a direct material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory\nframework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank’s assets,\nliabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank’s capital amounts and classification are\nalso subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.\n96\nTable of Contents\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company’s and the Bank’s Tier 1 capital was $2.08 billion and $2.35 billion, respectively, and total capital was\n$2.52 billion and $2.51 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2023, the Company’s and the Bank’s Tier 1 capital leverage ratio was 11.03% and\n12.43%, common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.32% and 16.13%, Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.32% and 16.13%, and total capital ratio was 17.29%\nand 17.23%, respectively. These capital ratios exceeded the “well capitalized” standards defined by the federal banking regulators under prompt\ncorrective action rules of 5.00% for Tier 1 leverage ratio, 6.50% for common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, 8.00% for Tier 1 capital ratio, and 10.00%\nfor total capital ratio and exceeded the minimum capital ratio levels inclusive of the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer of 4.00%, 7.00%,\n8.50% and 10.50%, respectively. The regulatory capital ratios of the Company and Bank further strengthened at December 31, 2023 compared to the\ncapital ratios at December 31, 2022.\nSee Note 2 – Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Regulatory Matters in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included\nin Item 8 hereof for a discussion of the Bank’s and Corporation’s capital ratios.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nAsset/Liability Management and Market Risk\nMarket risk is the risk of loss in value or reduced earnings from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. The Bank’s market risk\narises primarily from interest rate risk in our lending, investments. and deposit taking activities. Interest rate risk primarily occurs to the degree that\nthe Bank’s interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature on a different basis and frequency than its interest-earning assets. The Bank actively monitors\nand manages its portfolios to limit the adverse effects on net interest income and economic value due to changes in interest rates. The Asset Liability\nCommittee is responsible for implementing the Bank’s interest rate risk management policy established by the Board of Directors that sets forth\nlimits of acceptable changes in net interest income (“NII”) and economic value of equity (“EVE”) due to specified changes in interest rates.\nManagement monitors asset and liability maturities and repricing characteristics on a regular basis and evaluates its interest rate risk as it relates to\noperational strategies.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nThe principal objective of the Company’s interest rate risk management function is to maintain an interest rate risk profile close to the\ndesired risk profile in light of the interest rate outlook. The Bank measures the interest rate risk included in the major balance sheet portfolios and\ncompares the current risk profile to the desired risk profile and to policy limits set by the Board of Directors. Management then implements strategies\nconsistent with the desired risk profile. Asset duration is compared to liability, with the desired mix of fixed and floating rate determined based upon\nthe Company’s risk profile and outlook. Likewise, the Bank seeks to raise non-maturity deposits. Management often implements these strategies\nthrough pricing actions. Finally, management structures its security portfolio and borrowings to offset some of the interest rate sensitivity created by\nthe repricing characteristics of customer loans and deposits.\nManagement monitors asset and liability maturities and repricing characteristics on a regular basis and evaluates its interest rate risk as it\nrelates to operational strategies. Management analyzes potential strategies for their impact on the interest rate risk profile. Each quarter the Board of\nDirectors reviews the Bank’s asset/liability position and simulations showing the impact on the Bank’s EVE in various interest rate scenarios.\nInterest rate moves, up or down, may subject the Bank to interest rate spread compression, which adversely impacts its net interest income. This is\nprimarily due to the lag in repricing of the indices, to which adjustable rate loans and mortgage-backed securities are tied, as well as their repricing\nfrequencies. Furthermore, large rate moves show the impact of interest rate caps and floors on adjustable rate transactions. This is partly offset by\nlags in repricing for deposit products. The extent of the interest rate spread compression depends on the direction and severity of interest rate moves\nand features in the Bank’s product portfolios.\n97\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s interest rate sensitivity is monitored by management through the use of both a simulation model that quantifies the estimated\nimpact to earnings (“Earnings at Risk”) for twelve- and twenty-four month periods, and a model that estimates the change in the Company’s EVE\nunder alternative interest rate scenarios, primarily instantaneous parallel interest rate shifts in 100 basis point increments. The simulation model\nestimates the impact on NII from changing interest rates on interest-earning assets and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities. The EVE\nmodel computes the net present value of equity by discounting all expected cash flows on assets and liabilities under each rate scenario. For each\nscenario, the EVE is the present value of all assets less the present value of all liabilities. The EVE ratio is defined as the EVE divided by the market\nvalue of assets within the same scenario.\nThe following table shows the projected NII and net interest margin of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, assuming\ninstantaneous parallel interest rate shifts in the first month of the following year:\nDecember 31, 2023\n(Dollars in thousands)\nProjected Net Interest\nEarnings at Risk Margin\nChange in Rates (Basis\nPoints) $ Amount $ Change % Change Rate %\n300 667,387 40,063 6.4 3.69\n200 656,958 29,634 4.7 3.63\n100 643,837 16,513 2.6 3.56\nStatic 627,324 — — 3.47\n-100 601,798 (25,526) (4.1) 3.33\n-200 569,355 (57,969) (9.2) 3.15\n-300 534,151 (93,173) (14.9) 2.95\nDecember 31, 2022\n(Dollars in thousands)\nProjected Net Interest\nEarnings at Risk Margin\nChange in Rates (Basis\nPoints) $ Amount $ Change % Change Rate %\n200 787,390 32,342 4.3 4.03\n100 772,657 17,609 2.3 3.95\nStatic 755,048 — — 3.86\n-100 727,456 (27,592) (3.7) 3.72\n-200 681,562 (73,486) (9.7) 3.49\n98\nTable of Contents\nThe following table shows the EVE and projected change in the EVE of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, assuming\ninstantaneous parallel interest rate shifts in the first month of the following year:\nDecember 31, 2023\n(Dollars in thousands)\nEVE as % of market value\nEconomic Value of Equity of portfolio assets\nChange in Rates (Basis\nPoints) $ Amount $ Change % Change EVE Ratio\n300 2,918,718 (236,315) (7.5) 17.70\n200 3,073,927 (81,106) (2.6) 18.11\n100 3,155,901 868 — 18.05\nStatic 3,155,033 — — 17.51\n-100 3,022,479 (132,554) (4.2) 16.28\n-200 2,785,592 (369,441) (11.7) 14.57\n-300 2,445,055 (709,978) (22.5) 12.42\nDecember 31, 2022\n(Dollars in thousands)\nEVE as % of market value\nEconomic Value of Equity of portfolio assets\nChange in Rates (Basis\nPoints) $ Amount $ Change % Change EVE Ratio\n200 3,910,396 9,655 0.2 20.39\n100 3,949,678 48,937 1.3 19.95\nStatic 3,900,741 — — 19.09\n-100 3,770,385 (130,356) (3.3) 17.88\n-200 3,554,253 (346,488) (8.9) 16.34\nBased on the modeling of the impact on earnings and EVE from changes in interest rates, the Company’s sensitivity to changes in interest\nrates is low for rising rates, aided by the addition of interest rate swaps for hedging purposes. With a slightly asset sensitive profile, the Earnings at\nRisk is expected to increase as rates rise. It is important to note the above tables are forecasts based on several assumptions and that actual results\nmay vary. The forecasts are based on estimates of historical behavior and assumptions by management that may change over time and may turn out\nto be different. Factors affecting these estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to (1) competitor behavior, (2) economic conditions\nboth locally and nationally, (3) actions taken by the Federal Reserve, (4) customer behavior, and (5) management’s responses to the foregoing.\nChanges that vary significantly from the assumptions and estimates may have significant effects on the Company’s earnings and EVE.\nThe Company has minimal direct market risk from foreign exchange and no exposure from commodities.\n99\nTable of Contents\nITEM 8.

In our\nopinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and\nthe results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the\nCompany's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated\nFramework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 23, 2024,\nexpressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's\nfinancial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect\nto the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audit included\nperforming procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the\nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as\nevaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated\nor required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and\n(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our\nopinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion\non the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n101\nTable of Contents\nAllowances for Credit Losses on Loans (“ACL”) – Commercial Real Estate and Commercial Loans — Refer to Notes 1 and 5 to the financial\nstatements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company accounts for credit losses on loans by recording an estimate of expected lifetime credit losses for loans at the time of origination or\nacquisition. Estimating expected credit losses requires management to use relevant forward-looking information, including the use of reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts.\nThe Company uses a discounted cash flow model when determining estimates for the ACL. In developing reasonable and supportable forecasts,\nmanagement periodically evaluates the appropriateness of economic scenarios and may decide that a particular economic scenario or a combination\nof probability-weighted economic scenarios should be used in the Company’s ACL model. The economic scenarios are comprised of multiple\neconomic variables, which include the U.S. unemployment rate and U.S. real GDP growth rates, among other variables. The discounted cash flow\nmethodology relies on several significant components essential to the development of estimates for future cash flows on loans. These components\nconsist of: the estimated Probability of Default, the estimated Loss Given Default, which represents the estimated severity of the loss when a loan is\nin default, and the estimated exposure to the Company at default. Changes in economic forecasts, in conjunction with changes in loan specific\nattributes, have an impact on a loan’s probability of default and loss given default, which can drive changes in the determination of the ACL.\nGiven the significance of the ACL related to commercial real estate loans (Investor loans secured by real estate and Business loans secured by real\nestate) and commercial loans, the complexity of the models, and the management judgments required for the selection of appropriate models,\neconomic forecast scenarios and related scenario-weightings, performing audit procedures to evaluate the ACL related to commercial real estate\nloans and commercial loans, requires a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our credit\nspecialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit:\nOur audit procedures related to the ACL described in the preceding paragraph included the following, among others:\n• We tested the effectiveness of controls over the (i) selection of the economic forecast scenarios and scenario related weightings by\nmanagement, (ii) model development and maintenance, (iii) data transfers into and out of the models, (iv) determination of the qualitative\nallowance, and (v) overall calculation and disclosure.\n• We involved our credit specialists to assist us in evaluating the reasonableness and conceptual soundness of the model and methodologies\napplied by management.\n• We tested the completeness and accuracy of the key data used as inputs in the model.\n• We evaluated the reasonableness of the probability-weighted economic scenarios utilized by management in the model.\nGoodwill – Refer to Note 7 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nGoodwill arises from the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations and represents the excess value of the consideration paid over\nthe fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is deemed to have an indefinite life, is not subject to amortization, and instead is tested for\nimpairment at least annually.\nThe goodwill balance was $901.3 million as of December 31, 2023. The Company’s policy is to assess goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter\nof each year or more frequently if events or circumstances lead management to believe the value of goodwill may be impaired. Impairment testing is\nperformed at the reporting unit level.\n102\nTable of Contents\nThe Company assessed goodwill for impairment by performing a quantitative assessment. The quantitative\nassessment utilized a combination of an income approach and a market approach. These valuation techniques consider several assumptions, such as\nthe (i) estimated future cash flows, (ii) potential synergies, (iii) the discount rate used to present value such cash flows to determine the fair value\nunder the income approach, and (iv) the selection of peer data utilized in the market approach.\nAuditing the assessment of goodwill for impairment involves a high degree of subjectivity, including the need to involve our fair value specialists, as\nit relates to evaluating whether management's judgments in determining whether estimated future cash flows, including potential synergies, and the\ndiscount rate used to present value such cash flows were appropriate.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n• We tested the effectiveness of controls over the management judgments to (i) estimate future cash flows, (ii) potential synergies, (iii) the\ndetermination of a discount rate used to present value such cash flows to determine the fair value under the income approach, and (iv) the\nselection of peer data utilized in the market approach.\n• We tested the completeness and accuracy of the key data used as inputs in the determination of future cash flows.\n• We evaluated the reasonableness of the assumptions utilized by management in the determination of the estimated future cash flows.\n• We involved our valuation specialists to assist us in evaluating the reasonableness of the potential synergies, the discount rate used to present\nvalue cash flows to determine fair value under the income approach, and the selection of peer data utilized in the market approach.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nCosta Mesa, CA\nFebruary 23, 2024\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2022.\n103\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Pacific Premier Bancorp, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Pacific Premier Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31,\n2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated\nfinancial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, of the Company and our report dated February 23, 2024, expressed an unqualified\nopinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness\nof internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and\noperating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the\ncircumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting\nand the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately\nand fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as\nnecessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of\nthe company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance\nregarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the\nfinancial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation\nof effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nCosta Mesa, CA\nFebruary 23, 2024\n104\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nShareholders and the Board of Directors of Pacific Premier Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries\nIrvine, California\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows of Pacific\nPremier Bancorp Inc. and the subsidiaries (the “Company”) for the year ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as\nthe \"financial statements\").

Pacific Premier Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation organized in 1997 (the “Corporation”), is a California-based\nbank holding company that owns 100% of the capital stock of Pacific Premier Bank, a California-chartered commercial bank (the “Bank,” and\ntogether with the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company”), the Corporation’s principal operating subsidiary. The Bank was\nincorporated and commenced operations in 1983.\nThe principal business of the Company is attracting deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds\ngenerated from operations and borrowings, primarily in business loans and commercial real estate loans. At December 31, 2023, the Company had\n58 full-service depository branches located in the Western Region of the U.S. in major metropolitan markets in Arizona, California, Nevada, and\nWashington. The Company also offers IRA custodial and maintenance services through its Pacific Premier Trust division, which serves as a\ncustodian for self-directed IRAs as well as certain accounts that do not qualify as IRAs pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code. Account owners use\nthe funds for self-directed investments in various alternative asset classes. Additionally, the Company provides commercial escrow and exchange\nservices through its Commerce Escrow division, which facilitates commercial escrow services and tax-deferred commercial real estate exchanges\nunder Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”). The Company is also subject to the\nregulations of certain governmental agencies, and undergoes periodic examinations by those regulatory authorities.\nPrinciples of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary\nthe Bank. The Company is organized and operates as a single reporting segment, principally engaged in the commercial banking business. All\nsignificant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThe Company consolidates voting entities in which the Company has control through voting interests or entities through which the Company\nhas a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity (“VIE”). The Company evaluates its interests in these entities to determine whether\nthey meet the definition of a VIE and whether the Company is required to consolidate these entities. A VIE is consolidated by its primary beneficiary,\nwhich is the party that has both (i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and (ii) a\nvariable interest that could potentially be significant to the VIE. To determine whether or not a variable interest the Company holds could potentially\nbe significant to the VIE, the Company considers both qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the nature, size, and form of the Company's\ninvolvement with the VIE. See Note 10 – Variable Interest Entities for additional information.\nBasis of Financial Statement Presentation. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the related footnote\ndisclosure for the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Reclassifications had no effect on net income or\nstockholders’ equity as previously reported.\nUse of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial\nstatements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates, and\nthose estimates may change as new information is obtained.\n111\nTable of Contents\nThe following discussion provides a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies:\nCash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash balances due from banks, federal funds sold and cash\nitems in the process of collection. Interest-bearing deposits with financial institutions primarily represent cash held at the Federal Reserve Bank of\nSan Francisco. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve”) has cash reserve requirements for depository institutions\nbased on the amount of deposits held. At December 31, 2023, the Bank had no required balance by the Federal Reserve. The Company maintains\namounts due from banks that exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.\nSecurities. The Company has established written guidelines and objectives for its investing activities. At the time of purchase, management\ndesignates securities as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale, or held-for-trading based on the Company’s investment objectives, operational\nneeds, and intent. Investments are monitored to ensure that those activities are consistent with the established guidelines and objectives.\nSecurities Held-to-Maturity (“HTM”). Investments in debt securities that management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity\nare reported at amortized cost. The amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method\nover the period of time remaining to an investment’s maturity.\nThe Company accounts for transfers of debt securities from the available-for-sale classification to the held-to-maturity classification at fair\nvalue on the date of transfer. Any associated unrealized gains or losses on such securities as of the date of transfer become part of the security’s\namortized cost and are subsequently amortized or accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the security using the interest method. In\naddition, the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the date of transfer are also\nsubsequently amortized or accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the security using the interest method.\nSecurities Available-for-Sale (“AFS”). Investments in debt securities that management has no immediate plan to sell, but which may be sold\nin the future, are carried at fair value. Premiums and discounts are amortized using the interest method over the remaining period to the first call date\nfor premiums or contractual maturity for discounts and, in the case of mortgage-backed securities, the estimated average life, which can fluctuate\nbased on the anticipated prepayments on the underlying collateral of the securities. Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of tax, are recorded in\naccumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Realized gains and losses on the sales of securities are determined using the specific identification\nmethod, recorded on a trade date basis based on the amortized cost basis of the specific security and are included in noninterest income as net gain\n(loss) on investment securities.\nAllowance for Credit Losses (“ACL”) on Investment Securities. The ACL on investment securities is determined for both the HTM and AFS\nclassifications of the investment portfolio in accordance with ASC 326 on a quarterly basis. The ACL for HTM investment securities is recorded at\nthe time of purchase or acquisition, representing the Company’s best estimate of current expected credit losses (“CECL”) as of the date of the\nconsolidated statements of financial condition. The ACL for HTM investment securities is determined on a collective basis, based on shared risk\ncharacteristics, and is determined at the individual security level when the Company deems a security to no longer possess risk characteristics similar\nwith others in the portfolio. For investment securities where the Company has reason to believe the credit loss exposure is remote, a zero credit loss\nassumption is applied. Such investment securities typically consist of those guaranteed by the U.S. government or other government enterprises,\nwhere there is an explicit or implicit guarantee by the U.S. government, that are highly rated by rating agencies, and historically have had no credit\nloss experience.\n112\nTable of Contents\nFor AFS investment securities, the Company performs a qualitative evaluation for securities in an unrealized loss position to determine if, for\nthose investments in an unrealized loss position, the decline in fair value is credit related or non-credit related. In determining whether a security’s\ndecline in fair value is credit related, the Company considers a number of factors including, but not limited to: (i) the extent to which the fair value of\nthe investment is less than its amortized cost; (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; (iii) downgrades in credit ratings; (iv)\npayment structure of the security, (v) the ability of the issuer of the security to make scheduled principal and interest payments, and (vi) general\nmarket conditions which reflect prospects for the economy as a whole, including interest rates and sector credit spreads. If it is determined that the\nunrealized loss, or a portion thereof, is credit related, the Company records the amount of credit loss through a charge to provision for credit losses in\ncurrent period earnings. However, the amount of credit loss recorded in current period earnings is limited to the amount of the total unrealized loss\non the security, which is measured as the amount by which the security’s fair value is below its amortized cost. If it is likely the Company will be\nrequired to sell the security in an unrealized loss position, the total amount of the loss is recognized in current period earnings. Unrealized losses\ndeemed non-credit related are recorded, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nThe Company determines the amount of expected credit losses on AFS and HTM securities through a discounted cash flow approach, using\nthe security’s effective interest rate. The Company’s discounted cash flow approach incorporates assumptions about the collectability of future cash\nflows. The amount of credit loss is measured as the amount by which the security’s amortized cost exceeds the present value of expected future cash\nflows. Credit losses on AFS securities are measured on an individual basis. The Company does not measure credit losses on an investment’s accrued\ninterest receivable, but rather promptly reverses from current period earnings the amount of accrued interest that is no longer deemed collectable.\nAccrued interest receivable for investment securities is included in accrued interest receivable balances in the consolidated statements of financial\ncondition.\nEquity Investments. Equity investments that have readily determinable fair values are carried at fair value with changes in fair value\nrecognized in current period earnings as a component of noninterest income. Equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values are\ncarried at cost, adjusted for any observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Such\ninvestments are also recorded net of any previously recognized impairment. Dividends received on equity securities are included in interest income\non investment securities and other interest earning assets in the consolidated statements of income.\nThe Company applies the equity method of accounting to investments in the equity of certain entities where it is deemed to have the ability\nto exercise significant influence over the entity, but does not control the entity, such as when its ownership interest is between 20% and 50%. Further,\nthe Company also applies the equity method of accounting to equity investments it makes in limited partnerships and limited liability companies\nwhen its ownership interest in such entities exceeds 3-5% or when the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over the entity. Such\ninvestments typically reflect equity interests in various partnerships that make investments qualifying for credit under the Community Reinvestment\nAct (“CRA”) and are recorded in other assets of the consolidated statements of financial condition. The Company records its share of the operating\nresults associated with equity method investments, based on the most recent information available from the investee, in other noninterest income in\nthe consolidated statements of income.\nFederal Home Loan Bank Stock. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) System. Members are required to own a\ncertain amount of stock based on the level of borrowings and other factors, and may invest in additional amounts. Ownership of FHLB stock is\nrestricted to member banks and is not actively traded on an exchange. FHLB stock is carried at cost and periodically evaluated for impairment based\non ultimate recovery of par value. Both cash and stock dividends are recorded as a component of interest income.\n113\nTable of Contents\nFederal Reserve Bank Stock. The Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (the “FRB”). Ownership of FRB stock is\nrestricted to member banks and is not traded on an exchange. FRB stock is carried at cost, classified as a restricted security, and periodically\nevaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value. Both cash and stock dividends are recorded as a component of interest income.\nLoans Held for Sale. Loans for which the Company does not have the intent or ability to hold for the foreseeable future are designated as\nheld for sale at their origination or when the determination is made to sell the loan. Such loans are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. Gains\nor losses are recognized upon the sale of the loans on a specific identification basis. Origination fees and costs are deferred until the time of sale and\nare included in the determination of the gain or loss on the sale of the loan.\nLoan Servicing Assets. Servicing assets are related to U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loans sold and are recognized at the time\nof sale when servicing is retained with the income statement effect recorded in net gain on sales of loans. Servicing assets are initially recorded at\nfair value based on the present value of the contractually specified servicing fee, net of estimated servicing costs, over the estimated life of the loan.\nThe Company’s servicing costs approximates the industry average servicing costs of approximately 40 basis points. The servicing assets are\nsubsequently amortized into noninterest income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying\nloans. The Company periodically evaluates servicing assets for impairment based upon the fair value of the assets as compared to their carrying\namount.\nThe Company typically sells the guaranteed portion of SBA loans and retains the unguaranteed portion (“retained interest”). A portion of the\npremium on sale of SBA loans is recognized as gain on sale of loans at the time of the sale by allocating the carrying amount between the asset sold\nand the retained interest, based on their relative fair values. The remaining portion of the premium is recorded as a discount on the retained interest\nand is amortized over the remaining life of the loan as an adjustment to yield. The retained interest, net of any discount, are included in loans held for\ninvestment—net of allowance for credit losses in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition.\nLoans Held for Investment. Loans held for investment are loans the Company has the ability and intent to hold for the foreseeable future, or\nuntil their maturity. These loans are carried at amortized cost, net of discounts and premiums on acquired and purchased loans, and net deferred loan\norigination fees and costs. Purchase discounts and premiums and net deferred loan origination fees and costs on loans are accreted or amortized in\ninterest income as an adjustment of yield, using the interest method, over the contractual life of the loans. Accretion or amortization of deferred loan\nfees and costs or discounts and premiums are discontinued for loans that are placed on nonaccrual. Any remaining discounts, premiums, deferred\nfees or costs, and prepayment fees associated with loan payoffs prior to contractual maturity are included in interest income in the period of payoff.\nLoan commitment fees received to originate or purchase a loan are deferred and, if the commitment is exercised, recognized over the life of the loan\nusing the interest method as an adjustment of yield or, if the commitment expires unexercised, recognized as income upon expiration of the\ncommitment.\nThe Company accrues interest on loans using the interest method and only if deemed collectible. Loans for which the accrual of interest has\nbeen discontinued are designated as nonaccrual loans. The accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when principal or interest is past due 90 days\nbased on the contractual terms of the loan or when, in the opinion of management, there is reasonable doubt as to the collection of principal and/or\ninterest. When loans are placed on nonaccrual status, all previously accrued and uncollected interest is promptly reversed against current period\ninterest income, and as such an ACL for accrued interest receivable is not established. Interest income generally is not recognized on nonaccrual\nloans unless the likelihood of further loss is remote. Interest payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied as a reduction to the loan principal\nbalance. Interest accruals are resumed on such loans only when they are brought current with respect to interest and principal and when, in the\njudgment of management, the loans are deemed to be fully collectible as to all principal and interest.\n114\nTable of Contents\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Loans. The Company accounts for credit losses on loans in accordance with ASC 326, which requires the\nCompany to record an estimate of expected lifetime credit losses for loans at the time of origination or acquisition. The ACL is maintained at a level\ndeemed appropriate by management to provide for expected credit losses in the portfolio as of the date of the consolidated statements of financial\ncondition. Estimating expected credit losses requires management to use relevant forward-looking information, including the use of reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. The measurement of the ACL is performed by collectively evaluating loans with similar risk characteristics. The Company\nmeasures the ACL on commercial real estate loans and commercial loans using a discounted cash flow approach, and a historical loss rate\nmethodology is used to determine the ACL on retail loans. The Company’s discounted cash flow methodology incorporates a probability of default\n(“PD”) and loss given default (“LGD”) model, whereby PDs and LGDs are forecasted using economic scenarios over a two-year period to generate\nestimates for cash flows expected to be collected over the estimated life of a loan. Beyond the two-year forecast time horizon, the Company’s ACL\nmodel reverts to historical long-term average loss rates over a period of three years. Estimates of future expected cash flows ultimately reflect\nassumptions made concerning net credit losses over the life of a loan. The use of reasonable and supportable forecasts requires significant judgment,\nsuch as selecting forecast scenarios and related scenario-weighting, as well as determining the appropriate length of the forecast horizon.\nManagement leverages economic projections from a reputable and independent third party to inform and provide its reasonable and supportable\neconomic forecasts. Other internal and external indicators of economic forecasts may also be considered by management when developing the\nforecast metrics. The duration of the forecast horizon, the period over which forecasts revert to long-term averages, the economic forecasts that\nmanagement utilizes, as well as additional internal and external indicators of economic forecasts that management considers, may change over time\ndepending on the nature and composition of our loan portfolio.\nExpectations of future cash flows are discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate. The Company has made an accounting policy election to\nadjust the effective interest rate to take into consideration the effects of estimated prepayments. The resulting ACL for term loans represents the\namount by which the loan’s amortized cost exceeds the net present value of a loan’s discounted cash flows. The ACL for credit facilities is\ndetermined by discounting estimates for cash flows not expected to be collected. The ACL is recorded through a charge to provision for credit losses\nand is reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries on loans previously charged-off. It is the Company’s policy to charge-off loan balances at the time\nthey have been deemed uncollectible.\nThe Company’s ACL model also includes adjustments for qualitative factors, where appropriate, since historical information, such as\nhistorical net losses and economic cycles, may not always provide a sufficient basis for determining future expected credit losses. Qualitative\nadjustments may be related to and include, but not limited to factors such as: (i) management’s assessment of economic forecasts used in the model\nand how those forecasts align with management’s overall evaluation of current and expected economic conditions, (ii) organization specific risks\nsuch as credit concentrations, collateral specific risks, regulatory risks, and external factors that may ultimately impact credit quality, (iii) potential\nmodel limitations such as limitations identified through backtesting, and other limitations associated with factors such as underwriting changes,\nacquisition of new portfolios and changes in portfolio segmentation, and (iv) management’s overall assessment of the adequacy of the ACL,\nincluding an assessment of model data inputs used to determine the ACL.\n115\nTable of Contents\nThe Company has a credit portfolio review process designed to detect problem loans. Problem loans are typically those of a substandard or\nworse internal credit risk grade, and may consist of loans on nonaccrual status, modified loans to troubled borrowers, loans where the likelihood of\nforeclosure on underlying collateral has increased, collateral dependent loans and other loans where concern or doubt over the ultimate collectability\nof all contractual amounts due has become elevated. Such loans, which have exhibited a deterioration in credit quality may, in the opinion of\nmanagement, be deemed to no longer possess risk characteristics similar to other loans in the loan portfolio, and as such may require individual\nevaluation to determine an appropriate ACL for the loan. When a loan is individually evaluated, the Company typically measures the expected credit\nloss for the loan based on a discounted cash flow approach, unless the loan has been deemed collateral dependent. Collateral dependent loans are\nloans where the repayment of the loan is expected to come from the operation of and/or eventual liquidation of the underlying collateral. The ACL\nfor collateral dependent loans is determined based on the estimated expected fair value of the underlying collateral, less costs to sell.\nAlthough management uses the best information available to derive estimates necessary to measure an appropriate level of the ACL, future\nadjustments to the ACL may be necessary due to economic, operating, regulatory, and other conditions that may extend beyond the Company’s\ncontrol. Additionally, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Company’s ACL and\ncredit review process and may require changes to the ACL.\nPlease also see Note 5 – Allowance for Credit Losses for additional discussion concerning the Company’s ACL methodology, including\ndiscussion concerning economic forecasts used in the determination of the ACL.\nThe Company has segmented the loan portfolio according to loans that share similar attributes and risk characteristics. Each segment\npossesses varying degrees of risk based on, among other things, the type of loan, the type of collateral, and the sensitivity of the borrower or industry\nto changes in external factors such as economic conditions. These segment groupings are: investor loans secured by real estate, business loans\nsecured by real estate, commercial loans, and retail loans. Within each segment grouping there are various classes of loans as disclosed below. The\nCompany determines the ACL for loans based on this more detailed loan segmentation and classification.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had the following segments and classes of loans:\nInvestor Loans Secured by Real Estate:\n• Commercial real estate (“CRE”) non-owner-occupied - CRE non-owner-occupied includes loans for which the Company holds real\nproperty as collateral, but where the borrower does not occupy the underlying property. The primary risks associated with these loans include\nthe borrower’s inability to pay, material decreases in the value of the real estate that is being held as collateral, significant increases in\ninterest rates, changes in market rents, and vacancy of the underlying property, any of which may make the real estate loan unprofitable to\nthe borrower. Real estate loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy.\n• Multifamily - Multifamily loans are secured by multi-unit (5 or more units) residential real properties. Payments on multifamily loans are\ndependent on the successful operation or management of the properties, and repayment of these loans may be subject to adverse conditions\nin the real estate market or the economy.\n116\nTable of Contents\n• Construction and land - We originate loans for the construction of one-to-four family and multifamily residences and CRE properties in\nour primary market area. We concentrate our efforts on single homes and small infill projects in established neighborhoods where there is not\nabundant land available for development. Construction loans are considered to have higher risks due to construction completion and timing\nrisk, and the ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes, government regulation of real property, and the availability of long-\nterm financing. Additionally, economic conditions may impact the Company’s ability to recover its investment in construction loans, as\nadverse economic conditions may negatively impact the real estate market, which could affect the borrower’s ability to complete and sell the\nproject. Additionally, the fair value of the underlying collateral may fluctuate as market conditions change. We occasionally originate land\nloans located predominantly in California for the purpose of facilitating the ultimate construction of a home or commercial building. The\nprimary risks include the borrower’s inability to pay and the inability of the Company to recover its investment due to a decline in the fair\nvalue of the underlying collateral.\nBusiness Loans Secured by Real Estate:\n• Commercial real estate owner-occupied - CRE owner-occupied includes loans for which the Company holds real property as collateral and\nwhere the underlying property is occupied by the borrower, such as with a place of business. These loans are primarily underwritten based on\nthe cash flows of the business and secondarily on the real estate. The primary risks associated with CRE owner-occupied loans include the\nborrower’s inability to pay, material decreases in the value of the real estate that is being held as collateral, and significant increases in\ninterest rates, which may make the real estate loan unprofitable to the borrower. Real estate loans may be more adversely affected by\nconditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy.\n• Franchise secured by real estate - Franchise real estate secured loans are business loans secured by real property occupied by franchised\nrestaurants, generally quick service restaurants. These loans are primarily underwritten based on the cash flows of the business and\nsecondarily on the real estate. Risks associated with these loans include material decreases in the value of real estate being held as collateral,\nand the borrower’s inability to pay as a result of increases in interest rates or decreases in cash flow from the underlying business.\n• Small Business Administration - We originate loans nationwide under the SBA’s 7(a), SBA Express, International Trade and 504(a) loan\nprograms, in conformity with SBA underwriting and documentation standards. SBA loans are similar to commercial business loans, but have\nadditional credit enhancement provided by the U.S. government. The Company originates SBA loans with the intent to sell the guaranteed\nportion into the secondary market on a quarterly basis. Certain loans classified as SBA are secured by commercial real estate property. SBA\nloans secured by hotels are included in the segment investor loans secured by real estate, and SBA loans secured by all other forms of real\nestate are included in the business loans secured by real estate segment. All other SBA loans are included in the commercial loans segment\nbelow, and are secured by business assets.\n117\nTable of Contents\nCommercial Loans:\n• Commercial and industrial (including franchise commercial loans) (“C&I”) - C&I loans are loans that are secured by business assets\nincluding inventory, receivables, and machinery and equipment. Loan types include revolving lines of credit, term loans, seasonal loans, and\nloans secured by liquid collateral such as cash deposits or marketable securities. Franchise credit facilities not secured by real estate and\nHomeowners’ Association (“HOA”) credit facilities are included in C&I loans. We also issue letters of credit on behalf of our customers.\nRisk associated with C&I loans arises primarily due to the difference between expected and actual cash flows of the borrowers. In addition,\nthe recoverability of the Company’s investment in these loans is also dependent on other factors primarily dictated by the type of collateral\nsecuring these loans, and occasionally upon other borrower assets and guarantor assets. The fair value of the collateral securing these loans\nmay fluctuate as market conditions change. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the recovery of the Company’s investment is\ndependent upon the borrower’s ability to collect amounts due from its customers.\nRetail Loans:\n• One-to-four family - Although we do not originate first lien single family loans, we have acquired them through bank acquisitions. We\noriginate home equity lines of credit loans to consumers within our market area. The primary risks of one-to-four family loans include the\nborrower’s inability to pay, material decreases in the value of the real estate that is being held as collateral, and significant increases in\ninterest rates, which may make loans unprofitable to the borrower.\n• Consumer loans - In addition to consumer loans acquired through our various bank acquisitions, we originate a limited number of consumer\nloans, generally to banking clients. Our consumer loans consist primarily of small balance personal unsecured loans and savings account\nsecured loans. Risk arises with these loans in the borrower’s inability to pay and decreases in the fair value of the underlying collateral.\nModified Loans to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty. Infrequently, the Company makes modifications to certain loans in order to\nalleviate temporary difficulties in the borrower’s financial condition and/or constraints on the borrower’s ability to repay the loan, and to minimize\npotential losses to the Company. The Company also refers to these modifications as modified loans to troubled borrowers (“MLTB”). Modifications\nmay include: changes in the amortization terms of the loan, reductions in interest rates, acceptance of interest only payments, and, in very limited\ncases, reductions to the outstanding loan balance. Such loans are typically placed on nonaccrual status when there is doubt concerning the full\nrepayment of principal and interest or the loan has been in default for a period of 90 days or more. Such loans may be returned to accrual status when\nall contractual amounts past due have been brought current, and the borrower’s performance under the modified terms of the loan agreement and the\nultimate collectability of all contractual amounts due under the modified terms is no longer in doubt. The Company typically measures the ACL on\nMLTB on an individual basis when such loans are deemed to no longer share risk characteristics that are similar with other loans in the portfolio. The\ndetermination of the ACL for these loans is based on a discounted cash flow approach for both those measured collectively and individually, unless\nthe loan is deemed collateral dependent, which requires measurement of the ACL based on the estimated expected fair value of the underlying\ncollateral, less costs to sell. GAAP requires the Company to make certain disclosures related to these loans, including certain types of modifications,\nas well as how such loans have performed since their modifications. Please see Note 4 – Loans Held for Investment for additional information\nconcerning modified loans to troubled borrowers.\n118\nTable of Contents\nAcquired Loans. The Company has loans it has previously acquired through purchase or business combinations. When loans are purchased\nor acquired an assessment is first performed to determine if such loans have experienced more than insignificant deterioration in credit quality since\ntheir origination and thus should be classified as purchased credit deteriorated (“PCD”) loans or otherwise classified as non-PCD loans. All acquired\nloans are recorded at their fair value on the date of acquisition. Any resulting discount or premium recorded on acquired loans is accreted or\namortized into interest income over the remaining life of the loans using the interest method. Additionally, upon the purchase or acquisition of non-\nPCD loans, the Company measures and records an ACL based on the Company’s methodology for determining the ACL. The ACL for non-PCD\nloans is recorded through a charge to the provision for credit losses in the period in which the loans were purchased or acquired.\nUnlike non-PCD loans, the initial ACL for PCD loans is established through an adjustment to the acquired loan balance and not through a\ncharge to the provision for credit losses. However, as with non-PCD loans, the ACL for PCD loans is determined with the use of the Company’s ACL\nmethodology. Characteristics of PCD loans may include: delinquency, downgrade in credit quality since origination, loans on nonaccrual status,\nand/or other factors the Company may become aware of through its initial analysis of acquired loans that may indicate there has been more than\ninsignificant deterioration in credit quality since a loan’s origination. Subsequent to acquisition, the ACL for both non-PCD and PCD loans is\nmeasured with the use of the Company’s ACL methodology in the same manner as all other loans.\nOff-balance Sheet Commitments. Such commitments consist of commitments to make loans and commercial letters of credit, issued to meet\ncustomer financing needs. The face amount for these items represents the exposure to loss, before considering customer collateral or ability to repay.\nSuch financial instruments are recognized in the consolidated financial statements when they are funded. The Company records an ACL for off-\nbalance sheet lending commitments using the same models and methodologies previously discussed under Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans,\nwhile incorporating assumptions for utilization. Please also see Note 5 - Allowance for Credit Losses for additional discussion concerning the ACL\nfor off-balance sheet commitments.\nOther Real Estate Owned. Real estate properties acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are recorded at fair value, less cost to sell,\nwith any excess of the loan’s amortized cost over the fair value of the property recorded as a charge against the ACL at the time of foreclosure. The\nCompany obtains an appraisal and/or market valuation on all other real estate owned upon foreclosure. After foreclosure, valuations are periodically\nperformed by management. Any subsequent declines in fair value are recorded as a charge to non-interest expense in current period earnings with a\ncorresponding write-down to the asset. All legal fees and direct costs, including foreclosure and other related costs, are expensed as incurred.\nPremises and Equipment. Premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and\namortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range\nfrom twenty years for buildings, seven years for furniture, fixtures and equipment, and three years for computer and telecommunication equipment.\nThe cost of leasehold improvements is amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the term of\nthe related leases.\nThe Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, such as premises and equipment, to ensure the carrying value\nhas not been impaired. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.\nBank Owned Life Insurance (“BOLI”). BOLI assets are life insurance policies on certain current and former officers, directors and\nemployees for which the Bank is the beneficiary under each policy. BOLI assets are recorded at their cash surrender value. Changes in the cash\nsurrender value of BOLI and the death benefits of an insured individual covered by these policies, after distribution to the insured’s beneficiaries, if\nany, are recorded as tax-exempt noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income.\n119\nTable of Contents\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill originates from business combinations where the Company has acquired other financial\ninstitutions, and is determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the\nacquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is not amortized, but tested for impairment at least\nannually or more frequently if events and circumstances lead management to believe the value of goodwill may be impaired. Impairment testing is\nperformed at the reporting unit level, which is considered the Company level, as management has identified the Company is its sole reporting unit as\nof December 31, 2023.\nManagement’s assessment of goodwill is performed in accordance with ASC 350-20, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Goodwill, which\nallows the Company to first perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill to determine if it is more likely than not the fair value of the Company is\nbelow its carrying value. However, GAAP also allows the Company, at its option, to unconditionally forego the qualitative assessment and proceed\ndirectly to a quantitative assessment. When performing a qualitative assessment of goodwill, should the results of such analysis indicate it is more\nlikely than not the fair value of the Company is below its carrying value, the Company then performs the quantitative assessment of goodwill to\ndetermine the fair value of the Company and compares the results of that assessment to the carrying value of the Company. If the fair value of the\nCompany is below its carrying value, a goodwill impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the Company’s carrying value\nexceeds its fair value. Impairment losses are recorded as a charge to noninterest expense.\nThe Company’s annual impairment test of goodwill is performed in the fourth quarter of each year. The Company elected to perform a\nquantitative assessment of goodwill for its 2023 annual impairment test, the results of which indicated the value of goodwill was not impaired. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life recorded in the Company’s consolidated statements of financial\ncondition.\nOther intangible assets include core deposit and customer relationship intangibles arising from the acquisition of other financial institutions\nand are amortized on a basis reflecting the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are expected to be consumed, or on a\nstraight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which ranges from six to eleven years. GAAP requires intangible assets other than goodwill to be\ntested for impairment when events and circumstances change, indicating that their carrying value may not be recoverable. For intangible assets other\nthan goodwill, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. A\nquantitative assessment is followed to determine the amount of impairment in the event the carrying value of such assets are deemed not recoverable.\nImpairment is measured as the amount by which their carrying value exceeds their estimated fair value. The Company tests other intangible assets\nfor impairment in the fourth quarter of each year. The Company’s impairment test of other intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2023 indicated\nthe value of such assets were not impaired.\nDerivatives as Part of Designated Accounting Hedges. The Company applies hedge accounting to certain derivative instruments used for\nrisk management purposes, primarily interest rate risk. To qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative instrument must be highly effective at reducing\nthe risk associated with the hedged exposure, and the hedging relationship must be formally documented at its inception. The Company uses\nregression analysis to assess the effectiveness of each hedging relationship, unless the hedge qualifies for other methods of assessing effectiveness\n(e.g., shortcut or critical terms match), both at inception and throughout the life of the hedge transaction.\n120\nTable of Contents\nThe Company has derivative instruments designated as part of fair value accounting hedges. These derivatives consist of pay-fixed, receive-\nfloating interest rate swaps, and were entered into to hedge changes in the fair value of fixed-rate assets for specific risks, such as interest rate risk\nresulting from changes in a benchmark interest rate. In a qualifying fair value hedge, the Company records periodic changes in the fair value of the\nderivative instrument in current period earnings. Simultaneously, periodic changes in the fair value of the hedged risk are also recorded in current\nperiod earnings. Together, these periodic changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and the fair value of the hedged risk are included in\nthe same line item of the statements of income associated with the hedged item (i.e. interest income), and largely offset each other. Interest accruals\non both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are also recorded in the same line item, which effectively converts the designated fixed-rate\nassets to floating-rate assets. The Company structures these interest rate swaps to match the critical terms of the hedged items (i.e. fixed-rate loans),\nthereby maximizing the economic and accounting effectiveness of the hedging relationships and resulting in the expectation that the hedging\nrelationship will be highly effective. If a fair value hedging relationship ceases to qualify for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued and\nfuture changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognized in current period earnings, until the derivative is settled with the\ncounterparty. In addition, all remaining basis adjustments resulting from periodic changes in the fair value of the hedged risk, previously recorded as\na component of the carrying amount of the hedged item, are amortized or accreted into interest income using the interest method over the remaining\nlife of the hedged item.\nBusiness Combinations. The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. Upon obtaining\ncontrol of the acquired entity, the Company records all identifiable assets and liabilities at their estimated fair values. Goodwill is recorded when the\nfair value of the consideration paid for an acquired entity exceeds the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired. If, following the close of an\nacquisition, additional information is obtained concerning the acquisition date fair value estimates for assets acquired and liabilities assumed, GAAP\nallows for corresponding adjustments to be made to goodwill over a one year measurement period following the date of acquisition. Costs associated\nwith business combinations are reflected as a component of noninterest expense.\nSubordinated Debentures. Long-term borrowings are carried at cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts,\nwhich are recognized in interest expense using the interest method. Debt issuance costs are included in the carrying value of associated borrowings\nand are subsequently recognized in interest expense using the interest method over the life of the borrowing.\nLeases. The Company accounts for its leases in accordance with ASC 842 - Leases, which requires the Company to record liabilities for\nfuture lease obligations as well as assets representing the right to use the underlying leased asset. Leases with a term of 12 months or less are\naccounted for using straight-line expense recognition with no right-of-use asset being recorded for such leases. Other than short-term leases, the\nCompany classifies its leases as either finance leases or operating leases. Leases are classified as finance leases when any of the following are met:\n(a) the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term, (b) the lease contains an option to purchase the\nunderlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise, (c) the term of the lease represents a major part of the remaining life of the\nunderlying asset, (d) the present value of the future lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset, or (e)\nthe underling leased asset is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term due to its specialized nature. When the\nCompany’s assessment of a lease does not meet the foregoing criteria, and the term of the lease is in excess of 12 months, the lease is classified as an\noperating lease.\n121\nTable of Contents\nLiabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets are determined based on the total future contractual rents for each lease,\ndiscounted at the rate implicit in the lease or at the Company’s estimated incremental borrowing rate if the rate is not implicit in the lease. The\nCompany measures future contractual rents based on the minimum payments specified in the lease agreement, giving consideration for periodic\ncontractual rent increases, which may be based on an escalation rate or a specified index. When future rent payments are based on an index, the\nCompany uses the index rate observed at the time of lease commencement to measure future lease payments. Liabilities to make future lease\npayments on operating leases are reduced by periodic contractual lease payments net of periodic interest accretion on the lease liability. Right-of-use\nassets for operating leases are amortized over the term of the lease by amounts that represent the difference between periodic straight-line lease\nexpense and periodic interest accretion on the related liability to make lease payments. Expense recognition for operating leases is recorded on a\nstraight-line basis and is included in premises and occupancy expense of the consolidated statements of income. Right-of-use assets are recorded in\nother assets and liabilities to make lease payments are recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities of the consolidated statements of financial\ncondition. As of December 31, 2023, all of the Company’s leases were classified as either operating leases or short-term leases.\nFrom time to time the Company leases portions of the space it leases to other parties through sublease transactions. Income received from\nthese transactions is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the sublease.\nRevenue Recognition. The Company accounts for certain of its revenue streams deemed to arise from contracts with customers in accordance\nwith ASC 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Revenue streams within the scope of and accounted for under ASC 606 include: service\ncharges and fees on deposit accounts, debit card interchange fees, custodial account fees, fees from other services the Bank provides its customers,\nand gains and losses from the sale of other real estate owned and property, premises and equipment. These revenue streams are included in\nnoninterest income in the consolidated statements of income. ASC 606 requires revenue to be recognized when the Company satisfies related\nperformance obligations by transferring to the customer a good or service. The recognition of revenue under ASC 606 requires the Company to first\nidentify the contract with the customer, identify the performance obligations, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to the\nperformance obligations, and finally recognize revenue when the performance obligations have been satisfied and the good or service has been\ntransferred. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration that Company expects to receive in exchange for the transfer of goods or services to\nthe associated customer. The majority of the Company’s contracts with customers associated with revenue streams that are within the scope of ASC\n606 are considered short-term in nature, such as a deposit account agreement, which may be cancelled at any time, or a service provided to a\ncustomer at a point in time. Other more significant revenue streams for the Company, such as interest income on loans and investment securities, are\nspecifically excluded from the scope of ASC 606 and are accounted for under other applicable GAAP.\nStock-Based Compensation. The Company issues various forms of stock-based compensation awards annually to officers and directors of the\nCompany, including stock options, restricted stock awards, and restricted stock units. The related compensation costs are based on the grant-date fair\nvalue of the awards and are recognized in the income statement over the period they are expected to vest, net of estimates for forfeitures. Estimates\nfor forfeitures are based on the Company’s historical experience for each award type. A Black-Scholes model is utilized to estimate the fair value of\nstock options on the grant date. The Black-Scholes model uses certain assumptions to determine grant-date fair value such as: expected volatility,\nexpected term of the option, expected risk-free rate of interest, and expected dividend yield on the Corporation’s common stock. The market price of\nthe Corporation’s common stock at the grant date is used for restricted stock awards in determining the grant date fair value for those awards. The\nCompany did not issue any stock option awards during 2023 or 2022.\n122\nTable of Contents\nRestricted stock awards and restricted stock units are granted to employees of the Company, and represent stock-based compensation awards\nthat when ultimately settled, result in the issuance of shares of the Corporation’s common stock to the grantee. As with other stock-based\ncompensation awards, compensation cost for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is recognized over the period in which the awards are\nexpected to vest. Certain of the Corporation’s restricted stock units contain vesting conditions which are based on pre-determined performance\ntargets. The level at which the associated performance targets are achieved can impact the ultimate settlement of the award with the grantee and thus\nthe level of compensation expense ultimately recognized. Certain of these awards contain a market-based condition whereby the vesting of the award\nis based on the Company’s performance, such as total shareholder return, relative to its peers over a specified period of time. The grant date fair\nvalue of market-based restricted stock units is determined through an independent third party which employs the use of a Monte Carlo simulation.\nThe Monte Carlo simulation estimates grant date fair value using input assumptions similar to those used in the Black-Scholes model, however, it\nalso incorporates into the grant date fair value calculation the probability that the performance targets will be achieved. The grant date fair value of\nrestricted stock units that do not contain a market-based condition for vesting is based on the price of the Corporation’s common stock on the grant\ndate.\nHolders of restricted stock awards are entitled to receive cash dividends. Holders of restricted stock units are entitled to receive dividend\nequivalents during the vesting period commensurate with dividends declared and paid on the Corporation’s common stock. As restricted stock\nawards contain rights to receive non-forfeitable dividends prior to the awards being vested, such awards are considered participating securities.\nIncome Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized\nin the Company’s financial statements or tax returns using the asset liability method. In estimating future tax consequences, all expected future\nevents other than enactments of changes in the tax law or rates are considered. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in\nincome in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are recognized for temporary differences that will result in deductible\namounts in future years and for tax carryforwards if, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be\nrealized. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, no valuation allowance was deemed necessary against the Company’s deferred tax assets.\nA tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a\ntax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that management believes is more likely than\nnot to be realized upon examination. The Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.\nEarnings per Share. Earnings per share of common stock is calculated on both a basic and diluted basis, based on the weighted average\nnumber of common and common equivalent shares outstanding. Basic earnings per share excludes potential dilution from common equivalent\nshares, such as those associated with stock-based compensation awards, and is computed by dividing net income allocated to common stockholders\nby the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could\noccur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock, such as common equivalent shares associated with stock-based compensation awards,\nwere exercised or converted into common stock that would then share in the net earnings of the Corporation. Potential dilution from common\nequivalent shares is determined using the treasury stock method, reflecting the potential settlement of stock-based compensation awards resulting in\nthe issuance of additional shares of the Corporation’s common stock. Stock-based compensation awards that would have an anti-dilutive effect have\nbeen excluded from the determination of earnings per common share.\nRestricted stock awards are deemed participating securities by the Corporation, and therefore the Corporation applies the two-class method\nwhen considering these awards in the computation of earnings per common share. Under the two-class method, distributed and undistributed net\nearnings allocable to participating securities are deducted from net income to determine net income allocable to common shareholders, which is then\nused in the numerator of both basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. Participating securities are excluded from the denominator of both\nbasic and diluted earnings per common share.\n123\nTable of Contents\nComprehensive Income. Comprehensive income is reported in addition to net income for all periods presented. Comprehensive income is a\nmore inclusive financial reporting methodology that includes disclosure of other comprehensive income (loss) that historically has not been\nrecognized in the calculation of net income. Unrealized gains and losses on the Company’s available-for-sale investment securities are required to be\nincluded in other comprehensive income or loss. Total comprehensive income and the components of accumulated other comprehensive income\n(loss) are presented in the consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity and consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nLoss Contingencies. Loss contingencies, including claims and legal action arising in the ordinary course of business, are recorded as\nliabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. Management does not believe there are\nany such matters that will have a material effect on the financial statements.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments. Fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other\nassumptions, as more fully disclosed in Note 17 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments. Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would\nbe received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and\nmatters of significant judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments, and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for\nparticular items. Fair value measures are classified according to a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which is based on the observability of inputs used to\nmeasure fair value. GAAP requires the Company to maximize the use of observable inputs when measuring fair value. When observable market\nprices or inputs are not available, the Company estimates fair value using modeling techniques such as a discounting future cash flows. Such a\ntechnique uses assumptions that market participants would consider in determining the fair value of the financial asset or liability. Changes in\nassumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect fair value estimates.\nVariable Interest Entities. A VIE is consolidated in the Company’s financial statements when it is deemed the Company is the primary\nbeneficiary of the VIE. GAAP requires analysis at the time of commencement of our involvement with a VIE, to determine the primary beneficiary\nand whether it should be consolidated in the Company’s financial statements. The Company continually performs analysis to determine the primary\nbeneficiary of a VIE. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, no VIE for which the Company has involvement with were consolidated in the Company’s\nfinancial statements.\nRecent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Effective\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU” or “Update”) 2023-\n09, Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The FASB issued this Update to enhance the transparency and decision\nusefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in this Update address investor requests for more transparency about income tax information\nthrough improvements to income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. The amendments in\nthis Update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating\nthe impact of this Update on its consolidated financial statements.\n124\nTable of Contents\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) - Improvements to Reportable Segments. The\namendments in this Update improve financial reporting by requiring disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis.\nAmendments in this Update include: a requirement that a public entity provide all annual disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss in its\ninterim period disclosures, disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”),\ndisclosure of amounts for other segment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition, clarification that if the CODM uses more\nthan one measure of a segment’s profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources, a public entity may report\none or more of those additional measures of segment profit or loss, requires that a public entity disclose the title and position of the CODM and an\nexplanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss, and requires that a public entity that has a single reportable\nsegment provide all the disclosures required by this Update as well as all existing disclosures required in Topic 280. The amendments in this Update\nare effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early\nadoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this Update on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-02, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), Accounting for Investments in\nTax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method, a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force. The amendments in this Update\nallow the option for an entity to apply the proportional amortization method of accounting to other equity investments that are made for the primary\npurpose of receiving income tax credits or other income tax benefits, if certain conditions are met. Prior to this Update, the application of the\nproportional amortization method of accounting was limited to investments in low income housing tax credit structures. The proportional\namortization method of accounting results in the amortization of applicable investments, as well as the related income tax credits or other income tax\nbenefits received, being presented on a single line in the statements of income, that is income tax expense. Under this Update, an entity has the\noption to apply the proportional amortization method of accounting to applicable investments on a tax-credit-program-by-tax-credit-program basis.\nIn addition, the amendments in this Update require that all tax equity investments accounted for using the proportional amortization method use the\ndelayed equity contribution guidance in paragraph 323-740-25-3, requiring a liability be recognized for delayed equity contributions that are\nunconditional and legally binding or for equity contributions that are contingent upon a future event when that contingent event becomes probable.\nUnder this Update, low income housing tax credit investments for which the proportional amortization method is not applied can no longer be\naccounted for using the delayed equity contribution guidance. Further, this Update specifies that tax equity investments accounted for using the\nequity method must apply the impairment guidance in Subtopic 323-10 - Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures - Overall. This Update also\nclarifies that for low income housing tax credit investments not accounted for under the proportional amortization method or the equity method, an\nentity shall account for them under Topic 321 - Investments - Equity Securities. The amendments in this Update also require additional disclosures in\ninterim and annual periods concerning investments for which the proportional amortization method is applied, including (i) the nature of tax equity\ninvestments, and (ii) the effect of tax equity investments and related income tax credits and other income tax benefits on the financial position and\nresults of operations. The provisions of this Update are effective for the Company for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023.\nEarly adoption is permitted. The Company has evaluated the provisions of this Update and does not believe they will have a material impact on the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements.\n125\nTable of Contents\nAccounting Guidance Adopted in 2023\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage\nDisclosures. The FASB issued this Update in response to feedback the FASB received from various stakeholders in its post-implementation review\nprocess related to the issuance of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial\nInstruments, which was effective for the Company on January 1, 2020. The amendments in this Update include the elimination of accounting\nguidance for troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) in Subtopic 310-40 - Receivables - Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors, and introduce\nnew disclosures and enhance existing disclosures concerning certain loan refinancings and restructurings when a borrower is experiencing financial\ndifficulty. Under the provisions of this Update, an entity must determine whether a modification results in a new loan or the continuation of an\nexisting loan. Further, the amendments in this Update require that a public business entity disclose current period gross charge-offs on financing\nreceivables within the scope of ASC 326-20, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses - Measured at Amortized Cost, by year of origination and class of\nfinancing receivable. The amendments in this Update became effective for the Company on January 1, 2023 for all interim and annual periods. The\nCompany adopted the provisions in this Update prospectively. The adoption of the provisions of this have resulted in additional disclosures\nconcerning modifications of loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, as well as disaggregated disclosure of charge-offs on loans. Please\nalso see Note 4 – Loans Held for Investment for added disclosure concerning modifications of loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, as\nwell as current period gross charge-offs on loans by year of origination and loan classification.\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-01, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) Fair Value Hedging - Portfolio Layer Method. The\namendments in this Update make targeted improvements to fair value hedge accounting and more specifically to the last-of-layer hedge accounting\nmethod. This Update expands the last-of-layer hedge accounting method to allow for multiple hedged layers to be designated for a single closed\nportfolio of prepayable financial assets, and renames this accounting method the “portfolio layer method.” The provisions of this Update also\ninclude: (i) expanding the scope of the portfolio layer method to nonprepayable financial assets, (ii) specifying that eligible hedging instruments in a\nsingle layer hedge may include spot-starting or forward-starting constant-notional or amortizing-notional swaps and that the number of hedged layers\ncorresponds with the number of hedges designated, (iii) specifies that an entity hedging multiple amounts in a closed portfolio using a single\namortizing-notional swap is executing a single-layer hedge, (iv) provides additional guidance on the accounting for and disclosure of hedge basis\nadjustments resulting from a fair value hedge under the portfolio layer method by requiring such basis adjustments be maintained at the portfolio\nlevel and not allocated to individual assets, and to disclose basis adjustments as a reconciling item in certain disclosures, such as those for loans, and\n(v) specifies that an entity is to exclude hedge basis adjustments in the determination of credit losses on the assets within the closed portfolio. The\nprovisions of this Update became effective for the Company on January 1, 2023 for all interim and annual periods. The adoption of the provisions in\nthis Update did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Please also see Note 19 – Derivative Instruments, for\ndisclosure concerning the Company’s portfolio layer method fair value hedges.\n126\nTable of Contents\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848)—Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on\nFinancial Reporting. In response to concerns about structural risks of Interbank Offered Rates (“IBORs”), and particularly, the risk of cessation of\nthe London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), regulators around the world have undertaken reference rate reform initiatives to identify alternative\nreference rates that are more observable or transaction-based and less susceptible to manipulation. The amendments in this Update provide optional\nguidance for a limited time to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting\nas well as optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference\nrate reform if certain criteria are met. The amendments in this Update apply only to contracts and hedging relationships that reference LIBOR or\nanother reference rate expected to be discontinued due to reference rate reform. The expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments do not\napply to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022. The amendments in this Update\nare elective and become effective upon issuance for all entities.\nAn entity may elect to apply the amendments in this Update to eligible hedging relationships existing as of the beginning of the interim\nperiod that includes March 12, 2020 and to new eligible hedging relationships entered into after the beginning of the interim period that includes\nMarch 12, 2020. The Company has not entered into any hedging related transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate that is expected\nto be discontinued, and as such, the amendments included in this Update have not had an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial\nstatements.\nThe use of LIBOR was discontinued after June 30, 2023. In anticipation of this, the Company previously created a cross-functional working\ngroup to manage the transition away from LIBOR. This working group was comprised of senior leadership and staff from functional areas that\ninclude: finance, treasury, lending, loan servicing, enterprise risk management, information technology, legal, and other internal stakeholders integral\nto the Bank’s transition away from LIBOR. The working group monitored developments related to transition and uncertainty surrounding reference\nrate reform and guided the Bank’s response. The working group performed regular assessments of the population of financial instruments that\nreferenced LIBOR and worked to transition such instruments away from LIBOR. The working group also worked to confirm the Bank’s loan\ndocuments that referenced LIBOR have been appropriately amended, ensuring that our internal systems were prepared for the transition, and\nmanaged the transition process with our customers. The Company has chosen to use the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as an\nalternative to LIBOR. However, the Company may also use other alternative reference rates, such as the Constant Maturity Treasury index and Prime\nrate based on the individual needs of our customers as well as the types of credit being extended.\n127\nTable of Contents\nNote 2 – Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Regulatory Matters\nThe Corporation and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Failure to\nmeet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken,\ncould have a direct material effect on the Corporation’s and the Bank’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory\nframework for prompt corrective action, the Corporation and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the\nCorporation’s and the Bank’s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The\nCorporation’s and the Bank’s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk\nweightings, and other factors.\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain capital in order to meet certain\ncapital ratios to be considered adequately capitalized or well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. As of the most\nrecent formal notification from the Federal Reserve, the Bank was categorized as “well capitalized.” There are no conditions or events since that\nnotification that management believes have changed the Bank’s categorization.\nThe Company and the Bank are required to meet risk-based capital standards under the revised capital framework of the Basel Committee on\nBanking Supervision, generally referred to as “Basel III”, administered by their respective regulatory authorities. The Basel III final capital\nframework requires all banking organizations to maintain a capital conservation buffer of 2.50% above the minimum risk-based capital requirements\nin order to avoid certain limitations on capital distributions, stock repurchases, and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The capital\nconservation buffer is exclusively comprised of Common Equity Tier capital, and it applies to each of the three risk-based capital ratios but not to the\nleverage ratio. At December 31, 2023, the Company and Bank are in compliance with the capital conservation buffer requirement and exceeded the\nminimum Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and total capital ratio, inclusive of the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer, of 7.0%, 8.5% and\n10.5%, respectively, and the Bank qualified as “well capitalized” for purposes of the federal bank regulatory prompt corrective action regulations.\nIn February 2019, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies approved a final rule modifying their regulatory capital rules and providing an\noption to phase-in over a three-year period the Day 1 adverse regulatory capital effects of the CECL accounting standard. Additionally, in March\n2020, the U.S. Federal bank regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that provides banking organizations an option to delay the estimated\nCECL impact on regulatory capital for an additional two years for a total transition period of up to five years. The cumulative difference at the end of\nthe second year of the transition period is then phased into regulatory capital at 25% per year over a three-year transition period. The final rule was\nadopted and became effective in September 2020. The Company implemented the CECL model commencing January 1, 2020 and elected to phase in\nthe full effect of CECL on regulatory capital over the five-year transition period. In the first quarter of 2022, the Company began phasing into\nregulatory capital the cumulative adjustments at the end of the second year of the transition period at 25% per year.\nFor regulatory capital purposes, the subordinated debentures of the Corporation and the Bank are included in Tier 2 capital at December 31,\n2023 and 2022. See Note 13 – Subordinated Debentures for additional information.\n128\nTable of Contents\nAs defined in applicable regulations and set forth in the table below at the dates indicated:\nMinimum Required for Capital\nAdequacy Purposes Inclusive of Minimum Required For Well\nActual Capital Conservation Buffer Capitalized Requirement\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nDecember 31, 2023\nPacific Premier Bancorp, Inc.

The Company intends and has the ability to hold the securities transferred to maturity. The transfer of these securities was\naccounted for at fair value on the transfer date. The municipal bonds had a net carrying amount of $780.7 million with a pre-tax unrealized loss of\n$50.8 million, and the mortgage-backed securities had a net carrying amount of $238.8 million with a pre-tax unrealized loss of $$16.2 million, both\nof which are accreted into interest income as yield adjustments over the remaining term of the securities. No gains or losses were recorded at the time\nof transfer.\nInvestment securities with carrying values of $2.80 billion and $195.6 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were pledged\nto other borrowings, secure public deposits, and for other purposes as required or permitted by law. The increase in the investment securities pledged\nduring 2023 was primarily due to the additional investment securities with carrying values of $1.41 billion pledged to the Federal Reserve's discount\nwindow and $1.19 billion pledged to the Federal Reserve's new Bank Term Funding Program (“BTFP”) launched in March 2023 to increase the\nCompany’s access to funding and provide liquidity.\nUnrealized Gains and Losses\nUnrealized gains and losses on AFS investment securities are recognized in stockholders’ equity as accumulated other comprehensive\nincome or loss. At December 31, 2023, the Company had a net unrealized loss on AFS investment securities of $36.0 million, or $25.8 million net of\ntax in accumulated other comprehensive loss, compared to a net unrealized loss of $303.7 million, or $217.4 million net of tax in accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss, at December 31, 2022. The decrease of net unrealized loss on AFS investment securities was primarily due to the sale of $1.26\nbillion of AFS of securities at fair value to reposition the balance sheet, resulting in a net realized pre-tax loss of $254.1 million, or $182.3 million\nnet of tax, during the fourth quarter of 2023.\nFor investment securities transferred from AFS to HTM, the net after-tax unrealized gains and losses at the date of transfer continue to be\nreported in stockholders’ equity as accumulated other comprehensive loss and are amortized over the remaining lives of the securities with an\noffsetting entry to interest income as an adjustment of yield in a manner consistent with the amortization of a premium or discount, with an offsetting\nentry to interest income for the accretion of the unrealized loss associated with the transferred securities. At December 31, 2023, the unrealized loss\non investment securities transferred from AFS to HTM was $102.9 million, or $73.9 million net of tax. At December 31, 2022, the unrealized loss on\ninvestment securities transferred from AFS to HTM was $66.9 million, or $47.9 million net of tax.\nThe table below summarizes the number, fair value, and gross unrealized holding losses of the Company’s AFS investment securities in an\nunrealized loss position for which an allowance for credit losses has not been recorded as of the dates indicated, aggregated by investment category\nand length of time in a continuous loss position.\nDecember 31, 2023\nLess than 12 months 12 months or Longer Total\nGross Gross Gross\nFair Unrealized Fair Unrealized Fair Unrealized\n(Dollars in thousands) Number Value Losses Number Value Losses Number Value Losses\nAFS investment securities:\nU.S. Treasury 4 $ 98,622 $ (24) — $ — $ — 4 $ 98,622 $ (24)\nAgency — — — 4 1,868 (73) 4 1,868 (73)\nCorporate 1 4,989 (3) 47 431,353 (35,205) 48 436,342 (35,208)\nCollateralized mortgage obligations — — — 28 152,604 (1,097) 28 152,604 (1,097)\nTotal AFS investment securities 5 $ 103,611 $ (27) 79 $ 585,825 $ (36,375) 84 $ 689,436 $ (36,402)\n131\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31, 2022\nLess than 12 months 12 months or Longer Total\nGross Gross Gross\nFair Unrealized Fair Unrealized Fair Unrealized\n(Dollars in thousands) Number Value Losses Number Value Losses Number Value Losses\nAFS investment securities:\nU.S. Treasury 5 $ 33,982 $ (237) 1 $ 13,036 $ (1,902) 6 $ 47,018 $ (2,139)\nAgency 8 79,895 (1,265) 35 351,543 (52,628) 43 431,438 (53,893)\nCorporate 35 327,984 (20,840) 21 214,565 (23,264) 56 542,549 (44,104)\nCollateralized mortgage obligations 41 522,955 (33,318) 40 241,229 (32,381) 81 764,184 (65,699)\nMortgage-backed securities 13 91,762 (6,987) 68 724,019 (130,910) 81 815,781 (137,897)\nTotal AFS investment securities 102 $ 1,056,578 $ (62,647) 165 $ 1,544,392 $ (241,085) 267 $ 2,600,970 $ (303,732)\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Investment Securities\nThe Company reviews individual securities classified as AFS to determine whether unrealized losses are deemed credit related or due to\nother factors such as changes in interest rates and general market conditions. An ACL on AFS investment securities is recorded when unrealized\nlosses have been deemed, through the Company’s qualitative assessment, to be credit related. Non-credit related unrealized losses on AFS investment\nsecurities, which may be attributed to changes in interest rates and other market-related factors, are not recorded through an ACL. Such declines are\nrecorded as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax. In the event the Company is required to sell or has the intent to sell\nan AFS security that has experienced a decline in fair value below its amortized cost, the Company writes the amortized cost of the security down to\nfair value in the current period.\nThe ACL for HTM investment securities is estimated on a collective basis, based on shared risk characteristics, and is determined at the\nindividual security level when the Company deems a security to no longer possess shared risk characteristics. Credit losses on HTM investment\nsecurities are representative of the amount needed to reduce the amortized cost basis to reflect the net amount expected to be collected.\nThe Company determines credit losses on both AFS and HTM investment securities through the use of a discounted cash flow approach\nusing the security’s effective interest rate. The ACL is measured as the amount by which an investment security’s amortized cost exceeds the net\npresent value of expected future cash flows. However, the amount of credit losses for AFS investment securities is limited to the amount of a\nsecurity’s unrealized loss. The ACL is established through a charge to provision for credit losses in current period earnings.\nFor additional information concerning allowance for credit losses on investment securities, refer to Note 1 – Description of Business and\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies, of our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had an ACL of $126,000 and $43,000, respectively, for HTM investment securities classified\nas municipal bonds. The following table presents a rollforward by major security type of the ACL on the Company's HTM debt securities as of, and\nfor the periods indicated:\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2023\nBalance, December 31, Provision for Credit Balance, December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2022 Losses 2023\nHTM Investment securities:\nMunicipal bonds $ 43 $ 83 $ 126\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2022\nBalance at December 31, Provision for Credit Balance, December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2021 Losses 2022\nHTM Investment securities:\nMunicipal bonds $ 22 $ 21 $ 43\n132\nTable of Contents\nThe Company had no ACL for AFS investment securities at December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company performed a qualitative assessment\nof the AFS investment securities as of December 31, 2023 and determined that the unrealized losses during 2023 were the result of general market\nconditions, including changes in interest rates driven by the Federal Reserve’s policy to reduce levels of inflation, and does not believe the declines\nin fair value were credit related. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has not recorded credit losses on certain AFS securities that were in an\nunrealized loss position due to the high quality of the investments, with investment grade ratings, and many of them are issued by U.S. government\nagencies. As of December 31, 2023, 61% of our AFS securities were U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agency, and U.S. government-sponsored\nenterprise securities. Additionally, the Company continues to receive contractual principal and interest payments in a timely manner. It is more likely\nthan not that the Company will not be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recoveries, and at this time the Company does not intend\nto sell these securities. There was no provision for credit losses recognized for AFS investment securities during the years ended December 31, 2023\nand 2022.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no AFS or HTM securities in nonaccrual status. All securities in the portfolio were current with\ntheir contractual principal and interest payments. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no securities purchased with deterioration in credit\nquality since their origination. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no collateral dependent AFS or HTM securities.\nRealized Gains and Losses\nThe following table presents the amortized cost of securities sold with related gross realized gains, gross realized losses, and net realized\n(losses) gains for the periods indicated:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nAmortized cost of AFS investment securities sold $ 1,822,531 $ 934,703 $ 884,231\nGross realized gains $ 986 $ 13,645 $ 23,185\nGross realized losses (254,913) (11,935) (6,279)\nNet realized gains on sales of AFS investment securities $ (253,927) $ 1,710 $ 16,906\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company sold $1.26 billion of lower-yielding AFS securities at fair value to reposition the securities\nportfolio, resulting in a net loss of $254.1 million, and redeployed a portion of the sale proceeds into higher-yielding short-term AFS U.S. Treasury\nsecurities.\n133\nTable of Contents\nContractual Maturities\nThe amortized cost and fair value of investment securities at December 31, 2023, by contractual maturity, are shown in the table below.\nDue in One Year Due after One Year Due after Five Years Due after\nor Less through Five Years through Ten Years Ten Years Total\nAmortized Fair Amortized Fair Amortized Fair Amortized Fair Amortized Fair\n(Dollars in thousands) Cost Value Cost Value Cost Value Cost Value Cost Value\nAFS investment securities:\nTreasury $ 538,899 $ 539,256 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 538,899 $ 539,256\nAgency — — — — 1,190 1,149 751 719 1,941 1,868\nCorporate 13,000 12,951 254,872 251,485 213,627 181,907 — — 481,499 446,343\nCollateralized mortgage\nobligations — — 41,266 41,112 63,988 63,288 48,447 48,204 153,701 152,604\nTotal AFS investment\nsecurities 551,899 552,207 296,138 292,597 278,805 246,344 49,198 48,923 1,176,040 1,140,071\nHTM investment\nsecurities:\nMunicipal bonds — — 26,257 24,543 37,985 33,749 1,082,002 882,284 1,146,244 940,576\nCollateralized mortgage\nobligations — — 101 101 — — 334,896 326,891 334,997 326,992\nMortgage-backed\nsecurities — — 1,913 2,001 3,482 3,593 226,762 196,075 232,157 201,669\nOther — — — — — — 16,269 16,269 16,269 16,269\nTotal HTM investment\nsecurities — — 28,271 26,645 41,467 37,342 1,659,929 1,421,519 1,729,667 1,485,506\nTotal investment\nsecurities $ 551,899 $ 552,207 $ 324,409 $ 319,242 $ 320,272 $ 283,686 $ 1,709,127 $ 1,470,442 $ 2,905,707 $ 2,625,577\nFHLB, FRB, and Other Stock\nThe Company’s equity securities primarily consist of FHLB and FRB stock, which are considered restricted securities and held as a\ncondition of membership of the FHLB and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. These equity securities without readily\ndeterminable fair values are carried at cost less impairment. At December 31, 2023, the Company had $19.4 million in FHLB stock, $75.2 million in\nFRB stock, and $4.7 million in other stock. At December 31, 2022, the Company had $27.7 million in FHLB stock, $74.8 million in FRB stock, and\n$17.4 million in other stock.\nThe Company evaluates its investments in FHLB, FRB, and other stock for impairment periodically, including their capital adequacy and\noverall financial condition. No impairment losses have been recorded through December 31, 2023.\n134\nTable of Contents\nNote 4 – Loans Held for Investment\nThe Company’s loan portfolio is segmented according to loans that share similar attributes and risk characteristics.\nInvestor loans secured by real estate include CRE non-owner-occupied, multifamily, construction, and land, as well as SBA loans secured by\nreal estate, which are loans collateralized by hotel/motel real property.\nBusiness loans secured by real estate are loans to businesses that are collateralized by real estate where the operating cash flow of the\nbusiness is the primary source of repayment. This loan portfolio includes CRE owner-occupied, franchise loans secured by real estate, and SBA\nloans secured by real estate, which are collateralized by real property other than hotel/motel real property.\nCommercial loans are loans to businesses where the operating cash flow of the business is the primary source of repayment. This loan\nportfolio includes commercial and industrial loans, franchise loans not secured by real estate, and SBA loans non-real estate secured.\nRetail loans include single family residential and consumer loans. Single family residential loans include home equity lines of credit, as well\nas second trust deeds.\n135\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents the composition of the loan portfolio as of the dates indicated:\nDecember 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022\nInvestor loans secured by real estate\nCRE non-owner-occupied $ 2,421,772 $ 2,660,321\nMultifamily 5,645,310 6,112,026\nConstruction and land 472,544 399,034\nSBA secured by real estate 36,400 42,135\nTotal investor loans secured by real estate 8,576,026 9,213,516\nBusiness loans secured by real estate\nCRE owner-occupied 2,191,334 2,432,163\nFranchise real estate secured 304,514 378,057\nSBA secured by real estate 50,741 61,368\nTotal business loans secured by real estate 2,546,589 2,871,588\nCommercial loans\nCommercial and industrial 1,790,608 2,160,948\nFranchise non-real estate secured 319,721 404,791\nSBA non-real estate secured 10,926 11,100\nTotal commercial loans 2,121,255 2,576,839\nRetail loans\nSingle family residential 72,752 72,997\nConsumer 1,949 3,284\nTotal retail loans 74,701 76,281\nLoans held for investment before basis adjustment (1) 13,318,571 14,738,224\nBasis adjustment associated with fair value hedge (2) (29,551) (61,926)\nLoans held for investment 13,289,020 14,676,298\nAllowance for credit losses for loans held for investment (192,471) (195,651)\nLoans held for investment, net $ 13,096,549 $ 14,480,647\nTotal unfunded loan commitments $ 1,703,470 $ 2,489,203\nLoans held for sale, at lower of cost or fair value $ — $ 2,643\n____________________________________________________\n(1) Includes net deferred origination fees of $74,000 and $1.9 million, and unaccreted fair value net purchase discounts of $43.3 million and $54.8 million as of December 31, 2023\nand 2022, respectively.\n(2) Represents the basis adjustment associated with the application of hedge accounting on certain loans. Refer to Note 19 – Derivative Instruments for additional information.\nThe Company originates SBA loans with the intent to sell the guaranteed portion of the loans prior to maturity and, therefore, designates\nthem as held for sale. From time to time, the Company may purchase or sell other types of loans in order to manage concentrations, maximize\ninterest income, change risk profiles, improve returns, and generate liquidity.\n136\nTable of Contents\nLoans Serviced for Others and Loan Securitization\nThe Company generally retains the servicing rights of the guaranteed portion of SBA loans sold, for which the Company initially records\nservicing assets at fair value within its other assets category. Servicing assets are subsequently measured using the amortization method and\namortized to noninterest income. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the servicing assets totaled $1.6 million and $3.0 million, respectively, and were\nincluded in other assets on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial condition. Servicing assets are evaluated for impairment based upon\nthe fair value of the servicing rights as compared to the carrying amount. Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance, to the extent the\nfair value is less than the carrying amount. The fair value of retained servicing rights is generally evaluated at the loan level using a discounted cash\nflow analysis utilizing current market assumptions derived from the secondary market. Key modeling assumptions include interest rates, prepayment\nassumptions, discount rate, and servicing cost. At December 31, 2023, and 2022, the Company determined that no valuation allowance was\nnecessary.\nIn connection with the acquisition of Opus Bank (“Opus”), the Company acquired Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie\nMac”) guaranteed structured pass-through certificates, which were issued as a result of Opus’s securitization sale of $509.0 million in originated\nmultifamily loans through a Freddie Mac-sponsored transaction in December 2016. The Company's continuing involvement includes sub-servicing\nresponsibilities, general representations and warranties, and reimbursement obligations. Servicing responsibilities on loan sales generally include\nobligations to collect and remit payments of principal and interest, provide foreclosure services, manage payments of taxes and insurance premiums,\nand otherwise administer the underlying loans. In connection with the securitization transaction, Freddie Mac was designated as the master servicer\nand appointed the Company to perform sub-servicing responsibilities, which generally include the servicing responsibilities described above with the\nexception of the servicing of foreclosed or defaulted loans. The overall management, servicing, and resolution of defaulted loans and foreclosed\nloans are separately designated to the special servicer, a third-party institution that is independent of the master servicer and the Company. The\nmaster servicer has the right to terminate the Company in its role as sub-servicer and direct such responsibilities accordingly.\nTo the extent the ultimate resolution of defaulted loans results in contractual principal and interest payments that are deficient, the Company\nis obligated to reimburse Freddie Mac for such amounts, not to exceed 10% of the original principal amount of the loans comprising the\nsecuritization pool at the closing date of December 23, 2016. The liability recorded for the Company’s exposure to the reimbursement agreement\nwith Freddie Mac was $345,000 and $334,000 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nLoans sold and serviced for others are not included in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition. The unpaid principal\nbalances of loans and participations serviced for others were $373.8 million and $463.4 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIncluded in those totals are multifamily loans transferred through securitization with Freddie Mac of $48.0 million and $54.2 million at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and SBA participations serviced for others totaling $258.1 million and $315.3 million at December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively.\n137\nTable of Contents\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company’s loan portfolio was primarily collateralized by various forms of real estate and business assets\nlocated principally in California. The Company’s loan portfolio contains concentrations of credit in multifamily, CRE non-owner-occupied, CRE\nowner-occupied, and C&I business loans. The Bank maintains policies approved by the Bank’s Board of Directors (the “Bank Board”) that address\nthese concentrations, and diversifies its loan portfolio through loan originations, purchases, and sales to meet approved concentration levels.\nUnder applicable laws and regulations, the Bank may not make secured loans to one borrower in excess of 25% of the Bank’s unimpaired\ncapital plus surplus and likewise in excess of 15% of the Bank’s unimpaired capital plus surplus for unsecured loans. These loans-to-one-borrower\nlimitations result in a dollar limitation of $834.6 million for secured loans and $500.8 million for unsecured loans at December 31, 2023. In order to\nmanage concentration risk, the Bank maintains a house lending limit well below these statutory maximums. At December 31, 2023, the Bank’s\nlargest aggregate outstanding balance of loans to one borrower was $269.4 million, primarily comprised of asset-based lines of credit.\nCredit Quality and Credit Risk Management\nThe Company’s credit quality and credit risk is managed in two distinct areas. The first is the loan origination process, wherein the Bank\nunderwrites credit and chooses which types and levels of risk it is willing to accept. The Company maintains a credit policy which addresses many\nrelated topics, sets forth maximum tolerances for key elements of loan risk, and indicates appropriate protocols for identifying and analyzing these\nrisk elements. The policy sets forth specific guidelines for analyzing each of the loan products the Company offers from both an individual and\nportfolio-wide basis. The credit policy is reviewed annually by the Bank Board. The Bank’s underwriters ensure all key risk factors are analyzed,\nwith most underwriting including a global cash flow analysis of the prospective borrowers and guarantors.\nThe second area is in the ongoing oversight of the loan portfolio, where existing credit risk is measured and monitored, and where\nperformance issues are dealt with in a timely and appropriate fashion. Credit risk is monitored and managed within the loan portfolio by the\nCompany’s portfolio managers based on both the credit policy and a credit and portfolio review policy. This latter policy requires a program of\nfinancial data collection and analysis, thorough loan reviews, property and/or business inspections, monitoring of portfolio concentrations and trends,\nand consideration of current business and economic conditions. The portfolio managers also monitor asset-based lines of credit, loan covenants, and\nother conditions associated with the Company’s business loans as a means to help identify potential credit risk. Most individual loans, excluding the\nhomogeneous loan portfolio, are reviewed at least annually, including the assignment or confirmation of a risk grade.\nRisk grades are based on a six-grade Pass scale, along with Special Mention, Substandard, Doubtful, and Loss classifications, as such\nclassifications are defined by the federal banking regulatory agencies. The assignment of risk grades allows the Company to, among other things,\nidentify the risk associated with each credit in the portfolio and to provide a basis for estimating credit losses inherent in the portfolio. Risk grades\nare reviewed regularly with the Company’s Credit and Portfolio Review Committee, and the portfolio management and risk grading process is\nreviewed on an ongoing basis by both an independent loan review function and periodic internal audits, as well as by regulatory agencies during\nscheduled examinations.\n138\nTable of Contents\nThe following provides brief definitions for risk grades assigned to loans in the portfolio:\n• Pass assets carry an acceptable level of credit quality that contains no well-defined deficiencies or weaknesses.\n• Special Mention assets do not currently expose the Bank to a sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the adverse categories, but\npossess correctable deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving management’s close attention.\n• Substandard assets are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if\nany. These assets are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.\nOther real estate owned (“OREO”) acquired through foreclosure are also classified as substandard assets.\n• Doubtful credits have all the weaknesses inherent in substandard credits, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make\ncollection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.\n• Loss assets are those that are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets is not warranted. Amounts\nclassified as loss are promptly charged off.\nThe Bank’s portfolio managers also manage loan performance risks, collections, workouts, bankruptcies, and foreclosures. A special assets\ndepartment, whose portfolio managers have professional expertise in these areas, typically handles or advises on these types of matters. Loan\nperformance risks are mitigated by our portfolio managers acting promptly and assertively to address problem credits when they are identified.\nCollection efforts commence immediately upon non-payment, and the portfolio managers seek to promptly determine the appropriate steps to\nminimize the Company’s risk of loss. When foreclosure will maximize the Company’s recovery for a non-performing loan, the portfolio managers\nwill take appropriate action to initiate the foreclosure process.\nWhen a loan is graded as special mention, substandard, or doubtful, the Company obtains an updated valuation of the underlying collateral.\nCollateral generally consists of accounts receivable, inventory, fixed assets, real estate properties, and cash. If, through the Company’s credit risk\nmanagement process, it is determined the ultimate repayment of a loan will come from the foreclosure upon and ultimate sale of the underlying\ncollateral, the loan is deemed collateral dependent and evaluated individually to determine an appropriate ACL for the loan. The ACL for such loans\nis measured as the amount by which the fair value of the underlying collateral, less estimated costs to sell, is less than the amortized cost of the loan.\nThe Company typically continues to obtain or confirm updated valuations of underlying collateral for special mention and classified loans on an\nannual or biennial basis in order to have the most current indication of fair value of the underlying collateral securing the loan. Additionally, once a\nloan is identified as collateral dependent, due to the likelihood of foreclosure, and repayment of the loan is expected to come from the eventual sale\nof the underlying collateral, an analysis of the underlying collateral is performed at least quarterly. Changes in the estimated fair value of the\ncollateral are reflected in the lifetime ACL for the loan. Balances deemed to be uncollectable are promptly charged-off. However, if a loan is not\nconsidered collateral dependent and management determines that the loan no longer possesses risk characteristics similar to other loans in the loan\nportfolio, the loan is individually evaluated, and the associated ACL is determined through the use of a discounted cash flow analysis.\n139\nTable of Contents\nThe following table stratifies the loans held for investment portfolio by the Company’s internal risk grading, and by year of origination, as\nwell as the gross charge-offs on a year-to-date basis by year of origination as of December 31, 2023:\nTerm Loans by Vintage\nRevolving\nConverted to\nTerm During\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 Prior Revolving the Period Total\nDecember 31, 2023\nInvestor loans secured by real estate\nCRE non-owner-occupied\nPass $ 71,452 $ 482,045 $ 549,828 $ 192,399 $ 315,139 $ 795,856 $ — $ — $ 2,406,719\nSpecial mention — 3,811 2,530 — — 625 — — 6,966\nSubstandard — 412 — — — 7,675 — — 8,087\nMultifamily\nPass 179,055 1,184,329 2,008,126 725,123 822,411 714,638 — — 5,633,682\nSpecial mention — — — — — 11,628 — — 11,628\nConstruction and land\nPass 59,993 309,677 94,845 2,223 2,368 3,438 — — 472,544\nSBA secured by real estate\nPass — 6,478 — 493 4,804 16,496 — — 28,271\nSubstandard — — 131 — 536 7,462 — — 8,129\nTotal investor loans secured by real\nestate 310,500 1,986,752 2,655,460 920,238 1,145,258 1,557,818 — — 8,576,026\nCurrent period gross charge-offs — — 217 — 1,582 3,653 — — 5,452\nBusiness loans secured by real estate\nCRE owner-occupied\nPass 19,014 543,413 660,967 224,333 211,283 458,975 — — 2,117,985\nSpecial mention — 16,535 — 476 4,775 11,775 919 — 34,480\nSubstandard — 15,539 2,162 5,505 3,873 11,790 — — 38,869\nFranchise real estate secured\nPass 10,580 39,239 124,424 25,697 15,731 72,342 — — 288,013\nSpecial mention 1,758 3,603 1,903 — 795 1,615 — — 9,674\nSubstandard — 3,964 — — 2,571 292 — — 6,827\nSBA secured by real estate\nPass 113 9,334 7,634 1,979 4,109 22,417 — — 45,586\nSpecial mention — 536 — — — 83 — — 619\nSubstandard — — — — — 4,536 — — 4,536\nTotal loans secured by business real\nestate 31,465 632,163 797,090 257,990 243,137 583,825 919 — 2,546,589\nCurrent period gross charge-offs — — 318 191 — 1,861 — — 2,370\nCommercial loans\nCommercial and industrial\nPass 46,765 172,987 160,275 40,988 110,526 146,310 966,733 6,518 1,651,102\nSpecial mention 239 23,242 12,270 367 16 2,139 42,570 407 81,250\nSubstandard 425 8,052 2,689 588 173 1,138 26,462 14,187 53,714\nDoubtful and loss — — — — — — — 4,542 4,542\nFranchise non-real estate secured\nPass 6,801 74,441 112,112 16,355 34,770 53,957 — 753 299,189\nSpecial mention 433 845 1,633 — 627 692 — — 4,230\nSubstandard — 1,646 322 2,324 10,451 1,559 — — 16,302\n140\nTable of Contents\nTerm Loans by Vintage\nRevolving\nConverted to\nTerm During\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 Prior Revolving the Period Total\nDecember 31, 2023\nSBA non-real estate secured\nPass 1,075 4,485 343 113 1,464 2,490 — — 9,970\nSubstandard — 527 — 141 53 235 — — 956\nTotal commercial loans 55,738 286,225 289,644 60,876 158,080 208,520 1,035,765 26,407 2,121,255\nCurrent period gross charge-offs 132 3,053 62 5 362 37 6,387 503 10,541\nRetail loans\nSingle family residential\nPass 20 — — 167 — 44,104 28,461 — 72,752\nConsumer loans\nPass — — 3 9 5 788 1,144 — 1,949\nTotal retail loans 20 — 3 176 5 44,892 29,605 — 74,701\nCurrent period gross charge-offs — — — — — 983 3 — 986\nLoans held for investment before\nbasis adjustment (1) $ 397,723 $ 2,905,140 $ 3,742,197 $ 1,239,280 $ 1,546,480 $ 2,395,055 $ 1,066,289 $ 26,407 $ 13,318,571\nTotal current period gross charge-\noffs $ 132 $ 3,053 $ 597 $ 196 $ 1,944 $ 6,534 $ 6,390 $ 503 $ 19,349\n______________________________\n(1) Excludes the basis adjustment of $29.6 million to the carrying amount of certain loans included in fair value hedging relationships.

Collective evaluation is based\non aggregating loans deemed to possess similar risk characteristics. In certain instances, the Company may identify loans that it believes no longer\npossess risk characteristics similar to other loans in the loan portfolio. These loans are typically identified from a substandard or worse internal risk\ngrade, since the specific attributes and risks associated with such loans tend to become unique as the credit deteriorates. Such loans are typically\nnonperforming, modified loans made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, and/or are deemed collateral dependent, where the ultimate\nrepayment of the loan is expected to come from the operation of or eventual sale of the collateral. Loans that are deemed by management to no\nlonger possess risk characteristics similar to other loans in the portfolio are evaluated individually for purposes of determining an appropriate\nlifetime ACL. The Company uses a discounted cash flow approach, using the loan’s effective interest rate, for determining the ACL on individually\nevaluated loans, unless the loan is deemed collateral dependent, which requires evaluation based on the estimated fair value of the underlying\ncollateral, less estimated costs to sell. The Company may increase or decrease the ACL for collateral dependent individually evaluated loans based\non changes in the estimated expected fair value of the collateral. Changes in the ACL for all other individually evaluated loans is based substantially\non the Company’s evaluation of cash flows expected to be received from such loans.\nAs of December 31, 2023, $24.8 million of loans were individually evaluated, with no ACL attributed to such loans. At December 31, 2023,\n$12.2 million of individually evaluated loans were evaluated based on the underlying value of the collateral and $12.6 million were evaluated using a\ndiscounted cash flow approach. All individually evaluated loans were on nonaccrual status at December 31, 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2022, $30.9 million of loans were individually evaluated, and the ACL attributed to such loans totaled $1.7 million. At\nDecember 31, 2022, all of the individually evaluated loans were evaluated based on the underlying value of the collateral, and none were evaluated\nusing a discounted cash flow approach. All individually evaluated loans were on nonaccrual status at December 31, 2022.\nPurchased Credit Deteriorated Loans\nThe Company analyzed acquired loans for more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since their origination. Such loans are\nclassified as purchased credit deteriorated loans. Please see Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for\nmore information concerning the accounting for PCD loans. The Company had PCD loans of $359.3 million and $422.7 million at December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAcquired loans classified as PCD are recorded at an initial amortized cost, which is comprised of the purchase price of the loans (or initial\nfair value) and the initial ACL determined for the loans, which is added to the purchase price, as well as any resulting discount or premium related to\nfactors other than credit. The Company accounts for interest income on PCD loans using the interest method, whereby any purchase discounts or\npremiums are accreted or amortized into interest income as an adjustment of the loan’s yield. Subsequent to acquisition, the ACL for PCD loans is\nmeasured in accordance with the Company’s ACL methodology. Please also see Note 5 – Allowance for Credit Losses for more information\nconcerning the Company’s ACL methodology.\nNonaccrual Loans\nWhen loans are placed on nonaccrual status, previously accrued but unpaid interest is reversed from current period earnings. Payments\nreceived on nonaccrual loans are generally applied as a reduction to the loan principal balance. If the likelihood of further loss is remote, the\nCompany may recognize interest on a cash basis. Loans may be returned to accruing status if the Company believes that all remaining principal and\ninterest is fully collectible and there has been at least three months of sustained repayment performance since the loan was placed on nonaccrual.\n144\nTable of Contents\nThe Company typically does not accrue interest on loans 90 days or more past due or when, in the opinion of management, there is\nreasonable doubt as to the collection of interest. However, when such loans are well secured and in the process of collection, the Company may\ncontinue with the accrual of interest. The Company had loans on nonaccrual status of $24.8 million and $30.9 million at December 31, 2023 and\n2022, respectively.\nThe Company did not record income from the receipt of cash payments related to nonaccruing loans during the years ended December 31,\n2023, 2022, and 2021. The Company had no loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe following tables provide a summary of nonaccrual loans as of the dates indicated:\nNonaccrual Loans (1)\nCollateral Dependent Loans Non-Collateral Dependent Loans\nTotal Nonaccrual Nonaccrual Loans\n(Dollars in thousands) Balance ACL Balance ACL Loans with No ACL\nDecember 31, 2023\nInvestor loans secured by real estate\nCRE non-owner-occupied $ 412 $ — $ — $ — $ 412 $ 412\nSBA secured by real estate 1,205 — — — 1,205 1,205\nTotal investor loans secured by real estate 1,617 — — — 1,617 1,617\nBusiness loans secured by real estate\nCRE owner-occupied 8,666 — — — 8,666 8,666\nTotal business loans secured by real estate 8,666 — — — 8,666 8,666\nCommercial loans\nCommercial and industrial 1,381 — 12,595 — 13,976 13,976\nSBA non-real estate secured 558 — — — 558 558\nTotal commercial loans 1,939 — 12,595 — 14,534 14,534\nTotal nonaccrual loans $ 12,222 $ — $ 12,595 $ — $ 24,817 $ 24,817\nDecember 31, 2022\nInvestor loans secured by real estate\nCRE non-owner-occupied $ 4,429 $ — $ — $ — $ 4,429 $ 4,429\nMultifamily 8,780 — — — 8,780 8,780\nSBA secured by real estate 533 — — — 533 533\nTotal investor loans secured by real estate 13,742 — — — 13,742 13,742\nBusiness loans secured by real estate\nCRE owner-occupied 11,475 1,742 — — 11,475 9,733\nSBA secured by real estate 1,191 — — — 1,191 1,191\nTotal business loans secured by real estate 12,666 1,742 — — 12,666 10,924\nCommercial loans\nCommercial and industrial 3,908 — — — 3,908 3,908\nSBA non-real estate secured 589 — — — 589 589\nTotal commercial loans 4,497 — — — 4,497 4,497\nTotal nonaccrual loans $ 30,905 $ 1,742 $ — $ — $ 30,905 $ 29,163\n______________________________\n(1) The ACL for nonaccrual loans is determined based on a discounted cash flow methodology unless the loan is considered collateral dependent; otherwise, the ACL for collateral dependent nonaccrual\nloans is determined based on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral.\nResidential Real Estate Loans In Process of Foreclosure\nThe Company had no consumer mortgage loans collateralized by residential real estate property for which formal foreclosure proceedings\nwere in process as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n145\nTable of Contents\nModified Loans to Troubled Borrowers\nOn January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) Troubled Debt Restructurings\nand Vintage Disclosures, which introduces new reporting requirements for modifications of loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The\nCompany also refers to these loans as modified loans to troubled borrowers. An MLTB arises from a modification made to a loan in order to alleviate\ntemporary difficulties in the borrower’s financial condition and/or constraints on the borrower’s ability to repay the loan, and to minimize potential\nlosses to the Company. GAAP requires that certain types of modifications be reported, which consist of the following: (i) principal forgiveness, (ii)\ninterest rate reduction, (iii) other-than-insignificant payment delay, (iv) term extension, or any combination of the foregoing. The ACL for an MLTB\nis measured on a collective basis, as with other loans in the loan portfolio, unless management determines that such loans no longer possess risk\ncharacteristics similar to others in the loan portfolio. In those instances, the ACL for an MLTB is determined through individual evaluation.\nDuring 2023, there were two syndicated C&I participation loan modifications to one borrower experiencing financial difficulty.\nThe following table shows the amortized cost of the MLTBs by class and type of modification, as well as the percentage of the loan modified\nto total loans in each class at and during the period indicated:\nTwelve Months Ended\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nOther-than-Insignificant Payment Delay\nPercent of Total Class of\n(Dollars in thousands) Balance Loans\nCommercial loans\nCommercial and industrial $ 12,595 0.70 %\nTotal commercial loans $ 12,595\nThe following table describes the financial effect of the loan modification made for the borrower experiencing financial difficulty during the\nyear ended December 31, 2023:\nOther-than-Insignificant Payment Delay\nCommercial loans\nCommercial and industrial 1 year of interest-only payments\nDuring 2023, there was one CRE owner-occupied MLTB of $851,000 that was modified with the term extension by four months and paid off\nat maturity.\nDuring 2023, there were no MLTBs that had a payment default and had been modified within the 12 months preceding the payment default\n(90 days or more past due).\nThe following table depicts the performance of the MLTB as of the date indicated:\nDays Past Due\n(Dollars in thousands) Current 30-59 60-89 90+ Total\nDecember 31, 2023\nCommercial loans\nCommercial and industrial $ 12,595 $ — $ — $ — $ 12,595\nTotal commercial loans $ 12,595 $ — $ — $ — $ 12,595\n146\nTable of Contents\nTroubled Debt Restructurings\nPrior to the Company’s adoption of ASU 2022-02 on January 1, 2023, the Company, in infrequent situations, would modify or restructure\nloans when the borrower was experiencing financial difficulties by making a concession to the borrower. Such concessions typically were in the form\nof changes in the amortization terms, reductions in the interest rates, the acceptance of interest-only payments, and, in very few cases, reductions to\nthe outstanding loan balances. These modifications were classified as TDRs and were made for the purpose of alleviating temporary impairments to\nthe borrower’s financial condition or cash flows. A workout plan between us and the borrower was designed to provide a bridge for borrower cash\nflow shortfalls in the near term. In most cases, the Company initially placed TDRs on nonaccrual status, and they could be returned to accrual status\nwhen the loans were brought current, performed in accordance with the restructured contractual terms for a period of at least six months, and the\nultimate collectability of the total contractual restructured principal and interest payments were no longer in doubt. ASU 2022-02 eliminated the\nconcept of TDRs in current GAAP, and therefore, beginning January 1, 2023, the Company no longer reports loans modified as TDRs except for\nthose loans modified and reported as TDRs in prior period financial information under previous GAAP.\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company had five loans totaling $16.1 million modified as TDRs consisting of three CRE owner-occupied loans\nand one C&I loan totaling $5.1 million belonging to one borrower relationship with the terms modified due to bankruptcy, and one franchise non-real\nestate secured loan of $11.0 million belonging to another borrower relationship with the terms modified for payment deferral. $5.1 million of TDRs\nwere on nonaccrual status as of December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the three CRE owner-occupied loans and one C&I\nloan classified as TDRs were in payment default after modification within the previous 12 months.\n147\nTable of Contents\nCollateral Dependent Loans\nLoans that have been classified as collateral dependent are loans where substantially all repayment of the loan is expected to come from the\noperation of or eventual liquidation of the collateral. Collateral dependent loans are evaluated individually for purposes of determining the ACL,\nwhich is determined based on the estimated fair value of the collateral. Estimates for costs to sell are included in the determination of the ACL when\nliquidation of the collateral is anticipated. In cases where the loan is well secured and the estimated value of the collateral exceeds the amortized cost\nof the loan, no ACL is recorded.

ASC 326 requires the Company to initially recognize estimates for lifetime credit losses on loans and unfunded loan commitments at the time\nof origination or acquisition. The recognition of credit losses represents the Company’s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses, given the\nfacts and circumstances associated with a particular loan or group of loans with similar risk characteristics. Determining the ACL involves the use of\nsignificant management judgement and estimates, which are subject to change based on management’s ongoing assessment of the credit quality of\nthe loan portfolio and changes in economic forecasts used in the Company’s ACL model. The Company uses a discounted cash flow model when\ndetermining estimates for the ACL for commercial real estate loans and commercial loans, which comprise the majority of the loan portfolio, and\nuses a historical loss rate model for retail loans. The Company also utilizes proxy loan data in its ACL model where the Company’s own historical\ndata is not sufficiently available.\nThe discounted cash flow model is applied on an instrument-by-instrument basis, and for loans with similar risk characteristics, to derive\nestimates for the lifetime ACL for each loan. The discounted cash flow methodology relies on several significant components essential to the\ndevelopment of estimates for future cash flows on loans and unfunded loan commitments. These components consist of: (i) the estimated PD, (ii) the\nestimated LGD, which represents the estimated severity of the loss when a loan is in default, (iii) estimates for prepayment activity on loans, and (iv)\nthe estimated exposure to the Company at default (“EAD”). The PD and LGD are heavily influenced by changes in economic forecasts employed in\nthe model over a reasonable and supportable period. The Company’s ACL methodology for unfunded loan commitments also includes assumptions\nconcerning the probability an unfunded commitment will be drawn upon by the borrower. These assumptions are based on the Company’s historical\nexperience.\nThe Company’s discounted cash flow ACL model for commercial real estate and commercial loans uses internally derived estimates for\nprepayments in determining the amount and timing of future contractual cash flows expected to be collected. The estimate of future cash flows also\nincorporates estimates for contractual amounts the Company believes may not be collected, which are based on assumptions for PD, LGD, and EAD.\nEAD is the estimated outstanding balance of the loan at the time of default. It is determined by the contractual payment schedule and expected\npayment profile of the loan, incorporating estimates for expected prepayments and future draws on revolving credit facilities. The Company\ndiscounts cash flows using the effective interest rate on the loan. The effective interest rate represents the contractual rate on the loan; adjusted for\nany purchase premiums or discounts, and deferred fees and costs associated with an originated loan. The Company has made an accounting policy\nelection to adjust the effective interest rate to take into consideration the effects of estimated prepayments. The ACL for loans is determined by\nmeasuring the amount by which a loan’s amortized cost exceeds its discounted cash flows expected to be collected. The ACL for credit facilities is\ndetermined by discounting estimates for cash flows not expected to be collected.\nProbability of Default\nThe PD for investor loans secured by real estate is based largely on a model provided by a third party, using proxy loan information. The\nPDs generated by this model are reflective of current and expected economic conditions in the commercial real estate market, and how they are\nexpected to impact loan level and property level attributes, and ultimately the likelihood of a default event occurring. This model incorporates\nassumptions for PD at a loan’s maturity. Significant loan and property level attributes include: loan-to-value ratios, debt service coverage, loan size,\nloan vintage, and property types.\n149\nTable of Contents\nThe PD for business loans secured by real estate and commercial loans is based on an internally developed PD rating scale that assigns PDs\nbased on the Company’s internal credit risk grades for loans. This internally developed PD rating scale is based on a combination of the Company’s\nown historical data and observed historical data from the Company’s peers, which consist of banks that management believes align with our business\nprofile. As credit risk grades change for these loans, the PD assigned to them also changes. As with investor loans secured by real estate, the PD for\nbusiness loans secured by real estate and commercial loans is also impacted by current and expected economic conditions.\nThe Company considers loans to be in default when they are 90 days or more past due and still accruing or placed on nonaccrual status.\nLoss Given Default\nLGDs for commercial real estate loans are derived from a third party, using proxy loan information, and are based on loan and property level\ncharacteristics for loans in the Company’s loan portfolio, such as: loan-to-value ratios (“LTV”), estimated time to resolution, property size, and\ncurrent and estimated future market price changes for underlying collateral. The LGD is highly dependent upon LTV ratios, and incorporates\nestimates for the expense associated with managing the loan through to resolution. LGDs also incorporate an estimate for the loss severity associated\nwith loans where the borrower fails to meet their debt obligation at maturity, such as through a balloon payment or the refinancing of the loan\nthrough another lender. External factors that have an impact on LGDs include: changes in the index for CRE pricing, GDP growth rate,\nunemployment rates, and the Consumer Price Index. LGDs are applied to each loan in the commercial real estate portfolio, and in conjunction with\nthe PD, produce estimates for net cash flows not expected to be collected over the estimated term of the loan.\nLGDs for commercial loans are also derived from a third party that has a considerable database of credit related information specific to the\nfinancial services industry and the type of loans within this segment, and is used to generate annual default information for commercial loans. These\nproxy LGDs are dependent upon data inputs such as: credit quality, borrower industry, region, borrower size, and debt seniority. LGDs are then\napplied to each loan in the commercial segment, and in conjunction with the PD, produce estimates for net cash flows not expected to be collected\nover the estimated term of the loan.\nHistorical Loss Rates for Retail Loans\nThe historical loss rate model for retail loans is derived from a third party that has a considerable database of credit related information for\nretail loans. Key loan level attributes and economic drivers in determining the loss rate for retail loans include FICO scores, vintage, as well as\ngeography, unemployment rates, and changes in consumer real estate prices.\n150\nTable of Contents\nEconomic Forecasts\nIn order to develop reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions, the Company estimates how those forecasts are expected to\nimpact a borrower’s ability to satisfy their obligation to the Bank and the ultimate collectability of future cash flows over the life of a loan. The\nCompany uses macroeconomic scenarios from an independent third party. These scenarios are based on past events, current conditions, and the\nlikelihood of future events occurring. These scenarios typically are comprised of: a base-case scenario, an upside scenario, representing slightly\nbetter economic conditions than currently experienced and, a downside scenario, representing recessionary conditions. Management periodically\nevaluates appropriateness of economic scenarios and may decide that a particular economic scenario or a combination of probability-weighted\neconomic scenarios should be used in the Company’s ACL model. The economic scenarios chosen for the model, the extent to which more than one\nscenario is used, and the weights that are assigned to them, are based on the likelihood that the economy would perform better than each scenario,\nwhich is based in part on analysis performed by an independent third party. Economic scenarios chosen, as well as the assumptions within those\nscenarios, and whether to use a probability-weighted multiple scenario approach, can vary from one period to the next based on changes in current\nand expected economic conditions, and due to the occurrence of specific events. The Company’s ACL model at December 31, 2023 includes\nassumptions concerning the interest rate environment, general uncertainty concerning future economic conditions, and the potential for recessionary\nconditions.\nThe Company currently forecasts PDs and LGDs based on economic scenarios over a two-year period, which we believe is a reasonable and\nsupportable period. Beyond this point, PDs and LGDs revert to their long-term averages. The Company has reflected this reversion over a period of\nthree years in each of its economic scenarios used to generate the overall probability-weighted forecast. Changes in economic forecasts impact the\nPD, LGD, and EAD for each loan, and therefore influence the amount of future cash flows the Company does not expect to collect for each loan.\nIt is important to note that the Company’s ACL model relies on multiple economic variables, which are used in several economic scenarios.\nAlthough no one economic variable can fully demonstrate the sensitivity of the ACL calculation to changes in the economic variables used in the\nmodel, the Company has identified certain economic variables that have significant influence in the Company’s model for determining the ACL.\nThese key economic variables include changes in the U.S. unemployment rate, U.S. real GDP growth, CRE prices, and interest rates.\nQualitative Adjustments\nThe Company recognizes that historical information used as the basis for determining future expected credit losses may not always, by itself,\nprovide a sufficient basis for determining future expected credit losses. The Company, therefore, considers the need for qualitative adjustments to the\nACL on a quarterly basis. Qualitative adjustments may be related to and include, but not be limited to, factors such as: (i) management’s assessment\nof economic forecasts used in the model and how those forecasts align with management’s overall evaluation of current and expected economic\nconditions, (ii) organization specific risks such as credit concentrations, collateral specific risks, regulatory risks, and external factors that may\nultimately impact credit quality, (iii) potential model limitations such as limitations identified through back-testing, and other limitations associated\nwith factors such as underwriting changes, acquisition of new portfolios, and changes in portfolio segmentation, and (iv) management’s overall\nassessment of the adequacy of the ACL, including an assessment of model data inputs used to determine the ACL.\n151\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2023, qualitative adjustments primarily relate to certain segments of the loan portfolio deemed by management to be of\na higher-risk profile or other factors where management believes the quantitative component of the Company’s ACL model may not be fully\nreflective of levels deemed adequate in the judgement of management. Certain qualitative adjustments also relate to heightened uncertainty as to\nfuture macroeconomic conditions and the related impact on certain loan segments. Management reviews the need for an appropriate level of\nqualitative adjustments on a quarterly basis, and as such, the amount and allocation of qualitative adjustments may change in future periods.\nThe following tables provide the allocation of the ACL for loans held for investment as well as the activity in the ACL attributed to various\nsegments in the loan portfolio as of, and for the periods indicated:\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2023\nBeginning ACL Provision for Ending\n(Dollars in thousands) Balance Charge-offs Recoveries Credit Losses ACL Balance\nInvestor loans secured by real estate\nCRE non-owner-occupied $ 33,692 $ (3,472) $ 159 $ 651 $ 31,030\nMultifamily 56,334 (1,872) 1 1,849 56,312\nConstruction and land 7,114 — — 2,200 9,314\nSBA secured by real estate 2,592 (108) — (302) 2,182\nBusiness loans secured by real estate\nCRE owner-occupied 32,340 (2,370) 40 (1,223) 28,787\nFranchise real estate secured 7,019 — — 480 7,499\nSBA secured by real estate 4,348 — 248 (169) 4,427\nCommercial loans\nCommercial and industrial 35,169 (10,474) 1,041 10,956 36,692\nFranchise non-real estate secured 16,029 — 150 (1,048) 15,131\nSBA non-real estate secured 441 (67) 71 13 458\nRetail loans\nSingle family residential 352 (90) 1 242 505\nConsumer loans 221 (896) 35 774 134\nTotals $ 195,651 $ (19,349) $ 1,746 $ 14,423 $ 192,471\n152\nTable of Contents\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2022\nBeginning ACL Provision for Ending\n(Dollars in thousands) Balance Charge-offs Recoveries Credit Losses ACL Balance\nInvestor loans secured by real estate\nCRE non-owner-occupied $ 37,380 $ (4,760) $ — $ 1,072 $ 33,692\nMultifamily 55,209 — — 1,125 56,334\nConstruction and land 5,211 — — 1,903 7,114\nSBA secured by real estate 3,201 (70) — (539) 2,592\nBusiness loans secured by real estate\nCRE owner-occupied 29,575 — 56 2,709 32,340\nFranchise real estate secured 7,985 — — (966) 7,019\nSBA secured by real estate 4,866 — — (518) 4,348\nCommercial loans\nCommercial and industrial 38,136 (8,387) 2,904 2,516 35,169\nFranchise non-real estate secured 15,084 (448) — 1,393 16,029\nSBA non-real estate secured 565 (50) 51 (125) 441\nRetail loans\nSingle family residential 255 — 148 (51) 352\nConsumer loans 285 (4) — (60) 221\nTotals $ 197,752 $ (13,719) $ 3,159 $ 8,459 $ 195,651\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2021\nBeginning ACL Provision for Ending\n(Dollars in thousands) Balance Charge-offs Recoveries Credit Losses ACL Balance\nInvestor loans secured by real estate\nCRE non-owner-occupied $ 49,176 $ (154) $ 78 $ (11,720) $ 37,380\nMultifamily 62,534 — — (7,325) 55,209\nConstruction and land 12,435 — — (7,224) 5,211\nSBA secured by real estate 5,159 (424) 3 (1,537) 3,201\nBusiness loans secured by real estate\nCRE owner-occupied 50,517 — 56 (20,998) 29,575\nFranchise real estate secured 11,451 — — (3,466) 7,985\nSBA secured by real estate 6,567 (98) 130 (1,733) 4,866\nCommercial loans\nCommercial and industrial 46,964 (5,384) 4,720 (8,164) 38,136\nFranchise non-real estate secured 20,525 (2,554) 405 (3,292) 15,084\nSBA non-real estate secured 995 — 21 (451) 565\nRetail loans\nSingle family residential 1,204 — 3 (952) 255\nConsumer loans 491 (2) 3 (207) 285\nTotals $ 268,018 $ (8,616) $ 5,419 $ (67,069) $ 197,752\n153\nTable of Contents\nThe decrease in the ACL for loans held for investment during 2023 of $3.2 million was reflective of $17.6 million in net charge-offs,\npartially offset by $14.4 million in provision for credit losses. The provision for credit losses in 2023 was largely impacted by changes in economic\nforecasts, slightly higher loss rates, and changes in qualitative adjustments, partially offset by lower loans held for investment. Charge-offs during\n2023 were largely attributed to two C&I lending relationships, two CRE non-owner-occupied lending relationships, one CRE owner-occupied\nlending relationship, and one multifamily lending relationship.\nThe decrease in the ACL for loans held for investment during 2022 of $2.1 million was reflective of $10.6 million in net charge-offs,\npartially offset by $8.5 million in provision for credit losses. The provision for credit losses in 2022 was largely impacted by changes to the overall\nsize, composition, and asset quality trends of the loan portfolio. Charge-offs during 2022 were largely attributed to one C&I lending relationship and\ntwo CRE non-owner-occupied lending relationships.\nAllowance for Credit Losses for Off-Balance Sheet Commitments\nThe Company maintains an ACL for off-balance sheet commitments related to unfunded loans and lines of credit, which is included in other\nliabilities of the consolidated statements of financial position. The allowance for off-balance sheet commitments was $19.3 million and $23.6 million\nat December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decline in the allowance for off-balance sheet commitments in 2023 is attributed to a provision\nrecapture for off-balance sheet commitments of $4.4 million, which was primarily related to a decrease in the balance of unfunded commitments,\nchanges in the mix of unfunded commitments between various loan segments, as well as qualitative adjustments during 2023.\nThe ACL for off-balance sheet commitments was $23.6 million and $27.3 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decline\nin the allowance for off-balance sheet commitments in 2022 was attributed to a provision recapture of $3.6 million, which was related primarily to\nchanges in the mix of unfunded commitments between various loan segments, as well as qualitative adjustments during 2022.\nThe following table summarizes the activities in the ACL for off-balance sheet commitments for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nBeginning ACL balance $ 23,641 $ 27,290 $ 31,118\nProvision for credit losses on off-balance sheet commitments (4,377) (3,649) (3,828)\nEnding ACL balance $ 19,264 $ 23,641 $ 27,290\n154\nTable of Contents\nNote 6 – Premises and Equipment\nThe Company’s premises and equipment consisted of the following at December 31:\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022\nLand $ 16,090 $ 16,090\nPremises 19,756 19,785\nLeasehold improvements 43,054 41,594\nFurniture, fixtures, and equipment 53,100 51,103\nAutomobiles 143 143\nSoftware 1,669 1,587\nTotal 133,812 130,302\nLess: accumulated depreciation 77,136 65,759\nPremises and equipment, net $ 56,676 $ 64,543\nDepreciation expense for premises and equipment was $13.8 million for 2023, $14.8 million for 2022, and $16.0 million for 2021.\nNote 7 – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nThe Company had goodwill of $901.3 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company did not record any adjustments to goodwill in\n2023 and 2022.\nThe Company’s policy is to assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of each year, and more frequently if\nevents or circumstances lead management to believe the value of goodwill may be impaired. Due to the market volatility experienced in the banking\nsector during 2023, the Company made an unconditional election to bypass a qualitative assessment of goodwill and proceed directly to a\nquantitative assessment of goodwill in accordance with the guidance in ASC 350-20, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Goodwill during the fourth\nquarter of 2023. The quantitative assessment was performed with the assistance of an independent third party, and the results of this assessment\nindicated goodwill were not impaired as of December 31, 2023.\nOther intangible assets with definite lives were $43.3 million at December 31, 2023, consisting of $41.2 million in core deposit intangibles\nand $2.1 million in customer relationship intangibles. At December 31, 2022, the Company had other intangible assets of $55.6 million, consisting of\n$53.2 million in core deposit intangibles and $2.4 million in customer relationship intangibles. The following table summarizes the changes in the\nbalances of core deposit and customer relationship intangible assets, and the related accumulated amortization for the years ended December 31:\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nGross balance of intangible assets:\nBalance, beginning of year $ 145,212 $ 145,212 $ 145,212\nAdditions due to acquisitions — — —\nBalance, end of year 145,212 145,212 145,212\nAccumulated amortization:\nBalance, beginning of year (89,624) (75,641) (59,705)\nAmortization (12,303) (13,983) (15,936)\nBalance, end of year (101,927) (89,624) (75,641)\nNet intangible assets, end of year $ 43,285 $ 55,588 $ 69,571\n155\nTable of Contents\nThe Company amortizes core deposit intangibles and customer relationship intangibles based on the projected useful lives of the related\ndeposits in the case of core deposit intangibles, and over the projected useful lives of the related client relationships in the case of customer\nrelationship intangibles. The amortization periods typically range from six to eleven years. The estimated aggregate amortization expense related to\nour core deposit and customer relationship intangible assets for each of the next five years succeeding December 31, 2023, in order from the present,\nis $11.1 million, $10.0 million, $8.9 million, $7.2 million, and $4.0 million. The Company’s core deposit and customer relationship intangibles are\nevaluated annually for impairment or more frequently if events and circumstances lead management to believe their value may not be recoverable.\nFactors that may ultimately attribute to impairment include customer attrition and run-off. The Company believes core deposit relationships in the\ncurrent interest rate environment continue to provide a significant benefit to the Company relative to other sources of alternative funding, and thus\ndoes not believe the value of core deposit intangible assets are impaired at December 31, 2023. In addition, the Company is unaware of any events\nand/or circumstances that would indicate the values of customer relationship intangible assets are impaired as of December 31, 2023.\nNote 8 – Bank Owned Life Insurance\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had investments in BOLI of $471.2 million and $460.0 million, respectively. The Company\nrecorded noninterest income associated with the BOLI policies of $14.1 million, $13.2 million, and $11.3 million for the years ending December 31,\n2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nBOLI involves the purchasing of life insurance by the Company on a select group of employees where the Company is the owner and\nbeneficiary of the policies. BOLI is recorded as an asset at its cash surrender value. Increases in the cash surrender value of these policies, as well as\na portion of the insurance proceeds received, are recorded in noninterest income and are not subject to income tax, as long as they are held for the\nlife of the covered parties.\nNote 9 – Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Partnerships\nThe Company invests in certain affordable housing projects in the form of ownership interests in limited partnerships or limited liability\ncompanies that qualify for CRA credit and generate low-income housing tax credits (“LIHTC”) and other tax benefits for the Company.\nThe Company records its investments in qualified affordable housing partnerships using either the proportional amortization method, if\ncertain criteria are met, or the cost method. Under the proportional amortization method, the Company amortizes the initial cost of the investment in\nproportion to the tax credits and other tax benefits that are allocated to the Company over the period of the investment. The net benefits of these\ninvestments, which are comprised of tax credits and operating loss tax benefits, net of investment amortization, are recognized in the income\nstatement as a component of income tax expense. At December 31, 2023 and 2022 the carrying value of these investments was $88.8 million and\n$71.9 million, respectively. For certain of the Company’s investments in qualified affordable housing partnerships that do not qualify for the\napplication of the proportional amortization method, the Company applies the cost method. Under the cost method, the Company amortizes the\ninitial cost of the investment as noninterest expense equally over the expected time period in which tax credits and other tax benefits will be\nreceived. Tax credits and other tax benefits on these investments are recognized as a component of income tax expense. At December 31, 2023 and\n2022 the carrying value of these investments was $250,000 and $1.0 million, respectively.\nThe Company’s net investment in qualified affordable housing projects that generate LIHTC and other tax benefits at December 31, 2023\nand 2022 was $89.1 million and $72.9 million, respectively, and is recorded in other assets in the consolidated statements of financial condition. The\ntotal unfunded commitments related to the investments in qualified affordable housing partnerships totaled $32.1 million and $15.4 million at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and were recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities.\n156\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company’s unfunded affordable housing partnerships commitments were estimated to be paid as follows:\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount\nYear Ending December 31,\n2024 $ 11,065\n2025 11,840\n2026 3,892\n2027 2,458\n2028 439\nThereafter 2,376\nTotal unfunded commitments $ 32,070\nThe following table presents tax credits and other tax benefits generated by operating losses from qualified affordable housing projects as\nwell as amortization expense associated with these investments for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nTax credit and other tax benefits recognized $ 17,016 $ 15,091 $ 15,037\nAmortization of investments $ 13,839 $ 13,070 $ 13,660\nThere were no impairment losses related to LIHTC investments for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.\nNote 10 – Variable Interest Entities\nThe Company is involved with VIEs through its loan securitization activities and affordable housing investments that qualify for the low-\nincome housing tax credit,. The Company has determined that its interests in these entities meet the definition of variable interests.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company determined it was not the primary beneficiary of the VIEs and did not\nconsolidate its interests in VIEs. The following table provides a summary of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the Company’s\nconsolidated statements of financial condition and maximum exposure to loss as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 that relate to\nvariable interests in non-consolidated VIEs.\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\n(Dollars in thousands) Maximum Loss Assets Liabilities Maximum Loss Assets Liabilities\nMultifamily loan securitization:\nInvestment securities (1) $ 48,204 $ 48,204 $ — $ 56,784 $ 56,784 $ —\nReimbursement obligation (2) 47,994 — 345 50,901 — 334\nAffordable housing partnership:\nOther investments (3) 57,016 89,085 — 60,531 75,959 —\nUnfunded equity commitments (2) — — 32,070 — — 15,428\nTotal $ 153,214 $ 137,289 $ 32,415 $ 168,216 $ 132,743 $ 15,762\n______________________________\n(1) Included in AFS investment securities on the consolidated statements of financial condition.\n(2) Included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition.\n(3) Included in other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition.\n157\nTable of Contents\nMultifamily loan securitization\nWith respect to the securitization transaction with Freddie Mac discussed in Note 4 – Loans Held for Investment, the Company’s variable\ninterests reside with the underlying Freddie Mac-issued guaranteed, structured pass-through certificates that were held as AFS investment securities\nat fair value as of December 31, 2023. Additionally, the Company has variable interests through a reimbursement agreement executed by Freddie\nMac that obligates the Company to reimburse Freddie Mac for any defaulted contractual principal and interest payments identified after the ultimate\nresolution of the defaulted loans. Such reimbursement obligations are not to exceed 10% of the original principal amount of the loans comprising the\nsecuritization pool.\nAs part of the securitization transaction, the Company released all servicing obligations and rights to Freddie Mac who was designated as the\nMaster Servicer. In its capacity as Master Servicer, Freddie Mac can terminate the Company’s role as sub-servicer and direct such responsibilities\naccordingly. In evaluating our variable interests and continuing involvement in the VIE, we determined that we do not have the power to make\nsignificant decisions or direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE’s assets and liabilities. As sub-\nservicer of the loans, the Company does not have the authority to make significant decisions that influence the value of the VIE’s net assets and,\ntherefore, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the VIE. As a result, we determined that the VIE associated with the multifamily\nsecuritization should not be included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.\nWe believe that our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with the VIE associated with the securitization is the carrying\nvalue of the investment securities issued by Freddie Mac and purchased by the Company. Additionally, our maximum exposure to loss under the\nreimbursement agreement executed with Freddie Mac is 10% of the original principal amount of the loans comprising the securitization pool, or\n$50.9 million. During 2023, as the total outstanding principal amount of the underlying loans decreased below the aforementioned reimbursement\nthreshold, the maximum exposure was the total outstanding principal amount of the underlying loans of $48.0 million at December 31, 2023. Based\nupon our analysis of quantitative and qualitative data over the underlying loans included in the securitization pool, as of December 31, 2023 and\n2022, our reserve for estimated losses with respect to the reimbursement obligation was $345,000 and $334,000, respectively.\nInvestments in qualified affordable housing partnerships\nThe Company has variable interests through its affordable housing partnership investments. These investments are fundamentally designed\nto provide a return through the generation of income tax credits. The Company has evaluated its involvement with the low-income housing projects\nand determined it does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over or participate in the decision-making activities related to the\nmanagement of the projects, and therefore, is not the primary beneficiary, and does not consolidate these interests.\nThe Company’s maximum exposure to loss, exclusive of any potential realization of tax credits, is equal to the commitments invested,\nadjusted for amortization. The amount of unfunded commitments associated with the affordable housing partnership investments is recorded as a\ncorresponding liability. The table above summarizes the amount of tax credit investments held as assets, the amount of unfunded commitments held\nas liabilities, and the maximum exposure to loss as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n158\nTable of Contents\nNote 11 – Deposit Accounts\nDeposit accounts and the end-of-period weighted average interest rates paid consisted of the following at December 31:\n2023 2022\nWeighted Weighted\n% of Total Average % of Total Average\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount Deposits Interest Rate Amount Deposits Interest Rate\nNoninterest-bearing checking $ 4,932,817 32.9 % — % $ 6,306,825 36.4 % — %\nInterest-bearing checking 2,899,621 19.3 % 1.38 % 3,119,850 18.0 % 0.63 %\nMoney market 4,572,693 30.5 % 2.00 % 4,946,019 28.5 % 0.85 %\nSavings 295,749 2.0 % 0.29 % 476,588 2.7 % 0.49 %\nTotal transaction accounts 12,700,880 84.7 % 1.04 % 14,849,282 85.6 % 0.43 %\nTime deposit accounts\n$250,000 or less 853,013 5.7 % 4.04 % 525,299 3.0 % 1.35 %\nGreater than $250,000 1,441,733 9.6 % 4.56 % 1,977,820 11.4 % 3.37 %\nTotal time deposit accounts 2,294,746 15.3 % 4.37 % 2,503,119 14.4 % 2.95 %\nTotal deposits $ 14,995,626 100.0 % 1.55 % $ 17,352,401 100.0 % 0.79 %\nThe aggregate annual maturities of certificates of deposit accounts at December 31, 2023 are as follows:\n2023\nWeighted Average\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount Interest Rate\nWithin 3 months $ 885,862 4.35 %\n4 to 6 months 788,137 4.55 %\n7 to 12 months 509,187 4.19 %\n13 to 24 months 104,887 4.28 %\n25 to 36 months 3,105 0.39 %\n37 to 60 months 3,568 0.23 %\nOver 60 months — — %\nTotal $ 2,294,746 4.37 %\nInterest expense on deposit accounts for the years ended December 31 is summarized as follows:\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nChecking accounts $ 36,520 $ 6,351 $ 1,270\nMoney market accounts 69,917 12,735 6,824\nSavings 915 391 251\nCertificates of deposit accounts 110,095 20,616 3,472\nTotal $ 217,447 $ 40,093 $ 11,817\nAccrued interest on deposits, which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities, was $16.3 million at December 31, 2023 and $12.2\nmillion at December 31, 2022.\n159\nTable of Contents\nNote 12 – Federal Home Loan Bank Advances and Other Borrowings\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company has a line of credit with the FHLB that provides for advances totaling up to 30% of the Company’s\nassets, equating to a credit line of $6.08 billion, of which $4.40 billion was remaining available for borrowing based on collateral pledged by\nqualifying real estate loans with an aggregate carrying value of $7.41 billion.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had $600.0 million in term FHLB advances, compared to $1.00 billion in term advances at\nDecember 31, 2022. The term advances have a weighted average interest rate of 3.17% and 3.19% as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Bank had unsecured lines of credit with seven correspondent banks for a total amount of $390.0 million and\naccess through the Federal Reserve Bank’s discount window to borrow $2.93 billion secured by investment securities and a $953.5 million line with\nthe FRB’s Bank Term Funding Program. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no outstanding balances against these lines.\nThe Company maintains additional sources of liquidity at the Corporation level. The Corporation maintains a line of credit with U.S. Bank\nwith availability of $25.0 million that will expire on September 25, 2024. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Corporation had no outstanding\nbalances against this line.\nNote 13 – Subordinated Debentures\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had three subordinated notes with an aggregate carrying value of $331.8 million and a weighted\ninterest rate of 5.31%, compared to $331.2 million with a weighted interest rate of 5.32% at December 31, 2022. The increase of $638,000 was\nprimarily due to amortization of debt issuance costs.\nIn August 2014, the Corporation issued $60.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.75% Subordinated Notes Due 2024 (the “Notes I”)\nin a private placement transaction to institutional accredited investors. The Notes I bear interest at an annual fixed rate of 5.75%, with the first\ninterest payment on the Notes I made on March 3, 2015, and interest payable semiannually each March 3 and September 3 through September 3,\n2024. At December 31, 2023, the carrying value of the Notes I was $59.9 million, net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $90,000. The Notes I can\nonly be redeemed, in whole or in part, prior to the maturity date if the notes do not constitute Tier 2 Capital (for purposes of capital adequacy\nguidelines of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve). Principal and interest are due upon early redemption. As of December 31, 2023, the\nNotes I did not qualify as Tier 2 Capital as the remaining maturity is less than one year pursuant to regulatory capital rule.\nIn May 2019, the Corporation issued $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.875% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes\ndue May 15, 2029 (the “Notes II”), at a public offering price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes II.

Principal and interest are due upon early redemption at any time, including prior to May\n15, 2024 at our option, in whole but not in part, under the occurrence of special events defined within the trust indenture. At December 31, 2023, the\nNotes II qualify as Tier 2 Capital.

Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when,\nin the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the\nrealization of deferred tax assets, management evaluates both positive and negative evidence, including the existence of any cumulative losses in the\ncurrent year and the prior two years, the forecasts of future income, applicable tax planning strategies, and assessments of current and future\neconomic and business conditions. This analysis is updated quarterly and adjusted as necessary. Based on the analysis, the Company has determined\nthat a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was not required as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $35.9 million and $4.8\nmillion, respectively. The federal and state net operating losses of $20.9 million and $4.8 million will begin to expire in 2026 and 2029, respectively,\nunless previously utilized. Approximately $15.0 million of the federal net operating losses can be carried forward indefinitely. In addition, the\nCompany has a tax credit carryforward of $156,000, which is scheduled to expire by 2040.\nUnder Section 382 of the Code, annual use of our net operating losses and tax credits may be limited if a cumulative change in ownership of\nmore than 50% occurs within a three-year period. Except for the $15.0 million federal net operating losses, the Company’s federal and state net\noperating losses and tax credits are subject to the limitation under Section 382. The Company is expected to fully utilize the federal and state net\noperating losses and tax credits before expiration with the application of the Section 382 annual limitation.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. Federal income tax as well as income and franchise tax in multiple state jurisdictions.\nThe statute of limitations related to the consolidated Federal income tax returns is closed for all tax years up to and including 2019. The expirations\nof the statutes of limitations related to the various state income and franchise tax returns vary by state. The Company is currently not under\nexamination in any major taxing jurisdiction.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31 is as follows:\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022\nBalance at January 1, $ 1,437 $ 1,437\nIncreases based on tax positions related to prior years — —\nDecreases related to settlements with taxing authorities — —\nDecreases related to lapse of statute of limitation — —\nBalance at December 31, $ 1,437 $ 1,437\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $1.4 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and is primarily comprised of unrecognized\ntax benefits related to the Opus acquisition in 2020. The total amount of tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably impact the effective tax rate\nwas $563,000 at December 31, 2023 and 2022. It is reasonably possible that $1.1 million of the Company's unrecognized tax benefits may be\nrecognized within the next 12 months due to a lapse of the statute of limitations.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The Company has accrued\n$200,000 and $89,000 for such interest at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. No amounts for penalties were accrued at December 31, 2023\nand 2022.\n163\nTable of Contents\nNote 15 – Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Commitments, and Contingencies\nCommitments to Extend Credit\nThe Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of\nits customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit in the form of originating loans or providing funds under existing\nlines or letters of credit. These commitments are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the\ncontract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and may require payment of a fee. Since many commitments are expected to expire, the\ntotal commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Commitments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and\ninterest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition.\nThe Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to\nextend credit is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments. The Company controls credit risk of its commitments to fund\nloans through credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and\nconditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. The Company evaluates each customer for creditworthiness.\nThe Company receives collateral to support commitments when deemed necessary. The most significant categories of collateral include real\nestate properties underlying mortgage loans, liens on personal property, and cash on deposit with the Bank.\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the financial performance of a customer to a third\nparty. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support private borrowing or purchase arrangements. If a borrower defaults on its commitments\nsubject to any letter of credit issued under these arrangements, the Bank would be required to meet the borrower's financial obligation but would\nseek repayment of that financial obligation from the borrower. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary, is based on management’s\ncredit evaluation of the customer.\nThe following table presents a summary of the Company’s commitments to extend credit described below as of the dates indicated:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022\nLoan commitments to extend credit $ 1,655,078 $ 2,443,791\nStandby letters of credit 48,392 45,412\nTotal $ 1,703,470 $ 2,489,203\nThe balance at December 31, 2023 is primarily composed of $1.43 billion of undisbursed commitments for C&I loans.\nThe Company maintains an allowance for credit losses for off-balance sheet commitments to provide for commitments associated with\nundisbursed loan funds and unused lines of credit. The allowance for credit losses for off-balance sheet commitments was $19.3 million and $23.6\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. See Note 5 – Allowance for Credit Losses for additional information.\n164\nTable of Contents\nOther Commitments\nThe Company has commitments to invest in qualified affordable housing partnerships that qualify for CRA credit and generate LIHTC and\nother tax benefits as discussed in Note 9 – Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Partnerships. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, LIHTC\ncommitments totaled $32.1 million and $15.4 million, respectively.\nTrust Custodial Asset Accounts\nThe Company’s Pacific Premier Trust division holds certain assets in custodial capacity on behalf of our trust customers, which are not\nincluded in our consolidated financial statement of condition. The total trust custodial assets under custody was approximately $16.92 billion and\n$17.08 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company is not involved in any material pending legal proceedings, other than those occurring in the ordinary course of business.\nManagement believes that none of these legal proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse impact on the financial\ncondition or results of operations of the Company.\nNote 16 – Benefit Plans\n401(k) Plan. The Bank maintains an Employee Savings Plan (the “401(k) Plan”) which qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal\nRevenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, employees may contribute from 1% to 99% of their compensation, up to the dollar limit imposed by the IRS\nfor tax purposes. In 2023, 2022, and 2021, the Bank matched 100% of contributions for the first three percent contributed and 50% on the next two\npercent contributed. Contributions made to the 401(k) Plan by the Bank amounted to $4.8 million for 2023, $5.1 million for 2022, and $4.9 million\nfor 2021.\nHeritage Oaks Bancorp, Inc. 2005 Equity Based Compensation Plan (the “2005 Plan”) and Heritage Oaks Bancorp, Inc. 2015 Equity Based\nCompensation Plan (the “2015 Plan”). The 2005 Plan and 2015 Plan were acquired from Heritage Oaks Bancorp, Inc. on April 1, 2017. The 2005\nPlan authorized the granting of Incentive Stock Options, Non-Qualified Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock Awards,\nRestricted Stock Units, and Performance Share Cash Only Awards. As of December 31, 2016, no further grants can be made from the 2005 Plan. The\n2015 Plan authorized the granting of various types of share-based compensation awards to the employees and Board of Directors such as stock\noptions, restricted stock awards, and restricted stock units. The Company's Board of Directors has determined that, effective May 23, 2022, the 2015\nPlan is terminated such that no further awards can be made from the 2015 Plan.\nPacific Premier Bancorp, Inc. Amended and Restated 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2022 Plan”). On May 23, 2022, the\nCorporation’s stockholders approved the Company’s Amended and Restated 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2022 Plan”), which restates the\n2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2012 Plan”) previously in place in order to increase shares available under the 2012 Plan by 2,000,000 shares\nto total 7,000,000 shares of the common stock of the Corporation reserved for issuance to executive officers, employees, non-employee directors,\nconsultants, or independent contractors. The maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock with respect to one or more awards that may be\ngranted to any one person during any one calendar year shall be 400,000 shares or 30,000 shares in the case of non-employee directors. The 2022\nPlan will be in effect for a period of ten years from May 23, 2022, the date the 2022 Plan was adopted. Awards granted may include incentive stock\noptions, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units including performance-based units, and stock appreciation rights. The\nawards generally have vesting periods ranging from one to five years, where such vesting may occur in either equal annual installments or one lump\nsum at the end of the vesting term. As of May 23, 2022, the 2022 Plan will be the only active equity plan pursuant to which we can grant equity\nawards to incentivize our employees. As of December 31, 2023, the total number of shares available to grant was 1.8 million.\n165\nTable of Contents\nStock Options\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were 3,475 options outstanding on the 2005 Plan with zero available for future awards and there were 4,876\noptions outstanding on the 2015 Plan with zero available for future awards . As of December 31, 2023, there were 88,499 options outstanding on the\n2022 Plan with 1,828,009 available for future awards.

Restricted stock awards and restricted stock units with a\nservice condition for vesting are valued at the closing stock price on the date of grant and are expensed to stock-based compensation expense ratably\nunder the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period. Restricted stock units with a performance condition for vesting are valued\nat the closing stock price on the date of grant and the expense is estimated based on the share percentage payout expected to be achieved at vesting\nover a three-year performance period. The Company evaluates the probable outcome of the performance conditions quarterly and makes cumulative\nadjustments for current and prior periods in compensation expense in the period of change. Restricted stock units with a market condition for vesting\nare valued using a Monte Carlo valuation model and are expensed to stock-based compensation expense over a three-year performance period. The\npreviously recognized compensation expense for awards with a market condition will reverse only if the requisite service is not rendered. For\naccounting on stock-based compensation plans, see Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for more\ninformation.\nOther Plans\nSalary Continuation Plan. The Bank implemented a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan in 2006 (the “Salary Continuation Plan”)\nfor certain executive officers of the Bank. The Salary Continuation Plan is unfunded.\nDeferred Compensation Plans. The Bank implemented a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan in 2006 (the “Supplemental Executive\nRetirement Plan” or “SERP”) for certain executive officers of the Bank. The Bank has acquired additional SERPs through the acquisitions of San\nDiego Trust Bank, Independence Bank, Heritage Oaks Bancorp, Inc, and Grandpoint Capital, Inc. The SERP is unfunded.\nThe expense incurred for the Salary Continuation Plan and SERP for each of the last three years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021\nwas $456,000, $485,000, and $503,000, respectively, resulting in a deferred compensation liability of $9.0 million and $9.6 million as of the years\nended 2023 and 2022, respectively. In addition, with the acquisition of Plaza Bancorp, Inc., the Company acquired a deferred compensation plan that\nwas funded and resulted in a deferred compensation liability in the amount of $1.2 million and $1.3 million as of the years ended December 31, 2023\nand 2022, respectively.\n167\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the total deferred compensation liabilities recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of\ncondition for these plans were $10.3 million and $10.9 million, respectively.\nNote 17 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe fair value of an asset or liability is the exchange price that would be received to sell that asset or paid to transfer that liability (exit price)\nin an orderly transaction occurring in the principal market (or most advantageous market in the absence of a principal market) for such asset or\nliability. In estimating fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that are consistent with the market approach, the income approach,\nand/or the cost approach. Such valuation techniques are consistently applied. Inputs to valuation techniques include the assumptions that market\nparticipants would use in pricing an asset or liability. ASC Topic 825 - Financial Instruments requires disclosure of the fair value of financial assets\nand financial liabilities, including both those financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring\nbasis and a non-recurring basis. The methodologies for estimating the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair\nvalue are discussed below.\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 820 - Fair Value Measurement, the Company groups its financial assets and financial liabilities measured at\nfair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine\nfair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1\nmeasurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described as\nfollows:\nLevel 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or\nliabilities.\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These\nmight include quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are\nnot active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (such as interest rates, prepayment speeds, volatilities,\netc.) or model-based valuation techniques where all significant assumptions are observable, either directly or indirectly, in the market.\nLevel 3 - Valuation is generated from model-based techniques where one or more significant inputs are not observable, either directly or\nindirectly, in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect the Company’s own estimates of assumptions that market participants\nwould use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques may include use of matrix pricing, discounted cash flow models, and similar\ntechniques.\nBecause no market exists for a significant portion of the Company’s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments\nregarding current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. These estimates are subjective in\nnature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions\ncould significantly affect the fair values presented. Management uses its best judgment in estimating the fair value of the Company’s financial\ninstruments; however, there are inherent limitations in any estimation technique. While management believes the Company’s valuation\nmethodologies are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair\nvalue of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. The Company’s valuation methodologies\nmay produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values.\n168\nTable of Contents\nA financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement. Management maximizes the use of observable inputs and attempts to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair\nvalue measurements. Estimated fair values are disclosed for financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate fair value. These estimates\nare made at a specific point in time based on relevant market data and information about the financial instruments. These estimates do not reflect any\npremium or discount that could result from offering the Company’s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument for sale at one time, nor do\nthey attempt to estimate the value of anticipated future business related to the instruments. In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization\nof unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in any of these estimates.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe following is a description of both the general and specific valuation methodologies used for certain instruments measured at fair value,\nas well as the general classification of these instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.\nAFS Investment Securities – Investment securities are generally valued based upon quotes obtained from an independent third-party pricing\nservice, which uses evaluated pricing applications and model processes. Observable market inputs, such as, benchmark yields, reported trades,\nbroker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data are considered as part of the evaluation.\nThe inputs are related directly to the security being evaluated, or indirectly to a similarly situated security. Market assumptions and market data are\nutilized in the valuation models. The Company reviews the market prices provided by the third-party pricing service for reasonableness based on the\nCompany’s understanding of the market place and credit issues related to the securities. The Company has not made any adjustments to the market\nquotes provided by them and, accordingly, the Company categorized its investment portfolio within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nEquity Securities With Readily Determinable Fair Values – The Company’s equity securities with readily determinable fair values consist of\ninvestments in public companies and qualify for CRA purposes. The fair value is based on the closing price on nationally recognized securities\nexchanges at the end of each period and classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.\nInterest Rate Swaps – The Company originates a variable rate loan and enters into a variable-to-fixed interest rate swap with the customer.\nThe Company also enters into an offsetting swap with a correspondent bank. These back-to-back swap agreements are intended to offset each other\nand allow the Company to originate a variable rate loan, while providing a contract for fixed interest payments for the customer. The Company also\nenters into interest rate swap contracts with institutional counterparties to hedge against certain fixed-rate loans. The net cash flow for the Company\nis equal to the interest income received from a variable rate loan originated with the customer. The fair value of these derivatives is based on a\nmarket standard discounted cash flow approach. The Company incorporates credit value adjustments on derivatives to properly reflect the respective\ncounterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements of its derivatives. The Company has determined that the observable nature of the\nmajority of inputs used in deriving the fair value of these derivative contracts fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, and the credit valuation\nadjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivative financial instruments. As a result, the valuation of interest rate swaps is\nclassified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\n169\nTable of Contents\nEquity Warrant Assets – The Company acquired equity warrant assets as a result of the acquisition of Opus. Opus received equity warrant\nassets through its lending activities as part of loan origination fees. The warrants provide the Bank the right to purchase a specific number of equity\nshares of the underlying company’s equity at a certain price before expiration and contain net settlement terms qualifying as derivatives under ASC\nTopic 815 - Derivatives and Hedging. The fair value of equity warrant assets is determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model and are\nclassified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy due to the extent of unobservable inputs. The key assumptions used in determining the fair value\ninclude the exercise price of the warrants, valuation of the underlying entity's outstanding stock, expected term, risk-free interest rate, marketability\ndiscount for private company warrants, and price volatility.\nForeign Exchange Contracts – The Company enters into foreign exchange contracts to accommodate the business needs of its customers.\nThe Company also enters into offsetting contracts with institutional counterparties to mitigate the Company’s foreign exchange exposure with its\ncustomers, or enters into bilateral collateral and master netting agreements with certain customer counterparties to manage its credit exposure. The\nCompany measures the fair value of foreign exchange contracts based on quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets, a Level 1\nmeasurement.\nThe following fair value hierarchy tables present information about the Company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis at the dates indicated:\nDecember 31, 2023\nFair Value Measurement Using\nTotal\n(Dollars in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fair Value\nFinancial assets\nAFS investment securities:\nU.S. Treasury $ — $ 539,256 $ — $ 539,256\nAgency — 1,868 — 1,868\nCorporate — 446,343 — 446,343\nCollateralized mortgage obligation — 152,604 — 152,604\nTotal AFS investment securities $ — $ 1,140,071 $ — $ 1,140,071\nEquity securities $ 759 $ — $ — $ 759\nDerivative assets:\nForeign exchange contracts $ 1 $ — $ — $ 1\nInterest rate swaps (1) — 5,643 — 5,643\nTotal derivative assets $ 1 $ 5,643 $ — $ 5,644\nFinancial liabilities\nDerivative liabilities:\nForeign exchange $ 10 $ — $ — $ 10\nInterest rate swaps — 10,705 — 10,705\nTotal derivative liabilities $ 10 $ 10,705 $ — $ 10,715\n_______________________________________________________\n(1) Represents amounts after the application of variation margin payments as settlements with central counterparties, where applicable.

Individually evaluated loans are measured at fair value when they are deemed collateral dependent. Fair value on such loans is measured based\non the underlying collateral. Collateral generally consists of accounts receivable, inventory, fixed assets, real estate, and cash. The Company\nmeasures impairment on all individually evaluated loans for which it has reduced the principal balance to the value of the underlying collateral less\nthe anticipated selling cost.\nOther Real Estate Owned – OREO is initially recorded at the fair value less estimated costs to sell at the date of transfer. This amount\nbecomes the property’s new basis. Any fair value adjustments based on the property’s fair value less estimated costs to sell at the date of acquisition\nare charged to the allowance for credit losses.\nThe fair value of individually evaluated collateral dependent loans and OREO were determined using Level 3 assumptions, and represents\nindividually evaluated loan for which a specific reserve has been established or on which a write down has been taken. For real estate loans,\ngenerally, the Company obtains third party appraisals (or property valuations) and/or collateral audits in conjunction with internal analysis based on\nhistorical experience on its individually evaluated loans to determine fair value. In determining the net realizable value of the underlying collateral\nfor individually evaluated loans and OREO, the Company then discounts the valuation to cover both market price fluctuations and selling costs,\ntypically ranging from 7% to 10% of the collateral value, that the Company expected would be incurred in the event of foreclosure. In addition to the\ndiscounts taken, the Company’s calculation of net realizable value considered any other senior liens in place on the underlying collateral. For non-\nreal estate loans, fair value of the loan’s collateral may be determined using an appraisal, net book value per the borrower’s financial statements, or\naging reports, adjusted or discounted based on management’s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions, and management’s expertise and\nknowledge of the client and client’s business.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company’s individually evaluated collateral dependent loans were evaluated based on the fair value of their\nunderlying collateral based upon the most recent appraisals available to management. The Company completed partial charge-offs on certain\nindividually evaluated loans based on recent real estate or property appraisals and recorded the related reserves where applicable during the year\nended December 31, 2023.\nThe following table presents our assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nTotal\n(Dollars in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fair Value\nDecember 31, 2023\nFinancial assets\nCollateral dependent loans $ — $ — $ 1,569 $ 1,569\nOther real estate owned — — 248 248\nTotal assets $ — $ — $ 1,817 $ 1,817\nDecember 31, 2022\nFinancial assets\nCollateral dependent loans $ — $ — $ 3,180 $ 3,180\n172\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents quantitative information about Level 3 of fair value measurements for assets measured at fair value on a\nnonrecurring basis at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nRange\nWeighted\n(Dollars in thousands) Fair Value Valuation Technique(s) Unobservable Input(s) Min Max Average\nDecember 31, 2023\nInvestor loans secured by real estate\nSBA secured by real estate (1) $ 419 Fair value of collateral Cost to sell 10.00% 10.00% 10.00%\nCommercial loans\nCommercial and industrial 1,150 Fair value of collateral Cost to sell 7.00% 7.00% 7.00%\nTotal individually evaluated loans 1,569\nOther real estate owned 248 Fair value of property Cost to sell 10.00% 10.00% 10.00%\nTotal assets $ 1,817\nDecember 31, 2022\nCommercial loans\nCollateral discount and cost to\nCommercial and industrial 3,180 Fair value of collateral sell 6.00% 6.00% 6.00%\nTotal individually evaluated loans $ 3,180\n_________________________________________________\n(1) SBA loans that are collateralized by hotel/motel real property.\nFair Values of Financial Instruments\nThe fair value estimates presented herein are based on pertinent information available to management as of the dates indicated, representing\nan exit price.\nDecember 31, 2023\nCarrying Estimated\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fair Value\nAssets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 936,473 $ 936,473 $ — $ — $ 936,473\nInterest-bearing time deposits with financial institutions 995 995 — — 995\nHTM investment securities 1,729,541 — 1,485,506 — 1,485,506\nAFS investment securities 1,140,071 — 1,140,071 — 1,140,071\nEquity securities 759 759 — — 759\nLoans held for investment, net 13,289,020 — — 12,562,323 12,562,323\nDerivative assets (1) 5,644 1 5,643 — 5,644\nAccrued interest receivable 68,516 — 68,516 — 68,516\nLiabilities:\nDeposit accounts 14,995,626 — 15,003,769 — 15,003,769\nFHLB advances 600,000 — 592,480 — 592,480\nSubordinated debentures 331,842 — 320,687 — 320,687\nDerivative liabilities 10,715 10 10,705 — 10,715\nAccrued interest payable 18,671 — 18,671 — 18,671\n_________________________________________________________\n(1) Represents amounts after the application of variation margin payments as settlements with central counterparties, where applicable.

See Note 19 – Derivative Instruments for additional information.\nNote 18 – Earnings Per Share\nThe Company’s restricted stock awards contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends and therefore are considered participating securities. The\nCompany calculates basic and diluted earnings per common share using the two-class method.\nUnder the two-class method, distributed and undistributed earnings allocable to participating securities are deducted from net income to\ndetermine net income allocable to common shareholders, which is then used in the numerator of both basic and diluted earnings per share\ncalculations. Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income allocable to common shareholders by the weighted average\nnumber of common shares outstanding for the reporting period, excluding outstanding participating securities. Diluted earnings per common share is\ncomputed by dividing net income allocable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding over the\nreporting period, adjusted to include the effect of potentially dilutive common shares, but excludes awards considered participating securities. The\ncomputation of diluted earnings per common share excludes the impact of the assumed exercise or issuance of securities that would have an anti-\ndilutive effect.\n174\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables set forth the Company’s earnings per share calculations for the periods indicated:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data) 2023 2022 2021\nBasic\nNet income $ 30,852 $ 283,743 $ 339,889\nLess: dividends and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities (2,061) (3,405) (3,517)\nNet income allocated to common stockholders $ 28,791 $ 280,338 $ 336,372\nWeighted average common shares outstanding 94,113,132 93,718,293 93,532,109\nBasic earnings per common share $ 0.31 $ 2.99 $ 3.60\nDiluted\nNet income allocated to common stockholders $ 28,791 $ 280,338 $ 336,372\nWeighted average common shares outstanding 94,113,132 93,718,293 93,532,109\nDilutive effect of share-based compensation 123,743 373,168 480,028\nWeighted average diluted common shares 94,236,875 94,091,461 94,012,137\nDiluted earnings per common share $ 0.31 $ 2.98 $ 3.58\nShares or stock options are excluded from the computations of diluted earnings per share when their inclusion have an anti-dilutive effect.\nThe dilutive impact of these securities could be included in future computations of diluted earnings per share if the market price of the common stock\nincreases. For the year ended December 31, 2023, there were 71,447 weighted average potential common shares that were anti-dilutive. There were\nno potential common shares that were anti-dilutive at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\nNote 19 – Derivative Instruments\nThe Company uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to market risks, including interest rate risk, and to assist customers with\ntheir risk management objectives. The Company designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments in a qualifying hedge accounting relationship,\nwhile other derivatives serve as economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting.\nDerivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments\nFair Value Hedges – The Company is exposed to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate assets due to changes in benchmark interest rates.\nThe Company entered into pay-fixed and receive-floating interest rate swaps associated with certain fixed rate loans, primarily commercial real\nestate and multifamily loans, to manage its exposure to changes in fair value on these instruments attributable to changes in the designated SOFR\nbenchmark interest rate. These interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges using the portfolio layer method. The Company receives\nvariable-rate interest payments in exchange for making fixed-rate payments over the lives of the contracts without exchanging the notional amounts.\nThe fair value hedges are recorded as components of other assets and other liabilities in the Company’s consolidated statements of financial\ncondition. The gain or loss on these derivatives, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk, are\nrecognized in interest income in the Company’s consolidated statements of income. At December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, interest rate\nswaps with an aggregate notional amount of $1.35 billion and $1.20 billion, respectively, were designated as fair value hedges. Cash flows on\nderivatives designated as hedging instruments are classified in the statement of cash flows the same as the cash flows of the assets being hedged.\n175\nTable of Contents\nThe following amounts were recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition related to cumulative basis adjustment for fair\nvalue hedges as of the dates indicated:\nCumulative Amount of Fair Value Hedging\nLine Item in the Statement of Financial Position in Which Adjustment Included in the Carrying\nthe Hedged Item is Included Carrying Amount of the Hedged Assets Amount of the Hedged Assets\n(Dollars in thousands) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nLoans held for investment(1) $ 1,320,449 $ 1,138,074 $ (29,551) $ (61,926)\nTotal $ 1,320,449 $ 1,138,074 $ (29,551) $ (61,926)\n______________________________\n(1) These amounts were included in the amortized cost basis of closed portfolios of loans held for investment used to designate hedging relationships in which the hedged item is the\nstated amount of assets in the closed portfolios anticipated to be outstanding for the designated hedge period. At December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the amortized cost\nbasis of the closed portfolios used in these hedging relationships was $3.25 billion and 3.35 billion, respectively; the cumulative basis adjustments associated with these hedging\nrelationships was $(29.6) million and $(61.9) million, respectively; and the amounts of the designated hedged items were $1.35 billion and $1.20 billion, respectively.\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments\nInterest Rate Swap Contracts – From time to time, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements with certain borrowers to assist\nthem in mitigating their interest rate risk exposure associated with the loans they have with the Company. At the same time, the Company enters into\nidentical offsetting interest rate swap agreements with another financial institution to mitigate the Company’s interest rate risk exposure associated\nwith the swap agreements it enters into with its borrowers. The Company had over-the-counter derivative instruments and centrally-cleared\nderivative instruments with matched terms. The fair values of these agreements are determined through a third-party valuation model used by the\nCompany’s swap advisory firm, which uses observable market data such as interest rates, prices of Eurodollar futures contracts, and market swap\nrates. The fair values of these swaps are recorded as components of other assets and other liabilities in the Company’s consolidated statements of\nfinancial condition. Changes in the fair value of these swaps, which occur due to changes in interest rates, are recorded in the Company’s income\nstatement as a component of noninterest income. Upon the cessation of LIBOR on June 30, 2023, our LIBOR-indexed interest rate swap contracts\ntransitioned to SOFR as successor rate for both valuations and settlements.\nOver-the-counter contracts are tailored to meet the needs of the counterparties involved and, therefore, generally contain a greater degree of\ncredit risk and liquidity risk than centrally-cleared contracts, which have standardized terms. Although changes in the fair value of swap agreements\nbetween the Company and borrowers and the Company and other financial institutions offset each other, changes in the credit risk of these\ncounterparties may result in a difference in the fair value of the swap agreements. Offsetting over-the-counter swap agreements the Company has\nwith other financial institutions are collateralized with cash, and swap agreements with borrowers are secured by the collateral arrangements for the\nunderlying loans these borrowers have with the Company. All interest rate swap agreements entered into by the Company are free-standing\nderivatives and are not designated as hedging instruments.\nForeign Exchange Contracts – The Company offers foreign exchange spot and forward contracts as accommodations to its customers to\npurchase and/or sell foreign currencies at a contractual price. In conjunction with these products the Company also enters into offsetting contracts\nwith institutional counterparties to mitigate the Company’s foreign exchange exposure with its customers, or enters into bilateral collateral and\nmaster netting agreements with certain customer counterparties to manage its credit exposure. These contracts allow the Company to offer its\ncustomers foreign exchange products while minimizing its exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. These foreign exchange contracts are not\ndesignated as hedging instruments and are recorded at fair value in other assets and other liabilities in the Company’s consolidated statements of\nfinancial condition. Changes in the fair value of these contracts are recorded in the Company’s consolidated statements of income as a component of\nnoninterest income.\n176\nTable of Contents\nEquity Warrant Assets – The Company acquired equity warrant assets as a result of the acquisition of Opus. Opus received equity warrant\nassets through its lending activities, which were accounted for as loan origination fees. The warrants provide the Bank the right to purchase a specific\nnumber of equity shares of the underlying company’s equity at a certain price before expiration and contain net settlement terms qualifying as\nderivatives under ASC Topic 815. The Company no longer has loans associated with these borrowers. Changes in fair value are recognized as a\ncomponent of noninterest income with a corresponding offset within other assets. The total fair value of the warrants held in private companies was\nzero and $1.9 million in other assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. During 2023, the equity warrant assets were either settled or\nwritten off as the warrants were determined to be unexercisable until the underlying company’s fair market value is greater than the value established\nin the warrant agreement.\nThe net increases or decreases in derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are included in “Net change in accrued interest\nreceivable and other assets” and “Net change in accrued expenses and other liabilities” within the statement of cash flows.\nThe following tables summarize the Company’s derivative instruments included in “other assets” and “other liabilities” in the consolidated\nstatements of financial condition as of the dates indicated:\nDecember 31, 2023\nDerivative Assets Derivative Liabilities\n(Dollars in thousands) Notional Fair Value Notional Fair Value\nDerivative instruments designated as hedging instruments:\nFair value hedge - interest rate swap contracts $ 600,000 $ 34,541 $ 750,000 $ 3,184\nTotal derivative designated as hedging instruments 600,000 34,541 750,000 3,184\nDerivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments:\nForeign exchange contracts 19 1 410 10\nInterest rate swap contracts 103,954 10,397 103,954 10,409\nTotal derivative not designated as hedging instruments 103,973 10,398 104,364 10,419\nTotal derivatives $ 703,973 $ 44,939 $ 854,364 $ 13,603\nNetting adjustments - cleared positions (1) 39,295 2,888\nTotal derivatives in the Balance Sheet $ 5,644 $ 10,715\n______________________________\n(1) Netting adjustments represents the variation margin payments that are considered legal settlements of derivative exposure and applied to net the fair value of the respective\nderivative contracts in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on the settle-to-market rule for cleared derivatives.\n177\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31, 2022\nDerivative Assets Derivative Liabilities\n(Dollars in thousands) Notional Fair Value Notional Fair Value\nDerivative instruments designated as hedging instruments:\nFair value hedge - interest rate swap contracts $ 900,000 $ 63,710 $ 300,000 $ 72\nTotal derivative designated as hedging instruments 900,000 63,710 300,000 72\nDerivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments:\nForeign exchange contracts 22 1 143 1\nInterest rate swap contracts 112,124 12,524 112,124 12,525\nEquity warrants — 1,894 — —\nTotal derivative not designated as hedging instruments 112,146 14,419 112,267 12,526\nTotal derivatives $ 1,012,146 $ 78,129 $ 412,267 $ 12,598\nNetting adjustments - cleared positions (1) 69,181 67\nTotal derivatives in the Balance Sheet $ 8,948 $ 12,531\n______________________________\n(1) Netting adjustments represents the variation margin payments that are considered legal settlements of derivative exposure and applied to net the fair value of the respective\nderivative contracts in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on the settle-to-market rule for cleared derivatives.\nThe following table presents the effect of fair value hedge accounting on the consolidated statements of income:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\nLocation of Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income on\n(Dollars in thousands) Derivative Instruments 2023 2022\nGain (loss) on fair value hedging relationships:\nHedged items - loans Interest Income $ 32,375 (56,628)\nInterest rate swap contracts Interest Income 5,721 68,322\nThe following table summarizes the effect of the derivative financial instruments in the consolidated statements of income.\n(Dollars in thousands) For the Year Ended December 31,\nDerivative Not Designated as Hedging Location of Gain Recognized in\nInstruments: Income on Derivative Instruments 2023 2022 2021\nForeign exchange contracts Other income $ 952 $ 490 $ 82\nInterest rate products Other income (11) 4 9\nEquity warrants Other income (1,194) 4 (24)\nTotal $ (253) $ 498 $ 67\n178\nTable of Contents\nNote 20 – Balance Sheet Offsetting\nDerivative financial instruments may be eligible for offset in the consolidated statements of financial condition, such as those subject to\nenforceable master netting arrangements or a similar agreement. Under these agreements, the Company has the right to net settle multiple contracts\nwith the same counterparty. The Company offers an interest rate swap product to qualified customers, which are then paired with derivative contracts\nthe Company enters into with a counterparty bank. While derivative contracts entered into with counterparty banks may be subject to enforceable\nmaster netting agreements, derivative contracts with customers may not be subject to enforceable master netting arrangements. With regard to\nderivative contracts not centrally cleared through a clearinghouse, regulations require collateral to be posted by the party with a net liability position.\nParties to a centrally cleared over-the-counter derivative exchange daily payments that reflect the daily change in value of the derivative. These\npayments are commonly referred to as variation margin and are treated as settlements of derivative exposure rather than as collateral. The gross\namounts of derivative assets and liabilities for derivative contracts cleared through certain central clearing parties are reported at the fair value of the\nrespective derivative contracts net of the variation margin payments, where applicable.\nFinancial instruments that are eligible for offset in the consolidated statements of financial condition as of the periods indicated are presented\nin the table below:\nGross Amounts Not Offset in the Consolidated\nStatements of Financial Condition\nNet Amounts\nGross Amounts Offset Presented in the\nin the Consolidated Consolidated\nGross Amounts Statements of Statements of Financial\n(Dollars in thousands) Recognized (1) Financial Condition Financial Condition Instruments (2) Cash Collateral (3) Net Amount\nDecember 31, 2023\nDerivative assets:\nInterest rate swaps $ 5,643 $ — $ 5,643 $ — $ (4,610) $ 1,033\nTotal $ 5,643 $ — $ 5,643 $ — $ (4,610) $ 1,033\nFinancial liabilities:\nInterest rate swaps $ 10,705 $ — $ 10,705 $ — $ — $ 10,705\nTotal $ 10,705 $ — $ 10,705 $ — $ — $ 10,705\nDecember 31, 2022\nDerivative assets:\nInterest rate swaps $ 7,053 $ — $ 7,053 $ — $ (5,440) $ 1,613\nTotal $ 7,053 $ — $ 7,053 $ — $ (5440) $ 1,613\nFinancial liabilities:\nInterest rate swaps $ 12,530 $ — $ 12,530 $ — $ — $ 12,530\nTotal $ 12,530 $ — $ 12,530 $ — $ — $ 12,530\n______________________________\n(1) Represents amounts after the application of variation margin payments as settlements with central counterparties, where applicable.\n(2) Represents the fair value of securities pledged with counterparty bank.\n(3) Represents cash collateral received from or pledged with counterparty bank.

The Company’s leases primarily represent future obligations to\nmake payments for the use of buildings or space for its operations. Liabilities to make future lease payments are recorded in accrued expenses and\nother liabilities, while right-of-use assets are recorded in other assets in the Company’s consolidated statements of financial condition.\nAt December 31, 2023, all of the Company’s leases were classified as operating leases or short-term leases. Short-term leases are leases that have a\nterm of 12 months or less at commencement.\nLiabilities to make future lease payments and right-of-use assets are determined based on the total contractual base rents for each lease,\nwhich include options to extend or renew each lease, where applicable, and where the Company believes it has an economic incentive to extend or\nrenew the lease. Future contractual base rents are discounted using the rate implicit in the lease or the Company’s estimated incremental borrowing\nrate if the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. Liabilities to make future lease payments on operating leases are reduced by periodic\ncontractual lease payments net of periodic interest accretion. Right-of-use assets for operating leases are amortized over the term of the associated\nlease by amounts that represent the difference between periodic straight-line lease expense and periodic interest accretion on the related liability to\nmake future lease payments. The Company recognizes expense for both operating leases and short-term leases on a straight-line basis.\nThe Company’s lease expense is recorded in premises and occupancy expense in the consolidated statements of income.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and\nprocedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In\naddition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to\napply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\nBased on our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and\nprocedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K in providing reasonable assurance that information\nwe are required to disclose in periodic reports that we file or submit to the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized,\nand reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our\nmanagement, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required\ndisclosure.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-\n15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n• pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our\nassets;\n• provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with\nGAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of its management and directors;\nand\n• provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that\ncould have a material effect on the financial statements.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this\nassessment, management used the framework set forth in the report entitled “Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO. The COSO framework summarizes each of the components of a\ncompany’s internal control system, including (i) the control environment, (ii) risk assessment, (iii) control activities, (iv) information and\ncommunication, and (v) monitoring. Based on this assessment, our management believes that, as of December 31, 2023, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting was effective.\n184\nTable of Contents\nDeloitte & Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Company’s financial statements included in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K, issued an audit report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023.

Gardner\nSteven R. Gardner\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n/s/ Ronald J. Nicolas, Jr.\nRonald J. Nicolas, Jr.\nSenior Executive Vice President and\nChief Financial Officer\nA signed original of this written statement required by Section 906 has been provided to the Company and will be retained by the Company and furnished to\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission or its staff upon request.\nPACIFIC PREMIER BANCORP, INC.\nPage 1 of 3\nCLAWBACK POLICY Board Approved: November 13, 2023\nThe Board of Directors of Pacific Premier Bancorp, Inc. (the “Board”) believes that it is in the best interest of Pacific Premier Bancorp, Inc. (the\n“Company”) and its shareholders to create and maintain a culture that emphasizes integrity and accountability and that reinforces the Company’s\npay-for-performance compensation philosophy. The Board has therefore adopted this Clawback Policy (as amended) (the “Policy”), which provides\nfor the recoupment of certain executive compensation in the event of an Accounting Restatement. The Policy is intended to comply with and be\ninterpreted in accordance with the requirements of Listing Rule 5608 (“Listing Rule 5608”) of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”). The\nprovisions of Listing Rule 5608 shall prevail in the event of any conflict between the text of this Policy and such listing rule.\nAdministration.\nThis Policy shall be administered by the Board or, as designated herein, the Compensation Committee of the Board (the “Compensation\nCommittee”), in which case references to the Board shall be deemed to be references to the Compensation Committee. Any determination made by\nthe Board shall be final and binding on all affected individuals.\nCovered Executives.\nThis Policy applies to the Company’s Covered Executives. The term “Covered Executive” means the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, President,\nChief Financial Officer, or principal accounting officer (or, if there is no such accounting officer, the Controller), any vice-president of the Company in\ncharge of a principal business unit, division or function (such as sales, administration or finance), and any other officer or person who performs a\nsignificant policy-making function for the Company, whether such person is employed by the Company or a subsidiary thereof. For the sake of clarity,\n“Covered Executive” includes at a minimum executive officers identified by the Board pursuant to 17 CFR 229.401(b).\nRecoupment of Incentive Compensation.\nThis Policy applies in the event the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement. The term “Accounting Restatement” means any\naccounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under applicable securities laws,\nincluding any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that (i) is material to the previously issued\nfinancial statements (commonly referred to as a “Big R” restatement), or (ii) is not material to previously issued financial statements, but would result\nin a material misstatement if the error were left uncorrected in the current period or the error correction were recognized in the current period\n(commonly referred to as a “little r” restatement).\nFor purposes of this Policy, the date of an Accounting Restatement will be deemed to be the earlier of (i) the date the Board, a committee of the\nBoard, or officers authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company\nis required to prepare a restatement, and (ii) the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare a\nrestatement.\nIf any Incentive Compensation (as defined below) is received by a Covered Executive that was in excess of the Incentive Compensation that would\nhave been paid to the Covered Executive based on the information in an Accounting Restatement, the Board shall seek repayment of such Incentive\nCompensation, as described in this Policy. The Board shall determine whether any Incentive Compensation received by a Covered Executive during\nthe Look-Back Period was in excess of the Incentive Compensation that should have been received by the Covered Executive based on the\ninformation in the Accounting Restatement. If the Board so determines, then a committee consisting of non-management members of the Board\nestablished by the Board in its discretion in light of the circumstances, which may be the Audit or Compensation Committees of the Board (any such\ncommittee, the “Independent Director Committee”), shall review such Incentive Compensation.\nPACIFIC PREMIER BANCORP, INC.\nPage 2 of 3\nCLAWBACK POLICY Board Approved: November 13, 2023\nIf the Independent Director Committee determines that the amount of any such Incentive Compensation received by a Covered Executive (the\n“Awarded Compensation”) would have been a lower amount had it been determined based on the information in the Accounting Restatement (the\n“Actual Compensation”), then the Independent Director Committee shall in a timely manner seek to recover for the benefit of the Company the\ndifference between the Awarded Compensation and the Actual Compensation (such difference, the “Excess Compensation”). The Excess\nCompensation shall be calculated without considering the amount of any taxes paid.\nFor purposes of this Policy, Incentive Compensation is deemed “received” in the fiscal period that the Financial Reporting Measure specified in the\napplicable Incentive Compensation award or arrangement is attained, even if the payment or grant of the Incentive Compensation occurs after the\nend of that period.\nIn the event the Incentive Compensation is based on a measurement that is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in\nan Accounting Restatement, the Independent Director Committee shall calculate the Excess Compensation based on a reasonable estimate of the\neffect of the Accounting Restatement, which shall be set forth in writing. For example, in the case of Incentive Compensation based on stock price or\ntotal shareholder return, the Excess Compensation shall be based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the\nstock price or total shareholder return.\nThe Board will determine, in its sole discretion, the method for recouping Excess Compensation hereunder, which may include, without limitation: (a)\nrequiring reimbursement of Incentive Compensation previously paid; (b) seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement,\nsale, transfer or other disposition of any equity-based awards; (c) offsetting the recouped amount from any compensation otherwise owed by the\nCompany to the Covered Executive; (d) cancelling outstanding vested or unvested equity awards; and/or (e) taking any other remedial and recovery\naction permitted by law, as determined by the Board.\nPrior to seeking a recovery pursuant to this Policy, the Independent Director Committee shall make a written demand for repayment from the\nCovered Executive and, if the Covered Executive does not within a reasonable period tender repayment in full, or agree to a repayment plan\nacceptable to the Independent Director Committee, in response to such demand, and the Independent Director Committee determines that the\nCovered Executive is unlikely to do so, the Independent Director Committee may seek a court order against the Covered Executive for such\nrepayment or take any other remedial and recovery action permitted by law, as determined by the Independent Director Committee, including (A)\nseeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer, or other disposition of any equity-based awards; and/or (B)\ndeducting the amount to be recouped from any compensation otherwise owed by the Company to the Executive Officer.\nExceptions to Applicability.\nIn the event of an Accounting Restatement, the Company shall in a timely manner recover the Excess Compensation noted above unless the\nIndependent Director Committee makes a determination that recovery would be impracticable, and at least one of the following applies: (i) the direct\nexpense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing recovery would exceed the Excess Compensation, and a reasonable attempt to recover the\nExcess Compensation has already been made and documented; (ii) recovery of the Excess Compensation would violate home country law\n(provided such law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022 and that an opinion of counsel in such country is obtained stating that recoupment\nwould result in such violation); or (iii) recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly\navailable to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and\nregulations thereunder.\nPACIFIC PREMIER BANCORP, INC.\nPage 3 of 3\nCLAWBACK POLICY Board Approved: November 13, 2023\nDefinitions.\nFor the purposes of this Policy:\na. the term “Financial Reporting Measure” means any reporting measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting\nprinciples used in preparing the Company’s financial statements, and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures.\nStock price and total shareholder return are considered to be Financial Reporting Measures for purposes of this Policy. A financial reporting\nmeasure need not be presented within the financial statements or included in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nb. the term “Incentive Compensation” means all bonuses, other incentive compensation and equity compensation awarded to a Covered\nExecutive, the amount, payment and/or vesting of which was calculated based wholly or in part on a Financial Reporting Measure recorded\nduring any part of the period covered by this Policy.\nc. the term “Look-Back Period” means the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date of an Accounting Restatement and any\ntransition period as set forth in Listing Rule 5608.\nNo Indemnification of Covered Executives\nNotwithstanding the terms of any indemnification or insurance policy or any contractual arrangement with any Covered Executive that may be\ninterpreted to the contrary, the Company shall not indemnify any Covered Executives against the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation,\nincluding any payment or reimbursement for the cost of third-party insurance purchased by any Covered Executives to fund potential clawback\nobligations under this Policy.\nCommittee Indemnification\nAny members of the Committee, and any other members of the Board who assist in the administration of this Policy, shall not be personally liable for\nany action, determination or interpretation made with respect to this Policy and shall be fully indemnified by the Company to the fullest extent under\napplicable law and Company policy with respect to any such action, determination or interpretation.
