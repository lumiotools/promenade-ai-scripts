(“Keros” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: KROS), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing novel therapeutics to treat a wide range of patients with disorders that are linked to dysfunctional signaling of the transforming growth factor-beta (“TGF-ß”) family of proteins, today provided a business update and reported financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“This continues to be a year of clinical execution for Keros. In the third quarter, we completed enrollment ahead of schedule in our Phase 2 TROPOS trial of cibotercept (KER-012) in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension,” said Jasbir S. Seehra, Ph.D., Chair and Chief Executive Officer. “This has set the stage for upcoming clinical data updates from our three clinical assets, which are expected over the next nine months.”\n\n**Recent Corporate Highlights**\n\n  * **Executive leadership update:** In October 2024, the Company announced that Yung H. Chyung, M.D., has been appointed to serve as the Company’s Chief Medical Officer, effective as of November 1, 2024.\n  * **Cash position strengthened:** The Company has utilized its existing at-the-market offering (“ATM”) to sell additional shares of common stock, which strengthened its cash position. The Company expects that its cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, together with the net proceeds from the ATM through October 31, 2024, will enable the Company to fund its planned operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the third quarter of 2027.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial****Results**\n\nKeros reported a net loss of $53.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to a net loss of $39.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase of $13.5 million for the third quarter was largely due to increased research and development efforts as well as additional investments to support the achievement of Keros’ clinical and corporate goals.\n\nResearch and development expenses were $49.2 million for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to $34.1 million for the same period in 2023. The increase of $15.1 million was primarily due to additional research and development efforts, manufacturing activities and personnel expenses to support the advancement of Keros’ pipeline.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $9.8 million for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to $9.1 million for the same period in 2023. The increase of $0.7 million was primarily due to increase in personnel expenses and other external expenses to support Keros’ organizational growth.\n\nKeros’ cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 was $530.7 million compared to $331.1 million as of December 31, 2023. Keros expects that its cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, together with the net proceeds from the ATM through October 31, 2024, will enable Keros to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the third quarter of 2027.\n\n**About Keros Therapeutics, Inc.**\n\nKeros is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing novel therapeutics to treat a wide range of patients with disorders that are linked to dysfunctional signaling of the TGF-ß family of proteins.
