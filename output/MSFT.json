By providing our customers with the most advanced AI technology across every product we build — combined with our unparalleled partner ecosystem and co-innovation approach — we are helping them make real progress in ways that matter. I am proud to share over [100 customer stories](#customerstories) from this quarter alone showing how we are helping customers accelerate AI Transformation — no matter where they are on their journey.\n\nRecently during the [Microsoft AI Tour](https://aitour.microsoft.com/en-US/home), I spoke with customers who shared ways they are adopting Copilots to empower human achievement, democratize intelligence and realize significant business value. I also discussed the concept of an AI-first business process and the differentiation you can drive when bringing together the power of Copilots **_and_** human ambition with the autonomous capabilities of an agent. I was inspired by the outcomes our customers have achieved through pragmatic innovation and the progress they are making to evolve the future of industry. I am pleased to share ten stories from the past quarter that illustrate how Copilots have yielded results for our customers, while highlighting AI Transformation experiences in their own words.\n\n[**Accenture and Avanade**](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-US/case-studies/accenture-avanade-copilot) have a long history of helping customers implement cutting-edge solutions, with internal testing a key factor in their ability to deliver customizable Microsoft solutions with deep expertise. Putting Microsoft 365 Copilot into the hands of employees helped them realize ways to increase productivity, with **52% of employees seeing a positive impact on the quality of their work, 31% reporting less cognitive fatigue and 84% finding Copilot’s suggestions fair, respectful and non-biased**. Accenture also piloted GitHub Copilot to help build better solutions faster with developers spending less time debugging, **resulting in 95% of developers reporting they enjoyed coding more**.\n\n> _“Using our extensive Microsoft technology expertise and practical learnings from our own experience implementing Microsoft 365 Copilot, our solutions empower clients to fully tap into Microsoft AI capabilities.”_\n> \n> Veit Siegenheim, Global Future of Work Lead at Avanade\n\nNigerian multinational financial services group [**Access Holdings Plc.**](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1802756598954587083-access-holdings-plc-microsoft-365-banking-and-capital-markets-en-nigeria) serves more than 56 million customers across 18 countries. As the business grew and transitioned from a small bank to a major holding company, it adopted Microsoft 365 Copilot to address challenges in data management, meeting productivity and software development. With the integration of Copilot into daily tools, the company significantly enhanced efficiency and engagement across the business. **Writing code now takes two hours instead of eight, chatbots can be launched in 10 days instead of three months and presentations can be prepared in 45 minutes instead of six hours. Copilot has also driven a 25% increase in staff engagement during meetings.**\n\n> _“To inspire everyone in the organization to take advantage of AI, we knew we had to integrate AI into the tools people use every day. Microsoft 365 Copilot made the most sense and was a natural fit for us_ _.”_\n> \n> Lanre Bamisebi, Executive Director IT and Digitalization at Access Holdings, Plc.\n\nTo improve resident services and reinvent customer engagement, the [**City of Burlington**](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1817161013472137094-burlington-microsoft-copilot-studio-national-government-en-canada), Ontario, embraced AI and low-code tools to develop new online services that transform and automate internal processes. In just eight weeks, the city utilized Copilot Studio to develop and launch a custom copilot designed to help residents quickly find answers to frequently asked questions. The city also developed a portal that streamlines building permit reviews and enables customers to track the status of their own applications. As a result, **the average time it takes to process a permit approval decreased from 15 weeks to 5-7 weeks, allowing more time for city employees to evaluate complex submissions**.\n\n> _“Our staff and citizens do not have to worry about mundane tasks as much anymore. Now they’re able to have rich, collaborative conversations about how to creatively solve problems, making for a much more fulfilling and rewarding work and customer experience_.”\n> \n> Chad MacDonald, Executive Director and Chief Information Officer at the City of Burlington\n\n[**Finastra**](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1813696493334607461-finastra-microsoft-copilot-for-microsoft-365-professional-services-en-united-kingdom) empowers financial institutions with leading software for lending, payments, treasury, capital markets and universal banking. To transform its marketing processes, the company used Microsoft 365 Copilot to automate tasks, enhance content creation, improve analytics and personalize customer interactions. Since integrating Copilot, the team **reduced time-to-market for campaigns from three months to less than one**. Copilot also significantly reduced the time marketers spend generating and gathering insights from each campaign, with **employees citing a 20%-50% time savings across** tasks like full-funnel analysis, supply management analysis and budget management.\n\n> _“Copilot makes you more effective because you get better insights, and it makes you more efficient because you can produce results faster. It also makes work more meaningful and fun because your team can focus on what matters — strategy, creativity and everything that sets you apart from the competition.”_\n> \n> Joerg Klueckmann, Head of Corporate Marketing and Communications at Finastra\n\n[**GoTo Group**](https://news.microsoft.com/id-id/2024/09/10/goto-group-collaborates-with-microsoft-to-boost-engineering-productivity-with-github-copilot/) provides technology infrastructure and solutions across Indonesia. It is bending the curve on innovation by significantly enhancing productivity and code quality across its engineering teams by adopting GitHub Copilot. With real-time code suggestions, chat assistance and the ability to break down complex coding concepts, **the company has saved over seven hours per week and achieved a 30% code acceptance rate** within the first month. With 1,000 engineers already using GitHub Copilot, the tool allows them to innovate faster, reduce errors and focus more time on complex tasks to deliver greater value to their users.\n\n> _“GitHub Copilot has significantly reduced syntax errors and provided helpful autocomplete features, eliminating repetitive tasks and making coding more efficient. This has allowed me to focus on the more complex elements in building great software.”_\n> \n> Nayana Hodi, Engineering Manager at GoTo Group\n\nSouth Africa’s [**Milpark Education**](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1794371049083171324-milpark-education-dynamics-365-customer-service-higher-education-en-south-africa) faced operational challenges when shifting to online learning due to legacy systems slowing down student interactions and support. Through close collaboration with Enterprisecloud, Milpark migrated its back-office infrastructure to Azure within three months, replacing its legacy student admissions system with an extensible, integrated digital platform powered by technologies such as Microsoft Copilot and Copilot Studio. **In just four months, the educational institution improved efficiency and accuracy of student support, decreasing the average resolution time by 50% and escalations by more than 30%.**\n\n> _“Using Copilot, agents are now able to use generative AI to rapidly get up to speed on case details and respond to students using standardized templates that help them provide more personalized and professional responses. The results speak for themselves.”_\n> \n> Shaun Dale, Managing Director at Enterprisecloud\n\nFor over two decades, [**Teladoc Health**](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1805001416118108722-teladochealth-power-apps-health-provider-en-united-states) has been offering a broad spectrum of services to patients using virtual care services — from primary care to chronic condition management. After the rapid growth of telehealth adoption post-pandemic, operational efficiency was instrumental in managing internal processes and external client interactions. By deploying Microsoft 365 Copilot and using Copilot in Power Automate, the company has reshaped business processes to help employees realize greater time savings while enhancing the client experience. The Copilots and agents **helped employees save five hours per week and thousands of enterprise hours annually** by eliminating mundane daily processes and fostering better cross-department communications, while also**helping new employees get set up to run their workflows 20% faster.**\n\n> _“Copilot is changing the way we work. It’s not just about saving time; it’s about enhancing the quality of our work, allowing us to focus on what truly matters: delivering exceptional care to our members.”_\n> \n> Heather Underhill, SVP Client Experience & Operations at Teladoc Health\n\nInternational energy company [**Uniper**](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1802017730982552224-uniper-se-microsoft-copilot-for-microsoft-365-energy-en-germany) adopted a single-cloud strategy with Azure as its foundation to drive rapid AI innovation. To help its employees focus on using core competencies, the company implemented Microsoft 365 Copilot to reduce time spent on manual and repetitive tasks, and help workers focus on more pressing work, such as developing enhanced solutions to speed up the energy transition. Its in-house auditors have already **increased productivity by 80% by using Copilot** to create plans and checklists. **Uniper is also using Copilot for Security to help identify risks twice as fast** **and take appropriate action sooner**.\n\n> _“As an operator of critical infrastructure, we have to contend with a growing number of reports of phishing and attacks by hackers. AI can help us implement a sensible way of managing the sheer number of threats.”_\n> \n> Damian Bunyan, CIO at Uniper\n\nBritish telecommunications company [**V****odafone**](https://ukstories.microsoft.com/features/vodafone-to-roll-out-microsoft-365-copilot-to-68000-employees-to-boost-productivity-innovation-quality/) has transformed its workplace productivity with Microsoft 365 Copilot, already seeing strong ROI from its adoption. In early trials, Copilot saved employees an average of three hours per week by using the tool to draft emails, summarize meetings and search for information. Copilot is also enriching the employee experience, with **90% of users reporting they are eager to continue using Copilot and 60% citing improved work quality**. For Vodafone’s legal and compliance team, **Copilot has significantly accelerated the processes of drafting new contracts, reducing the time required to complete this work by one hour**. As a result of these efficiency gains, Vodafone is rolling out Copilot to 68,000 employees.\n\n> _“Our AI journey is focusing on three areas: operational efficiency inside the organization; rewiring the business to provide an enhanced customer experience; and unlocking growth opportunities through new products and services that we can create around generative AI. Copilot will help drive all three.”_\n> \n> Scott Petty, Chief Technology Officer at Vodafone\n\n[**Wallenius Wilhelmsen**](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1786814215980808594-wilh-wilhelmsen-microsoft-viva-goals-travel-and-transportation-en-norway), a global leader in roll-on/roll-off shipping and vehicle logistics, is empowering better decision-making while fostering a culture of innovation and inclusion with AI tools. After participating in an early access program, the company broadly adopted Microsoft Copilot 365 to help streamline processes, enhance data management and improve communication across its 28 countries. To help strengthen Copilot immersion and realize value faster, they introduced a seven-week Microsoft Viva campaign to teach, communicate and measure Copilot adoption. The campaign resulted in **80% of employees using Copilot, with some teams realizing time savings of at least 30 minutes per day**. The company also uses Copilot Dashboard to manage usage and gather user feedback, helping demonstrate ROI and measure results outside of time savings alone.\n\n> _“Copilot changes the way we think and work while keeping us curious and open to embracing opportunities. I think that is the sort of benefit that is not so measurable, but important. So, my time management and structured approach to my everyday work life has been enhanced with Copilot and Viva.”_\n> \n> Martin Hvatum, Senior Global Cash Manager at Wallenius Wilhelmsen\n\nI believe that no other company has a better foundation to facilitate your AI Transformation than Microsoft.

While the law itself does not specify a deadline for initial disclosures, the bill’s author has indicated that his intent was that the deadline for companies’ first annual disclosure under the law should be considered to be January 1, 2025. Microsoft is in the process of determining the scope of our potential reporting obligations under this law. We take our sustainability commitments and disclosure obligations seriously, and should we determine that we have reporting obligations under 1305, we will promptly determine the scope of those obligations and comply with those obligations no later than January 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nFollow Microsoft \n\n  * [ ![Facebook](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/image/microsoftcorp/Facebook%202x-1?scl=1) ](https://www.facebook.com/Microsoft)\n  * [ ![X \\(formerly Twitter\\)](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/image/microsoftcorp/Twitter-%20XCorp-black@2x-1?scl=1) ](https://www.twitter.com/Microsoft)\n  * [ ![LinkedIn](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/image/microsoftcorp/Linkedin%202x-1?scl=1) ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/microsoft)\n\n\n"
