(Nasdaq: MRM), which operates a health tech business, to two hotels under the ENT TERRACE brand. This initiative will launch on Friday, November 1st, under the theme “Circulation of Happiness through Energy of Travel.” \n\nMOTHER Bracelet ®︎ is a fitness tracker that does not require charging. Following the introduction, these trackers will be available free of charge to guests staying at the ENT TERRACE hotels. In addition to visualizing their own health condition, guests can earn energy points just by walking, which will then be automatically converted into cash to be donated by our hotels to organizations that are working to build and support the future of Japan. We believe this initiative offers a new style of travel, creating memorable experiences while contributing to a brighter tomorrow.\n\n**Activity details**\n\nThe trackers will first be introduced to two apartment hotel locations under the ENT TERRACE brand, with plans to gradually expand to other hotels under the ENT TERRACE brand. Guests will have the option to use a MOTHER Bracelet ®︎ during they stay, a stress-free device which does not require charging and can be worn in the shower. The hotel guests simply wear the device and enjoy their trip freely, and energy is accumulated based on the number of steps they take.\n\nIn addition to tracking steps, the device also measures sleep, body surface temperature, heart rate, and calories burned. This data is saved locally on hotel computers, and guests can check their vital data using a terminal installed at the front desk. This is a customer-participatory activity that visualizes the state of guests’ health and restfulness at our hotels. \n\nStart date: November 1st, 2024 (Friday) Facilities: ENT TERRACE ASAKUSA / ENT TERRACE AKIHABARA Details: Participating hotels will donate 50 yen for every 5,000 steps, up to a maximum of 100 yen per day, to organizations that are working to create and support the future of Japan. How to participate: The front desk staff will provide participate details upon check-in on how to use the MOTHER Bracelet. Information regarding data collection and usage will be provided, and guests will be asked to provide their consent to participate.

(“MOTHER Labs”), a subsidiary of MEDIROM Healthcare Technologies Inc. (Nasdaq: MRM), which operates a health tech business. \n\n**Background of the Business Alliance**\n\nLRE develops and operates the ENT TERRACE brand of extended-stay hotels, offering the “stay like living” concept designed to provide guests with a personalized, home-like experience tailored to each guest.\n\nAccording to a report by the Japan National Tourism Organization, Japan’s tourism industry is accelerating, partially driven by the weaker yen, which is attracting a growing number of international travelers. Compared to June 2023, the number of foreign tourists visiting Japan in June 2024 increased by 51.2% year-on-year and by 8.9% compared with pre-pandemic June 2019, reaching a record high of approximately 3.13 million travelers in June 2024. To cater to this growing market, LRE has been offering its ENT TERRACE hotel guests unique Japanese experiences and services. \n\nMOTHER Labs focuses on the development and sales of MOTHER Bracelet®, a fitness tracker that requires no electric charging, as it utilizes innovative technology such as Gemini TEG (Thermoelectric Generator) and Mercury Boost Converter to enable the user’s body heat to generate electricity. MRM’s product line also includes other fitness apps and wellness products that synchronize with MOTHER Bracelet® and its technology platforms, allowing for a health management experience. Through its retail salon brands, including Re.Ra.Ku®, MRM has established a growing healthtech segment aimed at improving health outcomes and satisfaction for its customers. \n\nThe collaboration between LRE and MOTHER Labs is built on a shared mission to “create an exciting cycle of happiness through business.” Through this business alliance, MOTHER Bracelet® will be gradually installed to all ENT TERRACE hotels. By utilizing the MOTHER Bracelet®, a stress-free device that is lightweight, does not require charging, and can be worn in the shower, guests can visualize their health status with ease. By incorporating the MOTHER Bracelet® and its features, we aim to provide our future customers with a “cycle of happiness” connected by compassion.\n\nThe introduction of the system is scheduled to start in November 2024 at ENT TERRACE ASAKUSA and ENT TERRACE AKIHABARA in Tokyo.\n\n**Mother Bracelet®, a smart tracker that does not require charging**\n\n![](http://ent-terrace.com/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/10/MOTHER_リリース素材-5-300x169.jpg)\n\nMOTHER Bracelet® is the world’s first activity tracker that does not require charging 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.2 The device is equipped with cutting-edge technology from Silicon Valley, U.S.A., that generates electricity from the difference between body temperature and the outside temperature.

Announced A Special Dividend Recently Has Been Making Moves Toward US Expansion\n\nby [Anthony Termini](/author/anthony-termini)[](https://twitter.com/benzinga)\n\nAugust 12, 2024 8:15 AM |  4 min read  | Make a Comment\n\n## Start generating passive income through real estate.\n\nOwn a piece of your favorite cities through diversified [real estate investments in the country's top

Nada's website](https://benzingapartners.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=279&aff_id=1) for more details. _\n\nAmerican investors love stories about real estate developers – like Trammell Crow, the Toll brothers and Eli Broad – who grew their small real estate businesses into huge public companies. Their style of entrepreneurialism is often thought to be uniquely American.\n\nSo, it may surprise some investors that a similar story could currently be playing out in Japan. Even more interesting is that this growing developer, with operations in Dallas, Texas, and Los Angeles, California, is led by a former jazz musician who once played riffs on the same stage as Skip Martin from Cool and The Gang.\n\n## Company Humble Beginnings Helped It Grow To Build Elegant Accommodations\n\n**Lead Real Estate Co.** LRE was founded in 2001 by Eiji Nagahara, its current President and Chief Executive Officer, as an independent real estate developer. Nagahara started the company with just $20,000 in initial capital. Last year, Lead Real Estate generated about $120 million in revenue.\n\nThe company operates hotels and leases apartment buildings internationally. Its projects include luxury residential properties, condominiums and single-family homes across Tokyo, Kanagawa prefecture and Sapporo.\n\nLead Real Estate's vision is to leverage its reputation in Japan to create a global transaction platform to provide access to prime properties in Japan, the U.S., Hong Kong and the Philippines.\n\n## Lead Real Estate Is Expanding Investor Outreach And Its Luxury Brand\n\nIn June, Lead Real Estate participated in the “NASDAQ JAPAN IR EVENT” at Nasdaq Headquarters in New York. The event helped to introduce the company to new investors and media representatives. Lead Real Estate used the forum to showcase its operating and financial strengths and to demonstrate its investment appeal to a broader global audience.\n\nAbout the event, Mr. Nagahara shared that \"to be a challenger in the global market, sharing the appeal of Japanese companies to investors around the world is necessary.\"\n\nDays after the NASDAQ event, Lead Real Estate announced that it would soon be breaking ground on a new luxury hotel in the fashionable Ginza district in Tokyo. Branded under Lead Real Estate's premium series, ENT TERRACE, the GINZA PREMIUM is scheduled for completion in December 2024.\n\nThe ENT TERRACE GINZA PREMIUM hotel will feature seven floors and six guest rooms, catering to both short-term and long-term stays. The highly sought-after location is two minutes from Higashi-Ginza Station on the Toei Asakusa Line.\n\nLead Real Estate expects the new Ginza property to feature the same amenities as its sister property, the ENT TERRACE AKIHABARA. Located in Akihabara, the hotel was a recipient of the \"[Traveller Review Awards 2024](https://ent-terrace.com/en/news-blog/101/)\" sponsored by reservation website [Booking.com](http://booking.com).\n\nNow in its 12th year, the Traveller Review Awards are based on more than 300 million guest reviews. The awards go to hotels that provide consistency of excellence as they are based on reviews received in the previous three years.\n\nAbout the award, Lead Real Estate said, \"We are committed to providing hospitality to make every moment of [our] guests' travel special and will continue to provide a variety of services and travel assistance to ensure [their] satisfaction.\"\n\n## Building For Its Future And Creating Value For Current Shareholders\n\nLead Real Estate made two significant financial announcements in June. The first was a business alliance agreement with Tokyo-based Samurai Capital Co., Ltd.\n\nSamurai is a diversified real estate investor. The deal with Lead is worth about $26 million and was structured as a trust beneficiary interest purchase agreement. Such agreements in Japan are essentially[ secured financing arrangements](https://www.nishimura.com/sites/default/files/images/The_Real_Estate_Law_Review3_Japan.pdf).\n\nIn addition, Lead Real Estate announced a special cash dividend for shareholders of record on June 30, 2024. The company's board will determine the exact rate of the payout at the annual general meeting in September 2024. Once approved, the dividend is scheduled to be paid on September 30, 2024.\n\nFeatured photo by[ Pharaoh EZYPT](https://pixabay.com/users/pharaoh_ezypt-3065661/) from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/photos/tokyo-tower-tokyo-japan-tower-5664846/).\n\n_This post contains sponsored content.
