Additionally, enterprises will benefit from an accelerated networking set up time in a branch office or remote site.\n  * **AI-Driven Dynamic Policy Framework for Application Prioritization:** New applications will be automatically assigned business priorities, streamlining network management, and assuring critical applications get the necessary attention without manual intervention. Dynamic Application-Based Slicing, or DABS, that assures quality of experience (QoE) per application across multiple disparate underlying networks, whether they support network layer slicing or not. DABS includes the addition of user profiles, allowing traffic prioritization based on a user’s identity and attributes. This will help ensure that key users receive the QoE they need, enhancing overall performance and user experience. In addition, the policy framework will be able to utilize the user identity to further prioritize traffic.\n\n\n\nThese latest innovations in AI-driven networking enabled by VeloRAIN will deliver unprecedented visibility, prioritization, and automation for enterprise networks—allowing organizations to operate more efficiently and deliver superior user experiences.\n\n**New VeloCloud Edge Appliances Maximize Performance, Resiliency and Support Workloads at Scale** Today, Broadcom unveiled the new VeloCloud Edge 4100 and 5100 appliances. Designed for large branch sites, regional hubs, and data centers, the VeloCloud Edge 4100 and 5100 appliances will offer a rich set of SD-WAN, security, and AI networking capabilities to help enterprises support their most demanding environments:\n\n  * The VeloCloud Edge 4100 appliance will offer up to 30 Gbps throughput but can connect up to 12,000 tunnels—up to a 300% improvement in performance and scalability over its predecessors (3400 & 3800/3810). (4)\n  * The VeloCloud Edge 5100 appliance will offer up to 100 Gbps throughput and can connect up to 20,000 tunnels—introducing a net-new entry for super high-performance, and scalable deployments\n\n\n\nThe VeloCloud Edge 4100 and 5100 appliances will simplify the network architecture by requiring the deployment of fewer devices to scale network and security services to support growing business needs. These platforms will support clustering technology to scale beyond 100 Gbps with ultra-low latency as needed. In addition, the appliances will deliver robust resilience and fast failover using VeloCloud’s proven technology in the enterprise to help customers better support edge AI and non-AI workloads at scale.

The Titan partner program is built for MSPs and introduces three tiers (Pinnacle, Premier, and Registered) with benefits designed to help partners grow their businesses through these key elements:\n\n  * Performance-based rewards, including joint solution development, market recognition, and stable and predictable business growth.\n  * Exclusive access to innovative technology and routes to market.\n  * New licensing model allows for portability of licenses, simplicity of management, and price stability.\n  * Service creation program focused on core value drivers, vertical alignment, and higher margins.\n  * New ‘White label’ offering to allow our top tier partners to grow their VeloCloud base through regional and specialized channel partners.\n\n\n\nPartners will deliver the VeloCloud SD-WAN portfolio as managed services to a broad set of enterprise customers globally. Partners can deliver innovative services to their end users by establishing or expanding their wide area network practice by leveraging the proven VeloCloud portfolio. Customers will benefit from the expertise, value, and resilience of partners to better support their highly distributed, latency-sensitive workloads, applications, and devices at the edge. Additionally, customers will gain from new VeloRAIN enhancements to the VeloCloud product portfolio—providing the requisite connectivity, deployment, runtime, and lifecycle management capabilities to support customers’ AI and non-AI workloads at the edge.\n\n**“State of the Edge” Report Reveals Momentum of AI Workloads at the Edge** According to new research by Broadcom, the driving factor for the adoption of edge solutions and AI workloads at the distributed edge is network connectivity issues across locations (57%). And when organizations implement these edge solutions, the top benefit they plan to achieve is faster response times for latency-sensitive applications (68%) and improved bandwidth/reduced network congestion (65%). By providing faster bandwidth and more reliable connections at the edge, enterprises can more efficiently process data leading to faster, smarter decision-making and further encourage edge and AI workload deployments. This “State of the Edge” report is based on VeloCloud Edge telemetry and a survey of 192 respondents across North America, South America, Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. Broadcom conducted the survey in September and October of 2024.

We see tremendous value in the new Broadcom Advantage Partner Program for VeloCloud Titan Partners, specifically through partner exclusivity, the license pooling model, and the comprehensive service creation partnership. We look forward to continuing our collaborative partnership and empowering even more businesses in the future.” – _Art Nichols , CTO, Windstream Enterprise_\n\n“For the better part of this decade, a focus on the edge has been on the horizon for most companies. However, recently, the adoption of AI and AI workloads have acted as an accelerant, shifting interest into proof of concepts and more deployments at the edge. One of the challenges to increased AI workload adoption is complexity and performance as businesses need to ensure the right technology is deployed in the right places. The new edge appliances announced by Broadcom are ideally suited as large enterprises can deploy what they need today but then scale it up as the demands change. The new partner program further simplifies deployment as it enables service partners to customize their offerings for different types of customers.” - _Zeus Kerravala , Founder and Principal Analyst, ZK Research_\n\n**About Broadcom** Broadcom Inc.
