See accompanying discussion and reconciliation tables provided in this release for reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the closest corresponding GAAP financial measures.  \n---|---  \n_2_ | _Represents $23.2 million of non-cash pension settlement costs, $11.9 million of expense related to the closure of our Charlotte, NC factory and $3.8 million of Monterrey MX start-up costs, which are taxed at a 24.6% tax rate._  \n_3_ | The Company has not reconciled the Adjusted EPS and Net Leverage Ratio guidance to the most comparable GAAP financial measure outlook because it is not possible to do so without unreasonable efforts due to the uncertainty and potential variability of reconciling items, which are dependent on future events and often outside of management's control and which could be significant. Because such items cannot be reasonably predicted with the level of precision required, we are unable to provide guidance for the comparable GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking guidance regarding Adjusted EPS and Net Leverage Ratio is made in a manner consistent with the relevant definitions and assumptions noted herein and in alignment with the Company's financial covenants per the Company's Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.  \n  \n**_About Columbus McKinnon_**\n\nColumbus McKinnon is a leading worldwide designer, manufacturer and marketer of intelligent motion solutions that move the world forward and improve lives by efficiently and ergonomically moving, lifting, positioning, and securing materials.

Such forward-looking statements are generally identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,”\n“could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “illustrative,” “intend,” “likely,” “may,” “opportunity,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “shall,” “should,” “target,” “will,” “would” and, in\neach case, their negative or other various or comparable terminology. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this document, including, but are not\nlimited to, statements relating to: (i) our strategy, outlook and growth prospects and our full year and second quarter fiscal 2025 guidance; (ii) our operational and financial\ntargets and capital distribution policy; (iii) general economic trend and trends in the industry and markets; (iv) the amount of debt to be paid down by the Company during fiscal\n2025; and (v) the competitive environment in which we operate, are forward looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts, but instead\nrepresent our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties\nand other factors that could cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements\nexpressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risks. These risks include, but are not limited to, the risk factors that are\ndescribed under the section titled “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 as well as in our other filings with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission, which are available on its website at www.sec.gov. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking\nstatements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Columbus McKinnon undertakes no duty to update publicly any such forward-looking\nstatement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by applicable law, regulation or other competent legal authority.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Forward-looking Non-GAAP Measures\nThis presentation will discuss some non-GAAP (“adjusted”) financial measures which we believe are useful in evaluating our performance. You should not consider the\npresentation of this additional information in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP measures are noted and reconciliations\nof comparable GAAP with non-GAAP measures can be found in tables included in the Supplemental Information portion of this presentation.\nUse of Forward-looking Non-GAAP Financial Metrics\nThis presentation presents forward-looking statements regarding non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA margin. The Company is unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of these\nforward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures because such information is not available, and\nmanagement cannot reliably predict the necessary components of such GAAP measures without unreasonable effort or expense. In addition, the Company believes that such\nreconciliations would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on the\nCompany’s financial results. These non-GAAP financial measures are preliminary estimates and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, among others, changes in\nconnection with post-closing adjustments and the factors described above. Any variation between the Company’s actual results and preliminary financial data described in this\npresentation may be material.\n2\n© 2024 COLUMBUS MCKINNON CORPORATION\nGlobal Leader in

Because such\nitems cannot be reasonably predicted with the level of precision required, we are unable to provide guidance for the comparable GAAP financial\nmeasures.

Credit Agreement Trailing Twelve Month Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income adjusted for\ninterest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, and other adjustments. Net Debt, Net Leverage Ratio\nand Credit Agreement Trailing Twelve Month Adjusted EBITDA are not measures determined in accordance with\nGAAP and may not be comparable with the measures as used by other companies. Nevertheless, the Company\nbelieves that providing non-GAAP financial measures, such as Net Debt, Net Leverage Ratio and Credit Agreement\nTrailing Twelve Month Adjusted EBITDA are important for investors and other readers of the Company’s financial\nstatements.\n15"

Because such items cannot be\nreasonably predicted with the level of precision required, we are unable to provide guidance for the comparable GAAP financial measures.\nForward-looking guidance regarding Adjusted EPS and Net Leverage Ratio for fiscal 2025 is made in a manner consistent with the relevant\ndefinitions and assumptions noted herein.
