SUMMARY OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nReliance Global Group, Inc., formerly known as Ethos Media Network, Inc. (\"RELI”, \"Reliance”, or the \"Company”), was incorporated in Florida on August 2, 2013.\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States\nof America (\"U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions for Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the\ninformation and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of recurring accruals) necessary for\na fair presentation have been included. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial\nstatements and the notes thereto, set forth in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the \"Form 10-K”), as the same may be amended\nfrom time to time. Capitalized terms not defined in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q refer to capitalized terms as defined in the Form 10-K. Certain prior period accounts and\nbalances in these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto may have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany\ntransactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nLiquidity\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company’s reported cash and restricted cash aggregated balance was approximately $2,354,000, current assets were approximately $3,835,000, and\ncurrent liabilities were approximately $3,404,000. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had working capital of approximately $431,000 and stockholders’ equity of approximately\n$2,821,000. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a loss from operations of approximately $6,690,000 and net loss of approximately $7,673,000, which\ninclude a non-cash asset impairment loss of approximately $3,922,000. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the\n\"ATM Agreement”) with EF Hutton LLC (the \"Agent”), pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, through the Agent, shares of its common stock\nhaving an approximate aggregate remaining offering price of up to $902,000 as of the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nAlthough there can be no assurance that debt or equity financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, the Company believes its financial position and its ability to raise\ncapital to be reasonable and sufficient. Based on our assessment, we do not believe there are conditions or events that, in the aggregate, raise substantial doubt about the\nCompany’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of filing these unaudited financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC”).\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on\nassumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE\nBasic earnings per common share (\"EPS”) applicable to common stockholders is computed by dividing earnings applicable to common stockholders by the weighted-average\nnumber of common shares outstanding.\nIf there is a loss from operations, diluted EPS is computed in the same manner as basic EPS is computed. Similarly, if the Company has net income but its preferred dividend\nadjustment made in computing income available to common stockholders results in a net loss available to common stockholders, diluted EPS would be computed in the same\nmanner as basic EPS.\n15\nThe following calculates basic and diluted EPS from continuing operations:\nThree Months Ended Three Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nLoss from continuing operations $ (837,314) $ (139,004)\nNet loss continuing operations, numerator, basic computation (837,314) $ (139,004)\nRecognition and change in fair value of warrant liabilities - -\nNet loss from continuing operations, numerator, diluted computation $ (837,314) $ (139,004)\nWeighted average common shares, basic 1,252,799 177,733\nEffect of Series B Warrants - -\nWeighted average common shares, dilutive 1,252,799 177,733\nLoss per common share – basic $ (0.67) $ (0.78)\nLoss per common share – diluted $ (0.67) $ (0.78)\nNine Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nLoss from continuing operations $ (7,673,373) $ (1,136,922)\nNet Loss continuing operations, numerator, basic computation (7,673,373) $ (1,136,922)\nRecognition and change in fair value of warrant liabilities - -\nNet loss from continuing operations, numerator, diluted computation $ (7,673,373) $ (1,136,922)\nWeighted average common shares, basic 726,347 143,295\nEffect of Series B Warrants - -\nWeighted average common shares, dilutive 726,347 143,295\nLoss per common share – basic $ (10.56) $ (7.93)\nLoss per common share – diluted $ (10.56) $ (7.93)\nAdditionally, the following are considered anti-dilutive securities excluded from weighted-average shares used to calculate diluted net loss per common share:\nFor the Three and Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nShares subject to outstanding common stock options 50 606\nShares subject to outstanding Series A warrants 6,647 6,647\nShares subject to outstanding Series B warrants - 69,586\nShares subject to outstanding Series E warrants - 52,211\nShares subject to outstanding PAW’s 959 -\nShares subject to outstanding Series F warrants - 123,839\nShares subject to PA Warrants 3,096 3,096\nShares subject to unvested stock awards 52 339\n16\nNOTE 7.

In satisfaction of such remaining balance, the Company agreed to issue 10,272 shares of the Company’s restricted\ncommon stock, par value $0.086 per share (the \"Common Stock”), to the Holder. The First Amendment also stated that if the Nasdaq official closing price of the Common Stock is\nless than $41.31 on March 29, 2024 (the \"Calculation Date”), then a determination of the Make-Up Amount (as defined herein) will be made. The \"Make-Up Amount” means\n$425,000 minus the Blockey Shares Value (10,272 multiplied by the Nasdaq official closing price of the Common Stock on the Calculation Date).

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nReliance Global Group, Inc. (the \"Company”) operates as a diversified company engaging in business in the insurance market, as well as other related sectors. Our focus is to grow\nthe Company by pursuing an aggressive acquisition strategy, initially and primarily focused upon wholesale and retail insurance agencies.\nIn the insurance sector, our management has extensive experience acquiring and managing insurance portfolios in several states, as well as developing specialized programs\ntargeting niche markets. Our primary strategy is to identify specific risk to reward arbitrage opportunities and develop these on a national platform, thereby increasing revenues\nand returns, and then identify and acquire undervalued wholesale and retail insurance agencies with operations in growing or underserved segments, expand and optimize their\noperations, and achieve asset value appreciation while generating interim cash flows.\nAs part of our growth and acquisition strategy, we continue to survey the current insurance market for value-add acquisition opportunities. As of September 30, 2024, we had\nacquired nine insurance agencies.\nOver the next 12 months, we plan to focus on the expansion and growth of our business through continued asset acquisitions in insurance markets and organic growth of our\ncurrent insurance operations through geographic expansion and market share growth. To that end, on May 14, 2024, the Company entered into a Stock Exchange Agreement (the\n\"Stock Exchange Agreement”) to acquire Spetner Associates (\"Spetner”), a well-established benefits enrollment company that, through its BenManage benefits enrollment\ncompany, is a leading provider of voluntary benefits to over 75,000 employees throughout the United States. Pursuant to the Stock Exchange Agreement, the Company agreed to:\n(i) acquire 80% of Spetner’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share (the \"Spetner Common Stock”) for $13,714,286 (which amount was to be\npaid as $5,500,000 in cash, the issuance of certain shares of the Company’s common stock, and the Company’s issuance of a promissory note); and (ii) have the sole option to\nacquire the remaining 20% of the Spetner Common Stock for a predetermined amount based on a multiple of EBITDA\nFurther, we launched our 5MinuteInsure.com (\"5MI”) Insurtech platform during 2021, which expanded our national footprint. 5MI is a high-tech proprietary tool developed by us\nas a business to consumer portal which enables consumers to instantly compare quotes from multiple carriers and purchase their car and home insurance in a time efficient and\neffective manner. 5MI taps into the growing number of online shoppers and utilizes advanced artificial intelligence and data mining techniques, to provide competitive insurance\nquotes in around 5 minutes with minimal data input needed from the consumer. The platform currently operates in 46 states offering coverage with up to 30 highly rated insurance\ncarriers.\nWith the acquisition of Barra, we launched RELI Exchange, our business-to-business (\"B2B”) InsurTech platform and agency partner network that builds on the artificial\nintelligence and data mining backbone of 5MinuteInsure.com. Through RELI Exchange we on-board agency partners and provide them with an InsurTech platform white labeled,\ndesigned and branded specifically for their business. This combines the best of digital and human capabilities by providing our agency partners and their customers quotes from\nmultiple carriers within minutes. Since its inception, RELI Exchange has increased its agent roster by more than 130%.\nBusiness Operations\nWe’ve adopted a \"OneFirm” strategy, pursuant to which Company owned and operated agencies come together to operate as one cohesive unit, which allows for efficient and\neffective cross-selling, cross-collaboration, and the effective deployment of the Company’s human capital. This strategy also aims to enhance the Company’s overall market\npresence across the U.S., with all business lines operating under the RELI Exchange brand. It’s expected to benefit agents and clients by improving relationships with carriers,\nleading to better commission and bonus contracts due to higher business volumes. The approach also strengthens the capability of RELI Exchange agency partners in securing\ndiverse insurance policies and fosters increased cross-selling opportunities. This unified strategy positions the Company for rapid scaling and integration of accretive\nacquisitions, expanding its industry reach.\n20\nBusiness Trends and Uncertainties\nThe insurance intermediary business is highly competitive, and we actively compete with numerous firms for customers and insurance companies, many of which have\nrelationships with insurance companies, or have a significant presence in niche insurance markets that may give them an advantage over us. Other competitive concerns may\ninclude the quality of our products and services, our pricing and the ability of some of our customers to self-insure and the entrance of technology companies into the insurance\nintermediary business. Several insurance companies are engaged in the direct sale of insurance, primarily to individuals, and do not pay commissions to agents and brokers.\nFinancial Instruments\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company’s financial instruments consisted of derivative warrants. These were accounted for at fair value as of\ninception/issuance date, and at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. Any change in fair value was recorded as non-operating, (non-cash) gain or loss. As of June\n18, 2024, the majority of the derivative warrants were exercised and as of September 30, 2024 only a nominal immaterial amount remain outstanding.\nInsurance Operations\nOur insurance operations focus on the acquisition and management of insurance agencies throughout the U.S. Our primary focus is to pinpoint undervalued wholesale and retail\ninsurance agencies with operations in growing or underserved segments (including healthcare and Medicare, as well as personal and commercial insurance lines). We then focus\non expanding their operations on a national platform and improving operational efficiencies to achieve asset value appreciation while generating interim cash flows. In the\ninsurance sector, our management team has over 100 years of experience acquiring and managing insurance portfolios in several states, as well as developing specialized programs\ntargeting niche markets. We plan to accomplish these objectives by acquiring wholesale and retail insurance agencies it deems to represent a good buying opportunity (as\nopposed to insurance carriers) as insurance agencies bear no insurance risk. Once acquired, we plan to develop them on a national platform to increase revenues and profits\nthrough a synergetic structure. The Company is initially focused on segments that are underserved or growing, including healthcare and Medicare, as well as personal and\ncommercial insurance lines.\nInsurance Acquisitions and Strategic Activities\nAs of September 30, 2024, we have acquired multiple insurance brokerages (see table below). As our acquisition strategy continues, our reach within the insurance arena can\nprovide us with the ability to offer lower rates, which could boost our competitive position within the industry. In furtherance of this strategy, on May 14, 2024, the Company\nentered into a Stock Exchange Agreement to acquire Spetner Associates (\"Spetner”) for cash, stock and issuance of a promissory note. Spetner is a well-established benefits\nenrollment company that, through its BenManage benefits enrollment company, is a leading provider of voluntary benefits to over 75,000 employees throughout the United States.\nCompletion of the transaction is subject to standard and stipulated closing.\n21\nReliance 100%\nAcquired Controlled Entity Date Location Line of Business\nU.S. Benefits Alliance, LLC (USBA) US Benefits Alliance, LLC October 24, 2018 Michigan Health Insurance\nEmployee Benefit Solutions, LLC (EBS) Employee Benefits Solutions, LLC October 24, 2018 Michigan Health Insurance\nCommercial Solutions of Insurance Agency, LLC (CCS or Commercial Coverage Solutions LLC P&C – Trucking\nCommercial Solutions) December 1, 2018 New Jersey Industry\nSouthwestern Montana Insurance Center, Inc.

The par value remained\nunchanged. All share and per share information, as well as common stock and additional paid-in capital, have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Reverse Split-2024 for all\nperiods presented, unless otherwise indicated. The Reverse Split-2024 resulted in a rounding addition of approximately 110,350 shares valued at par, totaling $9,490 for which\nshares were issued in July 2024.\n22\nNon-GAAP Measure\nThe Company believes certain financial measures which meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures, as defined in Regulation G of the SEC rules, provide important\nsupplemental information. Adjusted EBITDA (\"AEBITDA”), our key financial performance metric, is a non-GAAP financial measure that is not in accordance with, or an alternative\nto, measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP”). \"AEBITDA” is defined as earnings before interest,\ntaxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) with additional adjustments as further outlined below. The Company considers AEBITDA an important financial metric because it\nprovides a meaningful financial measure of the quality of the Company’s operational, cash impacted and recurring earnings and operating performance across reporting periods.\nOther companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, which might limit its usefulness as a comparative measure to other companies in the industry. AEBITDA\nis used by management in addition to and in conjunction (and not as a substitute) with the results presented in accordance with GAAP. Management uses AEBITDA to evaluate\nthe Company’s operational performance, including earnings across reporting periods and the merits for implementing cost-cutting measures. We have presented AEBITDA solely\nas supplemental disclosure because we believe it allows for a more complete analysis of results of operations and assists investors and analysts in comparing our operating\nperformance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Consistent with Regulation\nG, a description of such information is provided below herein and tabular reconciliations of this supplemental non-GAAP financial information to our most comparable GAAP\ninformation are contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under \"Results of Operations”.\nWe exclude the following items when calculating AEBITDA, and the following items define our non-GAAP financial measure AEBITDA:\n● Interest and related party interest expense: Unrelated to core Company operations and excluded to provide more meaningful supplemental information regarding the\nCompany’s core operational performance.\n● Depreciation and amortization: Non-cash charge, excluded to provide more meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s core operational performance.\n● Goodwill and/or asset impairments: Non-cash charge, excluded to provide more meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s core operational\nperformance.\n● Equity-based compensation: Non-cash compensation provided to employees and service providers, excluded to provide more meaningful supplemental information\nregarding the Company’s core cash impacted operational performance.\n● Change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables: An earn-out liability is a liability to the seller upon an acquisition which is contingent on future earnings. These\nliabilities are valued at each reporting period and the changes are reported as either a gain or loss in the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables account in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. The gain or loss is non-cash, can be highly volatile and overall is not deemed relevant to ongoing operations, thus, it’s excluded to\nprovide more meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s core operational performance.\n● Recognition and change in fair value of warrant liabilities: This account includes changes to derivative warrant liabilities which are valued at each reporting period and\ncould result in either a gain or loss. The period changes do not impact cash, can be highly volatile, and are unrelated to ongoing operations, and thus are excluded to\nprovide more meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s core operational performance.\n● Other income (expense), net: Includes non-routine income or expenses and other individually de minimis items and is thus excluded as unrelated to core operations of the\ncompany.\n● Transactional costs: This includes expenses related to mergers, acquisitions, financings and refinancings, and amendments or modification to indebtedness. These costs\nare unrelated to primary Company operations and are excluded to provide more meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s core operational\nperformance.\n● Non-recuring costs: This account includes non-recurring non-operational items, related to costs incurred for a legal suit the Company has filed against one of the third\nparties involved in the discontinued operations and was excluded to provide more meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s core operational\nperformance.\n● Loss from discontinued operations before tax: This account includes the net results from discontinued operations, and since discontinued, are unrelated to the\nCompany’s ongoing operations and thus excluded to provide more meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s core operational performance.\nRefer to the reconciliation of net (loss) income to AEBITDA, illustrated below in tabular format.\n23\nResults of Operations\nRELIANCE GLOBAL GROUP, INC.

While the outcome of these claims cannot be\npredicted with certainty, management does not believe the outcome of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of\noperations, or cash flows, and accordingly, no legal contingencies are accrued as of September 30, 2024. Litigation relating to the insurance brokerage industry is not uncommon.\nAs such we, from time to time have been, subject to such litigation. No assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any such litigation in the future.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the information disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors,” contained in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as the same may be updated from time to time. As a smaller reporting company, the Company is not required to disclose\nmaterial changes to the risk factors that were contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as updated from time to time.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nNone.\n29\nItem 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.\nNot applicable.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\nItem 5.

SUMMARY OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nReliance Global Group, Inc., formerly known as Ethos Media Network, Inc. (\"RELI”, \"Reliance”, or the \"Company”), was incorporated in Florida on August 2, 2013.\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States\nof America (\"U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions for Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the\ninformation and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of recurring accruals) necessary for\na fair presentation have been included. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial\nstatements and the notes thereto, set forth in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the \"Form 10-K”), as the same may be amended\nfrom time to time. Capitalized terms not defined in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q refer to capitalized terms as defined in the Form 10-K. Certain prior period accounts and\nbalances in these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany\ntransactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nLiquidity\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company’s reported cash and restricted cash aggregated balance was approximately $2,816,000, current assets were approximately $4,322,000, and current\nliabilities were approximately $3,722,000. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had working capital of approximately $600,000 and stockholders’ equity of approximately $2,889,000. For\nthe six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company had a loss from operations of approximately $6,178,000, which includes a non-cash asset impairment loss of approximately\n$3,922,000, and net loss of approximately $6,836,000. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the \"ATM Agreement”)\nwith EF Hutton LLC (the \"Agent”), pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, through the Agent, shares of its common stock having an approximate\naggregate remaining offering price of up to $1,728,825 as of the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nAlthough there can be no assurance that debt or equity financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, the Company believes its financial position and its ability to raise\ncapital to be reasonable and sufficient. Based on our assessment, we do not believe there are conditions or events that, in the aggregate, raise substantial doubt about the\nCompany’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of filing these unaudited financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC”).\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on\nassumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\n8\nCash and Restricted Cash\nCash and restricted cash reported on our condensed consolidated balance sheets are reconciled to the total shown on our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows as\nfollows:\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023\nCash $ 1,405,824 $ 1,274,743\nRestricted cash 1,409,787 1,405,513\nTotal cash and restricted cash $ 2,815,611 $ 2,680,256\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nLevel 1 — Observable inputs reflecting quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;\nLevel 2 — Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the\nasset or liability; and\nLevel 3 — Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which include management’s own assumption about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or\nliability, including assumptions about risk.\nWarrant Liabilities: The Company re-measures the fair value of its material Level 3 warrant liabilities at the balance sheet date, or at interim dates as applicable for warrant exercise\ntransactions that may occur, using a binomial option pricing model. The following summarizes the significant unobservable inputs for valuations occurring during the periods\nended:\nJune 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nStock price $ 3.74 $ 9.18\nVolatility 135.00% 110.00%\nTime to expiry 4.53 4.99\nDividend yield 0% 0%\nRisk free rate 4.30% 3.80%\nThe following reconciles fair value of the liability classified warrants:\nSeries B\nWarrant Placement\nLiabilities Agent Warrants Total\nBeginning balance, December 31, 2023 $ 268,667 $ 326 $ 268,993\nUnrealized gain (95,333) - (95,333)\nWarrants exercised or exchanged - - -\nEnding balance, March 31, 2024 $ 173,334 $ 326 $ 173,660\nUnrealized gain (60,667) - (60,667)\nWarrants exercised or exchanged (112,667) - (112,667)\nEnding balance, June 30, 2024 $ - $ 326 $ 326\nEarn-out liabilities: The Company utilizes two valuation methods to value its Level 3 earn-out liabilities: (a) the income valuation approach, and (b) the Monte Carlo simulation\nmethod. Key valuation and unobservable inputs for the income valuation approach include contingent payment arrangement terms, projected revenues and cash flows, rates of\nreturn, discount rates and probability assessments.\n9\nThe following table summarizes the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements:\nJune 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nValuation technique N/A Discounted cash flow\nProjected revenue and probability of\nSignificant unobservable input N/A achievement\nThe Company values its Level 3 earn-out liability related to the Barra Acquisition using a Monte Carlo simulation in a risk-neutral framework (a special case of the Income\nApproach).

The loss of any\nsignificant customer could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recorded no income tax expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 because the estimated annual effective tax rate was zero. In determining\nthe estimated annual effective income tax rate, the Company analyzes various factors, including projections of the Company’s annual earnings and taxing jurisdictions in which the\nearnings will be generated, the impact of state and local income taxes, the ability to use tax credits and net operating loss carry forwards, and available tax planning alternatives.\nAs of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets, since the Company believes it is more likely than\nnot that its deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nWe do not expect any recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material effect on our financial statements not already disclosed in the Form 10-K.\nNOTE 2.

These intangible assets consisted of customer relationships, and internally\ndeveloped and purchased software, with respective net of accumulated amortization asset values of $3,802,438, $65,411, and $54,261. The write-offs resulted in a total asset\nimpairment charge of $3,922,110, recorded in the asset impairment account on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the six-month period ended June\n30, 2024.\n11\nThe following table sets forth the major categories of the Company’s intangible assets and the weighted-average remaining amortization period as of June 30, 2024:\nWeighted\nAverage Remaining\nAmortization\nPeriod Gross Accumulated Net Carrying\n(Years) Carrying Amount Amortization Amount\nTrade name and trademarks 1.0 $ 1,807,188 $ (1,487,205) $ 319,983\nInternally developed software 2.7 1,698,186 (773,371) 924,815\nCustomer relationships 6.3 7,372,290 (2,813,315) 4,558,975\nPurchased software 2.0 564,396 (563,074) 1,322\nVideo production assets - 50,000 (50,000) -\nNon-competition agreements 0.4 3,504,810 (3,157,153) 347,657\n$ 14,996,870 $ (8,844,118) $ 6,152,752\nThe following table sets forth the major categories of the Company’s intangible assets and the weighted-average remaining amortization period as of December 31, 2023:\nWeighted\nAverage Remaining\nAmortization\nperiod Gross Accumulated Net Carrying\n(Years) Carrying Amount Amortization Amount\nTrade name and trademarks 1.5 $ 1,807,189 $ (1,320,939) $ 486,250\nInternally developed software 3.2 1,798,922 (650,029) 1,148,893\nCustomer relationships 8.0 11,922,290 (3,193,629) 8,728,661\nPurchased software 0.3 667,206 (618,418) 48,788\nVideo production assets - 50,000 (50,000) -\nNon-competition agreements 0.9 3,504,810 (2,874,645) 630,165\n$ 19,750,417 $ (8,707,660) $ 11,042,757\nThe following table reflects expected amortization expense as of June 30, 2024, for each of the following five years and thereafter:\nYears Ending December 31, Amortization Expense\n2024 (remaining six months) $ 764,453\n2025 1,397,041\n2026 1,148,216\n2027 807,696\n2028 717,314\nThereafter 1,318,032\nTotal $ 6,152,752\n12\nNOTE 3.

EQUITY\nCommon Stock\nThe Company is authorized to issue 117,647,059 shares of common stock, $0.086 par value. Each share of issued and outstanding common stock entitles the holder thereof to fully\nparticipate in all shareholder meetings, to cast one vote on each matter with respect to which shareholders have the right to vote, and to share ratably in all dividends and other\ndistributions declared and paid with respect to common stock, as well as in the net assets of the Company upon liquidation or dissolution.\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, the Company issued 11,036 shares through its ATM program, 42,545 pursuant to abeyance share conversions and 1,149 shares for equity-based\ncompensation.\nOn July 1, 2024, the Company effectuated a 1-for-17 reverse stock split of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock (the \"Reverse Split-2024”). The par value remained\nunchanged following the Reverse Split-2024. All share and per share information as well as common stock and additional paid-in capital have been retroactively adjusted to reflect\nthe Reverse Split-2024 for all periods presented, unless otherwise indicated.

Any shares offered and sold in the ATM offering will be issued pursuant to the Company’s effective shelf registration statement on\nForm S-3 (File No. 333-275190), which was declared effective by the SEC on November 7, 2023, and related prospectus supplements and accompanying base prospectus relating to\nthe ATM offering. Under the Agreement, the Agent may sell shares by any method permitted by law and deemed to be an \"at-the-market” offering as defined in Rule 415\npromulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act”). The offering of shares pursuant to the ATM Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (i) the\nsale of all of the shares subject to the ATM Agreement, or (ii) the termination of the ATM Agreement by the Agent or the Company, as permitted therein. The Company agreed to\npay to the Agent in cash, upon each sale of shares pursuant to the ATM Agreement, an amount equal to 3.5% of the gross proceeds from each such sale.

Total stock-based compensation expense recorded in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the six months ended\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023 was $264,331 and $79,164, respectively.\nNOTE 6. EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE\nBasic earnings per common share (\"EPS”) applicable to common stockholders is computed by dividing earnings applicable to common stockholders by the weighted-average\nnumber of common shares outstanding.\nIf there is a loss from operations, diluted EPS is computed in the same manner as basic EPS is computed. Similarly, if the Company has net income but its preferred dividend\nadjustment made in computing income available to common stockholders results in a net loss available to common stockholders, diluted EPS would be computed in the same\nmanner as basic EPS.\nThe following calculates basic and diluted EPS:\nThree Months Three Months\nEnded Ended\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023\nLoss from continuing operations $ (1,489,395) $ (3,869,732)\nNet loss continuing operations, numerator, basic computation (1,489,395) (3,869,732)\nRecognition and change in fair value of warrant liabilities - -\nNet loss from continuing operations, numerator, diluted computation $ (1,489,395) $ (3,869,732)\nWeighted average common shares, basic 539,133 159,795\nEffect of Series B Warrants - -\nWeighted average common shares, dilutive 539,133 159,795\nLoss per common share – basic $ (2.76) $ (24.21)\nLoss per common share – diluted $ (2.76) $ (24.21)\n15\nSix Months Six Months\nEnded Ended\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023\nLoss from continuing operations $ (6,836,057) $ (997,776)\nNet Loss continuing operations, numerator, basic computation (6,836,057) (997,776)\nRecognition and change in fair value of warrant liabilities - -\nNet loss from continuing operations, numerator, diluted computation $ (6,836,057) $ (997,776)\nWeighted average common shares, basic 462,773 125,791\nEffect of Series B Warrants - -\nWeighted average common shares, dilutive 462,773 125,791\nLoss per common share – basic $ (14.77) $ (7.93)\nLoss per common share – diluted $ (14.77) $ (7.93)\nAdditionally, the following are considered anti-dilutive securities excluded from weighted-average shares used to calculate diluted net loss per common share:\nFor the Three Months Ended\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023\nShares subject to outstanding common stock options 510 649\nShares subject to outstanding Series A warrants 6,647 6,647\nShares subject to outstanding PAW’s 959 959\nShares subject to outstanding Series F warrants - 123,840\nShares subject to PA Warrants 3,096 3,096\nShares subject to unvested stock awards 52 205\nFor the Six Months Ended\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023\nShares subject to outstanding common stock options 510 649\nShares subject to outstanding Series A warrants 6,647 6,647\nShares subject to outstanding PAW’s 959 959\nShares subject to outstanding Series F warrants - 123,840\nShares subject to PA Warrants 3,096 3,096\nShares subject to unvested stock awards 52 205\nNOTE 7. LEASES\nOperating lease expense for the three months ended June 30, 2024, and 2023 was $102,073 and $123,326, respectively. Operating lease expense for the six months ended June 30,\n2024, and 2023 was $207,029 and $239,296 respectively. As of June 30, 2024, the weighted average remaining lease term and weighted average discount rate for the operating leases\nwere 5.08 years and 8.35%, respectively.\n16\nFuture minimum lease payments under these operating leases consisted of the following:\nOperating Lease\nFiscal year ending December 31, Obligations\n2024 (remaining six months) $ 180,322\n2025 265,399\n2026 229,522\n2027 215,325\n2028 182,190\nThereafter 225,136\nTotal undiscounted operating lease payments 1,297,894\nLess: Imputed interest (252,939)\nPresent value of operating lease liabilities $ 1,044,955\nNOTE 8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLegal Contingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, arising in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of these claims\ncannot be predicted with certainty, management does not believe the outcome of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results\nof operations, or cash flows, and accordingly and no legal contingencies are accrued as of June 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. Litigation relating to the insurance brokerage\nindustry is not uncommon. As such the Company, from time to time has been subject to such litigation. No assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any\nsuch litigation in the future.\nEarn-out liabilities\nThe Company, Southwestern Montana Insurance Center, LLC, a Montana limited liability company (the \"Subsidiary”), Southwestern Montana Financial Center, Inc., a Montana\ncorporation (the \"Seller”), and Julie A. Blockey (the \"Holder”, and collectively with the Company, Subsidiary, and Seller, the \"Parties”) entered into a purchase agreement on or\naround April 1, 2019 (the \"Purchase Agreement”), whereby the Company purchased the business and certain assets noted within the Purchase Agreement. On September 29, 2023,\nthe Parties entered into a first amendment to the Purchase Agreement (the \"First Amendment”). Pursuant to the First Amendment, the Parties agreed to a total remaining earn-out\nrelated balance of $500,000 owed under the Purchase Agreement. In satisfaction of such remaining balance, the Company agreed to issue 10,272 shares of the Company’s restricted\ncommon stock, par value $0.086 per share (the \"Common Stock”), to the Holder. The First Amendment also stated that if the Nasdaq official closing price of the Common Stock is\nless than $41.31 on March 29, 2024 (the \"Calculation Date”), then a determination of the Make-Up Amount (as defined herein) will be made. The \"Make-Up Amount” means\n$425,000 minus the Blockey Shares Value (10,272 multiplied by the Nasdaq official closing price of the Common Stock on the Calculation Date). The First Amendment further stated\nthat the Company shall pay the Make-Up Amount with a combination of cash and Company shares. Accordingly, on the Calculation Date, a total Make-Up Amount of $367,496\nwas determined, and as agreed upon by the Parties, will be payable, $190,000 in cash, and the remaining balance via the issuance of 30,029 of the Company’s Common Stock,\nsubsequently issued to the Seller during April, 2024. The $190,000 cash balance was paid during the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\nThe following outlines changes to the Company’s earn-out liability balances for the respective periods ended June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nFortman Montana Altruis Kush Barra Total\nEnding balance December 31, 2023 $ - $ 159,867 $ - $ - $ - $ 159,867\nPayments - (190,000) - - - -\nEstimates and fair value adjustments - 47,761 - - - 47,761\nPayable in common stock - (17,628) - - - (17,628)\nEnding balance June 30, 2024 $ - $ - $ - $ - $ - $ -\nFortman Montana Altruis Kush Barra Total\nEnding balance December 31, 2022 $ 667,000 $ 500,001 $ 834,943 $ 147,534 $ 560,000 $ 2,709,478\nPayments (1,433,700) (750,001) (929,168) (147,534) - (3,260,403)\nEstimates and fair value adjustments 1,612,914 569,734 94,225 - (560,000) 1,716,873\nPayable in common stock - (159,867) - - - (159,867)\nReclass to loans payable, related parties* (846,214) - - - - (846,214)\nEnding balance December 31, 2023 $ - $ 159,867 $ - $ - $ - $ 159,867\n*The Company modified certain contingent earn-out payables by entering into fixed payment arrangements. Thus, remaining open balances are reclassified to the loans\npayable, related parties account on the consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n17\nDefinitive Acquisition Agreements\nOn May 14, 2024, the Company entered into a Stock Exchange Agreement (the \"Stock Exchange Agreement”) to acquire Spetner Associates (\"Spetner”). Pursuant to the Stock\nExchange Agreement, the Company agreed to: (i) acquire 80% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Spetner (the \"Spetner Common\nStock”) for $13,714,286 (which amount was to be paid as $8,000,000 in cash, the issuance of certain shares of the Company’s common stock, and the Company’s issuance of a\npromissory note); and (ii) have the sole option to acquire the remaining 20% of Spetner common stock for a predetermined amount based on a multiple of EBITDA.\nNOTE 9.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nReliance Global Group, Inc. (the \"Company”) operates as a diversified company engaging in business in the insurance market, as well as other related sectors. Our focus is to grow\nthe Company by pursuing an aggressive acquisition strategy, initially and primarily focused upon wholesale and retail insurance agencies.\nIn the insurance sector, our management has extensive experience acquiring and managing insurance portfolios in several states, as well as developing specialized programs\ntargeting niche markets. Our primary strategy is to identify specific risk to reward arbitrage opportunities and develop these on a national platform, thereby increasing revenues\nand returns, and then identify and acquire undervalued wholesale and retail insurance agencies with operations in growing or underserved segments, expand and optimize their\noperations, and achieve asset value appreciation while generating interim cash flows.\nAs part of our growth and acquisition strategy, we continue to survey the current insurance market for value-add acquisition opportunities. As of June 30, 2024, we have acquired\nnine insurance agencies.\nOver the next 12 months, we plan to focus on the expansion and growth of our business through continued asset acquisitions in insurance markets and organic growth of our\ncurrent insurance operations through geographic expansion and market share growth. To that end, on May 14, 2024, the Company entered into a Stock Exchange Agreement (the\n\"Stock Exchange Agreement”) to acquire Spetner Associates (\"Spetner”), a well-established benefits enrollment company that, through its BenManage benefits enrollment\ncompany, is a leading provider of voluntary benefits to over 75,000 employees throughout the United States. Pursuant to the Stock Exchange Agreement, the Company agreed to:\n(i) acquire 80% of Spetner’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share (the \"Spetner Common Stock”) for $13,714,286 (which amount was to be\npaid as $8,000,000 in cash, the issuance of certain shares of the Company’s common stock, and the Company’s issuance of a promissory note; and (ii) have the sole option to\nacquire the remaining 20% of the Spetner Common Stock for a predetermined amount based on a multiple of EBITDA\nFurther, we launched our 5MinuteInsure.com (\"5MI”) Insurtech platform during 2021, which expanded our national footprint. 5MI is a high-tech proprietary tool developed by us\nas a business to consumer portal which enables consumers to instantly compare quotes from multiple carriers and purchase their car and home insurance in a time efficient and\neffective manner. 5MI taps into the growing number of online shoppers and utilizes advanced artificial intelligence and data mining techniques, to provide competitive insurance\nquotes in around 5 minutes with minimal data input needed from the consumer. The platform launched during the summer of 2021 and currently operates in 46 states offering\ncoverage with up to 30 highly rated insurance carriers.\nWith the acquisition of Barra, we launched RELI Exchange, our business-to-business (\"B2B”) InsurTech platform and agency partner network that builds on the artificial\nintelligence and data mining backbone of 5MinuteInsure.com. Through RELI Exchange we on-board agency partners and provide them with an InsurTech platform white labeled,\ndesigned and branded specifically for their business. This combines the best of digital and human capabilities by providing our agency partners and their customers quotes from\nmultiple carriers within minutes. Since its inception, RELI Exchange has increased its agent roster by more than 130%.\nBusiness Operations\nWe’ve adopted a \"One-Firm” strategy, pursuant to which Company owned and operated agencies come together to operate as one cohesive unit, which allows for efficient and\neffective cross-selling, cross-collaboration, and the effective deployment of the Company’s human capital. This strategy also aims to enhance the Company’s overall market\npresence across the U.S., with all business lines operating under the RELI Exchange brand. It’s expected to benefit agents and clients by improving relationships with carriers,\nleading to better commission and bonus contracts due to higher business volumes. The approach also strengthens the capability of RELI Exchange agency partners in securing\ndiverse insurance policies and fosters increased cross-selling opportunities. This unified strategy positions the Company for rapid scaling and integration of accretive\nacquisitions, expanding its industry reach.\n19\nBusiness Trends and Uncertainties\nThe insurance intermediary business is highly competitive, and we actively compete with numerous firms for customers and insurance companies, many of which have\nrelationships with insurance companies, or have a significant presence in niche insurance markets that may give them an advantage over us. Other competitive concerns may\ninclude the quality of our products and services, our pricing and the ability of some of our customers to self-insure and the entrance of technology companies into the insurance\nintermediary business. Several insurance companies are engaged in the direct sale of insurance, primarily to individuals, and do not pay commissions to agents and brokers.\nFinancial Instruments\nDuring the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Company’s financial instruments consisted of derivative warrants. These were accounted at fair value as of inception/issuance date,\nand at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. Any change in fair value was recorded as non-operating, (non-cash) gain or loss. As of June 18, 2024, all of the\nremaining derivative warrants were exercised and there are currently none outstanding.\nInsurance Operations\nOur insurance operations focus on the acquisition and management of insurance agencies throughout the U.S. Our primary focus is to pinpoint undervalued wholesale and retail\ninsurance agencies with operations in growing or underserved segments (including healthcare and Medicare, as well as personal and commercial insurance lines). We then focus\non expanding their operations on a national platform and improving operational efficiencies to achieve asset value appreciation while generating interim cash flows. In the\ninsurance sector, our management team has over 100 years of experience acquiring and managing insurance portfolios in several states, as well as developing specialized programs\ntargeting niche markets. We plan to accomplish these objectives by acquiring wholesale and retail insurance agencies it deems to represent a good buying opportunity (as\nopposed to insurance carriers) as insurance agencies bear no insurance risk. Once acquired, we plan to develop them on a national platform to increase revenues and profits\nthrough a synergetic structure. The Company is initially focused on segments that are underserved or growing, including healthcare and Medicare, as well as personal and\ncommercial insurance lines.\nInsurance Acquisitions and Strategic Activities\nAs of the balance sheet date, we have acquired multiple insurance brokerages (see table below). As our acquisition strategy continues, our reach within the insurance arena can\nprovide us with the ability to offer lower rates, which could boost our competitive position within the industry. In furtherance of this strategy, on May 14, 2024, the Company\nentered into a Stock Exchange Agreement to acquire Spetner Associates (\"Spetner”) for cash, stock and issuance of a promissory note. Spetner is a well-established benefits\nenrollment company that, through its BenManage benefits enrollment company, is a leading provider of voluntary benefits to over 75,000 employees throughout the United States.\nCompletion of the transaction is subject to standard and stipulated closing.\n20\nReliance 100%\nAcquired Controlled Entity Date Location Line of Business\nU.S. Benefits Alliance, LLC (USBA) US Benefits Alliance, LLC October 24, 2018 Michigan Health Insurance\nEmployee Benefit Solutions, LLC (EBS) Employee Benefits Solutions, LLC October 24, 2018 Michigan Health Insurance\nCommercial Solutions of Insurance Agency, LLC (CCS Commercial Coverage Solutions P&C – Trucking\nor Commercial Solutions) LLC December 1, 2018 New Jersey Industry\nSouthwestern Montana Insurance Center, Inc.

The par value remained\nunchanged. All share and per share information, as well as common stock and additional paid-in capital, have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Reverse Split-2024 for all\nperiods presented, unless otherwise indicated. The Reverse Split-2024 resulted in a rounding addition of approximately 110,350 shares valued at par, totaling $9,490 for which\nshares were issued in July 2024.\nNon-GAAP Measure\nThe Company believes certain financial measures which meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures, as defined in Regulation G of the SEC rules, provide important\nsupplemental information. Adjusted EBITDA (\"AEBITDA”), our key financial performance metric, is a non-GAAP financial measure that is not in accordance with, or an alternative\nto, measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP”). \"AEBITDA” is defined as earnings before interest,\ntaxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) with additional adjustments as further outlined below. The Company considers AEBITDA an important financial metric because it\nprovides a meaningful financial measure of the quality of the Company’s operational, cash impacted and recurring earnings and operating performance across reporting periods.\nOther companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, which might limit its usefulness as a comparative measure to other companies in the industry. AEBITDA\nis used by management in addition to and in conjunction (and not as a substitute) with the results presented in accordance with GAAP. Management uses AEBITDA to evaluate\nthe Company’s operational performance, including earnings across reporting periods and the merits for implementing cost-cutting measures. We have presented AEBITDA solely\nas supplemental disclosure because we believe it allows for a more complete analysis of results of operations and assists investors and analysts in comparing our operating\nperformance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Consistent with Regulation\nG, a description of such information is provided below herein and tabular reconciliations of this supplemental non-GAAP financial information to our most comparable GAAP\ninformation are contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under \"Results of Operations”.\n21\nWe exclude the following items when calculating AEBITDA, and the following items define our non-GAAP financial measure AEBITDA:\n● Interest and related party interest expense: Unrelated to core Company operations and excluded to provide more meaningful supplemental information regarding the\nCompany’s core operational performance.\n● Depreciation and amortization: Non-cash charge, excluded to provide more meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s core operational performance.\n● Goodwill and/or asset impairments: Non-cash charge, excluded to provide more meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s core operational\nperformance.\n● Equity-based compensation: Non-cash compensation provided to employees and service providers, excluded to provide more meaningful supplemental information\nregarding the Company’s core cash impacted operational performance.\n● Change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables: An earn-out liability is a liability to the seller upon an acquisition which is contingent on future earnings. These\nliabilities are valued at each reporting period and the changes are reported as either a gain or loss in the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables account in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. The gain or loss is non-cash, can be highly volatile and overall is not deemed relevant to ongoing operations, thus, it’s excluded to\nprovide more meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s core operational performance.\n● Recognition and change in fair value of warrant liabilities: This account includes changes to derivative warrant liabilities which are valued at each reporting period and\ncould result in either a gain or loss. The period changes do not impact cash, can be highly volatile, and are unrelated to ongoing operations, and thus are excluded to\nprovide more meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s core operational performance.\n● Other income (expense), net: Includes non-routine income or expenses and other individually de minimis items and is thus excluded as unrelated to core operations of the\ncompany.\n● Transactional costs: This includes expenses related to mergers, acquisitions, financings and refinancings, and amendments or modification to indebtedness.

During the first quarter of 2024, the Company entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement with EF\nHutton LLC as sales agent (the \"ATM Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time through the sales agent, shares of its common stock\nhaving an aggregate offering price as determined by the then in effect prospectus supplement to the base prospectus included in the registration statement (the \"ATM Capacity”).\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company sold 313,713 shares of common stock under the ATM Agreement, at an average price of $5.3492, resulting in proceeds,\nnet of $141,631 in agent commissions and legal and other fees, of $2,068,344. From the net sales proceeds, $146,174 was received in July 2024 and was recorded in the other\nreceivables account in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2024. As of the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the net remaining\nATM Capacity was $1,728,825.\nInflation\nThe Company generally may be impacted by rising costs for certain inflation-sensitive operating expenses such as labor, employee benefits, and facility leases. The Company\nbelieves inflation could have a material impact on pricing and operating expenses in future periods due to the state of the economy and current inflation rates.\n25\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as such term is defined in Regulation S-K, during the six months ended June 30, 2024.\nCash Flows\nSix Months Ended\nJune 30,\n2024 2023\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (889,594) (2,007,101)\nNet cash (used in) provided by investing activities (36,531) 735,128\nNet cash provided by financing activities 1,002,825 2,042,460\nNet increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 76,700 $ 770,487\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2024, was approximately $890,000, compared to net cash flows used in operating activities of approximately\n$2.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The cash used includes a net loss of approximately $6,836,000, decreased by approximate non-cash adjustments of $5,332,000\nrelated to asset impairments of approximately $3,922,000, gain from recognition and change in fair value of warrant liabilities of approximately $156,000, depreciation and\namortization of approximately $1,004,000, other adjustments totaling approximately $562,000, as well as a net increase in cash due to changes of net working capital items of\napproximately $615,000.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2024, cash flows used in investing activities approximated $36,500 compared to cash flows used in investing activities of approximately\n$735,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2023.

Net cash used in financing activities relates to proceeds from common shares issued pursuant to the ATM Agreement totaling approximately $2,068,000,\noffset by net debt principal, net short-term financings, and related party payables repayments of approximately $1,066,000.\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe describe our significant accounting policies in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and our critical\naccounting estimates in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year\nended December 31, 2023. There have been no significant changes in our significant accounting policies or critical accounting estimates since the end of fiscal year 2023.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nNot applicable.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe term \"disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act”), refers to\ncontrols and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is\nrecorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,\ncontrols and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to a company’s management, including its principal executive and principal\nfinancial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed\nand operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of\npossible controls and procedures.\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2024, and determined them to be\neffective as of June 30, 2024.\n26\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nDuring fiscal year 2024, the Company revised its internal controls over its goodwill evaluation process to ensure that any testing performed at interim dates are rolled forward to the\nreporting date of the relevant financial statements. Aside from the foregoing, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in\nRules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,\nour internal control over financial reporting.\nPART II\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings.\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, arising in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of these claims cannot be\npredicted with certainty, management does not believe the outcome of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of\noperations, or cash flows, and accordingly, no legal contingencies are accrued as of June 30, 2024. Litigation relating to the insurance brokerage industry is not uncommon. As\nsuch we, from time to time have been, subject to such litigation. No assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any such litigation in the future.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the information disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors,” contained in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Except as disclosed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as amended from time to time.\nOur shares of common stock are currently listed on Nasdaq. If we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market, such as the corporate\ngovernance requirements, minimum bid price requirement or the minimum stockholders’ equity requirement, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our common stock. Any delisting\nwould likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair stockholders’ ability to sell or purchase their common stock when they wish to do so.\nAs previously disclosed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 16, 2024 by the Company on January 12, 2024, the Company received written notice from Nasdaq’s\nListing Qualifications Department notifying the Company that for the preceding 30 consecutive business days (November 29, 2023 to January 11, 2024), the Company’s common\nstock did not maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share as required by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). The notice has no immediate effect on the listing or trading of\nthe Company’s common stock and the common stock continued to trade on Nasdaq under the symbol \"RELI.” In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company\nhas a compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until July 10, 2024, to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a) (2).\nOn July 16, 2024 Nasdaq’s Listing Qualifications Department notified the Company that it had regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2).\nItem 2.

SUMMARY OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nReliance Global Group, Inc., formerly known as Ethos Media Network, Inc. (\"RELI”, \"Reliance”, or the \"Company”), was incorporated in Florida on August 2, 2013.\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States\nof America (\"U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions for Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the\ninformation and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of recurring accruals) necessary for\na fair presentation have been included. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial\nstatements and the notes thereto, set forth in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the \"Form 10-K”), as the same may be amended\nfrom time to time. Capitalized terms not defined in this Form 10-Q refer to capitalized terms as defined in the Form 10-K. Certain prior period accounts and balances in these\ncondensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Reliance Global Group, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All\nintercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nLiquidity\nAs of March 31, 2024, the Company’s reported cash and restricted cash aggregated balance was approximately $2,113,000, current assets were approximately $3,411,000, while\ncurrent liabilities were approximately $3,531,000. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had a working capital deficit of approximately $120,000 and stockholders’ equity of\napproximately $1,962,000. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company presents loss from operations of approximately $5,032,000, which includes a non-cash asset\nimpairment loss of approximately $3,900,000, and net loss of approximately $5,347,000. During the first quarter of 2024 the Company entered into an At Market Issuance Sales\nAgreement (the \"ATM Agreement”) to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time through the Agent, shares of its Common Stock (the \"Shares”), having an\naggregate offering price of up to $858,637.\nAlthough there can be no assurance that debt or equity financing will be available on acceptable terms, the Company believes its financial position and its ability to raise capital to\nbe reasonable and sufficient. Based on our assessment, we do not believe there are conditions or events that, in the aggregate, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability\nto continue as a going concern within one year of filing these financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC”).\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on\nassumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\n7\nCash and Restricted Cash\nCash and restricted cash reported on our condensed consolidated balance sheets are reconciled to the total shown on our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows as\nfollows:\nMarch 31, 2024 March 31, 2023\nCash $ 680,138 $ 2,116,333\nRestricted cash 1,432,847 1,437,961\nTotal cash and restricted cash $ 2,112,985 $ 3,554,294\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nLevel 1 — Observable inputs reflecting quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;\nLevel 2 — Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the\nasset or liability; and\nLevel 3 — Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which include management’s own assumption about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or\nliability, including assumptions about risk.\nWarrant Liabilities: The Company re-measures the fair value of its Level 3 warrant liabilities at the balance sheet date, using a binomial option pricing model. The following\nsummarizes the significant unobservable inputs:\nMarch 31, 2024 December 31, 2023\nStock price $ 0.34 $ 0.54\nVolatility 135.00% 110.00%\nTime to expiry 4.74 4.99\nDividend yield 0% 0%\nRisk free rate 4.20% 3.80%\nThe following reconciles fair value of the liability classified warrants:\nSeries B warrant\nliabilities Placement agent warrants Total\nBeginning balance, December 31, 2022 $ 6,384,250 $ 48,900 $ 6,433,150\nUnrealized (gain) loss (5,534,931) (48,575) (5,583,506)\nWarrants exercised or exchanged (580,651) - (580,651)\nEnding balance, December 31, 2023 $ 268,668 $ 325 $ 268,993\nUnrealized (gain) loss (95,333) - (95,333)\nWarrants exercised or exchanged - - -\nEnding balance, March 31, 2024 $ 173,335 $ 325 $ 173,660\n8\nEarn-out liabilities: The Company utilizes two valuation methods to value its Level 3 earn-out liabilities, a) the income valuation approach and b) the Monte Carlo simulation\nmethod. Key valuation and unobservable inputs for the income valuation approach include contingent payment arrangement terms, projected revenues and cash flows, rates of\nreturn, discount rates and probability assessments.\nThe following table reconciles fair value of earn-out liabilities for the periods ended March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023:\nMarch 31, 2024 December 31, 2023\nBeginning balance – January 1 $ 159,867 $ 2,709,478\nAcquisitions and settlements - (3,260,403)\nPeriod adjustments:\nFair value changes included in earnings* 47,761 1,716,873\nEarn-out payable in common shares (17,628) (159,867)\nEarn-out transferred to loans payable, related parties (190,000) (846,214)\nEnding balance - 159,867\nLess: Current portion - (159,867)\nEnding balance, less current portion $ - $ -\n* Recorded in the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables caption on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe following table disaggregates the Company’s revenue by line of business, showing commissions earned:\nProperty and\nThree Months ended March 31, 2024 Medical Life Casualty Total\nEBS $ 229,004 $ 3,700 $ - $ 232,704\nUSBA 9,758 750 - 10,508\nCCS/UIS - - 27,948 27,948\nMontana 442,954 1,209 - 444,163\nFortman 292,188 1,782 228,815 522,785\nAltruis 2,028,225 6,351 - 2,034,576\nKush 193,807 - - 193,807\nReli Exchange 78,043 42,425 495,479 615,947\nTotal $ 3,273,979 $ 56,217 $ 752,242 $ 4,082,438\n9\nProperty and\nThree Months ended March 31, 2023 Medical Life Casualty Total\nEBS $ 233,280 $ 4,100 $ - $ 237,380\nUSBA 11,265 764 - 12,029\nCCS/UIS - - 46,770 46,770\nMontana 486,009 4,985 - 490,994\nFortman 305,877 393 208,145 514,415\nAltruis 1,868,136 - - 1,868,136\nKush 320,175 116 - 320,291\nReli Exchange 71,370 23,381 354,337 449,088\nTotal $ 3,296,112 $ 33,739 $ 609,252 $ 3,939,103\nThe following are customers representing 10% or more of total revenue:\nThree Months ended March 31,\nInsurance Carrier 2024 2023\nPriority Health 45% 43%\nBlueCross BlueShield 13% 13%\nNo other single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s commission revenues during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. The loss of any\nsignificant customer could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Customers from 2022 were adjusted to reflect percentages of revenue from continued operations.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recorded no income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 because the estimated annual effective tax rate was zero. In determining the\nestimated annual effective income tax rate, the Company analyzes various factors, including projections of the Company’s annual earnings and taxing jurisdictions in which the\nearnings will be generated, the impact of state and local income taxes, the ability to use tax credits and net operating loss carry forwards, and available tax planning alternatives.\nAs of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets since the Company believes it is more likely than\nnot that its deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nWe do not expect any recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material effect on our financial statements.\n10\nNOTE 2.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nReliance Global Group, Inc. (the \"Company”) operates as a diversified company engaging in business in the insurance market, as well as other related sectors. Our focus is to grow\nthe Company by pursuing an aggressive acquisition strategy, initially and primarily focused upon wholesale and retail insurance agencies.\nIn the insurance sector, our management has extensive experience acquiring and managing insurance portfolios in several states, as well as developing specialized programs\ntargeting niche markets. Our primary strategy is to identify specific risk to reward arbitrage opportunities and develop these on a national platform, thereby increasing revenues\nand returns, and then identify and acquire undervalued wholesale and retail insurance agencies with operations in growing or underserved segments, expand and optimize their\noperations, and achieve asset value appreciation while generating interim cash flows.\nAs part of our growth and acquisition strategy, we continue to survey the current insurance market for value-add acquisition opportunities. As of March 31, 2024, we have\nacquired nine insurance agencies.\nOver the next 12 months, we plan to focus on the expansion and growth of our business through continued asset acquisitions in insurance markets and organic growth of our\ncurrent insurance operations through geographic expansion and market share growth, and more specifically, on May 14, 2024, the Company announced the signing of a definitive\nagreement to acquire Spetner Associates (\"Spetner”), a well-established benefits enrollment company that, through its BenManage benefits enrollment company, is a leading\nprovider of voluntary benefits to over 75,000 employees throughout the United States. Pursuant to a Stock Exchange Agreement (the \"SE Agreement”), dated as of May 14, 2024,\nby and among the parties thereto, the Company shall: (i) acquire eighty percent (80%) of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Spetner\n(the \"Spetner Common Stock”) for the amount of $13,714,286 (which shall be paid in $8 million cash, the issuance of certain shares of common stock of the Company, and the\nissuance a promissory note of the Company); and (ii) have the sole option to acquire the remaining twenty percent (20%) of the Spetner Common Stock for a predetermined amount\nbased on a multiple of EBITDA.\nFurther, we launched our 5MinuteInsure.com (\"5MI”) Insurtech platform during 2021 which expanded our national footprint. 5MI is a high-tech proprietary tool developed by us as\na business to consumer portal which enables consumers to instantly compare quotes from multiple carriers and purchase their car and home insurance in a time efficient and\neffective manner. 5MI taps into the growing number of online shoppers and utilizes advanced artificial intelligence and data mining techniques, to provide competitive insurance\nquotes in around 5 minutes with minimal data input needed from the consumer. The platform launched during the summer of 2021 and currently operates in 46 states offering\ncoverage with up to 30 highly rated insurance carriers.\nWith the acquisition of Barra, we launched RELI Exchange, our business-to-business (\"B2B”) InsurTech platform and agency partner network that builds on the artificial\nintelligence and data mining backbone of 5MinuteInsure.com. Through RELI Exchange we on-board agency partners and provide them with an InsurTech platform white labeled,\ndesigned and branded specifically for their business. This combines the best of digital and human capabilities by providing our agency partners and their customers quotes from\nmultiple carriers within minutes. Since its inception, RELI Exchange has increased its agent roster by more than 130%.\nBusiness Operations\nWe’ve adopted a ‘One-Firm’ strategy, whereby the Reliance owned and operated agencies come together to operate as one cohesive unit which allows for efficient and effective\ncross-selling, cross-collaboration, and the effective deployment of the Company’s human capital. This strategy also aims to enhance the Company’s overall market presence\nacross the U.S., with all business lines operating under the RELI Exchange brand. It’s expected to benefit agents and clients by improving relationships with carriers, leading to\nbetter commission and bonus contracts due to higher business volumes. The approach also strengthens the capability of RELI Exchange agency partners in securing diverse\ninsurance policies and fosters increased cross-selling opportunities. This unified strategy positions the company for rapid scaling and integration of accretive acquisitions,\nexpanding its industry reach.\nBusiness Trends and Uncertainties\nThe insurance intermediary business is highly competitive, and we actively compete with numerous firms for customers and insurance companies, many of which have\nrelationships with insurance companies, or have a significant presence in niche insurance markets that may give them an advantage over us. Other competitive concerns may\ninclude the quality of our products and services, our pricing and the ability of some of our customers to self-insure and the entrance of technology companies into the insurance\nintermediary business. Several insurance companies are engaged in the direct sale of insurance, primarily to individuals, and do not pay commissions to agents and brokers.\nFinancial Instruments\nThe Company’s financial instruments as of March 31, 2024, consist of derivative warrants. These are accounted at fair value as of inception/issuance date, and at fair value as of\neach subsequent balance sheet date. Any change in fair value is recorded as non-operating, (non-cash) gain or loss.\n19\nInsurance Operations\nOur insurance operations focus on the acquisition and management of insurance agencies throughout the U.S. Our primary focus is to pinpoint undervalued wholesale and retail\ninsurance agencies with operations in growing or underserved segments (including healthcare and Medicare, as well as personal and commercial insurance lines). We then focus\non expanding their operations on a national platform and improving operational efficiencies to achieve asset value appreciation while generating interim cash flows. In the\ninsurance sector, our management team has over 100 years of experience acquiring and managing insurance portfolios in several states, as well as developing specialized programs\ntargeting niche markets. We plan to accomplish these objectives by acquiring wholesale and retail insurance agencies it deems to represent a good buying opportunity (as\nopposed to insurance carriers) as insurance agencies bear no insurance risk. Once acquired, we plan to develop them on a national platform to increase revenues and profits\nthrough a synergetic structure. The Company is initially focused on segments that are underserved or growing, including healthcare and Medicare, as well as personal and\ncommercial insurance lines.\nInsurance Acquisitions and Strategic Activities\nAs of the balance sheet date, we have acquired multiple insurance brokerages (see table below). As our acquisition strategy continues, our reach within the insurance arena can\nprovide us with the ability to offer lower rates, which could boost our competitive position within the industry. In furtherance of this strategy, on May 14, 2024, the Company\nentered into a Stock Exchange Agreement to acquire Spetner Associates (\"Spetner”) for cash, stock and issuance of a promissory note. Spetner is a well-established benefits\nenrollment company that, through its BenManage benefits enrollment company, is a leading provider of voluntary benefits to over 75,000 employees throughout the United States.\nCompletion of the transaction is subject to standard and stipulated closing.

Namely our key financial performance metric Adjusted EBITDA (\"AEBITDA”) is a non-GAAP financial measure that is not in accordance with, or an\nalternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. \"AEBITDA” is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) with additional\nadjustments as further outlined below, to result in Adjusted EBITDA (or \"AEBITDA”). The Company considers AEBITDA an important financial metric because it provides a\nmeaningful financial measure of the quality of the Company’s operational, cash impacted and recurring earnings and operating performance across reporting periods. Other\ncompanies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, which might limit its usefulness as a comparative measure to other companies in the industry. AEBITDA is\nused by management in addition to and in conjunction (and not as a substitute) with the results presented in accordance with GAAP. Management uses AEBITDA to evaluate the\nCompany’s operational performance, including earnings across reporting periods and the merits for implementing cost-cutting measures. We have presented AEBITDA solely as\nsupplemental disclosure because we believe it allows for a more complete analysis of results of operations and assists investors and analysts in comparing our operating\nperformance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Consistent with Regulation\nG, a description of such information is provided below herein and tabular reconciliations of this supplemental non-GAAP financial information to our most comparable GAAP\ninformation are contained in this Report on Form 10-Q under \"Results of Operations”.\nWe exclude the following items, and the following items define our non-GAAP financial measure AEBITDA:\n● Interest and related party interest expense: Unrelated to core Company operations and excluded to provide more meaningful supplemental information regarding the\nCompany’s core operational performance.\n● Depreciation and amortization: Non-cash charge, excluded to provide more meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s core operational performance.\n● Goodwill and/or asset impairments: Non-cash charge, excluded to provide more meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s core operational\nperformance.\n● Equity-based compensation: Non-cash compensation provided to employees and service providers, excluded to provide more meaningful supplemental information\nregarding the Company’s core cash impacted operational performance.\n● Change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables: An Earn-out liability is a liability to the seller upon an acquisition which is contingent on future earnings. These\nliabilities are valued at each reporting period and the changes are reported as either a gain or loss in the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables account in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. The gain or loss is non-cash, can be highly volatile and overall is not deemed relevant to ongoing operations, thus, it’s excluded to\nprovide more meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s core operational performance.\n● Recognition and change in fair value of warrant liabilities: This account includes changes to derivative warrant liabilities which are valued at each reporting period and\ncould result in either a gain or loss. The period changes do not impact cash, can be highly volatile, and are unrelated to ongoing operations, and thus are excluded to\nprovide more meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s core operational performance.\n● Other income (expense), net: Includes non-routine income or expenses and other individually de minimis items and is thus excluded as unrelated to core operations of the\ncompany.\n● Transactional costs: This includes expenses related to mergers, acquisitions, financings and refinancings, and amendments or modification to indebtedness. Thes costs\nare unrelated to primary Company operations and are excluded to provide more meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s core operational\nperformance.\n● Non recuring costs: This account includes non-recurring non-operational items, related to costs incurred for a legal suit the Company has filed against one of the third\nparties involved in the discontinued operations and is excluded to provide more meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s core operational\nperformance.\n● Loss from discontinued operations before tax: This account includes the net results from discontinued operations, and since discontinued, are unrelated to the\nCompany’s ongoing operations and thus excluded to provide more meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s core operational performance.\nRefer to the reconciliation of net (loss) income to AEBITDA, illustrated below in tabular format.\n21\nResults of Operations\nRELIANCE GLOBAL GROUP, INC.

During the first quarter of 2024 the Company entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement\nwith EF Hutton as sales agent (the \"ATM Agreement”) under which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time through the sales agent, shares of its Common Stock (the\n\"Shares”), having an aggregate offering price of up to $858,637. Under the ATM Agreement, the Company pays the sales agent a commission equal to 3.5% of the aggregate gross\nproceeds of any sales of common stock under the ATM Agreement.\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Company sold 187,614 shares of Common Stock under the ATM Agreement, at a price of $0.6891, receiving proceeds, net of $4,636 in\nsales agent commissions and fees, of $124,649. As of March 31, 2024, the net remaining amount we are permitted to sell under the ATM Agreement was $729,352.\nDuring the period from April 1, 2024 through May 20, 2024, the Company sold 1,320,829 shares of Common Stock under the ATM Agreement, receiving proceeds, net of $15,905\nagent commissions and fees of $385,052. As of May 20, the net remaining amount we are permitted to sell under the ATM Agreement was $328,395.\nPursuant to the terms of the Series B Warrants and Series G Warrants, during the second quarter of 2024, the Series B Warrants and Series G Warrants respective exercise prices\nreduced from $0.63 and $0.6562 per share to $0.26 and $0.26 per share as a result of dilutive issuances of our Common Stock.\nInflation\nThe Company generally may be impacted by rising costs for certain inflation-sensitive operating expenses such as labor, employee benefits, and facility leases. The Company\nbelieves inflation could have a material impact to pricing and operating expenses in future periods due to the state of the economy and current inflation rates.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as such term is defined in Regulation S-K.\nCash Flows\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2024 2023\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (204,382) (1,064,878)\nNet cash used in investing activities (29,444) (96,297)\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities (392,100) 2,805,700\nNet (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ (625,926) $ 1,644,525\n23\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was approximately $204,000, compared to net cash flows used in operating activities of\napproximately $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The cash used includes net loss of approximately $5,347,000, decreased by approximate non-cash\nadjustments of $5,142,000 related to asset impairments of approximately $3,922,000, income of recognition and change in fair value of warrant liabilities of approximately $95,000,\ndepreciation and amortization of approximately $534,000, other small adjustments totaling approximately $79,000, as well as a net increase in cash due to changes of net working\ncapital items of approximately $702,000.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, cash flows used in investing activities approximated $29,000 compared to cash flows used in investing activities of approximately\n$96,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The cash used is primarily related to the purchase of property and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, approximate cash used in financing activities was $392,000 as compared to approximately $2.8 million provided for the three months\nended March 31, 2023. Net cash used in financing activities relates to proceeds from common shares issued pursuant to the ATM Agreement totaling approximately $125,000,\noffset by net debt principal, short term financings, and related party payables repayments of approximately $517,000.\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe describe our significant accounting policies in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and our critical\naccounting estimates in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year\nended December 31, 2023. There have been no significant changes in our significant accounting policies or critical accounting estimates since the end of fiscal year 2023.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nNot applicable.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe term \"disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act”), refers to\ncontrols and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is\nrecorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,\ncontrols and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to a company’s management, including its principal executive and principal\nfinancial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed\nand operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of\npossible controls and procedures.\n24\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2024, and determined them to be\neffective.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nDuring fiscal year 2024, the Company revised its internal controls over its goodwill evaluation process to ensure that any testing performed at interim dates, are rolled forward to\nthe financial statements reporting date. Aside for the foregoing, there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules\n13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during our most recently completed fiscal quarter which is the subject of this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably\nlikely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nPART II\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings.\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, arising in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of these claims cannot be\npredicted with certainty, management does not believe the outcome of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of\noperations, or cash flows, and accordingly, no legal contingencies are accrued as of March 31, 2024. Litigation relating to the insurance brokerage industry is not uncommon. As\nsuch we, from time to time have been, subject to such litigation. No assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any such litigation in the future.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the information disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors,” contained in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Except as disclosed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as amended from time to time.\nThe exercise of all or any number of outstanding Series G Warrants may dilute a shareholders holding of shares of our common stock.\nWe have issued 4,210,528 Series G Warrants providing for the right to purchase 4,4210,528 shares of our common stock at an initial exercise price of $0.6562 per share which price\nwas reduced to $0.26 per share effective as of May 10, 2024 pursuant to a price reset provision pursuant to the terms of the Series G Warrants and the Company’s issuance of\nshares of its Common Stock pursuant to the ATM. Our shareholders could be subject to increased dilution upon the exercise of the Series G Warrants. In addition, the exercise of\nthe Series G Warrants and the subsequent sale of shares of common stock issued thereby, could have an adverse effect on the market for our common stock, including the price\nthat a shareholder could obtain for their shares. Further, our shareholders may experience dilution in the value of their investment in our common stock upon the exercise of the\nSeries G Warrants.\nThe number of shares of common stock which may be issued upon exercise of our Series G Warrants is significant in relation to our currently outstanding common stock and\ncould cause downward pressure on the market price for our common stock.\nThe number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of our outstanding Series G Warrants is significant in relation to the number of shares of common stock currently\noutstanding. If the holder of the Series G Warrants determines to sell a substantial number of shares into the market at any given time, there may not be sufficient demand in the\nmarket to purchase the shares without a decline in the market price for our common stock. Moreover, continuous sales into the market of a number of shares in excess of the typical\ntrading volume for our common stock, or even the availability of such a large number of shares, could depress the trading market for our common stock over an extended period of\ntime.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.\nNone that have not been previously disclosed in our filings with the SEC.\nItem 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.\nNot applicable.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\nItem 5. Other Information.\nNot applicable.\n25\nItem 6.

BUSINESS\nAbout Reliance Global Group, Inc.\nReliance Global Group, Inc. (formerly known as Ethos Media Network, Inc.) was incorporated in Florida on August 2, 2013. In September 2018, Reliance Global Holdings, LLC, a\nrelated party (\"Reliance Holdings”), purchased a controlling interest in the Company. Ethos Media Network, Inc. was renamed Reliance Global Group, Inc. on October 18, 2018.\nWe operate as a company managing assets in the insurance markets, as well as other related sectors. Our focus is to grow the Company by pursuing an aggressive acquisition\nstrategy, initially and primarily focused upon wholesale and retail insurance agencies. We are led and advised by a management team that offers over 100 years of combined\nbusiness expertise in insurance, real estate and the financial service industry.\n1\nIn the insurance sector, our management has extensive experience acquiring and managing insurance portfolios in several states, as well as developing specialized programs\ntargeting niche markets. Our primary strategy is to identify specific risk to reward arbitrage opportunities and develop these on a national platform, thereby increasing revenues\nand returns, and then identify and acquire undervalued wholesale and retail insurance agencies with operations in growing or underserved segments, expand and optimize their\noperations, and achieve asset value appreciation while generating interim cash flows.\nAs part of our growth and acquisition strategy, we remain active in M&A markets and anticipate completing insurance agency/brokerage transactions throughout the course of\n2024 and beyond. As of December 31, 2023, we have acquired nine insurance agencies. During 2022, the Company acquired Barra & Associates, LLC., an unaffiliated full-service\ninsurance agency, which we rebranded to RELI Exchange and expanded its footprint nationally.\nThe Company also developed and launched 5MinuteInsure.com (\"5MI”), a proprietary direct to consumer InsurTech platform which went live during the summer of 2021. 5MI is a\nbusiness to consumer website which enables consumers to compare and purchase car and home insurance in a time efficient and effective manner. The platform is currently live in\n44 states and offers coverage with more than thirty carriers.\nOver the next 12 months, we plan to expand and grow our footprint and market share both through organic growth, and by expansion through additional acquisitions in various\ninsurance markets.\nOur competitive advantage includes the ability to:\n● Scale to compete at a national level.\n● Capitalize on the consumer shift to ‘online’ with the personal touch of an agent, as the only InsurTech company with this combination.\n● Leverage proprietary agency software & automation to compare carrier prices, for competitive renewal pricing.\n● Employ an empowered and scalable insurance agency model.\n● Leverage technology that facilitates comparing carriers for the best prices.\nThe RELI Exchange Business to Business (\"B2B”) InsurTech platform and partner network for insurance agents and agencies also:\n● Boast being the only white label insurance brokerage agency – New agents can have a multimillion-dollar agency look on day one, with a full suite of back-office support\n(business resources, licensing, compliance, etc.).\n● Combines the low barriers to entry of an agency network, with state-of-the-art tech.\n● Builds on the artificial intelligence and data mining backbone of 5MinuteInsure.com\n● Is designed to provide instant and competitive insurance quotes from more than thirty insurance carriers nationwide.\n● Reduces back-office burden and expenses by reducing the need for paperwork and redundant tasks.\n● Provides agents more time to focus on revenue driving activities, such as selling policies.\nIn addition, we have a vast mentorship program behind the scenes, to upskill our sales teams. Once people are registered, we enroll them in our mentorship program, and coach\nthem to bring new business.\nRELI Exchange is a complete, private label system where agents have more flexibility in how they choose to brand themselves, compared to competitor platforms that require\nagents to work under the platform’s brand name. In effect, agents have a greater sense of ownership on our platform, and the feeling that comes with a well-financed agency.\n2\nInsurance Market Overview\nThere are three main insurance sectors: (1) property/casualty (P/C), which consists mainly of auto, home, and commercial insurance; (2) life/health (L/H), which consists mainly of\nlife insurance and annuity products; and (3) accident and health, which is normally written by insurers whose main business is health insurance. The insurance industry plays a\nhuge role in the U.S. economy (Source: OECD Insurance Statistics).\nThe U.S. remained the world’s largest insurance market, with a 40% market share of global direct premiums written in 2023, with premiums of $2.8 trillion, and Swiss Re forecasts\nthat premiums will grow by an average 9% per annum over the next decade, stronger than the 7.5% annual average of 2015–2023 (Source: beinsure, Top Ranking the World’s\nLargest Insurance Markets 2024).\nInsurance Agency Industry Overview\nInsurance agencies act as intermediaries between insurance carriers and consumers. Unlike carriers, agencies do not bear insurance risk. The market has grown steadily including a\nsharp increase in 2019 due to macroeconomic growth, beneficial legislation, COVID treatments, and positive trends within the insurance sector. While inflation and other factors\nhave impacted the industry, it has continued to grow through 2021. The market flattened in 2022 (12.15% of US GDP in 2022 vs. 12.20% in 2021), with a positive outlook due to the\nincreased use of AI. Results may be impacted by changes to federal interest rates, with the federal funds rate skyrocketing from about 0% in early 2022 to 5.33% in February 2024,\nthe highest rate in over 20 years (Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve, Federal Funds Effective Rate).\nAn insurance agency or broker solicits, writes, and binds policies through many different insurance companies, as they are not directly employed by any insurance carrier. Thus,\ninsurance agencies can decide which insurance carriers they would like to represent and which products they would like to sell. They are like a retail shop that sells insurance\nservices and products created by the insurance carrier. The main difference between a broker and an agent has to do with who they represent. An agent represents one or more\ninsurance companies, acting as an extension of the insurer. A broker represents the insurance buyer.\nAn insurance carrier, on the other hand, is a manufacturer of insurance services and products that the insurance agencies sell. They control the underwriting process, claims\nprocess, pricing, and the overall management of the insurance products. Insurance carriers do not sell their products through direct agents, but only through independent\nagencies. Insurance policies are created and administered by the insurance carrier.\nA key operating difference between agencies and carriers is the risk profile. The potential financial risks to the insurance industry caused by unforeseen events such as natural\ndisasters are the responsibility of the carriers (and their re-insurers). Agencies and brokers bear no insurance risk. Furthermore, increased damage caused by natural disasters\ngenerally boosts demand for insurance and results in possible premium increases. Since insurance brokers and agents are a central part of the distribution of these products, they\nnormally benefit from this increase in demand and premiums despite damaged profit margins among these upstream underwriters and carriers. (Source: IBISWorld Insurance\nBrokers & Agencies Industry in the US, January 2023). Natural disasters are inherently difficult to forecast, but any increase in the frequency of these events has the potential to\nboost insurance policy volumes, particularly for property and casualty products.\n3\nThis risk difference is key, especially considering volatile weather patterns and an increased rate of natural disasters. The economic costs of 2023’s natural disaster events was\n$380 billion, up from $313 billion in 2022 (Source: Statista, Cost of natural disaster losses worldwide from 2000 to 2023, by type of loss). Insurance only covered 42% of the total\ndamages from 421 natural disaster events in 2022 (Source: AON, Testimony of Eric Anderson, President of Aon, before the United States Senate Committee on Budget,\nWednesday, March 22, 2023).\nKey external drivers for insurance industry performance include factors such as motor vehicle registrations, the homeowner rate, and per capita disposable income. The industry is\nin a hardening cycle, which leads to growth. There are still effects from the COVID-19 measures, with shifting sales trends expected to boost profitability while lowering marginal\ncosts. Additionally, businesses rebounding from COVID-19 are reported to translate to a consistent stream of new insurance customers (Source: IBISWorld, Insurance Brokers &\nAgencies Industry in the US, January 2023).\nIn 2023, the global insurance brokerage & agency market had an estimated value of $436 billion, and is forecasted to grow 7.2% to $468 billion in 2024 and to $613 billion by 2028\n(Source: Research and Markets, Insurance Brokers & Agents Global Market Report 2024). The insurance distribution industry continues to prove its resiliency and the growth is\nreflected in continued robust mergers and acquisition (M&A) activity within the sector, despite decreases as compared to recent prior years. Total deal volume in 2023 was $78\nbillion, 41% lower than in 2022, with a 15% drop in total deals to 1,062 M&A deals in 2023. That said, there were 22 mega-deals of over $1 billion in 2023, a 38% increase over 2022\n(Source: GlobalData, Insurance M&A Deals 2023 – Top Themes – Thematic Intelligence). The drop in deal volume was due to a 40-year high in inflation, rising capital costs and\ntightening budgets. As rate increases have already peaked, companies may allocate more capital to acquisitions. In 2024, there is an expected influx of private equity money into\ninsurance M&A. (Source: Deloitte, 2024 insurance M&A outlook: Climbing the leaderboard).\nThe global InsurTech market size was valued at $16.6 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow to $336.5 billion by 2032, including the highest CAGR of 41.0% between 2023 and 2032\n(Market.us, Global Insurtech Market By Type (Auto, Business, Health, and Other Types), By Deployment (On-Premise, and Cloud Based), By Technology, By Services, By End-\nUser, By Region and Companies - Industry Segment Outlook, Market Assessment, Competition Scenario, Trends, and Forecast 2023-2032). The increasing need for digitization of\ninsurance services is expected to propel the market growth. Insurtech is the usage of technology innovations particularly designed to make the existing insurance model more\nefficient. By using technologies such as AI and data analytics, InsurTech solutions allow products to be priced more competitively. Insurance companies are widely adopting\nthese solutions to drive cheaper, better, and faster operational results. Hence, the insurance industry is witnessing increased investment in technology. The outbreak of COVID-19\nhad a positive impact on the market. Numerous insurance companies are reconsidering their long-term strategies and short-term needs. COVID-19 and its impacts have accelerated\nthe implementation of online platforms and new mobile applications to meet consumer needs. (Sources: Grand View Research, Insurtech Market Size, Share & Growth Report, 2021-\n2028 and 2022 - 2030).\nThe Company therefore has strategically invested in its RELI Exchange and 5MinuteInsure.com online digital platforms as additional steps in expanding its national footprint which\nnow also includes a client referral portal. As discussed above, RELI Exchange and 5MI are high-tech proprietary tools developed by the Company as business to business or\nbusiness to consumer portals which enables agents/consumers to compare and purchase car home and life insurance in a time efficient and effective manner. These platforms tap\ninto the growing number of online users and utilize advanced artificial intelligence and data mining techniques, to provide competitive insurance quotes in around 1-5 minutes, with\nminimal data input needed from the agent/consumer.\n4\nGeneral Industry Outlook\nInsurance brokers and agencies play a critical role within the insurance market by distributing policies and consulting insurance underwriters and consumers. This industry is a\nvital component to the larger insurance sector as industry operators act as intermediaries between insurance providers and downstream consumers. Operators generate income via\ncommissions earned on policies sold. Given the transaction-based nature of the industry, revenue primarily depends on three factors: (1) policy (premium) pricing; (2) demand for\ninsurance; and (3) the popularity of using agents and brokers in the distribution process.\nAs mentioned, the insurance broker and agency industry has grown steadily over the five years due to macroeconomic growth, beneficial legislation that has been passed, and\npositive trends in the insurance sector, achieving approximately $436 billion in revenues in 2023. As macroeconomic conditions improve over the next few years, revenue generated\nby industry operators is expected to increase to $613 billion in 2028 as businesses regain confidence in their financial stability, despite increased external competition from online\ninsurance marketplace platforms.\nInsurance carriers should not continue to depend on the positive (though uncertain) fundamental economic strength of years past to maintain positive balance sheet momentum.\nTo succeed, carriers must address foundational challenges, which include remaining relevant despite systemic economic changes combined with expanding consumer preferences.\nSome of the issues that insurers must address will fall within the areas of mergers and acquisitions (M&A), technology, product development, talent, regulation, as well as tax\nreform, as described below.\n● M&A. The convergence of market pressures to attain sustainable growth, a persistent wealth of capital and capacity, combined with the upturn in interest rates may\ndemonstrate that insurers should be prepared for an uptick in M&A activity in 2024. As it stands now, fairly rich valuations could dampen activity, however, M&A could\noffer opportunities to scale and obtain new capabilities, primarily as it relates to technology.\n● Proprietary Technology. Advancements in AI, mobile and digital technology are forcing insurers to innovate, which is expected to continue and intensify, where every\ninsurance agency will need to focus on what makes their customer experiences and products unique. They will also need to integrate with technology enablers to bring to\ntheir customers a value proposition via a connected ecosystem. Furthermore, to better compete within the industry, those within the distribution system would benefit\ntremendously by improving the ability to share critical data and analytics between systems. Insurers are seeking to employ the cloud to power advanced analytics,\nimprove data gathering, and grow cognitive applications. To keep pace with the industry and prepare for a cloud-enabled future, insurance carriers should prioritize\nmigrating their existing systems to the cloud and launch new applications off-site.\n● Product Development. Economic and technological changes create the need for new types of coverage, revamped policies, and alternative distribution platforms;\nadaptation of this, however, has been slow within the insurance industry. Siloed business lines, legacy processes, and regulatory considerations hinder the rapid and\nagile product development needed within this highly competitive landscape. Accordingly, insurers would benefit by focusing on creating hybrid policies that cover both\ncommercial and personal risks. They could also supply on-demand coverage options, which provide greater control to customers for their policy terms and time frames.\nFurthermore, novel and unique micro-experiences could become the foundation for digital expansion as agencies are distinguished by the niche markets they sell to and\ncan better service versus their peers. Digital content campaigns and user interfaces targeting specialized prospects and customer segments are expected to continue to\nexpand. These micro-experiences could allow agencies to have access to a market that can quote, bind, and service insurance online, and where they are focused on\ncommercial lines and specialty insurance for niche markets. In such a scenario, they may be able to offer new opportunities for agencies to expand quickly via digital\nbuilding blocks that can be easily integrated into existing business and/or workflows.\n5\n● Regulation. Regulation will continue to play a significant role in the operations and development of the insurance industry, with three high-priority compliance issues\n(each with global and domestic implications) facing insurers:\n○ Market conduct. \"Best interest” standards have been implemented and more are being considered at both the federal and state levels to protect consumers who\npurchase annuities and life insurance. In 2020, the NAIC required producers to put the consumer’s interests ahead of their own. Currently, the NAIC’s Suitability\nin Annuity Transactions Model Regulation (#275) has been adopted by 41 states. It aims to protect consumers from potentially abusive and predatory practices\namong life insurance and annuity producers (Source: NAIC, The NAIC Annuity Suitability \"Best Interest” Model Regulation). Additionally, similar standards\nwere adopted in New York (Source: Debevoise & Plimpton, New York’s \"Best Interest” Rule for Life and Annuities Found Constitutional). Due to these\nstandards, insurers should seek to review and adjust their compliance structures to accommodate what could turn into a patchwork oversight system. One\npossibility could be to integrate new technologies that would allow for continual oversight and management of the sales process.\n○ Cyber risk. With New York State’s latest cybersecurity regulations, insurers are facing compliance deadlines, which have formed the basis of a nationwide model\nlaw developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Going forward, the spotlight is likely to be on how insurers plan to manage third-party\nrisks, given so much importance has been placed on migrating policyholder data and software systems to external hosts.\n○ Privacy oversight. Privacy is both a data-security and reputational risk issue given the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) having\nbeen implemented along with similar standards set to be imposed in California. Equally as important is how data can be used moving forward, specifically when it\ncomes to disclosure and consumer signoff. In addition to legal and IT experts, insurers should include multiple stakeholders in its compliance efforts. Over the\nlonger term, carriers may reexamine how the vast amounts of alternative data at their disposal may be leveraged for the mutual benefit not only for the carriers but\ntheir policyholders, while simultaneously remaining compliant with domestic and global regulations.\n● Taxes. The global trend has been to lower corporate income tax rates, with a recent report from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development citing\nsignificant tax reform packages enacted in Argentina, France, Latvia, and the U.S., with other countries introducing more disjointed reforms. U.S. insurers continue to\nfocus on adapting to the changes introduced in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) have\nissued final and proposed guidance on certain important, newly enacted provisions, such as the application of the base erosion and anti-abuse tax to reinsurance, as well\nas the taxation of foreign operations owned by U.S. taxpayers. Additional guidance could be imminent on many other important provisions, including how the new loss\ncarryover rules will fit with the old rules in the context of consolidated returns.\nFurther complexity may come from several areas in 2024, including (Source: Accenture, 5 predictions for the insurance industry in 2024):\n● Monetizing AI, including generative AI such as ChatGPT.\n● Alternative human capital strategies which include the use of generative AI acting as \"supplementary talent.”\n● Cost pressures driving operational model change including allocation methodologies and centralized costs.\n● Risk portfolio shifts and capital reallocation, including shifts into the retirement space as Millennials and GenZ become beneficiaries.\n● Service revenue increases alongside risk capital decreases, to raise RoE, and to expand product offerings in advice and services including tele-health, care navigation, and\nrisk mitigation.\nWhile the industry may need to address internal and external pressures, the impact from these issues will continue to fall within the individual insurer. Thus, since insurers have\nchoice in their decision making process, potentially the most significant factor is likely to be how committed and prepared insurers are to quickly adjust to changes in the economy,\nsociety, and technology, and respond accordingly.\nInsurance Options\nSingle-product platforms limit buyers’ choices and often lead to high costs or insufficient coverage. We’ve partnered with an extensive list of carriers and filter results for buyers\naccording to their needs. This gets them the right coverage at a fair price. From there, they’re connected to an agent who onboards them with minimal friction.\nInsurance Buyers\nInsurance buyers want coverage that fits their needs at a fair price. They also want good customer service. We believe the independent insurance agents, combined with the RELI\nExchange platform can serve these needs best. Our platform makes it easy to weigh the options and connect with a knowledgeable agent with the buyer’s interests in mind.\n6\nExpert Agents\nWe train our agents to evaluate coverages based on buyers’ needs, and to explain options in simple terms. Furthermore, service doesn’t stop there. People’s needs change during\ndifferent life events, and we facilitate adjustments to their coverage when it matters most.\nAgents can revolutionize their insurance businesses—or start a new one on RELI Exchange. They have the freedom to offer coverage from a variety of carriers, utilizing our\ncutting-edge technology, and proven sales system. This is particularly beneficial to captive insurance agents who previously found themselves limited to one carrier and pricing\nmodel. By offering more choices, agents now have more chances of closing business with interested buyers. By partnering with us, agents gain access to a variety of carriers, yet\nare able to streamline their workflows to focus on business development with support from our team and lower marketing costs.\nTop Carriers\nInsurance carriers want to maximize profits without detracting from the customer experience. The challenge is that it’s costly to distribute coverage through independent agents\nwith varying levels of expertise. Some carriers choose the Captive Agent route to save on cost, but RELI Exchange offers a better alternative. We reduce overhead and scale\ndistribution for carriers while maintaining good standards with our technology and back office support team.\nThe performance improvements and lower costs lead to higher customer retention and a better customer experience, which translates to a higher customer lifetime value and more\nprofits for the carrier and the agent.\nLeadership Team\nOur leadership team has over 100 years of combined industry experience.\nEzra Beyman, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, brings nearly three decades of entrepreneurial experience in real estate and fifteen years in insurance.

Prior to starting his own insurance agency, Mr. Fishman was a\nrecognized guru in the travel industry leveraging the technology in the travel sector. This tech savviness has been applied into the insurance and financial services industries with\nthe founding of Fishman Insurance Agency as well as Tekeno Financial. Mr. Fishman is one of the driving talents of the RELI Exchange & 5MinuteInsure.com InsurTech\nplatforms.\nAgency Partner network and proprietary InsurTech platform at ReliExchange.com\nOur Go-to-Market Strategy\nOur Go-to-Market high level goals include:\n● Brand awareness\n● Targeted Market Segmentation and Positioning\n● Content Marketing and Thought Leadership\n● Best in class recruitment team\nTarget #1: Captive\n● When an agent represents one insurance company, they have limited offerings for clients, assuming the same activity they’ll close more business, earning multiples of\nwhat they make currently due to our partnerships with many of the largest carriers in the industry.\n● Key target for Agency Partners\n● Eliminate many of the biggest expenses running an independent agency as an Agency Partner with RELI Exchange.\n8\nTarget #2: Agency Producers/CSRs\n● Agents that want their own agency.\nTarget #3: New Agency Startups\n● Our platform makes it easy for those with little to no experience that want to start their own agency business. This is a significant market with manty potential participants.\nPromotion\nTo meet our agency registration objectives, we have engaged in both inbound and outbound marketing. Outbound sales and marketing includes outreach on social media through\nposts and direct messages using tools on LinkedIn and other platforms, phone, email, and other methods of communication. Inbound marketing is primarily through driving traffic\nto our website through search engines, social media, and digital publicity campaigns. These combined tactics give us a constant influx of marketing qualified leads (MQL) and\nsales qualified leads (SQL) to predictably hit our target metrics each month.\nEmail Marketing\nAs we continue to build our database of customers and prospects, we will implement an effective email marketing campaign. This includes newsletters as well as content flows that\ndrip out over time to keep people engaged. This content is pre-programmed to automatically fire at set intervals whenever someone registers for a list. Through automation, we\ncontinue to build rapport with people who eventually sign up for the service.\nPublic Relations\nThe digital marketing tactics that we use have the following benefits:\n● Increase brand credibility\n● Generate leads\n● Attract investors and partners\n● Make other marketing more effective\n● Attract talent\n● Improve reputation on Google\n● Drive domain authority for SEO\n● Differentiate from competitors\n● Increase perceived value\n● Convert leads faster\n9\nSocial Media\nAs part of our content creation process, we’ve implemented a system for ongoing posts to social media channels such as LinkedIn. Tactics include:\n● Daily social listening – eye-on competitor + industry news + influencer\n● Creative design and content planning\n● Daily posting schedule\n● Real-time events support and live posting\n● Daily monitoring comments and discussions\n● A content coordinator with approving capabilities to approve/direct.\n● Monitoring data, providing monthly reports\n● Weekly meetings with updates on new content, industry news approval etc.…\n● Daily outreach, engagement, and growth of LinkedIn profile.\n● Weekly: 2 posts that demonstrate expertise, experience and thought leadership.\n● Monthly: Strategic growth and visibility\nUsing platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter, we post regular content with the aim of growing our visibility and credibility through social media storytelling. Our goal is to\nmaintain a consistent brand story for customers, prospects, stakeholders, and industry experts.\nPlanning, writing, creating, and posting a mixture of our available assets, plus curated topics on industry trends and influencer thought leadership to provide validation and\nexposure outside of our existing followers, to develop the company story.\nOur initial focus is on LinkedIn, with expansion to other platforms as it makes sense.\nPodcasts\nWe have appeared on several podcasts as subject matter experts, and will continue with outreach to increase exposure, visibility, brand awareness, and sales.\nWebsite Search Engine Optimization\nOur goal is to improve the website to drive more organic traffic through Google and other search engines. The two primary objectives are to create engaging content, and to\nimprove the technical SEO of the website.\nSEO growth opportunities include:\n● SEO Audit and Execution to improve HTML, structured data and other technical issues\n● SEO review of any future site migration and platform upgrade plans as part of the M&A process\n● Information architecture & internal linking for SEO\n● Content topic and structural improvements\n● Keyword Tracking\n● Competitive analysis\nProduct\nOur best-in-class product offerings include the following:\n1) An agency partner contract\n2) An agent / pro contract\n10\nOur value proposition is that we’re giving people a complete, white label business. Agents have a fast and easy website presence, get contracts with carriers they wouldn’t\nnormally access, and they can get paid for referrals.\nPrice\nCosts are very low. Access is approximately $90/month for agents, and $190/month for agency partners. This is a singular solution that gives people an all-in-one insurance\nagency.\nFor comparison, people used to pay about $50,000 to build out an insurance agency. Additionally, licensing can be around $750, with $100-200 in monthly expenditures. RELI\nExchange removes these costly barriers to entry through technology.\nWith the RELI Exchange platform, our vision is to remove all barriers and activate contracted agents at scale. Being cost efficient for these agencies is key to our success. Unlike\nthe franchise model, RELI Exchange is designed with low barriers to entry and a compelling value proposition. In addition, RELI Exchange significantly enhances competitive\nadvantages through provided agency partners.\nPeople (Target Audience)\nWe have identified several highly receptive target audiences, including:\n● Existing insurance agents & agency leadership/owners\n● People looking for a career change (GenX, older Millennials)\n● Experienced salespeople\n● Younger \"quiet quitters” and \"Great Resigners” who want more purposeful, lucrative work & flexibility\n● Recent college graduates with debt & unmarketable degrees with few career options\n● Captive Agents who feel trapped\nThe RELI Exchange Platform\nThe RELI Exchange platform is a revolutionary way to get insurance quotes without requiring users to undergo a complicated process of manually completing lengthy forms. With\nbasic contact information, our proprietary tool can generate accurate home auto and life insurance quotes from credible providers in under 5 minutes, for free. Then, our platform\nconnects each user with a fully trained and knowledgeable agent who guides them through the rest of the process to deliver the best coverage at the best price.\n11\nRELI Exchange is at the forefront of the digital transformation of the insurance industry. Our platform leverages unique technology, a proprietary database, and expert\nmethodologies from experienced insurance agents to deliver a quality experience to agents and people looking to get insured.\nIn addition to providing customers with a great experience, RELI Exchange automates many processes for agents to free up their time to sell to new customers. The result is higher\nprofitability with less work. Most importantly, mentorship is part of the RELI Exchange model, so that agents always receive the support they need to be successful.\nSystem for Agent and Agency Partner Success\nRELI Exchange agents have a distinct advantage over their captive counterparts when it comes to serving clients. They have access to multiple carriers in their markets, to provide\nmore choices and solutions that fit their customers’ needs. Additionally, our automations and back-office support eliminate time spent on service requests and renewals, so agents\ncan focus on sales growth.\nWe spent years developing our proprietary sales processes, backed up by an engaging mentorship program to maximize agent success. We provide every agent with\ncomprehensive training, product and carrier knowledge, and cutting-edge technology. Plus, our back-office support team is readily available to train and assist agents at every\nstep.\nWe actively recruit agents who are passionate about owning their own business and have a proven track record in business development. Our revenues are tied directly to their\nsuccess, creating an environment that delivers consistent results.\nAgents benefit from low startup costs and minimal overhead—no employees or physical location is required. In contrast, captive agents are often burdened with immediate hiring\nrequirements, storefront leases, and advertising budgets. Moreover, our software platform delivers economies of scale so that fixed and variable costs are reduced for greater\nprofitability.\nOnline Insurance and 5MinuteInsure.com\nIn August 2021, we launched 5MinuteInsure.com, which is a licensed online insurance agency that utilizes state of the art digital technology and seek to use this platform to\ndevelop business in the online insurance business which we believe represents an underutilized opportunity.\nWhile 90% of customers are open to purchasing insurance online, 75% of the people who attempt to make online purchases report problems (Source: J.D. Power, Direct-to-\nConsumer Auto Insurers Take Top Honors in Shopping Study as New Normal Arrives for P&C Industry, J.D. Power Finds; Invoca, 36 Insurance Marketing Statistics You Need\nto Know in 2023). Moreover, the current insurance purchasing processes is time consuming and lacks transparency. There are over 96 insurance companies paying thousands of\naffiliates to generate leads, paying as much as $120 per lead (Source: The Insurance Marketer, Best Life Insurance Affiliate Programs: How Much Can You Earn?; Lasso, The 96\nBest Insurance Affiliate Programs of 2023). Consequently, most of the current online sites are simply lead generators, which result in false insurance quotes, constant spam and\naggressive sales pitches. We believe consumers are looking for an online platform that will replicate the services they could obtain from a traditional brick and mortar insurance\nagency, thus driving business toward the online site as we all migrate to online in this post COVID world.\nAnother key benefit to online insurance is the ability to combine seamlessly with electronic capabilities in processing, such as 5MinuteInsure.com’s proprietary backend\nprocessing technology to support our traditional agency business. 5MinuteInsure.com will be used internally by all the Reliance Global Group affiliated agencies to offer more\nproducts to our existing client base. By implementing artificial intelligence, robotic process automation and automatic shopping for best rates at renewals, we believe we can\ndramatically reduce costs, and allow our agents to focus on selling new policies, creating a digitally empowered and scalable insurance agency model.\n12\nSpecific benefits of the 5MinuteInsure.com platform include:\n● First, a simplified application process\n● Second, 5MinuteInsure.com has real-time connections with over 15 top-rated insurance companies, which allows consumers to transparently compare real live quotes\nfrom multiple insurers side-by-side.\n● Third, 5MinuteInsure.com provides instant accurate coverage recommendations for home, auto and life insurance, providing consumers confidence they are not under or\nover-insured.\n● Fourth, 5MinuteInsure.com provides in-house insurance buying and policy binding capabilities, meaning no redirection to other websites and the ability to finalize\npurchases on 5MinuteInsure.com in as little as five minutes.\n● Fifth, coming soon is 5MinuteInsure’s free and secure account enables 24/7 access to previous quotes, policies and other documents.\n● Finally, when it’s time for a policy renewal, 5MinuteInsure.com can populate the best offers in the market before their policy expires.\nThus, we believe in the specific benefits of the online insurance business, and we believe that 5MinuteInsure.com provides the platform to transform this segment of the industry.\nBusiness Operations (OneFirm)\nReliance Global Group has adopted a ‘One-Firm’ approach, whereby the Reliance owned and operated agencies come together to operate as one cohesive unit which allows for\nefficient and effective cross-selling, cross-collaboration, and the effective deployment of the Company’s human capital. This strategy also aims to enhance the Company’s overall\nmarket presence across the U.S., with all business lines operating under the RELI Exchange brand. It’s expected to benefit agents and clients by improving relationships with\ncarriers, leading to better commission and bonus contracts due to higher business volumes. The approach also strengthens the capability of RELI Exchange agency partners in\nsecuring diverse insurance policies and fosters increased cross-selling opportunities. This unified strategy positions the company for rapid scaling and integration of accretive\nacquisitions, expanding its industry reach.\nInsurance M&A Overview\nAs noted above, M&A deal volume in the insurance agency market remains robust with $78 billion in deals during 2023, despite drops as compared prior recent years and 2024 is\nexpected to bring more acquisition opportunities.\n13\nThe COVID-19 crisis may have an impact on the insurance industry for quite some time. Some factors to consider:\n● Strain on investment portfolios – Insurance companies rely on their investment portfolios to generate returns. Markets have been in turmoil and, as a result, insurers’\ninvestment portfolios may be significantly impacted.\n● Delayed payments – Regulators are urging insurance companies to accept late premium payments with no penalty, putting a strain on cash flow. Despite liquidity being\nimpacted, insurance companies are still being expected to pay out claims.\n● Decreased premium volume – Full or partial closing of businesses coupled with social distancing has led to decreased demand for insurance. Lower payroll levels lead to\nlower payroll-based premiums, such as those in workers’ compensation, and an uptick in layoffs results in fewer people buying houses, cars, and other insurable\npurchases. A decrease in premium volume means a decrease in income for insurers.\n● Coverage disputes – Pandemics are generally excluded from insurance policy coverage and therefore policy premium has not included the necessary charges to provide\nsuch coverage. A number of states are attempting to legislate to force insurance companies to provide insurance coverage for business interruption and other losses for\nclaims resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. There is uncertainty regarding which party will ultimately incur the additional cost for these adjustments.\nWe cannot presently estimate the full financial impact of the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic on our business or predict the related federal, state and local civil authority\nactions, which are highly dependent on the severity and duration of the pandemic; however, we see opportunities which may arise as to changes in the markets. Due to the\nuncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the indeterminate length of time it will affect, we have taken proactive measures to secure our liquidity position to be\nable to meet our obligations for the foreseeable future.\nReliance Insurance Agency Brand Acquisitions:\n● RELI Exchange\n● Altruis Benefits\n● J.P. Kush & Associates\n● US Benefits Alliance\n● Employee Benefits Solutions\n● Fortman Insurance Solutions\n● Southwestern Montana Insurance Center\n● UIS Agency\n● Commercial Coverage Solutions\nAcquisition History\n● In October 2018, announced first two acquisitions: Employee Benefits Solutions and U.S. Benefits Alliance; Michigan-based agencies specializing in the sale of health\ninsurance products in the wholesale and retail industry\n● In December 2018, acquired Commercial Coverage Solutions, LLC, a commercial property and casualty insurance company specializing in commercial trucking and\ntransportation insurance\n14\n● In September 2019, two agencies transferred ownership from Reliance Global Holdings, LLC, a private company affiliated with Reliance Global Group:\nØ Southwestern Montana Insurance, a group health insurance agency providing personal and commercial lines of insurance\nØ Fortman Insurance Agency, LLC, an agency providing multiple lines of insurance in the property/casualty and life/health insurance sectors\n● In September 2019, acquired Altruis Benefit Consulting; serves customers throughout the entire State of Michigan, specializing in providing individual and group health\ninsurance\n● In September 2020, acquired the assets of UIS Agency, LLC (UIS), a premier regional insurance agency serving the commercial transportation industry\n● In May 2021, acquired J.P.

We will continue to focus on the hiring, retention, and advancement of underrepresented populations, and to\ncultivate an inclusive and diverse corporate culture. In the future, we intend to continue to evaluate our use of human capital measures or objectives in managing our business\nsuch as the factors we employ or seek to employ in the development, attraction and retention of personnel and maintenance of diversity in our workforce.\n15\nThe success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We\nprovide our employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible and convenient health and wellness programs, including benefits that provide protection\nand security so they can have peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work or that impact their financial well-being; that support their physical and\nmental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors; and that offer choice where\npossible so they can customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families.\nWe also provide robust compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. We believe that we maintain a satisfactory working relationship with our\nemployees and have not experienced any labor disputes.\nCompetition\nThe insurance brokerage business is highly competitive, and numerous firms actively compete with us for customers and insurance markets. Competition is largely based upon\ninnovation, knowledge, terms and conditions of coverage, quality of service and price. We believe that we’re well positioned to be highly competitive and continuously gain\nmarket share. Additionally, our focus on InsurTech is a game-changer in the industry and helps us stand-out vs. the competition.\nThe Merger and Acquisition of Insurance Agencies is a highly competitive industry, as well. Competition is due to many well-established companies having extensive experience\nin identifying and effecting business combinations who possess great technical, human, and financial resources. Several firms and banks with substantially greater resources and\nmarket presence compete with us. While we believe that there are numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable\ntarget businesses might be limited.\nGovernment Regulation\nThe business practices and compensation arrangements of the insurance intermediary industry, including our practices and arrangements, are regulated by various governmental\nauthorities. Certain of our offices are parties to profit-sharing contingent commission agreements with certain insurance companies, including agreements providing for potential\npayment of revenue-sharing commissions by insurance companies based primarily on the overall profitability of the aggregate business written with those insurance companies\nand/or additional factors such as retention ratios and the overall volume of business that an office or offices place with those insurance companies. The legislatures of various\nstates may adopt new laws addressing contingent commission arrangements, including laws prohibiting such arrangements, and addressing disclosure of such arrangements to\ninsureds.\nWe and our employees must be licensed to act as brokers, intermediaries, or third-party administrators by state regulatory authorities in the locations in which we conduct\nbusiness. Regulations and licensing laws vary by individual state and are often complex. The applicable licensing laws and regulations in all states are subject to amendment or\nreinterpretation by regulatory authorities, and such authorities are vested in most cases with relatively broad discretion as to the granting, revocation, suspension, and renewal of\nlicenses. We believe that we are in compliance with the applicable licensing laws and regulations of all states in which we currently operate. However, the possibility still exists that\nwe or our employees could be excluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities in, or could otherwise be subjected to penalties by, a particular\njurisdiction.\nNearly all states have insurance laws requiring personal property and casualty insurers to file rating plans, policy or coverage forms, and other information with the state’s\nregulatory authority. In many cases, such rating plans, policy, or coverage forms, must be approved prior to use and the regulator has the authority to disapprove a rate filing.\nWhile we are not an insurer, and thus not required to comply with state laws and regulations regarding insurance rates, our commissions are derived from a percentage of the\npremium rates set by insurers in conjunction with state law.\n16\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following important factors, among others, could cause our actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated or suggested by forward-looking statements\nmade in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or presented elsewhere by management from time to time. Investors should carefully consider the risks described below before\nmaking an investment decision. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not\nmaterial may also significantly impair our business operations. Our business could be harmed by any of these risks. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to\nany of these risks, and investors may lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results.\nFluctuations in our quarterly and annual financial results have resulted and will continue to result from numerous factors, including:\n● The Company having a limited operating history\n● The Company has limited resources and there is significant competition for business combination opportunities. Therefore, the Company may not be able to acquire other\nassets or businesses\n● The Company may be unable to obtain additional financing, if required, to complete an acquisition, or to complement the operations and growth of existing and target\nbusiness, which could compel the Company to restructure a potential business transaction or abandon a particular business combination\n● We hold our cash and cash equivalents that we use to meet our working capital and operating expense needs in deposit accounts that could be adversely affected if the\nfinancial institution holding such funds fail.\n● Our inability to retain or hire qualified employees, as well as the loss of any of our executive officers, could negatively impact our ability to retain existing business and\ngenerate new business\n● Our growth strategy depends, in part, on the acquisition of other insurance intermediaries, which may not be available on acceptable terms in the future or which, if\nconsummated, may not be advantageous to us\n● A cybersecurity attack, or any other interruption in information technology and/or data security and/or outsourcing relationships, could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and reputation\n● Rapid technological change may require additional resources and time to adequately respond to dynamics, which may adversely affect our business and operating results\n● Changes in data privacy and protection laws and regulations, or any failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could adversely affect our business and financial\nresults\n● Because our insurance business is highly concentrated in Michigan, New York, Montana, New Jersey, Ohio, and Illinois adverse economic conditions, natural disasters,\nor regulatory changes in these regions could adversely affect our financial condition\n● If we fail to comply with the covenants contained in certain of our agreements, our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected\n● Certain of our agreements contain various covenants that limit the discretion of our management in operating our business and could prevent us from engaging in certain\npotentially beneficial activities\n● There are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States\nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP). Any changes in estimates, judgments and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial\nposition and results of operations and therefore our business\n● Improper disclosure of confidential information could negatively impact our business\n● Our business could be adversely impacted by inflation.\nThese factors, some of which are not within our control, may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. If our operating results fail to meet or exceed the\nexpectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could drop suddenly and significantly. Due to the Company’s limited operating history, we believe period to period\ncomparisons of our financial results are not always meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.\n17\nThe Company has limited resources and there is significant competition for business combination opportunities. Therefore, the Company may not be able to acquire other\nassets or businesses.\nThe Company expects to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, which are also competing for acquisitions. Many of these\nentities are well established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess\ngreater technical, human, financial and other resources. While the Company believes that there are numerous potential target businesses that it could acquire, the Company’s\nability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses might be limited if the Company’s limited financial resources are less than that of its competitors. This inherent\ncompetitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses.\nThe Company may be unable to obtain additional financing, if required, to complete an acquisition, or to Company the operations and growth of existing and target\nbusiness, which could compel the Company to restructure a potential business transaction or abandon a particular business combination.\nTo date, much of our capital for acquiring and operating insurance agencies comes from loans from unaffiliated lenders, from direct market capital raises or funds provided by\nReliance Global Holdings our affiliate. We may be required to seek additional financing. We cannot assure you that such financing would be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nIf additional financing proves to be unavailable, we would be compelled to restructure or existing business, or abandon a proposed acquisition or acquisitions. In addition, if we\nconsummate additional acquisitions, we may require additional financing to complement the operations or growth of that business. The failure to secure additional financing could\nhave a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of our business.\nWe hold our cash and cash equivalents that we use to meet our working capital and operating expense needs in deposit accounts that could be adversely affected if the\nfinancial institution holding such funds fail.\nWe hold our cash and cash equivalents that we use to meet our working capital and operating expense needs in deposit accounts at one financial institution. The balance held in\nthese accounts exceeds the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, standard deposit insurance limit of $250,000. If the financial institution in which we hold such funds\nfails or is subject to significant adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets, we could be subject to a risk of loss of all or a portion of such uninsured funds or be subject to\na delay in accessing all or a portion of such uninsured funds. Any such loss or lack of access to these funds could adversely impact our short-term liquidity and ability to meet our\noperating expense obligations, including payroll obligations.\nFor example, on March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, and Signature Bank, were closed by state regulators and the FDIC was appointed receiver for each bank. The FDIC\ncreated successor bridge banks and all deposits of SVB and Signature Bank were transferred to the bridge banks under a systemic risk exception approved by the United States\nDepartment of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. If the financial institution in which we hold funds for working capital and operating expenses were to fail, we cannot\nprovide any assurances that such governmental agencies would take action to protect our uninsured deposits or investments in a similar manner.\nOur inability to retain or hire qualified employees, as well as the loss of any of our executive officers, could negatively impact our ability to retain existing business and\ngenerate new business.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel. There is significant competition from within the insurance industry and from businesses\noutside the industries for exceptional employees, especially in key positions. If we are not able to successfully attract, retain and motivate our employees, our business, financial\nresults and reputation could be materially and adversely affected.\n18\nLosing employees who manage or support substantial customer relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and\ncomplete customer engagements, which would adversely affect our results of operations. Also, if any of our key personnel were to join an existing competitor or form a competing\ncompany, some of our customers could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services. While our key personnel are generally prohibited by contract from\nsoliciting our employees and customers for a two-year period following separation from employment with us, they are not prohibited from competing with us.\nIn addition, we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our senior leaders and key executives. We cannot guarantee that the services of these\nexecutives will continue to be available to us. The loss of our senior leaders or other key personnel, or our inability to continue to identify, recruit and retain such personnel, or to\ndo so at reasonable compensation levels, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur growth strategy depends, in part, on the acquisition of other insurance intermediaries, which may not be available on acceptable terms in the future or which, if\nconsummated, may not be advantageous to us.\nOur growth strategy partially includes the acquisition of other insurance intermediaries. Our ability to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions,\nintegrate acquired businesses into our operations, and expand into new markets requires us to implement and continuously improve our operations and our financial and\nmanagement information systems. Integrated, acquired businesses may not achieve levels of revenues or profitability comparable to our existing operations, or otherwise perform\nas expected. In addition, we compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with firms and banks that may have substantially greater resources than we do. Acquisitions also\ninvolve a number of special risks, such as diversion of management’s attention; difficulties in the integration of acquired operations and retention of personnel; increase in\nexpenses and working capital requirements, which could reduce our return on invested capital; entry into unfamiliar markets or lines of business; unanticipated problems or legal\nliabilities; estimation of the acquisition earn-out payables; and tax and accounting issues, some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations,\nfinancial condition and cash flows. Post-acquisition deterioration of operating performance could also result in lower or negative earnings contribution and/or goodwill impairment\ncharges.\nA cybersecurity attack, or any other interruption in information technology and/or data security and/or outsourcing relationships, could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and reputation.\nWe rely on information technology and third-party vendors to provide effective and efficient service to our customers, process claims, and timely and accurately report information\nto carriers and which often involves secure processing of confidential sensitive, proprietary, and other types of information. Cybersecurity breaches of any of the systems we rely\non may result from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks or other cyber-attacks, hacking, \"phishing” attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware,\nemployee or insider error, malfeasance, social engineering, physical breaches, or other actions, any of which could expose us to data loss, monetary and reputational damages and\nsignificant increases in compliance costs. An interruption of our access to, or an inability to access, our information technology, telecommunications or other systems could\nsignificantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis. If sustained or repeated, such a business interruption, system failure or service denial could result in a\ndeterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions.\nWe have from time-to-time experienced cybersecurity breaches, such as computer viruses, unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and similar\nincidents, which to date have not had a material impact on our business.\nAdditionally, we are an acquisitive organization and the process of integrating the information systems of the businesses we acquire is complex and exposes us to additional risk\nas we might not adequately identify weaknesses in the targets’ information systems, which could expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own systems more vulnerable to\nattack. In the future, any material breaches of cybersecurity, or media reports of the same, even if untrue, could cause us to experience reputational harm, loss of clients and\nrevenue, loss of proprietary data, regulatory actions and scrutiny, sanctions or other statutory penalties, litigation, liability for failure to safeguard clients’ information or financial\nlosses. Such losses may not be insured against or not fully covered through insurance we maintain.\n19\nRapid technological change may require additional resources and time to adequately respond to dynamics, which may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nFrequent technological changes, new products and services and evolving industry standards are influencing the insurance businesses. The Internet, for example, is increasingly\nused to securely transmit benefits, property and personal information, and related information to customers and to facilitate business-to-business information exchange and\ntransactions.\nWe are continuously taking steps to upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities. Maintaining, protecting, and enhancing these capabilities to keep pace with\nevolving industry and regulatory standards, and changing customer preferences, requires an ongoing commitment of significant resources. If the information we rely upon to run\nour businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to effectively maintain our information systems and data integrity, we could experience operational disruptions,\nregulatory or other legal problems, increases in operating expenses, loss of existing customers, difficulty in attracting new customers, or suffer other adverse consequences.\nChanges in data privacy and protection laws and regulations, or any failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could adversely affect our business and financial\nresults.\nWe are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations globally regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to\nthe collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data. Significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and\napplied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. These laws apply to transfers of information among our affiliates, as well as to\ntransactions we enter into with third party vendors. These and similar initiatives around the world could increase the cost of developing, implementing, or securing our servers and\nrequire us to allocate more resources to improved technologies, adding to our information technology and compliance costs. In addition, enforcement actions and investigations\nby regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase. The enactment of more restrictive laws, rules, regulations or future\nenforcement actions or investigations could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business, and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and\nsignificant legal liability.\nBecause our insurance business is highly concentrated in Michigan, New York, Montana, New Jersey, Ohio, and Illinois adverse economic conditions, natural disasters, or\nregulatory changes in these regions could adversely affect our financial condition.\nA significant portion of our insurance business is concentrated in Michigan, New York, Montana, New Jersey, Ohio, and Illinois. For the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022\nwe derived $13,731,826 and $11,761,882 respectively or 100% of our annual revenue, respectively, from our operations located in these regions (FYE 2023 - Michigan – 55%, New\nYork – 2%, Montana – 14% and Ohio – 16%, and Illinois – 13%. FYE 2022 - Michigan – 55%, New York – 2%, Montana – 16%, Ohio – 18%, and Illinois – 9%.). The insurance\nbusiness is primarily a state-regulated industry, and therefore, state legislatures may enact laws that adversely affect the insurance industry. Because our business is concentrated\nin these four states, we face greater exposure to unfavorable changes in regulatory conditions in those states than insurance intermediaries whose operations are more diversified\nthrough a greater number of states. In addition, the occurrence of adverse economic conditions, natural or other disasters, or other circumstances specific to or otherwise\nsignificantly impacting these states could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by\nhurricanes or other weather conditions, and other possible events such as terrorist acts and other natural or man-made disasters. Our insurance coverage with respect to natural\ndisasters is limited and is subject to deductibles and coverage limits. Such coverage may not be adequate or may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and\nterms.\n20\nIf we fail to comply with the covenants contained in certain of our agreements, our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nThe Oak Street credit agreements, in the aggregate principal amount of $12,417,737 and $13,468,394, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, that govern our debt contain various\ncovenants and other limitations with which we must comply including a debt to EBITDA ratio covenant and a covenant that at all times that the loans are outstanding: (i) Ezra\nBeyman, our chief executive officer, Debra Beyman, Mr. Beyman’s wife, or Yaakov Beyman, son of Mr. and Ms. Beyman, or someone else approved by Oak Street, as applicable,\nwill be the manager of the current subsidiaries of the Company, (ii) Mr. Ezra Beyman will be President and Chairperson of the Board of the Company, and (iii) Reliance Global\nHoldings will continue to remain a shareholder of the Company’s equity and Ezra and Debra will be the sole owners of Reliance Global Holdings as tenants in entirety. The credit\nagreements also contain provisions which cause a \"cross default” if we default our obligations under other material contracts to which we are parties. The credit agreements\ncontain customary and usual events of default, including, subject to certain specified cure periods and notice requirements, the Company’s or one of its subsidiaries’ failure to\ncomply with the covenants therein. Upon an event of default, the lender has customary and usual remedies to cure these defaults including, but not limited to, the ability to\naccelerate the indebtedness.\nThe credit agreements contain financial covenants including debt service coverage ratio and debt to EBIDTA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) tests.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company is in compliance with all financial covenants.\nCertain of our agreements contain various covenants that limit the discretion of our management in operating our business and could prevent us from engaging in certain\npotentially beneficial activities.\nThe restrictive covenants in our debt agreements may impact how we operate our business and prevent us from engaging in certain potentially beneficial activities. Among other\ncovenants, our debt agreements require us to maintain a minimum ratio of Consolidated EBITDA, adjusted for certain transaction-related items (\"Consolidated EBITDA”), to\nconsolidated interest expense and a maximum ratio of consolidated net indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA. Our compliance with these covenants could limit management’s\ndiscretion in operating our business and could prevent us from engaging in certain potentially beneficial activities.\nThere are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Any\nchanges in estimates, judgments and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and therefore our business.\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP involves making estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets (including\nintangible assets), liabilities and related reserves, revenues, expenses, and income. Estimates, judgments and assumptions are inherently subject to change in the future, and any\nsuch changes could result in corresponding changes to the values of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and income, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial\nposition, results of operations and cash flows.\nImproper disclosure of confidential information could negatively impact our business.\nWe are responsible for maintaining the security and privacy of our customers’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees. We have put in\nplace policies, procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information; however, we cannot guarantee that this information will\nnot be improperly disclosed or accessed. Disclosure of this information could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal\ndata, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues.\n21\nOur business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected by certain actual and potential claims, regulatory actions and\nproceedings.\nWe are subject to various actual and potential claims, regulatory actions and other proceedings including those relating to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the\nplacement or servicing of insurance and/or the provision of services in the ordinary course of business, of which we cannot, and likely will not be able to, predict the outcome with\ncertainty. Because we often assist customers with matters involving substantial amounts of money, including the placement of insurance and the handling of related claims that\ncustomers may assert, errors and omissions claims against us may arise alleging potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question. Also, the failure of an insurer with\nwhom we place business could result in errors and omissions claims against us by our customers, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nClaimants may seek large damage awards, and these claims may involve potentially significant legal costs, including punitive damages. Such claims, lawsuits and other\nproceedings could, for example, include claims for damages based upon allegations that our employees or sub-agents failed to procure coverage, report claims on behalf of\ncustomers, provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or appropriately apply funds that we hold for our customers on\na fiduciary basis. In addition, given the long-tail nature of professional liability claims, errors and omissions matters can relate to matters dating back many years. Where\nappropriate, we have established provisions against these potential matters that we believe to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice, and we adjust such\nprovisions from time to time according to developments.\nWhile most of the errors and omissions claims made against us (subject to our self-insured deductibles) have been covered by our professional indemnity insurance, our business,\nresults of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if, in the future, our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable, or if there is an\nincrease in liabilities for which we self-insure. Our ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles we desire in the future may be\nadversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or our own claims experience. In addition, regardless of monetary costs, these matters could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our reputation and cause harm to our carrier, customer or employee relationships, or divert personnel and management resources.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by inflation.\nIncreases in inflation may have an adverse effect on our business. Current and future inflationary effects may be driven by, among other things, supply chain disruptions and\ngovernmental stimulus or fiscal policies. Continuing increases in inflation could impact the overall demand for our products, our costs for labor, material and services, and the\nmargins we are able to realize on our products, all of which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Inflation may\nalso result in higher interest rates, which in turn would result in higher interest.\nRisks Related to the Insurance Industry\nWe may experience increased competition from insurance companies, technology companies and the financial services industry, as well as the shift away from traditional\ninsurance markets.\nThe insurance intermediary business is highly competitive and we actively compete with numerous firms for customers, properties and insurance companies, many of which have\nrelationships with insurance companies, or have a significant presence in niche insurance markets that may give them an advantage over us. Other competitive concerns may\ninclude the quality of our products and services, our pricing, and the ability of some of our customers to self-insure and the entrance of technology companies into the insurance\nintermediary business. Several insurance companies are engaged in the direct sale of insurance, primarily to individuals, and do not pay commissions to agents and brokers. In\naddition, and to the extent that banks, securities firms, private equity companies, and insurance companies affiliate, the financial services industry may experience further\nconsolidation, and we therefore may experience increased competition from insurance companies and the financial services industry, as a growing number of larger financial\ninstitutions increasingly, and aggressively, offer a wider variety of financial services, including insurance intermediary services.\n22\nWorsening of Current U.S. economic conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian Federation Military Action may adversely affect our business.\nManagement continues to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the industry and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus could have a\nnegative effect on the Company’s financial position or results of its operations, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of the financial statements. The\nfinancial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nIn February 2022, the Russian Federation and Belarus commenced a military action with the country of Ukraine. As a result of this action, various nations, including the United\nStates, have instituted economic sanctions against the Russian Federation and Belarus. Further, the impact of this action and related sanctions on the world economy are not\ndeterminable as of the date of these financial statements and the specific impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows is also not\ndeterminable as of the date of these financial statements.\nIf economic conditions were to worsen, a number of negative effects on our business could result, including declines in values of insurable exposure units, declines in insurance\npremium rates, the financial insolvency of insurance companies, the reduced ability of customers to pay, declines in the stock of residential housing or declines in property values.\nAlso, if general economic conditions are poor, some of our customers may cease operations completely or be acquired by other companies, which could have an adverse effect on\nour results of operations and financial condition. If these customers are affected by poor economic conditions, but yet remain in existence, they may face liquidity problems or\nother financial difficulties that could result in delays or defaults in payments owed to us, which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and\nresults of operations. Any of these effects could decrease our net revenues and profitability.\nOur business, and therefore our results of operations and financial condition, may be adversely affected by conditions that result in reduced insurer capacity.\nOur results of operations depend on the continued capacity of insurance carriers to underwrite risk and provide coverage, which depends in turn on those insurance companies’\nability to procure reinsurance. Capacity could also be reduced by insurance companies failing or withdrawing from writing certain coverages that we offer to our customers. We\nhave no control over these matters. To the extent that reinsurance becomes less widely available or significantly more expensive, we may not be able to procure the amount or\ntypes of coverage that our customers desire and the coverage we are able to procure for our customers may be more expensive or limited.\nQuarterly and annual variations in our commissions that result from the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production may have\nunexpected effects on our results of operations.\nOur commission income (including profit-sharing contingent commissions and override commissions) can vary quarterly or annually due to the timing of policy renewals and the\nnet effect of new and lost business production. We do not control the factors that cause these variations. Specifically, customers’ demand for insurance products can influence the\ntiming of renewals, new business, and lost business (which includes policies that are not renewed), and cancellations. In addition, we rely on insurance companies for the payment\nof certain commissions. Because these payments are processed internally by these insurance companies, we may not receive a payment that is otherwise expected from a particular\ninsurance company in a particular quarter or year until after the end of that period, which can adversely affect our ability to forecast these revenues and therefore budget for\nsignificant future expenditures. Quarterly and annual fluctuations in revenues based upon increases and decreases associated with the timing of new business, policy renewals\nand payments from insurance companies may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nProfit-sharing contingent commissions are special revenue-sharing commissions paid by insurance companies based upon the profitability, volume and/or growth of the business\nplaced with such companies generally during the prior year. Override commissions are paid by insurance companies based upon the volume of business that we place with them\nand are generally paid over the course of the year. Because profit-sharing contingent commissions and override commissions affect our revenues, any decrease in their payment to\nus could adversely affect our results of operations, profitability, and our financial condition.\n23\nOur business practices and compensation arrangements are subject to uncertainty due to potential changes in regulations.\nThe business practices and compensation arrangements of the insurance intermediary industry, including our practices and arrangements, are subject to uncertainty due to\ninvestigations by various governmental authorities. Certain of our offices are parties to profit-sharing contingent commission agreements with certain insurance companies,\nincluding agreements providing for potential payment of revenue-sharing commissions by insurance companies based primarily on the overall profitability of the aggregate\nbusiness written with those insurance companies and/or additional factors such as retention ratios and the overall volume of business that an office or offices place with those\ninsurance companies. Additionally, to a lesser extent, some of our offices are parties to override commission agreements with certain insurance companies, which provide for\ncommission rates in excess of standard commission rates to be applied to specific lines of business, such as group health business, and which are based primarily on the overall\nvolume of business that such office or offices placed with those insurance companies. The legislatures of various states may adopt new laws addressing contingent commission\narrangements, including laws prohibiting such arrangements, and addressing disclosure of such arrangements to insureds. Various state departments of insurance may also adopt\nnew regulations addressing these matters which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisk of lack of knowledge in distant geographic markets\nAlthough the Company intends to focus its investments in locations with which we are generally familiar, the Company runs a risk of experiencing underwriting challenges or\nissues associated with a lack of familiarity in some markets. Each market has nuances and idiosyncrasies that affect values, marketability, desirability, and demand for individual\nassets that may not be easily understood from afar. While we believe we can effectively mitigate these risks in a myriad of ways, there is no guarantee that investments in any\ngeographic market will perform as expected.\nPotential liability or other expenditures associated with potential environmental contamination may be costly.\nVarious federal, state, and local laws subject multifamily residential community owners or operators to liability for management, and the costs of removal or remediation, of certain\npotentially hazardous materials that may be present in the land or buildings of a multifamily residential community. Potentially hazardous materials may include polychlorinated\nbiphenyls, petroleum-based fuels, lead-based paint or asbestos, among other materials. Such laws often impose liability without regard to fault or whether the owner or operator\nknew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such materials. The presence of, or the failure to manage or remediate properly, these materials may adversely affect occupancy at\nsuch apartment communities as well as the ability to sell or finance such apartment communities. In addition, governmental agencies may bring claims for costs associated with\ninvestigation and remediation actions, damages to natural resources and for potential fines or penalties in connection with such damage or with respect to the improper\nmanagement of hazardous materials. Moreover, private plaintiffs may potentially make claims for investigation and remediation costs they incur or personal injury, disease,\ndisability or other infirmities related to the alleged presence of hazardous materials at a multifamily residential community. In addition to potential environmental liabilities or costs\nassociated with our current multifamily residential communities, we may also be responsible for such liabilities or costs associated with communities we acquire or manage in the\nfuture, or multifamily residential communities we no longer own or operate.\n24\nWe compete in a highly regulated industry, which may result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations.\nWe conduct business in several states of the United States of America and are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by government agencies in each of those\nstates. The primary purpose of such regulation and supervision is to provide safeguards for policyholders rather than to protect the interests of our shareholders, and it is difficult\nto anticipate how changes in such regulation would be implemented and enforced. As a result, such regulation and supervision could reduce our profitability or growth by\nincreasing compliance costs, technology compliance, restricting the products or services we may sell, the markets we may enter, the methods by which we may sell our products\nand services, or the prices we may charge for our services and the form of compensation we may accept from our customers, carriers and third parties.\nThe laws of the various state jurisdictions establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers with respect to, among other things, licensing of entities to transact\nbusiness, licensing of agents, admittance of assets, regulating premium rates, approving policy forms, regulating unfair trade and claims practices, determining technology and data\nprotection requirements, establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards, requiring participation in guarantee funds and shared market mechanisms, and restricting\npayment of dividends. Also, in response to perceived excessive cost or inadequacy of available insurance, states have from time to time created state insurance funds and\nassigned risk pools, which compete directly, on a subsidized basis, with private insurance providers. We act as agents and brokers for such state insurance funds and assigned\nrisk pools in Michigan as well as certain other states. These state funds and pools could choose to reduce the sales or brokerage commissions we receive. Any such reductions, in\na state in which we have substantial operations could affect the profitability of our operations in such state or cause us to change our marketing focus.\nFurther, state insurance regulators and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners continually re-examine existing laws and regulations, and such re-examination may\nresult in the enactment of insurance-related laws and regulations, or the issuance of interpretations thereof, that adversely affect our business. Certain federal financial services\nmodernization legislation could lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years, which could result in increased expenses or restrictions on our\noperations.\nOther legislative developments that could adversely affect us include: changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory developments (for example, the\nAffordable Care Act); and federal and state governments establishing programs to provide health insurance or, in certain cases, property insurance in catastrophe-prone areas or\nother alternative market types of coverage, that compete with, or completely replace, insurance products offered by insurance carriers. Also, as climate change issues become more\nprevalent, the U.S. and foreign governments are beginning to respond to these issues. This increasing governmental focus on climate change may result in new environmental\nregulations that may negatively affect us and our customers. This could cause us to incur additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental regulations, as well as\nincreased indirect costs resulting from our customers incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us. These costs may adversely impact our results of operations\nand financial condition.\nAlthough we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable local, state, and federal laws, rules and regulations, there can be no assurance that more\nrestrictive laws, rules, regulations or interpretations thereof, will not be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult or expensive.\n25\nRisks Related to Investing in our Securities\nWe may experience volatility in our stock price that could affect your investment.\nThe market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations in response to various factors, including: quarterly fluctuations in our operating results; changes\nin securities analysts’ estimates of our future earnings; changes in securities analysts’ predictions regarding the short-term and long-term future of our industry; changes to the tax\ncode; and our loss of significant customers or significant business developments relating to us or our competitors. Our common stock’s market price also may be affected by our\ninability to meet stock analysts’ earnings and other expectations. Any failure to meet such expectations, even if minor, could cause the market price of our common stock to\ndecline. In addition, stock markets have generally experienced a high level of price and volume volatility, and the market prices of equity securities of many listed companies have\nexperienced wide price fluctuations not necessarily related to the operating performance of such companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect our common\nstock’s market price. In the past, securities class action lawsuits frequently have been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of such\ncompanies’ securities. If any such litigation is initiated against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market could result in a delisting of our common stock.\nOur shares of common stock are currently listed on Nasdaq. If we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market, such as the corporate\ngovernance requirements, minimum bid price requirement or the minimum stockholders’ equity requirement, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our common stock. Any delisting\nwould likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair stockholders’ ability to sell or purchase their common stock when they wish to do so.\nAs previously disclosed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 16, 2024 by the Company on January 12, 2024, the Company received written notice from Nasdaq’s\nListing Qualifications Department notifying the Company that for the preceding 30 consecutive business days (November 29, 2023 to January 11, 2024), the Company’s common\nstock did not maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share as required by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). The notice has no immediate effect on the listing or trading of\nthe Company’s common stock and the common stock continued to trade on Nasdaq under the symbol \"RELI.” In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company\nhas a compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until July 10, 2024, to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2).\nAny perception that we may not comply with Nasdaq continued listing requirements or a delisting of our common stock by Nasdaq could adversely affect our ability to attract new\ninvestors, decrease the liquidity of the outstanding shares of our common stock, reduce the price at which such shares trade and increase the transaction costs inherent in trading\nsuch shares with overall negative effects for our stockholders. In addition, delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq could deter broker-dealers from making a market in or\notherwise seeking or generating interest in our common stock, and might deter certain institutions and persons from investing in our common stock.\nThe Company’s CEO has a significant common stock equity interest.\nAs of April 4, 2024, our CEO, Ezra Beyman, is the beneficial owner of approximately 8% of the common stock, consisting of 381,020 common shares. As of December 31, 2023, the\nare no outstanding loan balances due to affiliated entities to our CEO, Reliance Global Holdings LLC and YES Americana Group, LLC.\n26\nUnder our credit agreements with Oak Street, the Company has agreed that at all times that the loans are outstanding: (i) Ezra Beyman, our chief executive officer, Debra Beyman,\nMr. Beyman’s wife, or Yaakov Beyman, son of Mr. and Ms. Beyman, or someone else approved by Oak Street, as applicable, will be the manager of the current subsidiaries of the\nCompany, (ii) Mr. Ezra Beyman will be President and Chairperson of the Board of the Company, and (iii) Reliance Global Holdings will continue to remain a shareholder of the\nCompany’s equity and Ezra and Debra will be the sole owners of Reliance Global Holdings as tenants in entirety. The loans by Oak Street immediately mature and become due and\npayable if the Company fails to comply with these provisions, subject to certain notice and/or cure periods.\nBroad discretion of management\nAny person who invests in the Company’s common stock will do so without an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of any prospective acquisition. As a result,\ninvestors will be entirely dependent on the broad discretion and judgment of management in connection with the selection of acquisitions. There can be no assurance that\ndeterminations made by the Company’s management will permit us to achieve the Company’s business objectives.\nFuture sales or other dilution of our equity could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions. One method of acquiring companies or otherwise Companying our corporate activities is through the issuance\nof additional equity securities. The issuance of any additional shares of common or of preferred stock or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of our\ncommon stock. Moreover, to the extent that we issue restricted stock units, performance stock units, options or warrants to purchase shares of our common stock in the future and\nthose options or warrants are exercised or as the restricted stock units or performance stock units vest, our stockholders may experience further dilution. Holders of our common\nstock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, such sales or offerings could\nresult in increased dilution to our stockholders. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of shares of our common stock or the perception that such\nsales could occur.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult to resell shares of common stock at attractive prices.\nThe trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors, including the risk factors described above many of which are outside our control. In\naddition, the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies. These broad market\nfluctuations have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:\n● General economic and political conditions such as recessions, economic downturns and acts of war or terrorism;\n● Quarterly variations in our operating results;\n● Seasonality of our business cycle;\n● Changes in the market’s expectations about our operating results;\n● Our operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;\n● Changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning us or the insurance brokerage or financial services industries in general;\n● Operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n● News reports relating to trends in our markets, including any expectations regarding an upcoming \"hard” or \"soft” market;\n● Cyberattacks and other cybersecurity incidents;\n● Changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;\n● Material announcements by us or our competitors;\n● The impact or perceived impact of developments relating to our investments, including the possible perception by securities analysts or investors that such investments\ndivert management attention from our core operations;\n● Market volatility;\n● A negative market reaction to announced acquisitions;\n● Competitive pressures in each of our divisions;\n● General conditions in the insurance brokerage and insurance industries;\n● Legal proceedings or regulatory investigations;\n● Sales of substantial amounts of common shares by our directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur.\nStockholder class action lawsuits may be instituted against us following a period of volatility in our stock price. Any such litigation could result in substantial cost and a diversion\nof management’s attention and resources.\n27\nPossible issuance of additional securities.\nOur Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of 2,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.086 per share. As of December 31, 2023 we had 4,761,974 shares issued\nand outstanding. We may be expected to issue additional shares in connection with our pursuit of new business opportunities and new business operations. To the extent that\nadditional shares of common stock are issued, our shareholders would experience dilution of their respective ownership interests. If we issue shares of common stock in\nconnection with our intent to pursue new business opportunities, a change in control of the Company may be expected to occur. The issuance of additional shares of common\nstock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, in the event that an active trading market commences.\nWe could be negatively impacted by cybersecurity attacks.\nWe may use a variety of information technology systems in the ordinary course of business, which are potentially vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses and\ncyberattacks, including cyberattacks to our information technology infrastructure and attempts by others to gain access to our propriety or sensitive information, and ranging from\nindividual attempts to advanced persistent threats. The risk of such a security breach or disruption has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of\nattempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased and will likely continue to increase in the future. The procedures and controls we use to monitor these\nthreats and mitigate our exposure may not be sufficient to prevent cyber security incidents. The results of these incidents could include disrupted operations, misstated or\nunreliable financial data, theft of trade secrets or other intellectual property, liability for disclosure of confidential customer, supplier or employee information, increased costs\narising from the implementation of additional security protective measures, regulatory enforcement litigation and reputational damage, which could materially adversely affect our\nfinancial condition, business and results of operations. These risks require continuous and likely increasing attention and other resources from us to, among other actions, identify\nand quantify these risks, upgrade and expand our technologies, systems and processes to adequately address them and provide periodic training for employees to assist them in\ndetecting phishing, malware and other schemes. Such attention diverts time and other resources from other activities and there is no assurance that our efforts will be effective.\nAdditionally, the cost of maintaining and improving such systems and processes, procedures and internal controls may increase from its current level. Potential sources for\ndisruption, damage or failure of our information technology systems include, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, human error, cyberattacks, natural disasters\nand defects in design. Additionally, we rely on third party service providers for certain aspects of our business. We can provide no assurance that the networks and systems that\nour third party vendors have established or use will be effective. Even if we are not targeted directly, cyberattacks on the U.S. and foreign governments, financial markets, financial\ninstitutions, or other businesses, including vendors, software creators, cybersecurity service providers, and other third parties with whom we do business, may occur, and such\nevents could disrupt our normal business operations and networks in the future.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, and international laws and other obligations regarding data protection.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, and international laws and other obligations regarding data protection. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other\njurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging\nand changing domestic and international requirements may cause us or our businesses to incur substantial costs or require us or one of our businesses to change its business\npractices. Any failure by us to comply with our own privacy policy, applicable association rules, or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws\nand regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others.\nDividends unlikely.\nThe Company does not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends will be contingent upon the Company’s future revenues and earnings, if any,\ncapital requirements and overall financial conditions. The payment of any future dividends will be within the discretion of the Company’s board of directors as then constituted. It\nis the Company’s expectation that future management following a business combination will determine to retain any earnings for use in its business operations and accordingly,\nthe Company does not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future.\n28\nSpeculative Nature of Warrants.\nWarrants offered in our various equity offerings do not confer any rights of common stock ownership on their holders, such as voting rights, and could limit the rights to receive\ndividends, they rather merely represent the right to acquire shares of our common stock at a fixed price for a limited period of time. Moreover, following these offerings, the market\nvalue of the warrants is uncertain and there can be no assurance that the market value of the warrants will equal or exceed their public offering price. There can be no assurance\nthat the market price of the common stock will ever equal or exceed the exercise price of the warrants, and consequently, whether it will ever be profitable for holders of the warrants\nto exercise the warrants.\nState blue sky registration; potential limitations on resale of the Company’s common stock\nThe holders of the Company’s shares of common stock registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Securities Act”) and those persons who desire to\npurchase them in any trading market that may develop in the future, should be aware that there may be state blue-sky law restrictions upon the ability of investors to resell the\nCompany’s securities. Accordingly, investors should consider the secondary market for the Company’s securities to be a limited one.\nChanges in tax laws could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe tax regimes we are subject to or operate under, including income and non-income taxes, are unsettled and may be subject to significant change. For example, the Inflation\nReduction Act (the \"IRA”) was signed into law on August 16, 2022 and was effective beginning in fiscal 2023. The IRA imposes a 15% minimum tax for large corporations on\nglobal adjusted financial statement income for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022, and a 1% excise tax on certain share repurchases occurring after December 31, 2022. We\ndo not currently expect that the IRA will have a material impact on our income tax liability, but will continue to monitor this change in future periods. We are unable to predict what\nchanges to the tax laws of the U.S. and other jurisdictions may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effect such changes would have on our business. Any significant\nincrease in our future effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nExpectations of our company relating to environmental, social and governance factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks.\nThere is an increasing focus from certain investors, customers and other key stakeholders concerning corporate responsibility, specifically related to environmental, social and\ngovernance (\"ESG”) factors. We expect that an increased focus on ESG considerations will affect some aspects of our operations, particularly as we expand into new geographic\nmarkets. There are a number of constituencies that are involved in a range of ESG issues, including investors, special interest groups, public and consumer interest groups and\nthird-party service providers. As a result, there is an increased emphasis on corporate responsibility ratings and several third parties provide reports on companies to measure and\nassess corporate responsibility performance. In addition, the ESG factors by which companies’ corporate responsibility practices are assessed may change, which could result in\ngreater expectations of us and cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy such new criteria. Alternatively, if we are unable to satisfy such new criteria, investors may\nconclude that our policies with respect to corporate responsibility are inadequate. We risk damage to our brand and reputation if our corporate responsibility procedures or\nstandards do not meet the standards set by various constituencies. In the future, we may be required to make substantial investments in matters related to ESG which could require\nsignificant investment and impact our results of operations. Any failure in our decision-making or related investments in this regard could affect consumer perceptions as to our\nbrand. Furthermore, if our competitors’ corporate responsibility performance is perceived to be greater than ours, potential or current investors may elect to invest with our\ncompetitors instead. In addition, in the event that we communicate certain initiatives and goals regarding ESG matters, we could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of\nsuch initiatives or goals, or we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals. If we fail to satisfy the expectations of investors and other key stakeholders or our\ninitiatives are not executed as planned, our reputation and financial results could be materially and adversely affected.\nItem 1B.

We anticipate that we will retain funds and future earnings to\nsupport operations and to finance the growth and development of our business. The payment of dividends will be contingent upon the Company’s future revenues and earnings,\nif any, capital requirements, overall financial condition, and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. The payment of any future dividends will be within the\ndiscretion of the Company’s board of directors as then constituted. It is the Company’s expectation that future management following a business combination will determine to\nretain any earnings for use in its business operations and accordingly, the Company does not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nThere have been no equity securities repurchased by the Company for the years ending December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nMarket Information\nOur common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol \"RELI”, and our warrants to purchase common stock are listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market\nunder the symbol \"RELIW.”\nOn April 03, 2024, the closing price per share of our common stock was $0.37 as reported on the NASDAQ.\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans\n2019 Equity Incentive Plans\nOn January 29, 2019, our board of directors and stockholders adopted the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan, pursuant to which 46,667 shares of our common stock are reserved for\nissuance as awards to employees, directors, consultants, advisors, and other service providers.

Selected Financial Data\nRESERVED\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nReliance Global Group, Inc. (formerly known as Ethos Media Network, Inc.) was incorporated in Florida on August 2, 2013. In September 2018, Reliance Global Holdings, LLC, a\nrelated party, purchased a controlling interest in the Company. Ethos Media Network, Inc. was renamed Reliance Global Group, Inc. on October 18, 2018.\nWe operate as a diversified company engaging in business in the insurance market, as well as other related sectors. Our focus is to grow the Company by pursuing an aggressive\nacquisition strategy, initially and primarily focused upon wholesale and retail insurance agencies. We are led and advised by a management team that offers over 100 years of\ncombined business expertise in real estate, insurance, and the financial service industry.\nIn the insurance sector, our management has extensive experience acquiring and managing insurance portfolios in several states, as well as developing specialized programs\ntargeting niche markets. Our primary strategy is to identify specific risk to reward arbitrage opportunities and develop these on a national platform, thereby increasing revenues\nand returns, and then identify and acquire undervalued wholesale and retail insurance agencies with operations in growing or underserved segments, expand and optimize their\noperations, and achieve asset value appreciation while generating interim cash flows.\nAs part of our growth and acquisition strategy, we continue to survey the current insurance market for value-add acquisition opportunities. As of December 31, 2023, we have\nacquired ten insurance agencies, including both affiliated and unaffiliated companies and long term, we seek to conduct all transactions and acquisitions through our direct\noperations.\nOver the next 12 months, we plan to focus on the expansion and growth of our business through continued asset acquisitions in insurance markets and organic growth of our\ncurrent insurance operations through geographic expansion and market share growth.\nFurther, we launched our 5MinuteInsure.com (\"5MI”) Insurtech platform during 2021 which expanded our national footprint. 5MI is a high-tech proprietary tool developed by us as\na business to consumer portal which enables consumers to instantly compare quotes from multiple carriers and purchase their car and home insurance in a time efficient and\neffective manner. 5MI taps into the growing number of online shoppers and utilizes advanced artificial intelligence and data mining techniques, to provide competitive insurance\nquotes in around 5 minutes with minimal data input needed from the consumer. The platform launched during the summer of 2021 and currently operates in 46 states offering\ncoverage with more than 30 highly rated insurance carriers.\n33\nWith the acquisition of Barra, we launched RELI Exchange, our business-to-business (B2B) InsurTech platform and agency partner network that builds on the artificial intelligence\nand data mining backbone of 5MinuteInsure.com. Through RELI Exchange we on-board agency partners and provide them an InsurTech platform white labeled, designed and\nbranded specifically for their business. This combines the best of digital and human capabilities by providing our agency partners and their customers quotes from multiple carriers\nwithin minutes. Since its inception, RELI Exchange, has increased its agent roster by close to 130%.\nBusiness Operations\nWe’ve adopted a ‘One-Firm’ strategy, whereby the Reliance owned and operated agencies come together to operate as one cohesive unit which allows for efficient and effective\ncross-selling, cross-collaboration, and the effective deployment of the Company’s human capital. This strategy also aims to enhance the Company’s overall market presence\nacross the U.S., with all business lines operating under the RELI Exchange brand. It’s expected to benefit agents and clients by improving relationships with carriers, leading to\nbetter commission and bonus contracts due to higher business volumes. The approach also strengthens the capability of RELI Exchange agency partners in securing diverse\ninsurance policies and fosters increased cross-selling opportunities. This unified strategy positions the company for rapid scaling and integration of accretive acquisitions,\nexpanding its industry reach.\nBusiness Trends and Uncertainties\nThe insurance intermediary business is highly competitive, and we actively compete with numerous firms for customers, properties and insurance companies, many of which have\nrelationships with insurance companies, or have a significant presence in niche insurance markets that may give them an advantage over us. Other competitive concerns may\ninclude the quality of our products and services, our pricing and the ability of some of our customers to self-insure and the entrance of technology companies into the insurance\nintermediary business. A number of insurance companies are engaged in the direct sale of insurance, primarily to individuals, and do not pay commissions to agents and brokers.\nFinancial Instruments\nThe Company’s financial instruments as of December 31, 2023, consist of derivative warrants. These are accounted at fair value as of inception/issuance date, and at fair value as\nof each subsequent balance sheet date. Any change in fair value is recorded as non-operating, (non-cash) gain or loss.\nInsurance Operations\nOur insurance operations focus on the acquisition and management of insurance agencies throughout the U.S. Our primary focus is to pinpoint undervalued wholesale and retail\ninsurance agencies with operations in growing or underserved segments (including healthcare and Medicare, as well as personal and commercial insurance lines). We then focus\non expanding their operations on a national platform and improving operational efficiencies in order to achieve asset value appreciation while generating interim cash flows. In the\ninsurance sector, our management team has over 100 years of experiences acquiring and managing insurance portfolios in several states, as well as developing specialized\nprograms targeting niche markets. We plan to accomplish these objectives by acquiring wholesale and retail insurance agencies it deems to represent a good buying opportunity\n(as opposed to insurance carriers) as insurance agencies bear no insurance risk. Once acquired, we plan to develop them on a national platform to increase revenues and profits\nthrough a synergetic structure. The Company is initially focused on segments that are underserved or growing, including healthcare and Medicare, as well as personal and\ncommercial insurance lines.\nRevenues\nThe Company’s revenue is primarily comprised of commission paid by health insurance carriers related to insurance plans that have been purchased by a\nmember who used the Company’s service. The Company defines a member as an individual currently covered by an insurance plan, including individual and\nfamily, Medicare-related, small business, and ancillary plans, for which the Company is entitled to receive compensation from an insurance carrier.\nInsurance Acquisitions and Strategic Activities\nAs of the date of this filing, we have acquired nine insurance brokerages (see table below). As we continue to execute on our acquisition strategy, our reach within the insurance\nindustry can provide us with the ability to offer lower rates, which could boost our competitive position within the industry.\n34\nAcquired Date Location Line of Business\nU.S. Benefits Alliance, LLC (USBA) October 24, 2018 Michigan Health Insurance\nEmployee Benefit Solutions, LLC (EBS) October 24, 2018 Michigan Health Insurance\nCommercial Solutions of Insurance Agency, LLC (CCS or December 1, 2018 New Jersey P&C – Trucking Industry\nCommercial Solutions)\nSouthwestern Montana Insurance Center, Inc.

(Kush) May 1, 2021 Michigan Health Insurance\nBarra & Associates, LLC April 26, 2022 Illinois Health Insurance\n35\nBarra & Associates, LLC Transaction\nOn April 26, 2022, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the \"APA”) with Barra & Associates, LLC (\"Barra”) pursuant to which the Company purchased all of the assets of\nBarra & Associates, LLC on April 26, 2022 for a purchase price in the amount of $7,725,000 in cash, with $6,000,000 paid to Barra at closing, $1,125,000 payable in nine months from\nclosing, and a final earnout of $600,000 payable over two years from closing based upon meeting stated milestones. The APA contains standard, commercial representations and\nwarranties and covenants. The source of the cash payment was $6,520,000 in funds borrowed from Oak Street Lending (\"Loan”), our existing lender pursuant to a Fifth Amendment\nto Credit Agreement and Promissory Note, of even date. The purchase price is subject to post-closing adjustment to reconcile certain pre-closing credits and liabilities of the\nparties.\nThe acquisition of Barra was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with the acquisition method pursuant to FASB Topic No. 805, Business Combination (ASC\n805). Accordingly, the total purchase consideration was allocated to the assets acquired, and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values. The acquisition\nmethod of accounting requires, among other things, that assets acquired, and liabilities assumed, if any, in a business purchase combination be recognized at their fair values as of\nthe acquisition date. The process for estimating the fair values of identifiable intangible assets and certain tangible assets requires the use of significant estimates and\nassumptions, including estimating future cash flows, developing appropriate discount rates, estimating the costs, and timing.\nThe preliminary allocation of the purchase price in connection with the acquisition of Barra was calculated as follows:\nWeighted\nAverage Useful\nDescription Fair Value Life (Years)\nAcquired accounts receivable $ 92,585\nProperty, plant and equipment 8,593 7\nRight-of-use asset 122,984\nTrade names 22,000 4\nCustomer relationships 550,000 10\nDeveloped technology 230,000 5\nAgency relationships 2,585,000 10\nLease liability (122,984)\nGoodwill 4,236,822 Indefinite\n$ 7,725,000\nGoodwill of $4,236,822 arising from the acquisition of Barra consisted of the value of the employee workforce and the residual value after all identifiable intangible assets were\nvalued. Goodwill recognized pursuant to the acquisition of Barra is currently expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Total acquisition costs incurred through December\n31, 2022 for the acquisition of Barra were 72,793 recorded as a component of General and administrative expenses.\n36\nRecent Developments\nPrivate Placements\nOn March 13, 2023, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with one institutional buyer for the purchase and sale of, (i) an aggregate of 155,038 shares (the\n\"Common Shares”) of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.086 per share (the \"Common Stock”) along with accompanying common warrants (the \"Common Units”), (ii)\nprefunded warrants (the \"Prefunded Warrants”) that are exercisable into 897,594 shares of Common Stock (the \"Prefunded Warrant Shares”) along with accompanying common\nwarrants (the \"Pre-Funded Units”), and (iii) common warrants (the \"Common Warrants”) to initially acquire up to 2,105,264 shares of Common Stock (the \"Common Warrant\nShares”) (representing 200% of the Common Shares and Prefunded Warrant Shares) in a private placement offering (the \"Private Placement”). Additionally, the Company agreed to\nissue a warrant to the Placement Agent (defined below), to initially acquire 52,632 shares of common stock (the \"PA Warrant”). The closing of the Private Placement occurred on\nMarch 16, 2023.\nNasdaq Notification\nOn January 12, 2024, the Company received written notice from Nasdaq’s Listing Qualifications Department notifying the Company that for the preceding 30 consecutive business\ndays (November 29, 2023 to January 11, 2024), the Company’s common stock did not maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share as required by Nasdaq Listing Rule\n5550(a)(2). The notice has no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company’s common stock and the common stock continued to trade on Nasdaq under the symbol\n\"RELI.” In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has a compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until July 10, 2024, to regain compliance with Nasdaq\nListing Rule 5550(a)(2).\nStock Splits\nOn February 23, 2023, pursuant to authority granted by the Board of Directors of the Company, the Company implemented a 1-for-15 reverse split of the Company’s authorized and\nissued and outstanding common stock (the \"Reverse Split-2023”). The par value remains unchanged. All share and per share information as well as common stock and additional\npaid-in capital have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Reverse Split-2023 for all periods presented, unless otherwise indicated.\nNon-GAAP Measure\nThe Company believes certain financial measures which meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures, as defined in Regulation G of the SEC rules, provide important\nsupplemental information. Namely our key financial performance metric Adjusted EBITDA (\"AEBITDA”) is a non-GAAP financial measure that is not in accordance with, or an\nalternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. \"AEBITDA” is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) with additional\nadjustments as further outlined below, to result in Adjusted EBITDA (\"AEBITDA”). The Company considers AEBITDA an important financial metric because it provides a\nmeaningful financial measure of the quality of the Company’s operational, cash impacted and recurring earnings and operating performance across reporting periods. Other\ncompanies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, which might limit its usefulness as a comparative measure to other companies in the industry. AEBITDA is\nused by management in addition to and in conjunction (and not as a substitute) with the results presented in accordance with GAAP. Management uses AEBITDA to evaluate the\nCompany’s operational performance, including earnings across reporting periods and the merits for implementing cost-cutting measures. We have presented AEBITDA solely as\nsupplemental disclosure because we believe it allows for a more complete analysis of results of operations and assists investors and analysts in comparing our operating\nperformance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Consistent with Regulation\nG, a description of such information is provided below herein and tabular reconciliations of this supplemental non-GAAP financial information to our most comparable GAAP\ninformation are contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under \"Results of Operations”.\nWe exclude the following items, and the following items define our non-GAAP financial measure AEBITDA:\n● Interest and related party interest expense: Unrelated to core Company operations and excluded to provide more meaningful supplemental information regarding the\nCompany’s core operational performance.\n● Depreciation and amortization: Non-cash charge, excluded to provide more meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s core operational performance.\n● Goodwill impairment: Non-cash charge, excluded to provide more meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s core operational performance.\n● Equity-based compensation: Non-cash compensation provided to employees and service providers, excluded to provide more meaningful supplemental information\nregarding the Company’s core cash impacted operational performance.\n● Change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables: An Earn-out liability is a liability to the seller upon an acquisition which is contingent on future earnings. These\nliabilities are valued at each reporting period and the changes are reported as either a gain or loss in the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables account in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. The gain or loss is non-cash, can be highly volatile and overall is not deemed relevant to ongoing operations, thus, it’s excluded\nto provide more meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s core operational performance.\n● Recognition and change in fair value of warrant liabilities: This account includes changes to derivative warrant liabilities which are valued at each reporting period and\ncould result in either a gain or loss. The period changes do not impact cash, can be highly volatile, and are unrelated to ongoing operations, and thus are excluded to\nprovide more meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s core operational performance.\n● Other income (expense), net: This account includes non-routine income or expenses and other individually de minimis items and is thus excluded as unrelated to core\noperations of the company.\n● Loss from discontinued operations before tax: This account includes the net results from discontinued operations and since discontinued, are unrelated to the\nCompany’s ongoing operations and thus excluded to provide more meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s core operational performance.\nRefer to the reconciliation of net (loss) income to AEBITDA, illustrated below in tabular format.\n37\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2023 to the year ended December 31, 2022\nThe following table sets forth our revenue and expenses for each of the years presented and provides insight into the value and percentage changes:\nRELIANCE GLOBAL GROUP, INC.

The 2023 increase in working capital is primarily attributable to increases in current assets stemming from the 17% increase in top line revenue, an equity\nprivate placement, cash received from warrant exercises and decreases to current liabilities.\nInflation\nThe Company generally may be impacted by rising costs for certain inflation-sensitive operating expenses such as labor, employee benefits, and facility leases. The Company\nbelieves inflation could have a material impact to pricing and operating expenses in future periods due to the state of the economy and current inflation rates.\n39\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as such term is defined in Regulation S-K.\nCash Flows\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (847,970) $ (3,189,997)\nNet cash provided and used in investing activities 710,189 (24,642,312)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 966,923 25,121,356\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 829,142 $ (2,710,953)\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in continuing and discontinued operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was approximately $848,000, compared to approximately $3,190,000 for the\nyear ended December 31, 2022 representing a decrease of cash used in operations of $2,342,000, or 73%. The 2023 cash used comprises an approximate net loss of $12,010,000,\ncontinuing non-cash positive adjustments of approximately $7,413,000 and non-cash positive adjustments from discontinued operations of approximately $3,749,000. Continuing\nnon-cash adjustments stem from depreciation and amortization of approximately $2,609,000, goodwill impairment of $7,594,000, amortization of debt issuance costs of approximately\n$47,000, equity-based compensation for employees, directors, and service providers of approximately $1,272,000, and change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables of\napproximately 1,717,000, offset by non-cash lease expense of approximately $5,000 and the change in fair value of warrant liability of approximately $5,504,000, as well as changes in\nnet working capital items in the net amount of approximately $317,000.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash flows provided from continuing and discontinued investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, was approximately $710,000 compared to net cash flows used\nin investing activities of approximately $24,642,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The 2023 net cash provided comprises $900,000 in cash proceeds from the sale of the\nNSURE investment, offset by approximately $190,000 of cash spend for the purchase of property, equipment and intangible assets.\nFinancing Activities.\nNet cash provided from continuing and discontinued financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, was approximately $967,000 as compared to $25,121,000 for the year\nended December 31, 2022. The 2023 net cash provided primarily comprises cash proceeds from an equity private placement and warrant exercises of approximately $4,475,000, offset\nby debt principal repayments of approximately $1,091,000, payments net of proceeds on short term financings of approximately $80,000, payments on related party loans and related\nparty convertible debt of approximately $1,900,000, payments on earn-out liabilities of approximately $419,000 and approximately $18,000 of cash used in discontinued financing\nactivities.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported\namounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, forecasted events, and various other\nassumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our estimates\nand judgments on an ongoing basis. Our management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and\nrequire management’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments.\n40\nBusiness acquisitions: Accounting for acquisitions requires us to estimate the fair value of consideration paid and the individual assets and liabilities acquired, which involves a\nnumber of judgments, assumptions, and estimates that could materially affect the amount and timing of costs recognized in subsequent periods. Accounting for acquisitions can\nalso involve significant judgment to determine when control of the acquired entity is transferred. We typically obtain independent third-party valuation studies to assist in\ndetermining fair values, including assistance in determining future cash flows, discount rates, and comparable market values. Items involving significant assumptions, estimates,\nand judgments include the following:\n● Debt, including discount rate and timing of payments;\n● Deferred tax assets, including projections of future taxable income and tax rates;\n● Fair value of consideration paid or transferred;\n● Intangible assets, including valuation methodology, estimations of future revenue and costs, and discount rates;\nContingencies: We are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Significant judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of a loss, if any,\nfrom such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired, and the amount of loss can be reasonably\nestimated. In accounting for the resolution of contingencies, significant judgment may be necessary to estimate amounts pertaining to periods prior to the resolution that are\ncharged to operations in the period of resolution and amounts related to future periods.\nGoodwill and intangible assets: We test goodwill for impairment in our fourth quarter each year, or more frequently if indicators of an impairment exist, to determine whether it is\nmore likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit with goodwill is less than its carrying value. For reporting units for which this assessment concludes that it is more\nlikely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value, goodwill is considered not impaired and we are not required to perform the goodwill impairment test. Qualitative\nfactors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the fair value of the\nreporting unit. For reporting units for which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value, goodwill is tested for impairment\nby determining the fair value of each reporting unit and comparing it to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit\nexceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we would record an impairment loss up to the\ndifference between the carrying value and implied fair value.\nDetermining when to test for impairment, the reporting units, the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, and the fair value of the reporting unit requires significant judgment and\ninvolves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates, and expenses and are developed as part of our long-\nrange planning process. The same estimates are used in business planning, forecasting, and capital budgeting. We test the reasonableness of the output of our long-range\nplanning process by calculating an implied value per share and comparing that to current stock prices, analysts’ consensus pricing, and management’s expectations. These\nestimates and assumptions are used to calculate projected future cash flows for the reporting unit, which are discounted using a risk-adjusted rate to estimate a fair value. The\ndiscount rate requires determination of appropriate market comparables. We base fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and\ninherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates.\nWe test other identified intangible assets with definite useful lives when events and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable by comparing the carrying\namount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. We test intangible assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment using a fair value\nmethod such as discounted cash flows. Estimating fair values involves significant assumptions, including future sales prices, sales volumes, costs, and discount rates.\n41\nIncome taxes: We are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world. These\nestimates involve significant judgment and interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex. Resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be\nknown for many years after completion of the applicable year. We are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with\nU.S. GAAP, which requires the assessment of our performance and other relevant factors. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable\nincome. In recent periods, our results of operations have benefited from increases in the amount of deferred taxes we expect to realize, primarily from the levels of capital spending\nand increases in the amount of taxable income we expect to realize. Our income tax provision or benefit is dependent, in part, on our ability to forecast future taxable income in these\nand other jurisdictions. Such forecasts are inherently difficult and involve significant judgments including, among others, projecting future average selling prices and sales\nvolumes, manufacturing and overhead costs, levels of capital spending, and other factors that significantly impact our analyses of the amount of net deferred tax assets that are\nmore likely than not to be realized.\nRevenue recognition: All commission revenue is recorded net of any deductions for estimated commission adjustments due to lapses, policy cancellations, and revisions in\ncoverage.\nThe Company earns additional revenue including contingent commissions, profit-sharing, override and bonuses based on meeting certain revenue or profit targets established\nperiodically by the carriers (collectively the Contingent Commissions). The Contingent Commissions are earned when the Company achieves the targets established by the\ninsurance carries. The insurance carriers notify the company when it has achieved the target. The Company only recognizes revenue to the extent that it is probable that a\nsignificant reversal of the revenue will not occur.\nEquity-based compensation: Equity-based compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense using the straight-line\namortization method over the requisite service period. For performance-based stock awards, the expense recognized is dependent on our assessment of the likelihood of the\nperformance measure being achieved. We utilize forecasts of future performance to assess these probabilities and this assessment requires significant judgment.\nDetermining the appropriate fair-value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires significant judgment, including estimating stock price\nvolatility and expected option life. We develop these estimates based on historical data and market information which can change significantly over time. A small change in the\nestimates used can result in a relatively large change in the estimated valuation. We use the Black-Scholes option valuation model to value employee stock options and awards\ngranted under our employee stock purchase plan. We estimate stock price volatility based on our historical volatility implied volatility derived from traded options on our stock.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk\nNot applicable.\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nSee the financial statements filed as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as listed under Item 15 below.\n42\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNot Applicable.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nControls and Procedure Requirements\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as\nthis annual report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the\nobjective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to\nallow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nWe do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived\nand operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure\ncontrols and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in\nall disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and\ninstances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no\nassurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined under Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 14d-14(f).\nOur internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements\nfor external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be\neffective can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial reporting reliability and financial statement preparation and presentation. In addition, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls become inadequate because of changes in conditions and that the degree of compliance with the\npolicies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe Company determined it has a material weakness in its disclosure controls and procedures relating to goodwill and earnings per share (\"EPS”). The Company continues the\nprocess of mitigating the deficiencies by ensuring it is appropriately consulting with experts in the respective areas. During fiscal year 2023, Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2023, and concluded that they were not effective as of December\n31, 2023, due to the material weakness identified.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nDuring fiscal year 2022, the Company retained subject matter expert advisors to prepare the accounting and disclosures over Earnings per Share. These advisors assisted the\nCompany in the calculations and disclosures of EPS for the year ended December 31, 2023. Aside for the foregoing, there have been no other changes in our internal control over\nfinancial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during our most recently completed fiscal quarter which is the subject of this\nreport that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n43\nItem 9B.

Due to the small size of the Company, we believe it is currently most effective to\nhave the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer positions partially combined.\n47\nOur Board is primarily responsible for overseeing our risk management processes. The Board receives and reviews periodic reports from management, auditors, legal counsel, and\nothers, as considered appropriate regarding the Company’s assessment of risks. The Board focuses on the most significant risks facing the Company and our general risk\nmanagement strategy, and also ensures that risks undertaken by us are consistent with the Board’s risk parameters. While the Board oversees the Company, our management is\nresponsible for day-to-day risk management processes. We believe this division of responsibilities is the most effective approach for addressing the risks facing the Company and\nthat our board leadership structure supports this approach.\nCompliance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act\nSection 16(a) of Exchange Act requires our executive officers and directors and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities to file\nwith the Commission initial statements of beneficial ownership, statements of changes in beneficial ownership and annual statement of changes in beneficial ownership with\nrespect to their ownership of the Company’s securities, on Form 3, 4 and 5 respectively.

Form 10-K Summary\nNot applicable.\n51\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm PCAOB ID 339\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of\nReliance Global Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Reliance Global Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the \"Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related\nconsolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes\n(collectively referred to as the \"consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial\nposition of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial\nstatements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB”) and are required to\nbe independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to\nperform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not\nfor the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nF-1\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as\na whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they\nrelate.\nImpairment Evaluation of Goodwill\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nAs described in Notes 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was approximately $6.7 million as of December 31, 2023.\nManagement tests goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently should an event or a change in circumstances occur that would indicate the carrying value may be\nimpaired. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value, up to\nthe amount of goodwill associated with the reporting unit. As a result of management’s assessment, the Company recognized impairment charges of $7.6 million related to goodwill\nduring the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that the goodwill impairment assessment was a critical audit matter are that there is significant judgment in selection of the\nvaluation methods to use, along with assumptions used to estimate the future revenues and cash flows, including revenue growth rates, operating expenses and cash outflows\nnecessary to support the cash flows, weighted average cost of capital and future market conditions as well as the valuation methodologies applied by the Company. This in turn\nled to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to managements inputs and selection of methods\nused. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of auditor employed professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating\nthe audit evidence obtained.\nHow the Critical Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nThe primary audit procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n- Obtaining an understanding over the Company’s process for evaluation whether an event of a change in circumstances occur that would indicate the carrying value of\ngoodwill may be impaired.\n- Utilizing a firm employed valuation specialist with the skills and knowledge to assist in: (i) evaluating and challenging the reasonableness of the valuation methods\nselected by management to determine the fair value of the Company, (ii) evaluating management’s significant assumptions by comparing inputs to market data (iii)\nperforming a control premium sensitivity study to determine the impact to the market participant acquisition approach, and (iv) performing recalculations of the method\nutilized by management.\n- Testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data utilized by management in their evaluation of goodwill impairment.\n/s/ Mazars USA LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2020.\nFort Washington, Pennsylvania\nApril 4, 2024\nF-2\nReliance Global Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nDecember 31 December 31,\n2023 2022\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash $ 1,329,016 $ 505,410\nRestricted cash 1,409,895 1,404,359\nAccounts receivable 1,298,863 994,321\nAccounts receivable, related parties 6,603 18,292\nOther receivables 899 11,464\nPrepaid expense and other current assets 333,756 245,535\nCurrent assets -

ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nReliance Global Group, Inc. (formerly known as Ethos Media Network, Inc.) (\"RELI”, \"Reliance”, or the \"Company”) was incorporated in Florida on August 2, 2013.\nOn April 26, 2022, the Company acquired the assets of Barra & Associates, LLC., an unaffiliated full-service insurance agency headquartered in Illinois (see Note 3).\nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America (\"GAAP”). The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounting of Reliance Global Group, Inc., and its wholly owned\nsubsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nLiquidity\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company’s reported cash and restricted cash aggregated balance was approximately $2,739,000, current assets were approximately $4,379,000, while\ncurrent liabilities were approximately 3,190,000. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had working capital of approximately $1,189,000 and stockholders’ equity of approximately\n$7,147,000. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company reported a loss from operations of approximately $13,879,000, of which $7,594,000 was related to goodwill\nimpairment. The Company also reported a non-cash, non-operating gain on the recognition and change in fair value of warrant liabilities of approximately $5,504,000, other expense,\nprimarily interest expense of approximately $1,650,000, which resulted in a loss from continuing operations of $10,025,000. Additionally, the Company reported a loss from\ndiscontinued operations of approximately $1,985,000. The total net loss of the company was approximately $12,010,000. The Company completed a capital offering in March 2023,\nraising net proceeds of approximately $3,446,000.\nAlthough there can be no assurance that debt or equity financing will be available on acceptable terms, the Company believes its financial position and its ability to raise capital to\nbe reasonable and sufficient. Based on our assessment, we do not believe there are conditions or events that, in the aggregate, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability\nto continue as a going concern within one year of filing these financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC”).\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,\nrevenues and expenses, and related disclosures in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on assumptions\nbelieved to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nF-8\nCash and Restricted Cash\nCash consists of checking accounts. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nRestricted cash includes cash pledged as collateral to secure obligations and/or all cash whose use is otherwise limited by contractual provisions.\nAt times, some cash balances held in banks may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, standard deposit insurance limit of $250,000.\nThe reconciliation of cash and restricted cash reported within the applicable balance sheet accounts that sum to the total of cash and restricted cash presented in the statement of\ncash flows is as follows:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nCash $ 1,329,016 $ 505,410\nRestricted cash 1,409,895 1,404,359\nTotal cash and restricted cash $ 2,738,911 $ 1,909,769\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recognized over an asset’s estimated useful life using the straight-line method beginning\non the date an asset is placed in service. The Company regularly evaluates the estimated remaining useful lives of the Company’s property and equipment to determine whether\nevents or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of depreciation. Certain capitalized software has been reclassified in the consolidated balance sheet\nfrom property and equipment, net to intangibles, net and comparative periods have been adjusted accordingly. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.\nEstimated useful lives of the Company’s Property and Equipment are as follows:\nUseful Life (in years)\nComputer equipment 5\nOffice equipment and furniture 7\nLeasehold improvements Shorter of the useful life or the lease term\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nThe accounting guidance includes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy\nare as follows:\nLevel 1 — Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;\nLevel 2 — Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the\nasset or liability; and\nLevel 3 — Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which include management’s own assumption about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or\nliability, including assumptions about risk.\nAs of December 31, 2023, and 2022 respectively, the Company’s balance sheet includes certain financial instruments, including cash, notes receivables, accounts payable, and\nshort and long-term debt. The carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities approximate their fair value because of the relatively short period of time between the\norigination of these instruments and their expected realization. The carrying amounts of long-term debt approximate their fair value as the variable interest rates are based on a\nmarket index.\nF-9\nWarrant Liabilities: The Company’s warrant liabilities (see Note 9, Warrant Liabilities) represent liability-classified derivative financial instruments recorded at fair value on a\nrecurring basis. The fair value of the Warrant Liabilities includes significant inputs unobservable in the market and thus are considered Level 3. The Company measured the fair\nvalue of the warrant liabilities at the issuance date, December 12, 2023, and subsequently at the balance sheet date, using a binomial option pricing model. The following\nsummarizes the significant unobservable inputs:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nStock price $ 0.54 $ 8.55\nVolatility 110.0% 105.0%\nTime to Expiry 4.99 4.01\nDividend yield 0% 0%\nRisk free rate 3.8% 4.1%\nThe following reconciles the warrant liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nYears ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nSeries B Warrant Series B warrant Placement agent\nCommitment liabilities warrants Total\nBeginning balance, December 31, 2021 37,652,808 - - 37,652,808\nInitial recognition - 55,061,119 1,525,924 56,587,043\nUnrealized (gain) loss 17,408,311 (48,668,869) (1,477,024) (32,737,582)1\nWarrants exercised or transferred (55,061,119) (8,000) - (55,069,119)\nEnding balance, December 31, 2022 $ - $ 6,384,250 $ 48,900 $ 6,433,150\nUnrealized (gain) loss (5,534,931) (48,575) (5,583,506)2\nWarrants exercised or exchanged - (580,651) - (580,651)\nEnding balance, December 31, 2023 - $ 268,668 $ 325 $ 268,993\n1 Recognition and change in fair value of warrant liabilities per income statement is $29,064,958. The difference of $3,672,624 is made up of the Warrant issuance costs.\n2 Recognition and change in fair value of warrant liabilities per income statement is $5,503,647. The difference of $79,859 was due to a loss on a warrant exchange.\nEarn-out liabilities: The Company generally values its Level 3 earn-out liabilities using the income valuation approach. Key valuation inputs include contingent payment\narrangement terms, projected revenues and cash flows, rate of return, and probability assessments. The following table summarizes the significant unobservable inputs used in the\nfair value measurements:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nValuation technique Discounted cash flow Discounted cash flow\nSignificant unobservable input Projected revenue and probability of achievement Projected revenue and probability of achievement\nF-10\nThe Company values its Level 3 earn-out liability related to the Southwestern Montana Insurance Center acquisition using a Monte Carlo simulation in a risk-neutral framework (a\nspecial case of the Income Approach). The following summarizes the significant unobservable inputs:\nDecember 31,\n2023\nVolatility 110%\nCredit Spread 7.73%\nNumber of trading days 252\nRisk free rate 5.34%\nRemaining term (years) 0.2\nStock Price $ 0.54\nDividend Yield 0%\nNumber of Iterations 100,000\nUndiscounted remaining earn out cash payments were approximately $165,000 as of December 31, 2023. The following table reconciles fair value of earn-out liabilities for the years\nending December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nBeginning balance – January 1 $ 2,709,478 $ 3,813,878\nAcquisitions and Settlements (3,260,403) (1,104,924)\nPeriod adjustments:\nFair value and estimate changes* 1,716,873 524\nEarn-out payable in common shares (159,867) -\nEarn-out transferred to loans payable, related parties (846,214) -\nEnding balance $ 159,867 $ 2,709,478\nLess: Current portion (159,867) (2,153,478)\nEnding balance, less current portion $ - $ 556,000\n* Recorded as change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables on the consolidated statements of operations.\nDeferred Financing Costs\nThe Company has recorded deferred financing costs because of fees incurred by the Company in conjunction with its debt financing activities. These costs are amortized to\ninterest expense using the straight-line method which approximates the interest rate method over the term of the related debt. As of December 31, 2023, and 2022, unamortized\ndeferred financing costs were $273,864, and $313,829, respectively and are netted against the related debt.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for its business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and\nconsideration transferred are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the expected life of the asset. Any\nexcess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nGoodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of the tangible net assets and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Acquisition-related expenses\nare recognized separately from business combinations and are expensed as incurred. If the business combination provides for contingent consideration such as earn-outs, the\nCompany records the contingent consideration at fair value at the acquisition date. The Company remeasures fair value as of each reporting date and changes resulting from\nevents after the acquisition date, are recognized as follows: 1) if the contingent consideration is classified as equity, the contingent consideration is not re-measured and its\nsubsequent settlement is accounted for within equity, or 2) if the contingent consideration is classified as a liability, the changes in fair value and accretion costs are recognized in\nearnings.\nF-11\nIdentifiable Intangible Assets, net\nFinite-lived intangible assets such as customer relationships assets, trademarks and tradenames are amortized over their estimated useful lives, generally on a straight-line basis for\nperiods ranging from 3 to 20 years. Finite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment or obsolescence whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount\nof the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted net cash flows\nexpected to be generated by that asset. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the\nasset exceeds the estimated fair value. No impairment was recognized during the periods presented.\nGoodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles\nThe Company records goodwill when the purchase price of a business acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired.\nGoodwill is assigned on the acquisition date and tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of\na reporting unit has more likely than not declined below its carrying value. Similarly, indefinite-lived intangible assets (if any) other than goodwill are tested annually or more\nfrequently if indicated, for impairment. If impaired, intangible assets are written down to fair value based on the expected discounted cash flows.\nFinancial Instruments\nThe Company evaluates issued financial instruments for classification as either equity or liability based on an assessment of the financial instrument’s specific terms and\napplicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (\"ASC 480”) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (\"ASC 815”) as well as in accordance with\nASU 2020-06. The assessment considers whether the financial instruments issued are freestanding pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and,\nif applicable whether the financial instruments meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the financial instruments are indexed to the\nCompany’s own Common Stock, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of\nissuance and as of each subsequent reporting period end date while the financial instruments are outstanding. Financial instruments that are determined to be liabilities under ASC\n480 or ASC 815 are held at their initial fair value and remeasured to fair value at each subsequent reporting date, with changes in fair value recorded as a non-operating, non-cash\nloss or gain, as applicable.\nThe Company’s financial instruments consist of derivatives related to the warrants issued with the securities purchase agreement as discussed in Note 9, Warrant Liabilities. The\naccounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that we record the derivatives at their fair values as of the inception date of the debt agreements and at fair value\nas of each subsequent balance sheet date. Any change in fair value is recorded as non-operating, non-cash income or expense at each balance sheet date. Upon the determination\nthat an instrument is no longer subject to derivative accounting, the fair value of the derivative instrument at the date of such determination will be reclassified to paid in capital.\nThe adoption of Topic 326 did not significantly change our approach to the valuation of trade receivables. The Company determines whether there is an expected loss on our\naccounts receivable by reviewing all available data, including our customers' latest available financial statements, their credit standing, our historical collection experience, and\ncurrent and future market and economic conditions. As of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, it was not deemed necessary to recognize any allowance for credit losses on\nour trade receivables.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers which at its core, recognizes revenue\nupon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or\nservices.\nThe Company’s revenue is primarily comprised of agency commissions earned from insurance carriers (the \"Customer” or \"Carrier”) related to insurance plans produced through\nbrokering, producing, and servicing agreements between insurance carriers and members. The Company defines a \"Member” as an individual, family or entity currently covered or\nseeking insurance coverage.\nF-12\nThe Company focuses primarily on agency services for insurance products in the \"Healthcare” and property and casualty, which includes auto (collectively \"P&C”) space, with\nnominal activity in the life insurance and bond sectors. Healthcare includes plans for individuals and families, Medicare supplements, ancillary and small businesses. The Company\nalso earns revenue in the \"Insurance Marketing” space as discussed further below.\nConsideration for all agency services typically is based on commissions calculated by applying contractual commission rates to policy premiums. For P&C, commission rates are\napplied to premiums due, whereas for healthcare, commission rates, including override commissions, are applied to monthly premiums received by the Carrier.\nThe Company has two forms of billing practices, \"Direct Bill” and \"Agency Bill”. With Direct Bill, Carriers bill and collect policy premium payments directly from Members without\nany involvement from the Company. Commissions are paid to the Company by the Carrier in the following month. With Agency Bill, the Company bills Members premiums due and\nremits them to Carriers net of commission earned.\nThe following outlines the core principles of ASC 606:\nIdentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer. A contract with a customer exists when (i) we enter into an enforceable contract with a customer that defines each\nparty’s rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred and identifies the payment terms related to these goods or services, (ii) the contract has commercial substance, and\n(iii) we determine that collection of substantially all consideration for goods or services that are transferred is probable based on the customer’s intent and ability to pay the\npromised consideration.\nIdentification of the performance obligations in the contract. Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods or services that will be transferred\nto the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the goods or service either on its own or together with other resources that are\nreadily available from third parties or from us, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the goods or services is separately identifiable from other\npromises in the contract.\nDetermination of the transaction price. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services\nto the customer.\nAllocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated\nto the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on\na relative standalone selling price basis.\nRecognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation. The Company satisfies performance obligations either over time or at a point in time, as\ndiscussed in further detail below. Revenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the promised good or service to the customer.\nHealthcare revenue recognition:\nThe Company identifies a contract when it has a binding agreement with a Carrier, the Customer, to provide agency services to Members.\nThere typically is one performance obligation in contracts with Carriers, to perform agency services that culminate in monthly premium cash collections by the Carrier. The\nperformance obligation is satisfied through a combination of agency services including, marketing carrier’s insurance plans, soliciting Member applications, binding, executing and\nservicing insurance policies on a continuous basis throughout a policy’s life cycle which includes and culminates with the Customer’s collection of monthly premiums. No\ncommission is earned if cash is not received by Carrier. Thus, commission revenue is earned only after a month’s cash receipts from Members’ dues is received by the Customer.\nEach month’s Carrier cash collections is considered a separate unit sold and transferred to the Customer i.e., the satisfaction of that month’s performance obligation.\nF-13\nTransaction price is typically stated in a contract and usually based on a commission rate applied to Member premiums paid and received by Carrier. The Company generally\ncontinues to receive commission payments from Carriers until a Member’s plan is cancelled or the Company terminates its agency agreement with the Carrier. Upon termination, the\nCompany normally will no longer receive any commissions from Carriers even on business still in place. In some instances, trailing commissions could occur which would be\nrecognized similar to other Healthcare revenue. With one performance obligation, allocation of transaction price is normally not necessary.\nHealthcare typically utilizes the Direct Bill method.\nThe Company recognizes revenue at a point in time when it satisfies its monthly performance obligation and control of the service transfers to the Customer. Transfer occurs when\nMember insurance premium cash payments are received by the Customer. The Customer’s receipt of cash is the culmination and complete satisfaction of the Company’s\nperformance obligation, and the earnings process is complete.\nWith Direct Bill, since the amount of monthly Customer cash receipts is unknown to the Company until the following month when notice is provided by Customer to Company, the\nCompany accrues revenue at each period end. Any estimated revenue accrued and recognized at a period-end is trued up for financial reporting per actual revenue earned as\nprovided by the Customer during the following month.\nP&C revenue recognition:\nThe Company identifies a contract when it has a binding agreement with a Carrier, the Customer, to provide agency services to Members.\nThere typically is one performance obligation in contracts with Customers, to perform agency services to solicit, receive proposals and bind insurance policies culminating with\npolicy placement. Commission revenue is earned at the time of policy placement.\nTransaction price is typically stated in a contract and usually based on commission rates applied to Member premiums due. With one performance obligation, allocation of\ntransaction price is normally not necessary.\nP&C utilizes both the Agency Bill and Direct Bill methods, depending on the Carrier.\nThe Company recognizes revenue at a point in time when it satisfies its performance obligation and control of the service transfers to the Customer. Transfer occurs when the\npolicy placement process is complete.\nWith both Direct Bill and Agency Bill, the Company accrues commission revenue in the period policies are placed. With Agency Bill, payment is typically received from Members\nin the month earned, however with Direct Bill, payment is typically received from Carriers in the month subsequent to the commissions being earned.\nOther revenue policies: Insurance commissions earned from Carriers for life insurance products are recorded gross of amounts due to agents, with a corresponding commission\nexpense for downstream agent commissions being recorded as commission expense within the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nWhen applicable, commission revenue is recognized net of any deductions for estimated commission adjustments due to lapses, policy cancellations, and revisions in coverage.\nThe Company could earn additional revenue from contingent commissions, profit-sharing, override and bonuses based on meeting certain revenue or profit targets established\nperiodically by the Carriers (collectively, \"Contingent Commissions”). Contingent Commissions are earned when the Company achieves targets established by Carriers. The\nCarriers notify the Company when it has achieved the target. The Company recognizes revenue for any Contingent Commissions at the time it is reasonably assured that a\nsignificant revenue reversal is not probable, which is generally when a Carrier notifies the Company that it is on track or has earned a Contingent Commission.\nF-14\nThe following table disaggregates the Company’s revenue by line of business, showing commissions earned:\nYear ended Property and\nDecember 31, 2023 Medical Life Casualty Total\nEBS $ 883,327 $ 22,114 $ - $ 905,441\nUSBA 43,193 3184 - 46,377\nCCS/UIS - - 289,486 289,486\nMontana 1,863,455 12,488 - 1,875,943\nFortman 1,161,506 5,487 1,044,592 2,211,585\nAltruis 5,454,654 - - 5,454,654\nKush 1,209,854 - - 1,209,854\nReli Exchange 209,615 127,486 1,401,385 1,738,486\nTotal $ 10,825,064 $ 170,759 $ 2,735,463 $ 13,731,826\nYear ended Property and\nDecember 31, 2022 Medical Life Casualty Total\nEBS $ 781,570 $ 16,843 $ - $ 798,413\nUSBA 51,006 1462 - 52,468\nCCS/UIS - - 254,325 254,325\nMontana 1,860,475 7,661 - 1,868,136\nFortman 1,267,945 6705 842,961 2,117,611\nAltruis 4,041,495 2954 - 4,044,449\nKush 1,535,416 1040 - 1,536,456\nReli Exchange 152,094 106,052 831,878 1,090,024\nTotal $ 9,690,001 $ 142,717 $ 1,929,164 $ 11,761,882\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel costs for the Company’s administrative functions, professional service fees, office rent, all employee travel\nexpenses, and other general costs.\nMarketing and Advertising\nThe Company’s direct channel expenses primarily consist of costs for e-mail marketing and newspaper advertisements. The Company’s online advertising channel expense\nprimarily consist of social media ads. Advertising costs for both direct and online channels are expensed as incurred.\nEquity-Based Compensation\nEquity-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite\nservice period, based on the terms of the awards. The fair value of the stock-based payments to nonemployees that are fully vested and non-forfeitable as at the grant date is\nmeasured and recognized at that date, unless there is a contractual term for services in which case such compensation would be amortized over the contractual term. To the extent\npossible, the Company will estimate and recognize expected forfeitures.\nF-15\nLeases\nThe Company recognizes leases in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, \"Leases” (\"ASC 842” or \"ASU 2016-12”). This standard provides enhanced\ntransparency and comparability by requiring lessees to record right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities on the balance sheet for most leases. Expenses associated\nwith leases are recognized as a single lease expense, generally on a straight-line basis.\nThe Company is the lessee in a contract when the Company obtains the right to use an asset. We currently lease real estate and office space under non-cancelable operating lease\nagreements. When applicable, consideration in a contract is allocated between lease and non-lease components. Lease payments are discounted using the implicit discount rate in\nthe lease. If the implicit discount rate for the lease cannot be readily determined, the Company uses an estimate of its incremental borrowing rate. The Company did not have any\ncontracts accounted for as finance leases as of December 31, 2023, or 2022. Operating leases are included in the line items right-of-use assets, current portion of leases payable, and\nleases payable, less current portion in the consolidated balance sheets. Right-of-use (\"ROU”) asset represents the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term\nand lease obligations represent the Company’s obligations to make lease payments arising from the lease, both of which are recognized based on the present value of the future\nminimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. Leases with a lease term of 12 months or less at inception are not recorded on the consolidated balance\nsheet and are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company determines a lease’s term by agreement with lessor\nand includes lease extension options and variable lease payments when option and/or variable payments are reasonably certain of being exercised or paid.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and\nliabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In evaluating its\nability to recover deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction in which they arise, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including the expected\nreversals of taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, taxable income available via carryback to prior years, tax planning strategies, and results of recent\noperations. The Company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets, including scheduling the reversal of its deferred tax assets and liabilities, to determine the amount of\nvaluation allowance needed. Scheduling the reversal of deferred tax asset and liability balances requires judgment and estimation. The Company believes the deferred tax liabilities\nrelied upon as future taxable income in its assessment will reverse in the same period and jurisdiction and are of the same character as the temporary differences giving rise to the\ndeferred tax assets that will be realized.\nDiscontinued Operations\nThe Company’s board of directors approved the discontinuation and abandonment of Medigap Healthcare Insurance Company, LLC (\"Medigap”), a subsidiary of the Company,\neffective April 17, 2023, due to Medigap’s sustained recurring losses stemming from amongst other factors, greater than anticipated revenue chargebacks. The Company was\nunable to divest its interest in Medigap for value, and accordingly, operations were wound down in an orderly manner. In doing so, the Company transferred to its operating entity,\nMedigap’s customer relationships and internally developed and purchased software intangible assets, with net of amortization combined value of approximately $4,300,000, as well\nas, its short-term financing arrangement of $29,500, and each are respectively classified at their adjusted book values in the intangible assets and short term financing agreements\naccounts in the condensed consolidated balance sheets for the periods ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. These assets have continued value to the Company and\nhave not been impaired as the fair value exceeds carrying cost. Medigap’s remaining assets were considered to have no remaining asset value and were fully impaired. Certain\nliabilities and estimated liabilities as outlined in the tables herein, were discharged and/or written-off in conjunction with the Settlement Agreement (as defined below) because of\nthem having a net zero dollar estimated liability value. Accordingly, the Company recognized a net of estimated liability adjustments gain/loss of approximately $0, and an\nimpairment loss of approximately $4,400,000, presented in income (loss) from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31,\n2023. As part of the abandonment, the Company cancelled third party contracts, settled outstanding vendor and other third-party obligations, ceased to enter new customer\ncontracts via Medigap, and no further customer performance obligations existed. The Company does not expect further continuing involvement with Medigap, and in accordance\nwith ASC 205-20-45-9, no corporate overhead has been allocated to discontinued operations.\nSettlement Agreement\nOn June 30, 2023, the Company entered into a confidential settlement agreement and mutual release (the \"Settlement Agreement”) with certain Medigap affiliated entities and\npersons, and the former owners of Medigap, whereby the Company would receive a settlement payment, net of costs, of $2,761,190 and was released from all past and future\nMedigap obligations and liabilities. The settlement payment was received in full by the Company in July 2023 and is recorded as income from discontinued operations in the\ncondensed consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe following tables present the major components of assets and liabilities included in discontinued operations on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nAccounts receivable $ -

The majority of the Company’s individual and family health insurance plans are sold in the annual open enrollment\nperiod as defined under the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and related amendments in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act. Individuals and\nfamilies generally are not able to purchase individual and family health insurance outside of these open enrollment periods, unless they qualify for a special enrollment period as a\nresult of certain qualifying events, such as losing employer-sponsored health insurance or moving to another state.\nF-17\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn March 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-01, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope Application of Profits Interest and Similar Awards (\"ASU 2024-01”), to\nclarify the scope application of profits interest and similar awards by adding illustrative guidance in ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. The ASU clarifies how to\ndetermine whether profits interest and similar awards are in the scope of ASC 718 and applies to all reporting entities that account for profits interest awards as compensation to\nemployees or non-employees. In addition to adding the illustrative guidance, the ASU modified the language in paragraph 718-10-15-3 to improve its clarity and\noperability. However, this amendment does not change the intent of that guidance, nor how it should be applied. The ASU’s amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning\nafter December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those years. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of the adoption of ASU No. 2024-01 on its consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU”) 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to\nIncome Tax Disclosures. ASU 2023-09 improves the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring, on an annual basis, consistent categories, and greater disaggregation of\ninformation in the rate reconciliation as well as income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December\n15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively, however, retrospective application is permitted. The Company is currently\nevaluating the impact that this guidance will have on its disclosures.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. ASU 2023-07 expands reportable segment\ndisclosures by requiring disclosure, on an annual and interim basis, of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM”)\nand included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss as well as an amount and description of other segment items. ASU 2023-07 also requires interim disclosures of\na reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets, disclosure of the title and position of the CODM, and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure of segment\nprofit or loss in assessing performance and allocating resources. ASU 2023-07 is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods\nwithin fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in this update are required to be applied retrospectively to all prior periods\npresented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on its disclosures.\nNOTE 3.

The APA contains standard, commercial representations and\nwarranties and covenants. The source of the cash payment was $6,520,000 in funds borrowed from Oak Street Lending (\"Loan”), our existing lender pursuant to a Fifth Amendment\nto Credit Agreement and Promissory Note, of even date. The purchase price is subject to post-closing adjustment to reconcile certain pre-closing credits and liabilities of the\nparties.\nThe acquisition of Barra was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with the acquisition method pursuant to FASB Topic No. 805, Business Combination (ASC\n805). Accordingly, the total purchase consideration was allocated to the assets acquired, and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values. The acquisition\nmethod of accounting requires, among other things, that assets acquired, and liabilities assumed, if any, in a business purchase combination be recognized at their fair values as of\nthe acquisition date. The process for estimating the fair values of identifiable intangible assets and certain tangible assets requires the use of significant estimates and\nassumptions, including estimating future cash flows, developing appropriate discount rates, estimating the costs, and timing.\nThe preliminary allocation of the purchase price in connection with the acquisition of Barra was calculated as follows:\nWeighted\nAverage Useful\nDescription Fair Value Life (Years)\nAcquired accounts receivable $ 92,585\nProperty, plant, and equipment 8,593 7\nRight-of-use asset 122,984\nTrade names 22,000 4\nCustomer relationships 550,000 10\nDeveloped technology 230,000 5\nAgency relationships 2,585,000 10\nLease liability (122,984)\nGoodwill 4,236,822 Indefinite\n$ 7,725,000\nF-19\nTrade name was measured at fair value using the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach. Significant inputs used to measure the fair value include an estimate of\nprojected revenue from the trade name, a pre-tax royalty rate of 0.5% and a discount rate of 19.5%.\nCustomer and Agency relationships were measured at fair value using the multiple-period excess earnings method under the income approach. Significant inputs used to measure\nthe fair value include an estimate of projected revenue and costs associated with existing customers, and a discount rate of 19.5%.\nDeveloped technology was measured at fair value using the cost replacement method of the cost approach.

The commitment to issue Series B Warrants (the \"Warrant Commitment”) represents a derivative financial\ninstrument, other than an outstanding share, that, at inception, has both of the following characteristics: (i) embodies a conditional obligation indexed to the Company’s equity.\nThe Company classified the commitment to issue the warrants as a derivative liability because it represents a written option that does not qualify for equity accounting The\nCompany initially measured the derivative liability at its fair value and will subsequently remeasure the derivative liability, at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in\nearnings. An option pricing model was utilized to calculate the fair value of the Warrant Commitment. The Company initially recorded $17,408,311 of non-operating unrealized\nlosses within the recognition and change in fair value of warrant liabilities account for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe Private Placement closed on January 4, 2022, at which time the Company remeasured the derivative liability for the warrants issued in the transaction, recognizing $17,408,311\nof non-operating unrealized losses and a derivative liability of $55,061,119.

The Placement Agent Warrants (PAW) are: (i) exercisable on any day after the six (6) month anniversary of the issue date, (ii) expire five years after\nthe closing of the Private Placement, and (iii) exercisable at $61.35 per share. The Placement Agent Warrants contain terms that may require the Company to transfer assets to settle\nthe warrants. Therefore, the Placement Agent Warrants are classified as a derivative liability, initially measured at fair value of $1,525,923 on the date of issuance and will be\nremeasured each accounting period with the changes in fair value reported in earnings. The Placement Agent Warrants are considered financing expense fees paid to the\nPlacement Agent in relation to a derivative liability measured at fair value, thus, are included along with non-operating unrealized gains and losses in the recognition and change in\nfair value of warrant liabilities account in the consolidated statements of operations.\nF-25\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, net fair value gains recognized for the PAW were, $48,575 and $1,477,024 respectively, presented in the recognition and change in\nfair value of warrant liabilities account in the consolidated statements of operations.

Black-Scholes option-pricing models require the\nCompany to make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, recipient exercise behavior, and dividend yield. The Company estimated the future stock price\nvolatility using the historical volatility over the expected term of the option. The expected term of the options was computed by taking the mid-point between the vesting date and\nexpiration date. The following assumptions were used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, not accounting for the reverse splits:\nYear Ended Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nExercise price $ 0.16 - $0.26 $ 0.16 - $0.26\nExpected term 3.25 to 3.75 years 3.25 to 3.75 years\nRisk-free interest rate 0.38% - 2.43% 0.38% - 2.43%\nEstimated volatility 293.07% - 517.13% 293.07% - 517.13%\nExpected dividend - -\nStock Awards\nThe Plans provide for various forms of stock awards.

For the full terms of our common and preferred stock, please refer to our articles\nof incorporation, as amended from time to time, and our bylaws, as amended from time to time. The Florida Business Corporation Act (“FBCA”) may also affect the terms of these\nsecurities.\nOur authorized capital stock consists of 2,750,000,000 shares of capital stock with a par value of $0.086 per share, consisting of 2,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value of\n$0.086 per share, and 750,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value of $0.086 per share, which may, at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors be issued in one or more series.\nThe Board of Directors has designated 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and 9,077 shares of preferred stock as Series B Convertible\nPreferred Stock. As of the date of this filing, there were 5,692,387 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, held by approximately 519 holders of record, no shares of the\nSeries A Convertible Preferred Stock and no shares of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding. The authorized and unissued shares of both common stock\nand preferred stock are available for issuance without further action by our stockholders, unless such action is required by applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange on\nwhich our securities may be listed. Unless approval of our stockholders is so required, our board of directors will not seek stockholder approval for the issuance and sale of either\nour common stock or preferred stock.\nThe Board may from time to time authorize by resolution the issuance of any or all shares of the preferred stock authorized in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in\nthe articles of incorporation, as amended, for such purposes, in such amounts, to such persons, corporations, or entities, for such consideration and in one or more series, all as the\nBoard in its discretion may determine and without any vote or other action by the stockholders, except as otherwise required by law.\nCommon Stock\nDividends. Subject to the rights of holders of any Preferred Stock having preference as to dividends and except as otherwise provided by the Articles of Incorporation from time to\ntime, or the FBCA, as the same may be amended and supplemented, the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive dividends when, as and if declared by the board of\ndirectors out of assets legally available therefor.\nVoting Rights. Except as otherwise provided by the FBCA, the holders of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share of\nCommon Stock. No holder of shares of Common Stock shall have the right to cumulate votes.\nLiquidation Rights. In the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, subject to the prior rights of holders\nof Preferred Stock to share ratably in the Company’s assets, the Common Stock and any shares of Preferred Stock which are not entitled to any preference in liquidation shall share\nequally and ratably in the Company’s assets available for distribution after giving effect to any liquidation preference of any shares of Preferred Stock. A merger, conversion,\nexchange or consolidation of the Company with or into any other person or sale or transfer of all or any part of the assets of the Company (which shall not in fact result in the\nliquidation of the Company and the distribution of assets to stockholders) shall not be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs\nof the Company.\nNo Conversion, Redemption, or Preemptive Rights. The holders of Common Stock shall not have any conversion, redemption, or preemptive rights.\nConsideration for Shares. The Common Stock authorized by the Articles of Incorporation shall be issued for such consideration as shall be fixed, from time to time, by the board of\ndirectors.\nNon-Assessment of Stock. The Common Stock, after the amount of the subscription price has been fully paid, are non-assessable.\nReverse Stock Split\nOn February 23, 2023, pursuant to authority granted by the Board, we implemented a 1-for-15 reverse split of our authorized and issued and outstanding common stock (the\n“Reverse Split-2023”). The par value remained unchanged. All share and per share information as well as common stock and additional paid-in capital have been retroactively\nadjusted to reflect the Reverse Split-2023 for all periods presented, unless otherwise indicated. The split resulted in a rounding addition of approximately 15,300 shares valued at\npar, totaling $1,300.\nPreferred Stock\nOur board of directors may, without further action by our stockholders, fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of up to an aggregate of 750,000,000 shares of\nPreferred Stock in one or more series and authorize their issuance. The voting powers, designations, preferences, limitations, restrictions, and relative, participating, option and\nother rights of the Preferred Stock and the qualifications, limitations, or restrictions relating thereto, shall be prescribed by resolution of the board of directors pursuant to the\nArticles of Incorporation.\nThe following summary of terms of our Preferred Stock is not complete. You should refer to the provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and the resolutions\ncontaining the terms of each class or series of the Preferred Stock which have been or will be filed with the SEC at or prior to the time of issuance of such class or series of Preferred\nStock and described in the applicable prospectus supplement. The applicable prospectus supplement may also state that any of the terms set forth herein are inapplicable to such\nseries of Preferred Stock, provided that the information set forth in such prospectus supplement does not constitute material changes to the information herein such that it alters\nthe nature of the offering or the securities offered.\nWe will fix the designations, voting powers, preferences and rights of the preferred stock of each series we issue, as well as the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, in\nthe certificate of designation relating to that series.\nSeries A Convertible Preferred Stock. Each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall have ten (10) votes per share and may be converted into ten (10) shares of $0.086\npar value common stock. The holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, if and as declared by the Board, out of funds legally available\ntherefore, cumulative dividends payable in cash. The annual interest rate at which cumulative preferred dividends will accrue on each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock\nis 0%. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, before any distribution of assets of the Corporation shall be made to or\nset apart for the holders of the Common Stock and subject and subordinate to the rights of secured creditors of the Company, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall receive\nan amount per share equal to the greater of (i) one dollar ($1.00), adjusted for any recapitalization, stock combinations, stock dividends (whether paid or unpaid), stock options and\nthe like with respect to such shares, plus any accumulated but unpaid dividends (whether or not earned or declared) on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, and (ii) the\namount such holder would have received if such holder has converted its shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to common stock, subject to but immediately prior to such\nliquidation. As of December 31, 2021, all Series A Convertible Preferred Stock had been converted into shares of common stock and none remain issued and outstanding.\nSeries B Convertible Preferred Stock. In January 2022, the Company issued 9,076 shares of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock through the Private Placement for the purpose\nof raising capital. The Series B Convertible Preferred Stock have no voting rights and initially each share may be converted into 16 shares of the Company’s common stock. The\nholders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock are not entitled to receive any dividends other than any dividends paid on account of the common stock. In the event of any\nvoluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the holders shall be entitled to receive out of the assets, whether capital or surplus, of the\nCompany the same amount that a holder of common stock would receive if the Preferred Stock were fully converted (disregarding for such purposes any conversion limitations\nhereunder) to common stock which amounts shall be paid pari-passu with all holders of common stock. During August 2022, all 9,076 Series B Convertible Preferred Stock were\nconverted by third parties into 147,939 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, all shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock had been converted and\nnone remain outstanding.\nStock Options\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company adopted the Reliance Global Group, Inc. 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) under which various forms of equity\nawards can be granted to employees, directors, consultants, and service providers. Awards include but are not limited to, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance\nshares and stock options. A total of 46,667 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the Plan, and as of June 30, 2023 there are 10,928 options outstanding at a\nweighted average exercise price of $232.78 with a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.12 years. 35,739 shares remain available for issuance pursuant to the Plan. With\nregards to stock options, the Company issues new shares of common stock from the shares reserved under the Plan upon exercise of stock options.\nThe Plan is administered by the Board. The Board is authorized to select from among eligible employees, directors, and service providers those individuals to whom shares and\noptions are to be granted and to determine the number of shares to be subject to, and the terms and conditions of the options. The Board is also authorized to prescribe, amend,\nand rescind terms relating to options granted under the Plan. Generally, the interpretation and construction of any provision of the Plan or any shares and options granted\nhereunder is within the discretion of the Board.\nThe Plan provides that options may or may not be Incentive Stock Options (ISOs) within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code. Only employees of the\nCompany are eligible to receive ISOs, while employees, non-employee directors, consultants, and service providers are eligible to receive options which are not ISOs, i.e. “Non-\nStatutory Stock Options.” The options granted by the Board in connection with its adoption of the Plan were Non-Statutory Stock Options.\nThe fair value of each option granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model or the value of the services provided, whichever is more readily\ndeterminable. The Black-Scholes option pricing model takes into account, as of the grant date, the exercise price and expected life of the option, the current price of the underlying\nstock and its expected volatility, expected dividends on the stock and the risk-free interest rate for the term of the option.\nEffects of Authorized but Unissued Stock\nWe have shares of common stock and preferred stock available for future issuance without stockholder approval, subject to any limitations imposed by the listing standards of the\nNasdaq Capital Market. We may utilize these additional shares for a variety of corporate purposes, including for future public offerings to raise additional capital, or facilitate\ncorporate acquisitions or for payment as a dividend on our capital stock. The existence of unissued and unreserved common stock and preferred stock may enable our board of\ndirectors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management or to issue preferred stock with terms that could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to\nacquire or could discourage a third party from seeking to acquire, a controlling interest in our company by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise. In addition,\nif we issue preferred stock, the issuance could adversely affect the voting power of holders of common stock, and the likelihood that such holders will receive dividend payments\nand payments upon liquidation.\nFlorida Law and Certain Charter and Bylaw Provisions\nFlorida Anti-Takeover Law. As a Florida corporation, we are subject to certain anti-takeover provisions that apply to public corporations under Florida law.\nPursuant to Section 607.0901 of the FBCA a publicly held Florida corporation may not engage in a broad range of business combinations or other extraordinary corporate\ntransactions with an interested shareholder without the approval of the holders of two-thirds of the voting shares of the corporation (excluding shares held by the interested\nshareholder), unless:\n● The transaction is approved by a majority of disinterested directors before the shareholder becomes an interested shareholder;\n● The interested shareholder has owned at least 80% of the corporation’s outstanding voting shares for at least five years preceding the announcement date of any such\nbusiness combination;\n● The interested shareholder is the beneficial owner of at least 90% of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation, exclusive of shares acquired directly from the\ncorporation in a transaction not approved by a majority of the disinterested directors; or\n● The consideration paid to the holders of the corporation’s voting stock is at least equal to certain fair price criteria.\nAn interested shareholder is defined as a person who, together with affiliates and associates, beneficially owns more than 10% of a corporation’s outstanding voting shares. We\nhave not made an election in our Articles of Incorporation to opt out of Section 607.0901.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 607.0902 of the FBCA which prohibits the voting of shares in a publicly held Florida corporation that are acquired in a control share\nacquisition unless (i) the board of directors approved such acquisition prior to its consummation or (ii) after such acquisition, in lieu of prior approval by the board of directors, the\nholders of a majority of the corporation’s voting shares, exclusive of shares owned by officers of the corporation, employee directors or the acquiring party, approve the granting\nof voting rights as to the shares acquired in the control share acquisition. A control share acquisition is defined as an acquisition that immediately thereafter entitles the acquiring\nparty to 20% or more of the total voting power in an election of directors.\nArticles of Incorporation, as amended and Bylaws.\nOur Articles of Incorporation, as amended and Bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of discouraging potential acquisition proposals or tender offers or delaying or\npreventing a change of control of our company. These provisions are as follows:\n● they provide that special meetings of shareholders may be called by the board of directors, or at the request in writing by shareholders of record owning at least 10% of all\nthe stockholders entitled to vote; and\n● they do not include a provision for cumulative voting in the election of directors. Under cumulative voting, a minority shareholder holding a sufficient number of shares\nmay be able to ensure the election of one or more directors. The absence of cumulative voting may have the effect of limiting the ability of minority shareholders to effect\nchanges in the board of directors.\nTransfer Agent\nThe transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is VStock Transfer. The transfer agent and registrar’s address is 18 Lafayette Place, Woodmere, New York 11598. Its\ntelephone number is (212) 828-8436.\nListing on the Nasdaq Capital Market\nOur Common Stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “RELI” and our Series A Warrants are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol\n“RELIW”.\nExhibit 23.1\nConsent of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nWe hereby consent to the incorporation by reference in the Registration Statements on Form S-8 (File Nos. 333-267799 and 333-275911), Registration Statements on Form S-1 (File\nNos. 333-249381, 333-252884, 333-262445, and 333-271110), and Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-275190) of our report dated April 4, 2024 on the consolidated\nfinancial statements of Reliance Global Group, Inc as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and for each of the two years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2023, which appears\nin the Annual Report on Form 10-K of Reliance Global Group, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n/s/ Mazars USA LLP\nMazars USA LLP\nFort Washington, Pennsylvania\nApril 4, 2024\nExhibit 31.1\nCERTIFICATIONS\nI, Ezra Beyman, certify that:\n1.

Ezra Beyman, Reliance's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"We are very pleased to report a highly successful third quarter, both in growing our revenues, as well as in controlling our operating costs, which has resulted in sustained revenue growth, decreased expenses and improved net financial results.\" The following presents some key financial highlights for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024: | **Financial Highlights**| **Three Months Ended**| **$ Change**| **% Change**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**September 30,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**  \nCommission income| $| 3,441,458| $| 3,275,583| $| 165,875| 5%  \nCommission expense| $| 902,246| $| 796,001| $| 106,245| 13%  \nSalaries and wages| $| 1,707,737| $| 1,803,698| $| (95,961| )| -5%  \nGeneral and administrative expenses| $| 821,510| $| 1,068,778| $| (247,268| )| -23%  \nMarketing and advertising expenses| $| 100,183| $| 117,752| $| (17,569| )| -15%  \nTotal operating expenses| $| 3,953,435| $| 4,710,637| $| (757,202| )| -16%  \nLoss from operations| $| (511,977| )| $| (1,435,054| )| $| 923,077| -64%  \nRecognition and change in fair value of warrant liabilities - gain (loss)| $| -| $| 1,715,397| $| (1,715,397| )| -100%  \nNet loss| $| (837,314| )| $| (139,004| )| $| (698,310| )| 502%  \nAEBITDA| $| 42,508| $| (200,602| )| $| 243,111| 121%  \n  \nMr. Beyman continued, \"As illustrated above, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023, revenues continued to grow by 5% to $3.4 million and total operating expenses continued to decrease by 16% to $3.9 million, positively impacting loss from operations which shows a very refreshing 64% improvement, notwithstanding a 13% increase in commission expense driven by higher first year commissions. Net loss came in at approximately $837,000, and when compared to net loss of approximately $139,000 in the prior year's third quarter, or $1.8 million when adjusted for comparability purposes to remove the $1.7 million warrant liability fair value gain (as that instrument was substantially liquidated during 2024), net loss for the current year's quarter versus the prior year's quarter shows an improvement of approximately $1 million, or 54%. Further, we are very pleased to report that this quarter brings positive Adjusted EBITDA (\"AEBITDA\" a non-GAAP metric), coming in at an approximate $43,000 gain, representing a 121% increase from the same period in the prior year.\"\n\n\"These highly positive financial results are a testament to the success of our OneFirm strategy, which brings together our owned and operated, but geographically dispersed, insurance agencies, to operate as one cohesive unit, allowing for efficient and effective cross-selling, cross-collaboration, and human capital cross utilization. The OneFirm enhancements are clearly evident and demonstrated by the quarter's promising revenue growth, shrinkage in operating costs and positive changes to net results. We feel strongly that our disciplined approach strengthens our financial position and sets the stage for continued sustained growth and long-term value creation for our shareholders.\"\n\n\"We also remain focused and highly energized in anticipation of a close in the coming months on the previously announced acquisition of Spetner Associates Inc. (\"Spetner\"), a leading voluntary benefits insurance agency/provider to over 85,000 employees nationally, and we are confident that the integration of Spetner will close to double our consolidated revenues and serve as a catalyst for additional accelerated revenue growth, by having an expanded combined range of service offerings, enhancing our market position and paving the way for sustained profitability and longer term success.\"\n\n\"Additionally, in the third quarter of 2024, we were thrilled to launch our AI-powered Quote & Bind solution on the RELI Exchange platform ahead of schedule, offering our agents a transformative tool that significantly accelerates the quoting and binding process for commercial insurance policies. This cutting-edge technology is now live, enabling agents to provide faster, more competitive quotes and bind policies instantly, meeting client needs in real time. The solution not only enhances operational efficiency for our partners but also creates new revenue opportunities by capitalizing on high-demand commercial lines, such as, general liability, cyber liability, and workers compensation.\"\n\nMr. Beyman concluded, \"Our mission at Reliance remains to build a multi-billion dollar, highly profitable business enterprise, through the execution of our strategic business initiatives, including, expansion, innovation and disciplined fiscal management, which will drive sustained growth, strengthen our market share, and consistently provide substantial returns and long-lasting value for our shareholders.\"\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nReliance Global Group will host a conference call today at 4:30 PM Eastern Time to discuss the Company's financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as well as the Company's corporate progress and other developments.\n\nThe conference call will be available via telephone by dialing toll-free +1 877-545-0320 for U.S. callers or +1 973-528-0002 for international callers and entering access code 442767.

These liabilities are valued at each reporting period and the changes are reported as either a gain or loss in the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables account in the consolidated statements of operations. The gain or loss is non-cash, can be highly volatile and overall is not deemed relevant to ongoing operations, thus, it's excluded to provide more meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's core operational performance.  \n•| Recognition and change in fair value of warrant liabilities: This account includes changes to derivative warrant liabilities which are valued at each reporting period and could result in either a gain or loss. The period changes do not impact cash, can be highly volatile, and are unrelated to ongoing operations, and thus are excluded to provide more meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's core operational performance.  \n•| Other income (expense), net: Includes non-routine income or expenses and other individually de minimis items and is thus excluded as unrelated to core operations of the company.  \n•| Transactional costs: This includes expenses related to mergers, acquisitions, financings and refinancings, and amendments or modification to indebtedness.

(Nasdaq: RELI)**(\"Reliance\", \"we\" or the \"Company\") today announced the official launch of the beta version of its highly anticipated AI-powered Quote & Bind InsurTech solution for commercial policies. Initially scheduled for release in Q4 2024, the new solution has been launched ahead of schedule, giving RELI Exchange agency partners immediate access to this cutting-edge technology. The solution, now live on the RELI Exchange platform, enables agents to generate real-time quotes and bind commercial insurance policies instantly from their dashboard. This advanced system covers a wide range of commercial insurance lines, including workers' compensation, general liability, cyber liability, business owner's policies, and executive coverages such as directors & officers (D&O) insurance and employment practices liability insurance (EPLI). The early launch of the Quote & Bind solution is set to rapidly enhance revenue streams for RELI Exchange partners by streamlining the traditionally labor-intensive quoting process for commercial policies. Agents can now offer clients faster, more competitive quotes and bind coverage instantly, transforming how commercial insurance is transacted with the help of AI automation. With the solution now in beta, RELI Exchange is already gathering valuable feedback from its users to refine and enhance the platform. The Company expects this AI-driven feature to contribute significantly to premium volume growth and anticipates millions of dollars in new premiums being added to its books in the coming year.  Ezra Beyman, Chairman and CEO of Reliance, commented, \"We are excited to have officially launched our beta version of the AI-powered Quote & Bind solution ahead of schedule, marking a major step forward for both our company and agency partners. By delivering this innovative tool early, we are providing our agents with the ability to capitalize on new revenue opportunities now. The solution's ability to quote and bind larger commercial policies seamlessly is expected to boost agent efficiency and generate significant premium growth for the Company with minimal operational overhead. This early launch further reinforces our commitment to delivering state-of-the-art technology to our agency partners, and empowering them to succeed in an increasingly competitive market.\" Moshe Fishman, Director of Insurtech and Operations at Reliance, added, \"The early launch of this feature is a game-changer for our agents, allowing them to tap into lucrative commercial policy markets with ease. The ability to quote and bind these larger policies with AI-based automation not only increases efficiency but also creates tremendous revenue potential. Just one commercial policy can have the same impact as dozens of smaller policies, meaning agents can add substantial premiums to their books with minimal effort. We believe this positions both our agents and Reliance for exponential growth in the coming months and years.\" **About Reliance Global Group, Inc.** Reliance Global Group, Inc.

The Company also reaffirmed that the transaction remains on track and is anticipated to close, as announced, in the second half of 2024. Ezra Beyman, Chairman and CEO of Reliance Global Group, stated, \"We are pleased to announce that we have revised the terms of the pending acquisition of Spetner Associates, reducing our upfront cash consideration to $5.5 million, from $8 million as originally contemplated. As such, we believe the new terms are substantially improved for our shareholders, and provide us greater flexibility in how we fund the transaction-in order to minimize dilution and maximize returns. We believe that the sellers' willingness to accept less cash up front and a larger seller-financed note later reflects their confidence in the value of the combined entity, post-acquisition.\" \"As we have previously stated, the transaction is surpassing our initial expectations. Since first announcing our plans, Spetner's BenManage voluntary benefit insurance segment has experienced impressive growth, now covering over 85,000 employees, a significant increase from their 45,000 covered employees when the transaction was first announced. We could not be more excited about the continued growth in the underlying business as the acquisition is expected to nearly double our annual revenue to approximately $28 million, and meaningfully boost our Adjusted EBITDA.\" \"We remain focused on our long-term goal of building a highly profitable business that generates strong returns for our shareholders. We believe this transformative acquisition will unlock significant opportunities aligned with our 'OneFirm' strategy. We remain committed to making Reliance a leading technology-driven company focused on sustainable profitability and enhanced shareholder value, and we expect the acquisition of Spetner Associates to greatly accelerate our growth trajectory.\" **About Reliance Global Group, Inc.** Reliance Global Group, Inc.
