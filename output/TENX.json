The left ventricle has reduced compliance (i.e. “stiffness”) which limits its ability to fill with blood normally\n2. Chronic sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation results in excessive venous return (stressed blood\nvolume) which produces elevated filling pressure in the heart\n3. Chronic elevation in pulmonary venous pressure leads to elevation in the pulmonary arterial pressure\n(pulmonary hypertension).\n8\nPH-HFpEF\nPathophysiology\nHFpEF and PH-HFpEF Share Two Underlying Physiological Features that are\nthe Critical Targets for Treatments\nTherapeutic Targets\nLeft Ventricle Stiffness Volume Overload\nExcessive venous return from chronic\nMultifactorial in nature, difficult to\nSNS activation as a maladaptive\nmeasure, increases with aging\nresponse\nThis pathophysiology predicts that pulmonary vasodilators (PAH drugs) are doomed to fail in\nPH-HFpEF as these agents drive even more blood into the left ventricle.\n9\nPH-HFpEF\nPathophysiology\nThis patient has excessive\nblood in her veins: lowering\nelevated venous pressure is\nthe objective\n10\nPH-HFpEF\nPathophysiology\nReviving the Fundamental Role of the Splanchnic Circulation\n35% of circulating 35% of circulating\nblood is in the blood is in the\nsystemic veins systemic arteries\n30% of circulating blood is in the\nsplanchnic vascular reservoir\nAnesthesiology 2004; 100:434–9\n11\nPH-HFpEF\nPathophysiology\nOverview: Pathophysiology of PH with HFpEF\nThe Venous Circulation Has Now Been Discovered to Be the Source of the Problem\nPH-HFpEF has recently been\ndescribed to follow this course:\nEXCESSIVE VENOUS RETURN/VOLUME\nOral Levosimendan’s MOA INCREASED CENTRAL VENOUS PRESSURE\naddresses the underlying\npathophysiology\nINCREASED PULMONARY VENOUS PRESSURE\nPULMONARY HYPERTENSION\nFudim M, Kaye DM, Borlaug BA, et.al.Venous Tone and Stressed Blood Volume in HeartFailure: JACC Review Topic of the Week.\nJ Am Coll Cardiol. 2022 May 10;79(18):1858-1869.. 12\nMechanism of Action\nLevosimendan is a Potent Venodilator\nEffects on Isolated\nHuman Portal Vein\n• Strong vasodilatory action on the pulmonary\nvasculature via K+ATP channel activation\n• Downregulation of potassium channels is a\nhallmark of pulmonary hypertension\n• Strong vasodilatory action on the splanchnic\nvasculature\n• Key to its beneficial effect in PH-HFpEF\nLevosimendan\nMondéjar-Parreño G, et.al.
