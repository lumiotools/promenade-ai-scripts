(Nasdaq: BBIO) (BridgeBio or the Company), a new type of biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Attruby™ (acoramidis), an orally-administered near-complete (≥90%) stabilizer of Transthyretin (TTR) for the treatment of adults with ATTR-CM to reduce cardiovascular death and cardiovascular-related hospitalization. The FDA approval is based on positive results seen in the ATTRibute-CM Phase 3 study, where Attruby significantly reduced death and cardiovascular-related hospitalization, and improved quality of life.\n\n“We are excited to be part of the celebration for the FDA approval of Attruby. The need for more treatment options for patients living with ATTR-CM is crucial to achieving the goal of better outcomes and improved quality of life. Access to this new therapy means more hope and more opportunity to improve the lives of patients with amyloidosis,” said Muriel Finkel, President of Amyloidosis Support Groups, a non-profit organization dedicated to the support of amyloidosis patients and caregivers.\n\nAttruby is the first and only approved product with a label specifying near-complete stabilization of TTR. Attruby was designed to mimic a naturally occurring \"rescue mutation” of the TTR gene (T119M) that targets the root cause of ATTR-CM, destabilization of the native TTR tetramer. Through near-complete TTR stabilization, Attruby has been shown to preserve the native function of TTR as a transport protein of thyroxine and vitamin A and to demonstrate benefit on cardiovascular outcomes.\n\nThe ATTRibute-CM Phase 3 study enrolled 632 participants with symptomatic ATTR-CM, associated with either wild-type or variant TTR. Participants were randomized 2:1 to receive Attruby or placebo for 30 months. As published in The New England Journal of Medicine, the trial successfully met its primary endpoint of a 4-component composite endpoint of ACM, CVH, N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and 6-minute walk distance with a Win Ratio of 1.8 (p<0.0001). Attruby demonstrated a statistically significant treatment effect at 30 months on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire and 6-minute walk test. Additionally, the increase in NT-proBNP on treatment was about half that of placebo.\n\n\"Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis is a progressive disease with a poor prognosis when left untreated. Having a new first line treatment option which provides excellent TTR stabilization and improves outcomes in this disease gives patients more options,” said Martha Grogan, M.D., of the Mayo Clinic. “Encouraging data suggests Attruby reduces all-cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalization as early as three months after initiation of therapy. With continued advances in therapy, this previously fatal disease is becoming a manageable chronic cardiovascular condition.\"\n\nBridgeBio offers a patient support services program, ForgingBridges™, for people in the U.S. prescribed Attruby and their families to receive help accessing this new therapy. ForgingBridges includes insurance resources, financial assistance options and a dedicated support team to assist in the treatment journey. More information about BridgeBio’s patient support services program is available on [ForgingBridges.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=NCE0zn5NfuO7R2i1OSctfUi1PQhvDCLc0NghD5In88ldUhGrGauw62qou5CKNspp5k7CfRv4sA3jBUDJpVa4obQ0JhYeTxGhlUpqtl5Ok6k=) or by calling 1-888-55-BRIDGE (1-888-552-7434).\n\n“With the landmark approval of Attruby, we gain the ability to serve patients with ATTR-CM. I’m grateful to each trial participant, their families, and the physicians, scientists and our team at BridgeBio who made this possible,” said Neil Kumar, Ph.D., founder and CEO. “Our journey is not over as we look to pursue approvals globally, next in Europe, Japan, and Brazil, and to continue exploring the full potential of this treatment. I am thrilled to extend our mission of ‘putting patients first’ with this third FDA approval in less than 10 years.”\n\nBridgeBio submitted a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency, with a decision expected in 2025. BridgeBio has granted exclusive rights to Bayer to commercialize acoramidis for ATTR-CM in Europe.\n\n**Management Remarks on Attruby** BridgeBio will share management remarks on key aspects of the Attruby label and important access programs on Friday, November 22, 2024 at 8:00 pm ET. A link to the remarks may be accessed from the event calendar page of BridgeBio’s website at [https://investor.bridgebio.com/news-and-events/event-calendar](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=hHFweghyC0dkP2oowip-tOxyUZ1IsLqoOtqXUojbiSK9UkdbLXX2ZiW6OXmjfwK0_WkIabRP5SQkP_F-HWV2fcCJtcF4W2DsuLIiVdRTAdIGGHEeSGjFStnRgyd4xPXwXRD0Flwaxi4ANr4AduACVDvHbB4Wtr2m0KS9QmnG9QtKBFEzvt6q5OFSDuTMb2w-UabbHPbwXjfKFTVVc24SOw==).

(Nasdaq: BBIO) (“BridgeBio” or the “Company”), a new type of biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases, presented positive initial outcomes from the ATTRibute-CM open-label extension (OLE) study of acoramidis in ATTR-CM at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions. ATTRibute-CM was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acoramidis, an investigational, near-complete, orally-administered, small molecule stabilizer of TTR. The preliminary results from this ongoing OLE study were also [**simultaneously published in** _**Circulation**_](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.072771). The OLE study involves 389 participants who completed the 30-month ATTRibute-CM Phase 3 study.\n\n“Results from the ATTRibute-CM OLE continue to showcase the potential of acoramidis, with ongoing data across the study suggesting that early intervention with this stabilizer leads to early separation from placebo, with sustained benefit for patients with ATTR-CM,” said Daniel Judge, M.D., professor of medicine and cardiology at the Medical University of South Carolina. “The prescribing community is eager to have another important treatment option given the remaining high unmet need for ATTR-CM patients.”\n\nKey initial results from the OLE study, presented by Dr. Judge at AHA, show that continuous treatment with acoramidis led to:\n\n  * A confirmed sustained improvement relative to placebo in time to first event (CVH or ACM) starting at Month 3 in ATTRibute-CM\n  * A statistically significant reduction in ACM alone of 36% by Month 36 (p=0.009) and 34% by Month 42 (p=0.006), as assessed by the Stratified Cox proportional hazards model \n  * A significant reduction of composite ACM and CVH by 46% at Month 36 (p<0.0001) and 48% at Month 42 (p<0.0001), as assessed by negative binomial regression, building upon the previously presented 42% reduction at Month 30 in ATTRibute-CM\n  * Evidence of early benefit in patients who crossed over from placebo to acoramidis after Month 30 as compared to extrapolated placebo curve reinforces the early separation seen previously in ATTRibute-CM\n  * Acoramidis continues to be well tolerated, with no new clinically significant safety signals identified in this long-term evaluation\n\n\n\nThe OLE data build on previously reported results from ATTRibute-CM in which acoramidis demonstrated clinically important treatment effects on mortality, CVH, and quality of life, further supporting that greater transthyretin (TTR) stabilization can improve clinical outcomes for patients. This included a 50% reduction in the cumulative frequency of CVH relative to placebo at Month 30.\n\n“We are pleased to share the initial results from the ongoing open-label extension study of ATTRibute-CM, which showcase the sustained benefits of acoramidis treatment for patients with ATTR-CM,” said Jonathan Fox, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer of BridgeBio Cardiorenal. “Coupled with acoramidis’ earliest time to separation of any known ATTR-CM treatment on clinical outcomes at 3 months, these analyses continue to support acoramidis as a meaningful first line option.”\n\nIn addition to the featured science oral presentation at AHA, BridgeBio also shared three moderated posters:\n\n  * Costs and Healthcare Resource Utilization in Transthyretin Amyloid Cardiomyopathy Exceeds That of Generalized Heart Failure\n  * Evolving Baseline Risk in Patients with Transthyretin Amyloid Cardiomyopathy: A Systematic Literature Review of Clinical Trials\n  * Acoramidis Improved Survival in Patients with Transthyretin Cardiac Amyloidosis Regardless of Prior Cardiovascular Hospitalization \n\n\n\nThese findings reinforce the importance of an effective therapy that reduces CVH and improves survival in patients with ATTR-CM.\n\nBased on the positive results from ATTRibute-CM, BridgeBio submitted a New Drug Application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which has been accepted with a PDUFA action date of November 29, 2024, and a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency, with a decision expected in 2025.

(Nasdaq: BBIO) (“BridgeBio” or the “Company”), a new type of biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases, announced that positive 18-month results from PROPEL 2, a Phase 2 trial of the investigational therapy infigratinib in children with achondroplasia, were published as an original research article in [the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) today](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=W4AAI_tsT3lahBkwisE2WN9QSsLE3vuuOtWI_3Zzsn5btYiOI7IwxsmVMN15f8uIOENz9_6X_WewflcLzM0REa0Sui-OO3G1AyjJqepD4fMouEus7hLA9AxlbN0TTf_t5FN_CGlPsr6Ju25SI0VJcPgpsMF7RkcVnG5C6LDzLX-tGhFKgbIZQf3up_TKQfC_s8iWUyWQNGBvTUxQcNYBhLl3Ub1vMdJIzCxyoE9w1VE=). Infigratinib is an investigational oral small molecule designed to inhibit FGFR3 signaling and target achondroplasia at its source. These data, which were also presented today at the 62nd Annual European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology (ESPE) Meeting in Liverpool, demonstrate continued potential best-in-class efficacy and an encouraging safety profile as a first-in-class oral treatment option.\n\n“Publication of results from PROPEL 2 in the New England Journal of Medicine and Breakthrough Therapy Designation of infigratinib by the FDA underscore the significance and importance of these data and the potential of this oral therapy to not only increase height, but more importantly, enhance functionality for children with achondroplasia,” said Ravi Savarirayan, M.D., Ph.D., of Murdoch Children’s Research Institute in Melbourne, Australia, the global lead investigator for PROPEL 2 and lead author of the NEJM publication.\n\nKey results from the PROPEL 2 dataset were presented today at ESPE in a talk titled “ _Oral infigratinib for children with achondroplasia: Month 18 results from the PROPEL 2 study demonstrate safety and durability of treatment effect on linear growth with improved body proportionality”_ by Melita Irving, M.D., a clinical geneticist at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK and investigator for the infigratinib clinical program at the Evelina London Children’s Hospital. The key data that were shared included:\n\n  * Statistically significant increase in annualized height velocity (AHV) was observed in children in Cohort 5 who received a daily dose of 0.25 mg/kg/ day of infigratinib), with a mean change from baseline in AHV of +2.50 cm/year (P=0.001) at Month 18\n  * Mean change from baseline in height Z-score was +0.54 (P<0.001) relative to an untreated achondroplasia population at Month 18\n  * Statistically significant improvement in body proportionality (mean upper to lower body segment ratio) was -0.12 (P=0.001) at Month 18\n  * Oral infigratinib was well tolerated at Month 18, with no serious adverse events (SAE) or treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) leading to treatment discontinuation \n    * Additionally, there was no accelerated progression of bone age, negative changes in bone mineral density, or other bone-related adverse events observed\n\n\n\n“We are encouraged to see no safety signals and no adverse changes in bone age or bone mineral density,” said Dr. Irving. “These results point to the potential of infigratinib for children living with skeletal dysplasia, and we look forward to further evaluation of infigratinib in PROPEL 3, the ongoing Phase 3 trial, as well as in the Phase 2 portion of the ACCEL program in children with hypochondroplasia.”\n\nInfigratinib has received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) based on the shared results from the PROPEL 2 clinical trial, which meet the FDA’s requirement of potentially demonstrating substantial improvement in efficacy over available therapies on clinically significant endpoints. In addition to receipt of Breakthrough Therapy Designation, infigratinib has also received Orphan Drug Designation, Fast Track Designation, and Rare Pediatric Disease Designation for achondroplasia from the FDA. If infigratinib is approved, BridgeBio may qualify for a Priority Review Voucher.\n\nInformation about PROPEL 3 (NCT06164951), which is currently enrolling children with achondroplasia, can be found [here](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=eNH3RscEJwIM9VU1hhMpWctd-VdWziVvj2NcLZzyNfaKCAxG2iRN3avC8IvZlWp1VPkBenxHUQB3lUwXM_Ouv1iCiNWF8HEeGTsEb3ZIih0WhoxkJ8Mh6hm5GZ_HM_7Q42qlL2QB5Wm1ka71PREh63w6_E7O8OUPWWvfHV2sXpo9xcOCpLbqgMwEfQ8-gKav0H6NLyeX5hfByb8mF3Lo492NDks_8nFNEfMhyBf6FpI51k4IUlCRZEyHbPKAavPjxl1smujWew9aBwvx6JjLQkVcvX5BWXfGPRsO4cHAhA50Vvljr1rtZrpmaQsO02aMshLeo09LWYMGrqn6HCulMkzcPbeYhLLbc3hlsvw_q3s=) on clinicaltrials.gov.

BridgeBio is committed to exploring the potential of infigratinib on wider medical and functional impacts of achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia and other skeletal dysplasias, which hold significant unmet needs for families.\n\n**About Achondroplasia** Achondroplasia is the most common cause of disproportionate short stature, affecting approximately 55,000 people in the United States (U.S.) and European Union (EU), including up to 10,000 children and adolescents with open growth plates. Achondroplasia impacts overall health and quality of life, leading to medical complications such as obstructive sleep apnea, middle ear dysfunction, kyphosis, and spinal stenosis. The condition is uniformly caused by an activating variant in FGFR3.\n\n**About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.** BridgeBio Pharma (BridgeBio) is a new type of biopharmaceutical company founded to discover, create, test and deliver transformative medicines to treat patients who suffer from genetic diseases.
