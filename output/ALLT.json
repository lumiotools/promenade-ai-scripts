Non-GAAP net income is defined as GAAP net income after including deferred revenues related to the fair value adjustment resulting from purchase accounting and excluding stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, deferred tax asset adjustment and changes in taxes-related items.\n\nThese non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, comparable GAAP measures. The non-GAAP results and a full reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in the accompanying Table 2. The Company provides these non-GAAP financial measures because it believes they present a better measure of the Company's core business and management uses the non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the Company's ongoing performance. Accordingly, the Company believes they are useful to investors in enhancing an understanding of the Company's operating performance. \n\n**_Safe Harbor Statement_**\n\nThis release contains forward-looking statements, which express the current beliefs and expectations of Company management.

(NASDAQ: ALLT) (TASE: ALLT), a leading global provider of innovative network intelligence and converged network-native security solutions for communication service providers and enterprises, today announced that Portugal’s MEO will deploy a new security service named Casa Segura for its fixed broadband consumer customers. The service will be based on Allot HomeSecure, an Allot solution that was chosen by MEO in a deal that was signed late in 2023. Allot and MEO have agreed to a subscription-based business model, wherein Allot will be a partner for MEO’s consumer security needs.\n\nThis unified experience will be facilitated by the Allot Security Management (ASM) solution. ASM unifies security services for mobile and fixed networks. With ASM, the end user, whether on their home network or the mobile network, enjoys a single, unified security experience drawing from a single unified threat database for both NetworkSecure and HomeSecure. The ASM solution also provides the CSP with comprehensive personalization capabilities and unifies customer management for both fixed and mobile security, making service activation, operation, and management simpler for the CSP.\n\nAllot [HomeSecure](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=tNLu8qmJ88JOxAjiNXDJycZ5Fmj-UXgqNW4yiKnuoq-UJRh0l__vuHdGZNfk0d4rSmqycTokyZDBdEI6Hb8JpuAd_7AZPw3IPqX6FuZd2DQLcNYdTp6-L4Ql3XE0cSQ_hW_5u0Ee7AkhCcxkngsUCC9U1MT9Z1bukKKw977ZJ5GqurumlAv9Ch1R4fg8_Y5C) provides security for all devices connected to the home network including mobile devices, computers, home IoT, and smart appliances.

With NetworkSecure, MEO offers its subscribers protection from the latest cybersecurity threats, including different types of malware such as ransomware, trojans, adware, viruses, and bots as well as phishing attacks.\n\n“MEO’s relationship with Allot goes back to 2020, when we launched Net Segura consumer security services based on Allot NetworkSecure,” said Tiago Silva Lopes, Director of Consumer Products at Altice Portugal. “We were encouraged by the great success of those services and decided to launch Casa Segura to work together with Net Segura and give our converged customers a unified solution that protects them from cyber threats both in and out of their homes.”\n\n“As far as service adoption and retention rates go, we have been very impressed with the results of the NetworkSecure mobile solution at MEO. This is the result of an unparalleled zero-touch solution and the cooperation that Allot has enjoyed while working with MEO over the years,” said Vered Zur, CMO of Allot. “Now, with Allot HomeSecure, MEO will enjoy additional recurring revenue with a converged consumer solution that will satisfy the cybersecurity needs of their customers who are both mobile and broadband MEO subscribers.”\n\n###\n\n**Additional Resources:** Allot Blog: [https://www.allot.com/blog](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=mTBuhWTeOFCvNQXyzcclUh58WOZn32Um_NTgIEBMHRLrzykXyDA3dMRJfbqriVrb9xyaIhm4wm7l6INQV9jZWgAPhYtKyVN9AIzhfrRYukU=)Telco CyberTalk Podcast: [https://www.allot.com/resources/podcasts](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=mTBuhWTeOFCvNQXyzcclUh58WOZn32Um_NTgIEBMHRJxt0aqNH9BCzrg1Ar_Sd_g4n__yYNHCDL-J5wWmV_gIYPvzIaBa3wdeQoXTK4OInanUMlM1NWZORRnOSwhYWB1KUS8bpBDvWUYSUaTWRWTBw==)Follow us on Twitter: [@allot_ltd](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=DBN-E5wm-aV8mDSpSF7HN3viPvCDGSDUoJ29v9kOk2AsewZ0zfKaaJ32tp5Va0A3uLkL50nwhqaczNsV3e3mnw==)Follow us on LinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/company/allot-communications](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=mTBuhWTeOFCvNQXyzcclUteclLhbfqGE_xVb9hIWlFctpbSTQ6kO8GJcJg0J6gyw58slB7H-frmz3u4wgkqPQ7Uac6YLODsZlJRUOKOUbwRyoRbnYGrst-7sdv9hEjVhqLa1gqCjs2vweue8nkUHxn-IFq7kYDYAEHMdBDuoggKrdU_DkfbmXDzOl0QN-Re6)\n\n**About Allot**\n\nAllot Ltd.
