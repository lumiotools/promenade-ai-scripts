As the number one prescribed and number one favorite pump 1 in the U.S., the waterproof 2 , discreet, and wearable Omnipod 5 is the first tubeless AID system that communicates with a CGM, proactively correcting for highs and helping to protect against lows, day and night 3,4,5 . \n\nOmnipod 5 user John Rowley, who lives in the United Kingdom where the FreeStyle Libre 2 Plus sensor integration launched earlier this year, had been using MDI for 36 years before making the switch to Pod therapy. \n\n“Having spent more than half my life injecting myself with insulin, Omnipod 5 with its connection to my FreeStyle Libre 2 Plus sensor has been truly liberating. When you have diabetes, there is so much more to think about when it comes to daily life,” said Mr. Rowley. “Omnipod 5 has made my life so much simpler, with much less to carry around with me, and less to worry about overall.” \n\nFor more information on how to access Omnipod 5 with the FreeStyle Libre 2 Plus sensor, visit [Omnipod.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.omnipod.com%2F&esheet=54155373&newsitemid=20241120268759&lan=en-US&anchor=Omnipod.com&index=2&md5=860e98231c455c5b7b894aee78f2baec). \n\n_ 1 USA 2023, data on file. _  \n---  \n_ 2 The Pod has an IP28 rating for up to 7.6 meters (25 feet) for 60 minutes.

The Omnipod Insulin Management System provides a unique alternative to traditional insulin delivery methods. With its simple, wearable design, the tubeless disposable Pod provides up to three days of non-stop insulin delivery, without the need to see or handle a needle. Insulet’s flagship innovation, the Omnipod 5 Automated Insulin Delivery System, integrates with a continuous glucose monitor to manage blood sugar with no multiple daily injections, zero fingersticks, and can be controlled by a compatible personal smartphone in the U.S. or by the Omnipod 5 Controller. Insulet also leverages the unique design of its Pod by tailoring its Omnipod technology platform for the delivery of non-insulin subcutaneous drugs across other therapeutic areas. For more information, please visit [insulet.com](https://insulet.com/) and [omnipod.com](https://omnipod.com/). \n\n**_Non-GAAP Measures:_ **\n\nThe Company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: \n\n  * Constant currency revenue growth, which represents the change in revenue between current and prior year periods using the exchange rate in effect during the applicable prior year period. Insulet presents constant currency revenue growth because management believes it provides meaningful information regarding the Company’s results on a consistent and comparable basis. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure, in addition to financial measures in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), to evaluate the Company’s operating results. It is also one of the performance metrics that determines management incentive compensation. \n\n\n  * Adjusted gross margin, adjusted gross margin as a percentage of revenue, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income as a percentage of revenue, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share exclude the impact of certain significant transactions or events, such as legal settlements, medical device corrections, gains (losses) on investments and loss on extinguishment of debt, that affect the period-to-period comparability of the Company’s performance, as applicable. \n\n\n  * Adjusted EBITDA, which represents net income plus net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and other significant transactions or events, such as legal settlements, medical device corrections, gains (losses) on investments and loss on extinguishment of debt, that affect the period-to-period comparability of the Company’s performance, as applicable, and adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. \n\n\n\nInsulet presents the above non-GAAP financial measures because management uses them as supplemental measures in assessing the Company’s performance, and the Company believes they are helpful to investors and other interested parties as measures of comparative performance from period to period. They also are commonly used measures in determining business value, and the Company uses them internally to report results. \n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, the Company’s reported financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Furthermore, the Company’s definition of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. Because non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease the Company’s reported results of operations, Insulet strongly encourages investors to review the Company’s consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. \n\n**_Forward-Looking Statement:_ **\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, future operating and financial performance, product success and efficacy, the outcome of studies and trials and the approval of products by regulatory bodies.

Insulet presents constant currency revenue growth because management believes it provides\nmeaningful information regarding the Company’s results on a consistent and comparable basis. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure,\nin addition to financial measures in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), to evaluate the Company’s\noperating results. It is also one of the performance metrics that determines management incentive compensation.\n• Adjusted gross margin, adjusted gross margin as a percentage of revenue, adjusted operating income, and adjusted operating income as a\npercentage of revenue, exclude the impact of certain significant transactions or events, such as legal settlements and medical device corrections,\nthat affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance, as applicable.\nInsulet presents the above non-GAAP financial measures because management uses them as supplemental measures in assessing the Company’s\nperformance, and the Company believes they are helpful to investors, and other interested parties as measures of comparative operating performance\nfrom period to period. They alsoarecommonly used measures in determining business value and the Company uses them internally to report results.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, the Company’s reported financial results prepared in\naccordance with GAAP. Furthermore, the Company’s definition of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others.\nBecause non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease the Company’s reported results of operations, Insulet\nstrongly encourages investors to review the Company’s consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. See appendix for a\nreconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measureto the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\n3\nInsulet Abbreviations and Acronyms\nAI Artificial Intelligence G6 Dexcom G6 Sensor\nAID Automated Insulin Delivery G7 Dexcom G7 Sensor\nbps Basis Points MDI Multiple Daily Injections\nCGM Continuous Glucose Monitoring NCS New Customer Starts\nFDA Food and Drug Administration T1D Type 1 Diabetes\nFMR Full Market Release T2D Type 2 Diabetes\nFSL2 Abbott FreeStyle Libre 2 Plus Sensor YoY Year-over-Year\n4\nQ3'24 Financial Highlights1\nTotal Revenue Omnipod Revenue Other Financial\nby Geography Highlights\nU.S. Omnipod\n$395.6M\nGross Margin\nan increase of 23.4%\nTotal Company Total Omnipod 69.3%\n$543.9M $533.6M up 150 bps\nan increase of 25.7%, an increase of\nor 25.4% 26.4%, or 26.1%\nin constant currency in constant currency\nOperating Margin\nInternational Omnipod\n$138.0M 16.2%\nan increase of 36.1%, or up 350 bps\n34.8% in constant currency\n5 1.
