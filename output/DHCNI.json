These forward looking statements are based upon DHC ’s present intents, beliefs or expectations, but forward looking statements are not guaranteed to occur and may not occur. DHC ’s actual results may differ materially from those contained in DHC ’s forward looking statements. The information contained in DHC ’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including under “Risk Factors\" and “Warnings Concerning Forward Looking Statements” in DHC ’s periodic reports and other filings, identifies important factors that could cause DHC ’s actual results to differ materially from those stated in DHC ’s forward looking statements. DHC ’s filings with the SEC are available on the SEC’s website at [www.sec.gov](http://www.sec.gov/) and are also accessible on DHC ’s website at the following link: [SEC Filings](/investors/financial-information/sec-filings/default.aspx).

For current information about the company, please refer to our most recent public SEC Filings.\n\n[OK]()\n\nCautionary Language\n\nPlease note that you are about to view content from a third party website. DHC does not by its inclusion imply its endorsement of or concurrence with the data provided on this website.\n\n[OK](https://apps.indigotools.com/IR/iac/?ticker=DHC&exchange=NASDAQ)\n\n## Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements\n\nThe information appearing on Diversified Healthcare Trust’s (“DHC”) website contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other securities laws. Also, whenever DHC uses words such as “believe”, “expect”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “plan”, “estimate”, “will”, “may” and negatives or derivatives of these or similar expressions, it is making forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based upon DHC’s present intent, beliefs or expectations, but forward-looking statements are not guaranteed to occur and may not occur. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by DHC’s forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. For example: (a) Office Properties Income Trust (“OPI”) and DHC have entered into a definitive merger agreement and the proposed merger is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023. However, the closing of the proposed merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of closing conditions, including DHC shareholder approval and the financing or any consents or approvals required or contemplated in connection with the proposed merger, some of which are beyond DHC’s control, and DHC cannot be sure that any or all of these conditions will be satisfied or waived. Accordingly, the proposed merger may not close on the contemplated terms or at all or it may be delayed; (b) DHC shareholders are expected to benefit from an annual dividend of $1.00 per share of the combined company. However, the Board of Trustees of the combined company will consider many factors when setting distribution rates, and thus future distribution rates may be increased or decreased and DHC cannot be sure as to the rate at which future distributions will be paid; (c) the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the terms thereof were evaluated, negotiated and recommended to DHC’s Board of Trustees by a special committee of DHC’s Board of Trustees, comprised solely of DHC’s disinterested, Independent Trustees, and were separately approved by DHC’s Independent Trustees and by DHC’s Board of Trustees. Despite this process, DHC could be subject to claims challenging the proposed merger or other transactions or DHC’s entry into the merger and related agreements because of the multiple relationships among DHC, OPI and The RMR Group LLC (“RMR”) and their related persons and entities or other reasons, and defending even meritless claims could be expensive and distracting to management; and (d) DHC’s website contains statements regarding the expectations for proposed merger and the combined company which may imply that the combined company will achieve its expected strategic and financial goals and the shareholders will benefit from the growth potential of the combined company. However, the combined company will be subject to various risks, including: the risk that the combined businesses will not be integrated successfully or that the integration will be more costly or more time-consuming and complex than anticipated; the risk that cost savings and synergies anticipated to be realized by the merger may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; risks related to future opportunities, plans and strategy for the combined company, including the uncertainty of expected future financial performance, expected access to cash flows and capital, timing of accretion, distribution rates and results of the combined company following completion of the proposed merger and the challenges facing the industries in which each company currently operates and the combined company will, following the closing of the transaction, operate; risks related to the market value of the OPI common shares of beneficial interest to be issued in the proposed merger; risks associated with indebtedness incurred in connection with the proposed merger, including the potential inability to access, or reduced access to, the capital markets or other capital resources or increased cost of borrowings, including as a result of a credit rating downgrade; risks associated with the level of capital expenditures of each company and the combined company following the proposed merger; and risks associated with the impact of general economic, political and market factors on the combined company. As a result, the combined company may not achieve the long-term growth and value creation for shareholder as expected.\n\nThe information contained in DHC's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including under “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” or incorporated therein, also identifies important factors that could cause DHC's actual results to differ materially from those stated in or implied by DHC's forward-looking statements. DHC's filings with the SEC are available on the SEC's website at [www.sec.gov](http://www.sec.gov) and are also accessible on DHC ’s website at the following link: [SEC Filings](https://www.dhcreit.com/investors/financial-information/sec-filings/default.aspx).\n\nYou should not place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements. Except as required by law, DHC does not intend to update or change any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\nThe documents provided in this section are provided for historical purposes only. The information contained in each document is accurate only as of the date each document was originally issued or such earlier date stated in those documents. DHC does not undertake any obligation to update any information contained in these documents. For current information about DHC, please refer to DHC’s most recent public SEC Filings.\n\n### IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE MERGER\n\nThe information appearing on DHC ’s website may be deemed to be solicitation material in respect of the proposed merger between DHC and OPI.

Also, whenever DHC uses words such as “believe”, “expect”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “plan”, “estimate”, “will”, “may” and negatives or derivatives of these or similar expressions, it is making forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based upon DHC’s present intent, beliefs or expectations, but forward-looking statements are not guaranteed to occur and may not occur. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by DHC’s forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. For example: (a) Office Properties Income Trust (“OPI”) and DHC have entered into a definitive merger agreement and the proposed merger is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023. However, the closing of the proposed merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of closing conditions, including DHC shareholder approval and the financing or any consents or approvals required or contemplated in connection with the proposed merger, some of which are beyond DHC’s control, and DHC cannot be sure that any or all of these conditions will be satisfied or waived. Accordingly, the proposed merger may not close on the contemplated terms or at all or it may be delayed; (b) DHC shareholders are expected to benefit from an annual dividend of $1.00 per share of the combined company. However, the Board of Trustees of the combined company will consider many factors when setting distribution rates, and thus future distribution rates may be increased or decreased and DHC cannot be sure as to the rate at which future distributions will be paid; (c) the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the terms thereof were evaluated, negotiated and recommended to DHC’s Board of Trustees by a special committee of DHC’s Board of Trustees, comprised solely of DHC’s disinterested, Independent Trustees, and were separately approved by DHC’s Independent Trustees and by DHC’s Board of Trustees. Despite this process, DHC could be subject to claims challenging the proposed merger or other transactions or DHC’s entry into the merger and related agreements because of the multiple relationships among DHC, OPI and The RMR Group LLC (“RMR”) and their related persons and entities or other reasons, and defending even meritless claims could be expensive and distracting to management; and (d) DHC’s website contains statements regarding the expectations for proposed merger and the combined company which may imply that the combined company will achieve its expected strategic and financial goals and the shareholders will benefit from the growth potential of the combined company. However, the combined company will be subject to various risks, including: the risk that the combined businesses will not be integrated successfully or that the integration will be more costly or more time-consuming and complex than anticipated; the risk that cost savings and synergies anticipated to be realized by the merger may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; risks related to future opportunities, plans and strategy for the combined company, including the uncertainty of expected future financial performance, expected access to cash flows and capital, timing of accretion, distribution rates and results of the combined company following completion of the proposed merger and the challenges facing the industries in which each company currently operates and the combined company will, following the closing of the transaction, operate; risks related to the market value of the OPI common shares of beneficial interest to be issued in the proposed merger; risks associated with indebtedness incurred in connection with the proposed merger, including the potential inability to access, or reduced access to, the capital markets or other capital resources or increased cost of borrowings, including as a result of a credit rating downgrade; risks associated with the level of capital expenditures of each company and the combined company following the proposed merger; and risks associated with the impact of general economic, political and market factors on the combined company. As a result, the combined company may not achieve the long-term growth and value creation for shareholder as expected.\n\nThe information contained in DHC's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including under “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” or incorporated therein, also identifies important factors that could cause DHC's actual results to differ materially from those stated in or implied by DHC's forward-looking statements.

The information contained in each document is accurate only as of the date each document was originally issued or such earlier date stated in those documents. DHC does not undertake any obligation to update any information contained in these documents.

These forward-looking statements are based upon DHC’s present intent, beliefs and expectations, but these statements and the implications of these statements are not guaranteed to occur and may not occur for various reasons, some of which are beyond DHC’s control. \n\nFor example, this press release states that DHC’s regular quarterly cash distribution rate is $0.01 per share per quarter or $0.04 per share per year. A possible implication of this statement is that DHC will continue to pay quarterly distributions of $0.01 per share per quarter or $0.04 per share per year in the future. DHC’s distribution rate may be set and reset from time to time by DHC’s Board of Trustees. DHC’s Board of Trustees considers many factors when setting or resetting DHC’s distribution rate, including DHC’s historical and projected net income, normalized funds from operations, requirements to maintain DHC’s qualification for taxation as a REIT, limitations in DHC’s debt agreements, the availability to DHC of debt and equity capital, DHC’s expectation of its future capital requirements and operating performance, DHC’s expected needs for and availability of cash to pay its obligations and other factors deemed relevant by DHC’s Board of Trustees in its discretion. Further, DHC’s projected cash available for distribution may change and may vary from its expectations. Accordingly, future distributions to DHC’s shareholders may be increased or decreased and DHC cannot be sure as to the rate at which future distributions will be paid. \n\nYou should not place undue reliance upon forward-looking statements. \n\nExcept as required by law, DHC does not intend to update or change any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. \n\nA Maryland Real Estate Investment Trust with transferable shares of beneficial interest listed on the Nasdaq.

The information contained in DHC ’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including under “Risk Factors\" and “Warnings Concerning Forward Looking Statements” in DHC ’s periodic reports and other filings, identifies important factors that could cause DHC ’s actual results to differ materially from those stated in DHC ’s forward looking statements. DHC ’s filings with the SEC are available on the SEC’s website at [www.sec.gov](http://www.sec.gov/) and are also accessible on DHC ’s website at the following link: [SEC Filings](/investors/financial-information/sec-filings/default.aspx).

The information contained in each document is accurate only as of the date each document was originally issued or such earlier date stated in those documents.

Also, whenever DHC uses words such as “believe”, “expect”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “plan”, “estimate”, “will”, “may” and negatives or derivatives of these or similar expressions, it is making forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based upon DHC’s present intent, beliefs or expectations, but forward-looking statements are not guaranteed to occur and may not occur. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by DHC’s forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. For example: (a) Office Properties Income Trust (“OPI”) and DHC have entered into a definitive merger agreement and the proposed merger is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023. However, the closing of the proposed merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of closing conditions, including DHC shareholder approval and the financing or any consents or approvals required or contemplated in connection with the proposed merger, some of which are beyond DHC’s control, and DHC cannot be sure that any or all of these conditions will be satisfied or waived. Accordingly, the proposed merger may not close on the contemplated terms or at all or it may be delayed; (b) DHC shareholders are expected to benefit from an annual dividend of $1.00 per share of the combined company. However, the Board of Trustees of the combined company will consider many factors when setting distribution rates, and thus future distribution rates may be increased or decreased and DHC cannot be sure as to the rate at which future distributions will be paid; (c) the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the terms thereof were evaluated, negotiated and recommended to DHC’s Board of Trustees by a special committee of DHC’s Board of Trustees, comprised solely of DHC’s disinterested, Independent Trustees, and were separately approved by DHC’s Independent Trustees and by DHC’s Board of Trustees. Despite this process, DHC could be subject to claims challenging the proposed merger or other transactions or DHC’s entry into the merger and related agreements because of the multiple relationships among DHC, OPI and The RMR Group LLC (“RMR”) and their related persons and entities or other reasons, and defending even meritless claims could be expensive and distracting to management; and (d) DHC’s website contains statements regarding the expectations for proposed merger and the combined company which may imply that the combined company will achieve its expected strategic and financial goals and the shareholders will benefit from the growth potential of the combined company. However, the combined company will be subject to various risks, including: the risk that the combined businesses will not be integrated successfully or that the integration will be more costly or more time-consuming and complex than anticipated; the risk that cost savings and synergies anticipated to be realized by the merger may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; risks related to future opportunities, plans and strategy for the combined company, including the uncertainty of expected future financial performance, expected access to cash flows and capital, timing of accretion, distribution rates and results of the combined company following completion of the proposed merger and the challenges facing the industries in which each company currently operates and the combined company will, following the closing of the transaction, operate; risks related to the market value of the OPI common shares of beneficial interest to be issued in the proposed merger; risks associated with indebtedness incurred in connection with the proposed merger, including the potential inability to access, or reduced access to, the capital markets or other capital resources or increased cost of borrowings, including as a result of a credit rating downgrade; risks associated with the level of capital expenditures of each company and the combined company following the proposed merger; and risks associated with the impact of general economic, political and market factors on the combined company. As a result, the combined company may not achieve the long-term growth and value creation for shareholder as expected.\n\nThe information contained in DHC's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including under “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” or incorporated therein, also identifies important factors that could cause DHC's actual results to differ materially from those stated in or implied by DHC's forward-looking statements. DHC's filings with the SEC are available on the SEC's website at [www.sec.gov](http://www.sec.gov) and are also accessible on DHC ’s website at the following link: [SEC Filings](https://www.dhcreit.com/investors/financial-information/sec-filings/default.aspx).\n\nYou should not place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements. Except as required by law, DHC does not intend to update or change any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\nThe documents provided in this section are provided for historical purposes only. The information contained in each document is accurate only as of the date each document was originally issued or such earlier date stated in those documents. DHC does not undertake any obligation to update any information contained in these documents. For current information about DHC, please refer to DHC’s most recent public SEC Filings.\n\n### IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE MERGER\n\nThe information appearing on DHC ’s website may be deemed to be solicitation material in respect of the proposed merger between DHC and OPI.

Despite this process, DHC could be subject to claims challenging the proposed merger or other transactions or DHC’s entry into the merger and related agreements because of the multiple relationships among DHC, OPI and The RMR Group LLC (“RMR”) and their related persons and entities or other reasons, and defending even meritless claims could be expensive and distracting to management; and (d) DHC’s website contains statements regarding the expectations for proposed merger and the combined company which may imply that the combined company will achieve its expected strategic and financial goals and the shareholders will benefit from the growth potential of the combined company. However, the combined company will be subject to various risks, including: the risk that the combined businesses will not be integrated successfully or that the integration will be more costly or more time-consuming and complex than anticipated; the risk that cost savings and synergies anticipated to be realized by the merger may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; risks related to future opportunities, plans and strategy for the combined company, including the uncertainty of expected future financial performance, expected access to cash flows and capital, timing of accretion, distribution rates and results of the combined company following completion of the proposed merger and the challenges facing the industries in which each company currently operates and the combined company will, following the closing of the transaction, operate; risks related to the market value of the OPI common shares of beneficial interest to be issued in the proposed merger; risks associated with indebtedness incurred in connection with the proposed merger, including the potential inability to access, or reduced access to, the capital markets or other capital resources or increased cost of borrowings, including as a result of a credit rating downgrade; risks associated with the level of capital expenditures of each company and the combined company following the proposed merger; and risks associated with the impact of general economic, political and market factors on the combined company. As a result, the combined company may not achieve the long-term growth and value creation for shareholder as expected.\n\nThe information contained in DHC's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including under “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” or incorporated therein, also identifies important factors that could cause DHC's actual results to differ materially from those stated in or implied by DHC's forward-looking statements.
