We disclose supplemental non-GAAP earnings measures, including for gross profit, gross margin, operating expenses, and net loss, as well as adjusted EBITDA. The Company has, regardless of result, applied consistent rationale and methods when presenting supplemental non-GAAP measures.\n\nManagement believes these supplemental non-GAAP measures reflect the Company’s core ongoing operating performance and facilitate comparisons across reporting periods. The Company uses these measures when evaluating its financial results and for planning and forecasting of future periods. We believe that these supplemental non-GAAP measures are also useful to investors in assessing our operating performance. While we believe in the usefulness of these supplemental non-GAAP measures, there are limitations. Our non-GAAP measures may not be reported by other companies in our industry and/or may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in calculation. We compensate for these limitations by using these non-GAAP measures as a supplement to GAAP and by providing the reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measure.\n\nThe schedules at the end of this press release reconcile the Company’s non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. The adjustments share one or more of the following characteristics: (a) they are unusual and the Company does not expect them to recur in the ordinary course of its business, (b) they do not involve the expenditure of cash, (c) they are unrelated to the ongoing operation of the business in the ordinary course, or (d) their magnitude and timing is largely outside of the Company’s control. All of these items meet one or more of the characteristics listed above. The criteria that must be met for litigation-related expense to qualify as a non-GAAP measure is that it must be directly connected to active litigation that the Company infrequently encounters and is unrelated to the ongoing operations of the business in the ordinary course. All legal expenses related to the ordinary course of business are included in the non-GAAP results consistently for all reporting periods. The Company has, for all reporting periods disclosed in this press release, applied consistent rationale, method, and adjustments in reconciling non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, reflecting the Company’s core ongoing operating performance and facilitating comparisons across reporting periods that the Company uses when evaluating its financial results, planning and forecasting future periods, and that are useful to investors in assessing our performance.\n\nNon-GAAP measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to GAAP, nor are they meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures. Our disclosures of these measures should be read only in conjunction with our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for the Company’s GAAP results.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThe information provided herein may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”).

We leverage industry-leading Photonic Integrated Chip (PIC), Quartz\nMEMS, and Lithium Niobate chip-level technology to deliver state-of-the-art component and\nsystem-level products across our end-market applications. EMCORE has vertically-\nintegrated manufacturing capability at its facilities in Budd Lake, NJ, Concord, CA, and Tinley\nPark, IL. Our manufacturing facilities all maintain ISO 9001 quality management certification,\nand we are AS9100 aerospace quality certified at our facilities in Budd Lake and Concord.\nFor further information about EMCORE, please visit https://www.emcore.com.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company conforms to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) in the\npreparation of its financial statements. We disclose supplemental non-GAAP earnings\nmeasures, including for gross profit, gross margin, operating expenses, and net loss, as well\nas adjusted EBITDA. The Company has, regardless of result, applied consistent rationale\nand methods when presenting supplemental non-GAAP measures.\nManagement believes these supplemental non-GAAP measures reflect the Company’s core\nongoing operating performance and facilitate comparisons across reporting periods. The\nCompany uses these measures when evaluating its financial results and for planning and\nforecasting of future periods. We believe that these supplemental non-GAAP measures are\nalso useful to investors in assessing our operating performance. While we believe in the\nusefulness of these supplemental non-GAAP measures, there are limitations. Our non-\nGAAP measures may not be reported by other companies in our industry and/or may not be\ndirectly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential\ndifferences in calculation. We compensate for these limitations by using these non-GAAP\nmeasures as a supplement to GAAP and by providing the reconciliations to the most\ncomparable GAAP measure.\nThe schedules at the end of this press release reconcile the Company’s non-GAAP\nmeasures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. The adjustments share one or\nmore of the following characteristics: (a) they are unusual and the Company does not expect\nthem to recur in the ordinary course of its business, (b) they do not involve the expenditure\nof cash, (c) they are unrelated to the ongoing operation of the business in the ordinary\ncourse, or (d) their magnitude and timing is largely outside of the Company’s control. All of\nthese items meet one or more of the characteristics listed above. The criteria that must be\nmet for litigation-related expense to qualify as a non-GAAP measure is that it must be\ndirectly connected to active litigation that the Company infrequently encounters and is\nunrelated to the ongoing operations of the business in the ordinary course. All legal\nexpenses related to the ordinary course of business are included in the non-GAAP results\nconsistently for all reporting periods. The Company has, for all reporting periods disclosed in\nthis press release, applied consistent rationale, method, and adjustments in reconciling non-\nGAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, reflecting the Company’s\ncore ongoing operating performance and facilitating comparisons across reporting periods\nthat the Company uses when evaluating its financial results, planning and forecasting future\nperiods, and that are useful to investors in assessing our performance.\nNon-GAAP measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to GAAP, nor are they\nmeant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures. Our\ndisclosures of these measures should be read only in conjunction with our financial\nstatements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures should not be viewed\nas a substitute for the Company’s GAAP results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe information provided herein may include forward-looking statements within the meaning\nof Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act\nof 1934 (“Exchange Act”).

(“S&N”), or the FOG and Inertial Navigation Systems business (“EMCORE Chicago”) of KVH Industries, Inc.\n(“KVH”) may not meet our expectations, (b) the costs and cash expenditures for integration of the S&N business operations or EMCORE Chicago may be higher than\nexpected, (c) there could be losses and liabilities arising from the acquisition of SDI, S&N, or EMCORE Chicago that we will not be able to recover from any source,\n(d) we may not recognize the anticipated synergies from the acquisition of SDI, S&N, or EMCORE Chicago, and (e) we may not realize sufficient scale in our\nNavigation and Inertial Sensing product line from the SDI acquisition, the S&N acquisition, and the EMCORE\n4\nChicago acquisition and will need to take additional steps, including making additional acquisitions, to achieve our growth objectives for this product line;\n• risks related to the conversion of order backlog into product revenue and the timing thereof; and\n• other risks and uncertainties discussed in Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, as such\nrisk factors may be amended, supplemented, or superseded from time to time by our subsequent periodic reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(“SEC”).\nThese cautionary statements apply to all forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this Quarterly Report. Forward-looking statements are based on certain\nassumptions and analysis made in light of experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, and expected future developments as well as other factors that we\nbelieve are appropriate under the circumstances. While these statements represent judgment on what the future may hold, and we believe these judgments are reasonable; these\nstatements are not guarantees of any events or financial results. All forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report are made as of the date hereof, based on information\navailable to us as of the date hereof, and subsequent facts or circumstances may contradict, obviate, undermine, or otherwise fail to support or substantiate such statements.

STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 1. Description of Business\nEMCORE Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (referred to herein as the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “EMCORE”), is a leading provider of sensors and navigation\nsystems for the aerospace and defense market. Over the last five years, we have expanded our scale and portfolio of inertial sensor products through the acquisitions of Systron\nDonner Inertial, Inc. (“SDI”) in June 2019, the Space and Navigation business of L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (“S&N”) in April 2022, and the FOG and Inertial Navigation\nSystems business of KVH Industries, Inc. (“EMCORE Chicago”) in August 2022. Our multi-year transition from a broadband company to an inertial navigation company has\nnow been completed following the sales of (i) our cable TV, wireless, sensing and defense optoelectronics business lines and (ii) our chips business line and indium phosphide\nwafer fabrication operations.\nWe have fully vertically-integrated manufacturing capability at our facilities in Budd Lake, NJ, Concord, CA, and Tinley Park, IL (the “Tinley Park Facility”). These facilities\nsupport our manufacturing strategy for Fiber Optic Gyroscope (“FOG”), Ring Laser Gyro (“RLG”), Photonic Integrated Chip (“PIC”), and Quartz Micro Electro-Mechanical\nSystem (“QMEMS”) products for inertial navigation. Our manufacturing facilities maintain ISO 9001 quality management certification, and we are AS9100 aerospace quality\ncertified at our facilities in Concord, CA, and Budd Lake, NJ. Our best-in-class components and systems support a broad array of inertial navigation applications.\nOur operations include wafer fabrication (lithium niobate and quartz), device design and production, fiber optic module and subsystem design and manufacture, and PIC-based\nand QMEMS-based component design and manufacture. Many of our manufacturing operations are computer-monitored or controlled to enhance production output and\nstatistical control. Our manufacturing processes involve extensive quality assurance systems and performance testing. We have one reporting segment, Inertial Navigation,\nwhose product technology categories include: (a) FOG, (b) QMEMS, and (c) RLG, in each case which serves the aerospace and defense market.\nNOTE 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States\nof America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim information, and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (“SEC”). Accordingly, they do not include all information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for annual financial statements. In our opinion, the interim financial\nstatements reflect all adjustments that are necessary to provide a fair presentation of the financial results for the interim periods presented. Operating results for interim periods\nare not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for an entire fiscal year. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2023 has been derived\nfrom the audited consolidated financial statements as of such date. For a more complete understanding of our business, financial position, operating results, cash flows, risk\nfactors, and other matters, please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.\nGoing Concern\nThese condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP assuming we will continue as a going concern. The going concern\nassumption contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a\ngoing concern exists.\nWe have recently experienced losses from our operations and used a significant amount of cash, amounting to a net loss of $14.0 million and $28.1 million for the three and\nnine months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, and net cash outflows from continuing operations of $14.8 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2024. We expect to\ncontinue to incur losses and use cash in our operations in the near term. As a result of our recent cash outflows, we have taken actions to manage our liquidity and plan to\ncontinue to do so. As of June 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $9.0 million, including restricted cash of $0.5 million and cash in escrow of $0.7 million.\nIn April 2023, we initiated a restructuring program that included the strategic shutdown of our Broadband business segment (including our cable TV, wireless, sensing and\nchips product lines) and the discontinuance of our defense optoelectronics product line (the “April 2023 Restructuring”). Our Board of Directors performed a thorough review\nof a number of factors\n12\nincluding the competitive landscape, declining revenue and gross profit of these discontinued businesses, the current and expected profitability of these discontinued businesses,\nour cost structure, and our strategic focus on our Inertial Navigation business segment, and concluded that these discontinued businesses were non-strategic, unsustainable, and\ncould not be restructured in a way that would have allowed us to achieve profitable growth and cash preservation. During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Broadband\nbusiness segment and defense optoelectronics product line were considered as held for sale based upon the existence at such time of an executed non-binding letter of intent\nwith respect to the PF Transaction (as defined below) and in consideration of ongoing negotiations for the sale of the chips business. Given the then-prospective sale of the\nBroadband business segment and defense optoelectronics product line we identified these asset groups as discontinued operations during the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\nWe discontinued operations of our chips business and indium phosphide wafer fabrication facility during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, consummated the PF\nTransaction during the three months ended December 31, 2023 and consummated the Chips Transaction on April 30, 2024.\nIn May 2024, we initiated a restructuring program that includes the full closure of our Alhambra, CA facility, headcount reductions and additional reductions in operating\nexpenses (the “May 2024 Restructuring”). Our Board of Directors performed a thorough review of a number of factors including our competitive landscape, expected revenue\nand profitability, and cost structure, and concluded that our then-current structure and operations would not allow us to achieve profitable growth and cash generation. We\nexpect the full closure of the Alhambra facility to be completed during the quarter ending September 30, 2024.\nPrimarily as a result of these restructurings, we (i) have eliminated approximately 200 positions across all locations, collectively representing approximately 50% of our total\nworkforce prior to such reductions, and (ii) consolidated facility space by shutting down our operations at the Alhambra facility (including sublease of three of the five\nbuildings in Alhambra pursuant to the Chips Transaction and PF Transaction) and seeking to sublease the remaining available space in such facility, transferred our\nmanufacturing support and engineering center in China to PF pursuant to the PF Transaction, and plan to relocate personnel in Concord, California to the operations area from\nthe adjacent office building, collectively representing an approximately 35% reduction in the aggregate square footage occupied by our facilities.\nOne-time employee severance and termination costs related to the May 2024 Restructuring of approximately $1.9 million and $3.1 million were incurred during the three and\nnine months ended June 30, 2024. For the three months ended June 30, 2024, we also incurred $1.3 million of restructuring expense including $0.8 million in impairment of the\nAlhambra inventory, $0.3 million of impairment of the Alhambra manufacturing execution software and hardware system, and $0.2 million in costs to tear-down, pack and\nmove equipment out of the Alhambra facility.\nWe are evaluating the sufficiency of our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations, together with additional actions we could take including\nfurther expense reductions and/or potentially raising capital through additional debt or equity issuances, or from the potential monetization of certain assets. However, we may\nnot be successful in executing on our plans to manage our liquidity, including recognizing the expected benefits from our previously announced restructuring program, or\nraising additional funds if we elect to do so, and as a result substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern exists.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts\nof assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, as of the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue\nand expenses during the reported period. Such estimates include accounts receivable, inventories, long-lived assets, product warranty liabilities, legal contingencies, bonus\naccruals, income taxes, equity-based instruments, restructuring related accruals, asset retirement obligations, and pension obligation, as well as the evaluation associated with\nthe Company's assessment of its ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe develop estimates based on historical experience and on various assumptions about the future that are believed to be reasonable based on the best information available to\nus. Our reported financial position or results of operations may be materially different under changed conditions or when using different estimates and assumptions, particularly\nwith respect to significant accounting policies. In the event that estimates or assumptions prove to differ from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to\nreflect more current information.\nNOTE 3. Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets that sum to the\ntotal of the same amounts shown in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows:\n13\n(in thousands) June 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nCash $ 3,319 $ 4,332\nCash in escrow 749 —\nCash in government money market funds 4,409 21,879\nRestricted cash 495 495\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 8,972 $ 26,706\nNOTE 4. Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations\nIn April 2023, we initiated a restructuring program that includes the strategic shutdown of our Broadband business segment (including our cable TV, wireless, sensing and chips\nproduct lines) and the discontinuance of our defense optoelectronics product line. During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Broadband business segment and defense\noptoelectronics product line were considered as held for sale based upon (i) the existence of an executed non-binding letter of intent entered into between us and Photonics\nFoundries, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“PF”) to sell our Broadband business segment (other than our chips business line) and our defense optoelectronics product line and (ii)\nin consideration of ongoing negotiations for the sale of the chips business line.\nIn October 2023, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, by and among the Company, PF, and Ortel LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly\nowned subsidiary of PF (the “Buyer”), pursuant to which (i) the Company agreed to transfer to the Buyer, and Buyer agreed to assume, substantially all of the assets and\nliabilities primarily related to the Company’s cable TV, wireless, sensing and defense optoelectronics business lines (the “Businesses”), including with respect to employees,\ncontracts, intellectual property and inventory, and (ii) Buyer agreed to provide a limited license back to the Company of patents being sold to the Buyer (the “PF Transaction”).\nThe Transaction excluded the Company’s chip business, indium phosphide wafer fabrication facilities and all assets not primarily related to the Businesses.\nThe signing and closing of the PF Transaction occurred simultaneously, except with respect to the assets of the Company located in China. In November 2023, the Company\ntransferred to the Buyer, and the Buyer assumed, substantially all of the assets and liabilities of each of the Company’s subsidiaries in China.\nIn connection with the PF Transaction, the parties entered a transition services agreement pursuant to which the Company is providing certain migration and transition services\nto facilitate an orderly transaction of the operation of the Businesses to the Buyer in the 12-month period following consummation of the PF Transaction, and the Company and\nthe Buyer entered into a sublease pursuant to which the Company is subleasing to the Buyer one of the Company’s buildings (occupying approximately 12,500 square feet) at\nits Alhambra, California facility for the 12-month period immediately following the closing of the PF Transaction without payment of rent. With respect to the Buyer’s\nassumption of our manufacturing agreement with our electronics manufacturing services (“EMS”) provider for our cable TV products, the Company (i) made a payment to the\nEMS provider in the amount of approximately $0.4 million immediately prior to the closing of the transaction and (ii) provided a guaranty of PF’s and the Buyer’s obligations\nwith respect to payment of certain long-term liabilities that were originally agreed to and set forth in the manufacturing agreement and assigned to PF and the Buyer in the PF\nTransaction, in an aggregate amount expected to equal up to approximately $5.5 million, approximately $4.3 million of which will not become payable, if at all, until January\n2026, provided that if such guaranty is exercised by the EMS provider, the Company will have the right to require the Buyer to reassign to the Company all intellectual property\nassigned to the Buyer in the PF Transaction and the Company will have the right to recover damages from PF and the Buyer.\nOn April 30, 2024, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “HieFo Purchase Agreement”), with HieFo Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“HieFo”),\npursuant to which the Company agreed to transfer to HieFo substantially all of the assets primarily related to the Company’s discontinued chips business line, including with\nrespect to equipment, contracts, intellectual property and inventory, including without limitation the Company’s indium phosphide wafer fabrication equipment (the “Chips\nTransaction”), in consideration for a purchase price equal to $2.9 million in cash and assumption by HieFo of certain assumed liabilities, $1.0 million of which was received by\nthe Company in the quarter ended December 31, 2023 in connection with the execution of a non-binding letter of intent related to the Chips Transaction and $1.9 million of\nwhich was received by the Company upon closing of the Chips Transaction. The signing and closing of the Chips Transaction occurred simultaneously.\nIn connection with the Chips Transaction, the parties entered a transition services agreement pursuant to which the Company is providing certain migration and transition\nservices to facilitate an orderly transition of the operation of the chips business line to HieFo in consideration for fees payable to the Company for such services as agreed\nbetween the Company and HieFo for a\n14\nperiod of up to 12 months following consummation of the Chips Transaction, and the Company and HieFo entered into a sublease pursuant to which the Company is subleasing\nto HieFo (i) initially, all of one building and a portion of a second building (collectively occupying approximately 21,750 square feet) and (ii) beginning January 1, 2026, all of\nsuch two buildings (collectively occupying approximately 25,000 square feet) at the Company’s Alhambra, California facility through the remaining term of the Company’s\nlease of such facility ending September 30, 2031, with a pro rata portion of the rent for such facility being payable to the Company beginning on July 1, 2024.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Broadband business segment and defense optoelectronics business line were disclosed as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet. As of\nJune 30, 2024, there were no assets or liabilities that were classified as held for sale on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nThe following table presents key components of assets and liabilities that were classified as held for sale on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30,\n2023:\n(in thousands)\nCash $ 81\nAccounts receivable, net of credit loss of $0 974\nInventory, net 10,063\nOther current assets 1,154\nProperty, plant, and equipment, net 4,131\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 56\nTotal assets 16,459\nRemeasurement of assets 9,195\nAssets held for sale $ 7,264\nAccounts payable $ 1,854\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities 1,697\nOperating lease liabilities - current 22\nOperating lease liabilities - non-current 36\nOther comprehensive income 1,053\nTotal liabilities 4,662\nLiabilities held for sale $ 4,662\nFor the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the results of the Broadband business segment, defense optoelectronics business, and chips business line were\ndisclosed as discontinued operations in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. For the nine months ended June 30, 2024, the selling costs were $0.3 million,\nrespectively.\nThe following table presents key components of net loss that were classified as discontinued operations on the condensed consolidated statements of operations:\nThree Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenue $ — $ (20) $ 216 $ 7,524\nCost of Revenue 161 3,739 2,163 13,753\nGross Profit (161) (3,759) (1,947) (6,229)\nSelling, general, and administrative — 739 250 2,255\nResearch and development — 826 — 2,877\nSeverance — 1,827 — 2,269\nOther income — (322) — (418)\nLoss on sale of assets 1,207 — 1,207 —\nImpairment of fixed assets 1,045 — 1,045 —\nLoss from discontinued operations $ (2,413) $ (6,829) $ (4,449) $ (13,212)\nNOTE 5. Inventory\n15\nThe components of inventory consisted of the following:\n(in thousands) June 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nRaw materials $ 14,640 $ 14,503\nWork in-process 10,816 9,766\nFinished goods 3,749 4,636\nInventory $ 29,205 $ 28,905\nIn May 2024, we initiated the May 2024 Restructuring. Due to the exit of our Alhambra facility we expensed $0.8 million of the Alhambra inventory, net to restructuring\nexpense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nNOTE 6. Property, Plant, and Equipment, net\nThe components of property, plant, and equipment, net consisted of the following:\n(in thousands) June 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nEquipment $ 31,889 $ 31,658\nFurniture and fixtures 1,576 1,576\nComputer hardware and software 3,638 3,220\nLeasehold improvements 4,510 9,442\nConstruction in progress 1,326 2,508\nProperty, plant, and equipment, gross 42,939 48,404\nAccumulated depreciation (33,970) (32,887)\nProperty, plant, and equipment, net $ 8,969 $ 15,517\nDepreciation expense totaled $0.7 million and $2.7 million during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, respectively. During the nine months ended June 30, 2024,\nwe sold certain equipment and recorded a gain on sale of assets of $31 thousand. During the nine months ended June 30, 2023, the Company consummated the sale of the real\nproperty interests in the Tinley Park Facility to 8400 W 185TH STREET INVESTORS, LLC, resulting in a gain on sale of assets of $1.2 million.\nAs of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, all of our long-lived assets were located in the United States.\nASC 360 requires review of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be\nrecoverable. In May 2024, we initiated the May 2024 Restructuring. Due to the announcement of exiting the entirety of our Alhambra facility, as of May 1, 2024, we compared\nthe carrying amount of the ROU assets for such leases to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. This resulted in an ROU asset\nimpairment of $0.5 million. We also impaired $2.4 million of leasehold improvements, net related to the Alhambra facility. We expensed $0.3 million of computer hardware\nand software and $0.2 million of costs related to moving equipment to our remaining facilities to restructuring expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nNOTE 7. Intangible Assets\nIntangible assets arose from the acquisition of SDI in fiscal year 2019 and the acquisitions of S&N and EMCORE Chicago in fiscal year 2022. Definite-lived intangible assets\nare amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of: (a) 7.0 years for patents, (b) 8.0 years for customer relationships, and (c) 2.0-8.0 years for technology.\nTrademarks are indefinite-lived.\nThe following table summarizes changes in intangible assets, net:\n(in thousands) June 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nBalance at beginning of period $ 12,245 $ 14,790\nChanges from acquisition — 1,470\nWrite off due to impairment — (2,125)\nAmortization (1,473) (1,890)\nBalance at end of period $ 10,772 $ 12,245\n16\nThe weighted average remaining useful lives by definite-lived intangible asset category are as follows:\nJune 30, 2024\nWeighted Average Remaining Life Gross Carrying Accumulated\n(in thousands, except weighted average remaining life) (in years) Amount Amortization Net Book Value\nTechnology 6.3 $ 16,901 $ (10,560) $ 6,341\nCustomer relationships 6.0 4,690 (1,114) 3,576\nDefinite-lived intangible assets total $ 21,591 $ (11,674) $ 9,917\nAs of June 30, 2024, the value of trademarks was approximately $0.9 million.\nSeptember 30, 2023\nWeighted Average Remaining Life Gross Carrying Accumulated\n(in thousands, except weighted average remaining life) (in years) Amount Amortization Net Book Value\nTechnology 6.5 $ 16,901 $ (9,527) $ 7,374\nCustomer relationships 6.9 4,690 (674) 4,016\nDefinite-lived intangible assets total $ 21,591 $ (10,201) $ 11,390\nAs of September 30, 2023, the value of trademarks was approximately $0.9 million.\nEstimated future amortization expense for intangible assets recorded by the Company as of June 30, 2024 is as follows:\n(in thousands) Amount\n2024 $ 482\n2025 1,929\n2026 1,527\n2027 1,504\n2028 1,491\nThereafter 2,984\nTotal amortization expense $ 9,917\nASC 360 requires review of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be\nrecoverable. In May 2024, we initiated the May 2024 Restructuring which led to impairment of leasehold improvements and ROU assets related to the Alhambra facility. These\nwere triggering events that led the Company to perform an ASC 360 analysis as of May 1, 2024 on the remaining long-lived assets. Recoverability of the long-lived assets,\nincluding the intangible assets detailed above, was measured by comparing the carrying value of the asset group to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be\ngenerated by the asset groups. The comparison indicated that the carrying value was recoverable and no further impairment to long-lived assets was recorded. See Note 6 -\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment, net.\nNOTE 8. Benefit Plans\nWe assumed a defined benefit pension plan (the “Pension Plan”) on April 29, 2022 as a result of the acquisition of S&N. The Pension Plan was frozen to new hires as of March\n31, 2007 and employees hired on or after April 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the Pension Plan. On July 1, 2022, the Pension Plan was amended to freeze benefit plan\naccruals for participants. As a result of the freeze, a curtailment was triggered and a restatement of the benefit obligation and plan assets occurred, although no gain or loss\nresulted. The annual measurement date for the Pension Plan is September 30. Benefits are based on years of credited service at retirement. Annual contributions to the Pension\nPlan are not less than the minimum funding standards outlined in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. We maintain the Pension Plan with the\ngoal of ensuring that it is adequately funded to meet its future obligations. We did not make any contributions to the Pension Plan during the three and nine months ended June\n30, 2024 and do not anticipate making any contributions for the remainder of the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024.\nThe components of net periodic pension cost are as follows:\n17\nThree Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nService cost $ 26 $ 26 $ 78 $ 78\nInterest cost 92 93 276 279\nExpected return on plan assets (76) (84) (228) (252)\nNet periodic pension cost $ 42 $ 35 $ 126 $ 105\nThe service cost component of total pension expense is included as a component of cost of revenue on the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and\nnine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. The interest cost and expected return on plan assets’ components of total pension expense are included as components of other\nexpense on the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.\nNet pension asset is included as a component of other non-current assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. As of\nJune 30, 2024, the Pension Plan assets consist of cash and cash equivalents, and we manage a liability-driven investment strategy intended to maintain fully-funded status.\n401(k) Plan\nWe have a savings plan that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under this savings plan, participating employees\nmay defer a portion of their pretax earnings up to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limit. Our matching contribution in cash for the three and nine months ended\nJune 30, 2024, was $0.3 million and $0.9 million, respectively. Our matching contribution in cash for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023 was $0.4 million and\n$1.0 million, respectively.\nNOTE 9. Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities\nThe components of accrued expenses and other current liabilities consisted of the following:\n(in thousands) June 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nCompensation $ 5,304 $ 5,980\nWarranty 534 864\nCommissions 66 468\nProfessional fees 1,108 493\nOther 809 666\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities $ 7,821 $ 8,471\nThe changes in product warranty accruals consisted of the following:\n(in thousands) June 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nBalance at beginning of period $ 864 $ 911\nProvision for product warranty expense 94 120\nAdjustments and utilization of warranty accrual (424) (167)\nBalance at end of period $ 534 $ 864\nThe changes in severance accruals consisted of the following:\n(in thousands) June 30, 2024\nBalance at beginning of period $ 64\nAdditions to accrual for severance expense 3,234\nSeverance expense paid (1,516)\nBalance at end of period $ 1,782\nNOTE 10. Credit Agreement\nWingspire/Hale Credit Agreement\n18\nOn August 9, 2022, EMCORE and S&N, our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into that certain Credit Agreement with the lenders party thereto and Wingspire Capital LLC\n(“Wingspire”), as administrative agent for the lenders, as amended pursuant to that First Amendment to Credit Agreement dated as of October 25, 2022, among EMCORE and\nS&N, EMCORE Chicago, our wholly-owned subsidiary (together with the Company and S&N, the “Borrowers”), the lenders party thereto and Wingspire, to add EMCORE\nChicago as a Borrower and include certain of its assets in the borrowing base (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement provided for two credit facilities:\n(a) an asset-based revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $40.0 million, subject to a borrowing base consisting of eligible accounts receivable and\neligible inventory (subject to certain reserves), and (b) a term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $6.0 million.\nOn April 29, 2024, Wingspire, HCP-FVU, LLC, HCP Fund V-FVU, LLC and Bessel Holdings LLC (each an affiliate of Hale Capital Management, L.P. and collectively,\n“Hale” or “New Lenders”), and HCP-FVU, LLC, as administrative agent for New Lenders (in such capacity, the “Successor Agent”) entered into an Assignment Agreement\n(the “Assignment Agreement”) pursuant to which Hale acquired all of the Wingspire’s interest in the credit facilities extended by Wingspire to the Company pursuant to the\nCredit Agreement and all of the Loan Documents (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and any other documents, instruments, certificates, financing statements and agreements\nrelating to the Credit Agreement. In connection with the Assignment Agreement, the Company entered into a Forbearance Agreement and Second Amendment to Credit\nAgreement with S&N and EMCORE Chicago, Hale, and the Successor Agent dated April 29, 2024 (the “Forbearance Agreement”). Under the terms of the Forbearance\nAgreement, Hale agreed: (i) not to accelerate the obligations or exercise other default remedies under the Credit Agreement and related documents; (ii) not to enforce any of the\nprovisions or terms of the Credit Agreement and the related collateral documents relating to the occurrence of one or more cash dominion trigger events; and (iii) to direct the\nSuccessor Agent not to accelerate the obligations, exercise default remedies or take any such enforcement action or enforcement of provisions under the Credit Agreement and\nrelated documents during the period (the “Forbearance Period”) beginning on April 29, 2024 through the earliest of: (i) May 31, 2024; (ii) the date that any breach or default\noccurs or is determined to have occurred under the Credit Agreement or any other related document, including the Forbearance Agreement; and (iii) the date that the Company\ninitiates any judicial, administrative or arbitration proceeding against Hale or the Successor Agent. The Forbearance Agreement also amended the Credit Agreement, to, among\nother things, set a fixed interest rate of 12% per annum (with an additional 6% upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, which shall not apply\nduring the Forbearance Period to any of the events of default as to which the forbearance applies) on each loan. The Forbearance Agreement reduced the aggregate principal\namount that we could draw under the revolving credit facility from $40.0 million to $4.6 million, subject to a borrowing base consisting of eligible accounts receivable, eligible\ninventory and eligible equipment (subject to certain reserves). The Forbearance Agreement also provided that the Company could elect to pay all or a portion of the interest that\nwould accrue under the Credit Agreement as payment-in-kind, which would allow the Company to increase the principal balance of the Loans due and payable upon maturity,\nrather than making interest payment in cash. In addition, the Forbearance Agreement provided for certain financial covenants, loosened the circumstances under which the\nBorrowers would have to comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio, and eliminated all restrictions relating to cash dominion.\nOn April 29, 2024, in consideration of the Forbearance Agreement, the Company issued to the Successor Agent a warrant (the “Warrant”) to purchase an aggregate of\n1,810,528 (post-reverse split) shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $2.73 per share. The Warrant is exercisable, at any time and from time to time, for\n10 years following the Issuance Date. The company accounted for the Warrant in accordance with ASC 815-40 “Derivatives and Hedging - Contract in Entity's Own Equity”\nand ASC 470-50 “Debt - Modifications and extinguishments”. As there are provisions in the Warrant agreement that indicate that neither of the two criteria necessary for equity\nclassification are met, the Company recorded the Warrant’s fair value using the Black-Scholes valuation method on date of issuance of approximately $5.1 million as a non-\ncurrent liability in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. As the Company was legally released as the primary obligor by Wingspire and there is no continuing debt to\nWingspire, a corresponding value of $5.1 million was recorded as loss on extinguishment of debt in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.\nThe Company has and will continue to subsequently remeasure the fair value of the Warrant each reporting period as long as the warrant contract remains classified as a\nliability with changes in the fair value reported in the caption “Loss on extinguishment of debt and change in fair value of warrant liability” on the condensed consolidated\nstatements of operations. We believe that the assumptions used in the calculations of fair value of the warrant liability represent the best estimates of fair value. As of June 30,\n2024, using the Black-Scholes valuation method, the fair value of the Warrant was recorded as a $2.1 million non-current liability in the condensed consolidated balance sheet\nand for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 the corresponding next expense of $2.1 million is included in“Loss on extinguishment of debt and change in fair value\nof warrant liability” in the condensed consolidated statements of operation. See Note 13 - Equity for further discussion of the Warrant.\nThe proceeds of the loans made under the Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. The maturity date for borrowings under the Credit Agreement was\nAugust 8, 2026.\n19\nThe Credit Agreement contained representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants that are generally customary for credit facilities of this type. Among others,\nthe Credit Agreement contained various covenants that, subject to agreed-upon exceptions, limit the Borrowers’ and their respective subsidiaries’ ability to incur indebtedness,\ngrant liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, enter into swap agreements, make loans, acquisitions and investments, change the nature of their business, acquire or sell\nassets, or consolidate or merge with or into other persons or entities, declare or pay dividends or make other restricted payments, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into\nburdensome agreements, change fiscal year, amend organizational documents, and use proceeds to fund any activities of or business with any person that is the subject of\ngovernmental sanctions. In addition, the Credit Agreement required that, for any period commencing upon the occurrence of an event of default and until such time as no event\nof default shall be continuing, the Borrowers satisfy a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.10:1.00 based on a trailing 12-month period at the end of each\nmonth.\nThe Credit Agreement also included customary events of default, the occurrence of which, following any applicable grace period, would permit Hale or Successor Agent to,\namong other things, declare the principal, accrued interest and other obligations of the Borrowers under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable, and exercise\nrights and remedies available to the lenders under the Credit Agreement or applicable law or equity. In connection with the Credit Agreement, the Borrowers entered into a\npledge and security agreement pursuant to which the obligations under the Credit Agreement were secured on a senior secured basis (subject to permitted liens) by substantially\nall assets of the Borrowers and substantially all assets of any future guarantors.\nAs of June 30, 2024, an aggregate principal amount of $8.4 million was outstanding pursuant to the Credit Agreement and we believe we were in compliance with all\ncovenants. As of September 30, 2023, an aggregate principal amount of $6.4 million was outstanding pursuant to the revolving credit facility and an aggregate principal amount\nof $4.2 million was outstanding pursuant to the term loan facility.\nOur future term loan repayments as of June 30, 2024 are as follows:\n(in thousands) Amount\nRemainder of fiscal 2024 $ 355\n2025 852\n2026 7,193\nTotal loan payments $ 8,400\nOn June 14, 2024, the Company received a written notice (the “June 14 Notice”) from HCP-FVU, LLC, as Successor Agent, under the Credit Agreement, that an alleged event\nof default had occurred. The June 14 Notice specified that in the Successor Agent’s view, certain defaults occurred under the Credit Agreement due to the Borrowers’ failure to:\n(i) provide a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its subsidiaries together without a “going concern” or like qualification or exception, (ii) deliver a compliance\ncertificate with financial reporting along with concurrent analysis, (iii) deliver notice to the New Lenders as to election to pay all or a portion of interest as PIK interest prior to\nthe payment deadlines of May 1, 2024 and June 1, 2024, and (iv) provide certain projections as required under the Credit Agreement. As a result of these alleged defaults, the\nJune 14 Notice stated that the Successor Agent was exercising its right to accrue interest at the default rate of 18% beginning May 1, 2024 and that the Borrowers were required\nto appoint a Chief Restructuring Officer in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, the selection of whom was subject to the consent of the New Lenders.\nOn June 21, 2024, the Company received a subsequent written notice (the “June 21 Notice”) from the Successor Agent in which the Successor Agent stated that it would not be\naccelerating the amounts owed under the Credit Agreement nor taking any remedies afforded to it under the Credit Agreement other than accruing interest at the default rate of\n18% for the seven-day period beginning June 21, 2024. The June 21 Notice further stated that the Successor Agent was not waiving any New Lenders’ rights or remedy\navailable under the Credit Agreement. On July 3, 2024, the Company received a written notice (the “July 3 Notice”, and together with the June 14 Notice and the June 21\nNotice, the “Default Notices”) from the Successor Agent that an alleged Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Agreement) had occurred due to the Borrowers’ failure to (i)\ncomply with certain covenants set forth in the Forbearance Agreement, and (ii) deliver to the Successor Agent and New Lenders material sufficient to determine whether the\nBorrowers are in compliance with certain covenants set forth in the Forbearance Agreement. In the July 3 Notice, the Successor Agent stated that the loans under the Credit\nAgreement would continue to accrue interest at the default rate of 18% due to the additional default alleged in the July 3 Notice. The July 3 Notice further stated that the\nSuccessor Agent was not waiving any of New Lenders’ rights or remedy available under the Credit Agreement.\nThe Company responded to the June 14 Notice advising the Successor Agent that the Company believed that no default or event of default under the Credit Agreement existed\nin connection with the alleged defaults described in the June 14 Notice.\nOn August 5, 2024, we voluntarily prepaid approximately $9.4 million to repay in full all amounts outstanding and payable under the Credit Agreement, resulting in\ntermination of the Credit Agreement. See Note 15 – Subsequent Event.\n20\nNOTE 11. Income and Other Taxes\nDuring the nine months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $114 thousand composed primarily of state tax expense and the effective tax rate\non continuing operations was 0.5%.\nDuring the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $28 thousand and $176 thousand, respectively, composed primarily of\nstate tax expense and tax expense generated from the tax amortization on acquired indefinitely lived assets. For the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, the effective tax\nrate on continuing operations was 0.9%.\nThe Company uses estimates to forecast the results from continuing operations for the current fiscal year as well as permanent differences between book and tax accounting.\nWe have not provided for income taxes on non-U.S. subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings as of June 30, 2024 because we plan to indefinitely reinvest the unremitted earnings of\nour non-U.S. subsidiaries and all of our non-U.S. subsidiaries historically have negative earnings and profits.\nAll deferred tax assets have a full valuation allowance as of June 30, 2024. On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates the positive and negative evidence to assess whether\nthe more-likely-than-not criteria has been satisfied in determining whether there will be further adjustments to the valuation allowance.\nAs of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we did not accrue any significant uncertain tax benefit, interest, or penalties as tax liabilities on our condensed consolidated\nbalance sheets. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no material increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits.\nNOTE 12. Commitments and Contingencies\nLeases\nOperating lease liabilities and expected cash inflows from signed subleases as of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were as follows:\n(in thousands) June 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\n2024 $ 1,168 $ 4,614\n2025 4,137 4,137\n2026 3,072 3,072\n2027 2,757 2,757\n2028 2,830 2,830\nThereafter 22,179 22,179\nTotal lease payments $ 36,143 $ 39,589\nLess imputed interest (14,446) (15,674)\nTotal operating lease liabilities $ 21,697 $ 23,915\nAmount of expected cash inflow from signed subleases $ 2,875 $ —\nIndemnifications\nWe have agreed to indemnify certain customers against claims of infringement of intellectual property rights of others in our sales contracts with these customers. Historically,\nwe have not paid any claims under these customer indemnification obligations. We enter into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers\npursuant to which we agree to indemnify them for certain potential expenses and liabilities arising from their status as a director or executive officer of the Company. We\nmaintain directors and executive officers’ insurance, which covers certain liabilities relating to our obligation to indemnify our directors and executive officers in certain\ncircumstances. It is not possible to determine the aggregate maximum potential loss under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification\nclaims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular claim.\nLegal Proceedings\n21\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings, claims, and litigation, either asserted or unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of business. The outcome of these matters is\ncurrently not determinable and we are unable to estimate a range of loss, should a loss occur, from these proceedings. The ultimate outcome of legal proceedings involves\njudgments, estimates, and inherent uncertainties and the results of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty. Professional legal fees are expensed when incurred. We\naccrue for contingent losses when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable. In the event that estimates or assumptions prove to differ from actual results, adjustments\nare made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Should we fail to prevail in any legal matter, or should several legal matters be resolved against the\nCompany in the same reporting period, then the financial results of that particular reporting period could be materially affected.\nIntellectual Property Lawsuits\nWe protect our proprietary technology by applying for patents where appropriate and, in other cases, by preserving the technology, related know-how, and information as trade\nsecrets. The success and competitive position of our product lines are impacted by our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our research and development efforts.\nWe have, from time to time, exchanged correspondence with third parties regarding the assertion of patent or other intellectual property rights in connection with certain of our\nproducts and processes.\nResilience Litigation\nIn February 2021, Resilience Capital (“Resilience”) filed a complaint against us with the Delaware Chancery Court containing claims arising from the February 2020 sale of\nSDI’s real property (the “Concord Property Sale”) located in Concord, California (the “Concord Real Property”) to Eagle Rock Holdings, LP (“Buyer”) and that certain Single-\nTenant Triple Net Lease, dated as of February 10, 2020, entered into by and between SDI and the Buyer, pursuant to which SDI leased from the Buyer the Concord Real\nProperty for a 15-year term. The Resilience complaint seeks, among other items, (a) a declaration that the Concord Property Sale included a non-cash component, (b) a decree\nrequiring us and Resilience to follow the appraisal requirements set forth in that certain Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “SDI Purchase Agreement”), dated as of June 7,\n2019, by and among the Company, The Resilience Fund IV, L.P., The Resilience Fund IV-A, L.P., Aerospace Newco Holdings, Inc. and Ember Acquisition Sub, Inc., (c)\nrecovery of Resilience’s costs and expenses, and (d) pre- and post-judgment interest.\nIn April 2021, we filed with the Delaware Chancery Court our answer to the Resilience complaint and counterclaims against Resilience, in which we are seeking, among other\nitems, (a) dismissal of the Resilience complaint and/or granting of judgment in favor of EMCORE with respect to the Resilience complaint, (b) entering final judgment against\nResilience awarding damages to us for Resilience’s fraud and breaches of the SDI Purchase Agreement in an amount to be proven at trial and not less than $1,565,000, (c) a\njudicial determination of the respective rights and duties of us and Resilience under the SDI Purchase Agreement, (d) an award to us of costs and expenses, and (e) pre- and\npost-judgment interest.\nIn April 2023, the Company and Resilience entered into a Settlement and Release Agreement (the “Resilience Settlement Agreement”). The material financial terms of the\nResilience Settlement Agreement required (i) a payment of $500,000 by the Company to Resilience, which payment was made by the Company during the three months ended\nJune 30, 2023, (ii) an appraisal of the Concord Real Property as of January 2, 2020, which resulted in a further payment obligation by us in an amount equal to approximately\n$1.3 million, which payment was made by us during the three months ending December 31, 2023, and (iii) a mutual release of all claims, including claims arising under the SDI\nPurchase Agreement, and a dismissal of the litigation by all parties.\nIn April 2023, the underwriters of the representation and warranty insurance policies the Company acquired in connection with the SDI Purchase Agreement agreed to pay the\nCompany $1.15 million within 15 business days in exchange for a release of any and all claims under the policies. We received payment during the three months ended June 30,\n2023.\nNOTE 13. Equity\nReverse Stock Split\nOn March 15, 2024, the Company’s shareholders approved an amendment to the Company’s certificate of incorporation to effect a reverse split of the Company’s outstanding\nstock at a ratio ranging from 5:1 to 12:1 at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company. On March 15, 2024, the Board of Directors approved a reverse split\nand set a reverse stock split ratio of 10:1 for the Company's outstanding share of the Company's common stock. The reverse stock split was effective on April 1, 2024. As of the\neffective time of the reverse split, every 10 issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock was automatically reclassified into one issued and outstanding share\nof the Company’s common stock, with any fractional\n22\nshares being rounded up to the next whole share. Proportionate adjustments were made to the number of shares of common stock underlying the Company’s outstanding equity\nawards, warrants, the number of shares issuable under its equity incentive plans and other existing agreements, as well as the exercise or conversion price, as applicable.\nHale Warrant\nOn April 29, 2024 (the “Issuance Date”), in consideration of the Forbearance Agreement, the Company issued to Successor Agent the Warrant to purchase an aggregate of\n1,810,528 (post-reverse split) shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $2.73 per share. The Warrant is exercisable, at any time and from time to time, for\n10 years following the Issuance Date. Under the terms of the Warrant, the Company has a right to force the Holder to exercise the Warrant under certain Forced Exercise\nConditions (as defined in the Warrant) and issue a replacement warrant, and the Holder has a right to require the Company to purchase the unexercised portion of the Warrant\nunder certain circumstances, including upon a Fundamental Transaction (as defined in the Warrant). If the Company is required to purchase the unexercised portion of the\nWarrant, the Company may elect to pay such repurchase price in the form of an unsecured promissory note.\nThe Warrant provides for certain adjustments to the exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant in certain circumstances, including a full-\nratchet anti-dilution adjustment in connection with certain issuances of Common Stock and convertible securities by the Company below the then current exercise price of the\nWarrant. The Company also agreed to register for resale with the SEC the shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant. The Warrant contains restrictions on the Holder’s ability\nto exercise the Warrant, such that the Holder shall not be entitled to exercise the Warrant if the total number of shares of Common Stock then beneficially owned by the Holder,\nand its affiliates and any other persons whose beneficial ownership of Common Stock would be aggregated with the Holder’s other ownership of the Company’s Common\nStock, exceeds 4.999% of the total number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company (the “Threshold Percentage”). However, the Holder has the\nright at any time and from time to time, to increase the Threshold Percentage to 9.999%. Additionally, the Holder shall not have the right to exercise the Warrant if the total\nnumber of shares of Common Stock then beneficially owned by the Holder, and its affiliates and any other persons whose beneficial ownership of Common Stock would be\naggregated with the Holder’s other ownership of the Company’s Common Stock, exceeds 19.99%, unless shareholder approval is obtained by the Company, as may be required\nby the applicable rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Stock Market or any such other exchange on which the Company’s shares are then listed, or unless such shareholder\napproval requirement has been waived by the Nasdaq Stock Market. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Warrant, the sum of the number of shares of Common\nStock that may be issued under the Warrant is limited to 19.99% of the Company’s outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the issuance date of the Warrant (the “Exchange\nCap”), unless shareholder approval is obtained by the Company to issue more than the Exchange Cap, as may be required by the applicable rules and regulations of the Nasdaq\nStock Market or any such other exchange on which the Company’s shares are then listed, or unless such shareholder approval requirement has been waived by the Nasdaq\nStock Market. The initial fair value of the warrant of $5.1 million was estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation method and was recorded as a long-term liability on the\ncondensed consolidated balance sheet. The change in fair value of the warrant liability using the Black-Scholes valuation method through the end of the quarter ended June 30,\n2024 was $3.0 million resulting in a net $2.1 million expense for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 and is included in the condensed consolidated statements of\noperations on the line item captioned “Loss on extinguishment of debt and change in fair value of warrant liability.” See Note 10 - Credit Agreement.\nEquity Plans\nWe provide long-term incentives to eligible officers, directors, and employees in the form of equity-based awards. We maintain four equity incentive compensation plans,\ncollectively described as our “Equity Plans”: (a) the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2010 Plan”), (b) the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2012 Plan”), (c) the Amended and\nRestated 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”), and (d) the 2022 New Employee Inducement Plan.\nWe issue new shares of common stock to satisfy awards granted under our Equity Plans. In December 2023, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to the 2019 Plan,\nwhich, following shareholder approval at our 2024 annual meeting of shareholders in March 2024, increased the maximum number of shares of the Company’s common stock\nthat may be issued or transferred pursuant to awards under the 2019 Plan by an additional 0.8 million shares.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe following table sets forth stock-based compensation expense by award type:\n23\nThree Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nRSUs $ 172 $ 1,113 $ 1,161 $ 2,869\nPSUs (1,216) 517 (1,094) 1,818\nOutside director equity awards and fees in common stock (68) 83 82 295\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ (1,112) $ 1,713 $ 149 $ 4,982\nThe following table sets forth stock-based compensation expense by expense type:\nThree Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nCost of revenue $ 70 $ 436 $ 57 $ 1,154\nSelling, general, and administrative (1,254) 980 (266) 3,006\nResearch and development 72 297 358 822\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ (1,112) $ 1,713 $ 149 $ 4,982\nOn May 7, 2024, a total of 51,862 unvested restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and 62,251 unvested performance stock units (“PSUs”) previously awarded to our former CEO,\nJeffrey Rittichier, were terminated pursuant to the terms of our 2019 Plan and corresponding award agreements in connection with Mr. Rittichier’s termination of employment\nwith the Company. In addition, 66,830 unvested RSUs previously awarded to non-executive employees were terminated pursuant to the terms of our 2019 Plan and the\ncorresponding award agreements in connection with termination of the applicable non-executive employee’s service with the Company during the three-month period ended\nJune 30, 2024. These terminations resulted in an aggregate reversal of stock-based compensation of $1.5 million, respectively, for the nine months ended June 30, 2024.\nOn June 14, 2024, the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”) approved the award of an aggregate of 527,600 RSUs\nunder the 2019 Plan to certain executive officers (excluding Mr. Matthew Vargas, the Company’s Interim CEO and VP, Sales) and non-executive employees. All such awards\nwill vest as to 1/3 of the underlying shares on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date, subject to the executive officer or non-executive employee’s continued\nservice with the Company through each vesting date. In addition, on June 14, 2024, pursuant to that certain Amended and Restated Offer Letter of Employment, dated May 8,\n2024, between the Company and Mr. Vargas, the Compensation Committee approved an award to Mr. Vargas of 215,517 RSUs under the 2019 Plan, which RSUs will vest in\nfull on June 14, 2025, subject to his continued service with the Company in any capacity through the vesting date.\nLoss Per Share\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share:\n24\nThree Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30,\n(in thousands, except per share data) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator\nNet loss from continuing operations $ (11,545) $ (3,028) $ (23,683) $ (20,566)\nLoss from discontinued operations $ (2,413) $ (6,829) $ (4,449) $ (13,212)\nNet loss $ (13,958) $ (9,857) $ (28,132) $ (33,778)\nDenominator\nWeighted average number of shares outstanding - basic reflective of reverse\nstock split effective April 1, 2024 9,044 5,393 9,006 4,555\nEffect of dilutive securities\nCommon shares underlying the warrant — — — —\nStock options — — — —\nPSUs, RSUs, and restricted stock — — — —\nWeighted average number of shares outstanding - diluted reflective of reverse\nstock split effective April 1, 2024 9,044 5,393 9,006 4,555\nNet loss from continuing operations per share, basic and diluted $ (1.27) $ (0.56) $ (2.63) $ (4.52)\nLoss from discontinued operations per share, basic and diluted $ (0.27) $ (1.27) $ (0.49) $ (2.90)\nNet loss per share, basic and diluted $ (1.54) $ (1.83) $ (3.12) $ (7.42)\nWeighted average antidilutive options, unvested RSUs and RSAs, unvested\nPSUs and common shares underlying warrants excluded from the\ncomputation reflective of reverse stock split effective April 1, 2024 348 382 369 253\nBasic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net (loss) income for the period by the weighted-average number of common stock outstanding during the period.\nThe weighted-average number of common stock outstanding includes the 1,190,000 pre-funded warrants discussed below in “Public Offerings”. Diluted EPS is computed by\ndividing net (loss) income for the period by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding during the period, plus the dilutive effect of outstanding RSUs, PSUs,\nstock options and common shares underlying warrants as applicable pursuant to the treasury stock method. Certain of the Company's outstanding share-based awards, noted in\nthe table above, were excluded because they were anti-dilutive, but they could become dilutive in the future. The anti-dilutive stock options, shares of outstanding and unvested\nrestricted stock and common shares underlying warrants were excluded from the computation of earnings per share for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\ndue to the Company incurring a net loss for such period.\nPublic Offerings\nOn August 23, 2023, we closed our offering of 2,260,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $5.00 per share, and, to certain investors, pre-funded warrants (each, a “Pre-\nFunded Warrant”) to purchase 1,190,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $4.99999990 for each pre-funded warrant (which represents the per share public offering\nprice for our common stock in such offering less the $0.0000001 per share exercise price for each such Pre-Funded Warrant), resulting in net proceeds to us from the offering,\nafter deducting the placement agent commissions and other offering expenses, of approximately $15.6 million. The shares were sold by us pursuant to an Underwriting\nAgreement, dated as of August 17, 2023, between us and the Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC as the sole managing underwriter. In the quarter ended March 31, 2024, certain\nholders of Pre-Funded Warrants exercised such warrants, resulting in the issuance to such holders of an aggregate amount of 400,000 shares of Common Stock, and in the\nquarter ended June 30, 2024, certain holders of Pre-Funded Warrants exercised such warrants, resulting in the issuance to such holders an aggregate amount of 790,000 shares\nof common stock. As of June 30, 2024, no Pre-Funded Warrants remained outstanding.\nOn February 17, 2023, we closed our offering of 1,545,455 shares of our common stock at a price of $11.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds to us from the offering, after\ndeducting the placement agent commissions and other offering expenses, of $15.4 million. The shares were sold by us pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of\nFebruary 17, 2023, between the Company and each purchaser named in the signature pages thereto and a Placement Agency Agreement, dated as of February 15, 2023, by and\nbetween the Company and A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners.\nFuture Issuances\n25\nCommon stock reserved for future issuances as of June 30, 2024 was as follows:\nAmount\nExercise of outstanding stock options 632\nUnvested RSUs 927,985\nUnvested PSUs (at 100% maximum payout) 120,054\nIssuance of stock-based awards under the Equity Plans 42,666\nPurchases under the officer and director share purchase plan 8,874\nTotal reserved 1,100,211\nNOTE 14. Reportable Segment and Revenue Information\nReportable Segment\nConcurrent with the discontinuance of the Broadband business segment and defense optoelectronics product line during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Company\nonly has one reportable segment, Inertial Navigation, for which financial information is available and upon which operating results are evaluated by the chief operating decision\nmaker, the Chief Executive Officer, to assess performance and to allocate resources.\nTiming of Revenue\nRevenue is classified by timing of recognition as presented below:\nThree Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nTrade revenue (recognized at a point in time) $ 16,370 $ 18,808 $ 49,786 $ 51,319\nContract revenue (recognized over time) 4,065 7,910 14,406 19,628\nTotal revenue $ 20,435 $ 26,718 $ 64,192 $ 70,947\nGeographical Concentration\nRevenue is classified by geographic area based on our customers’ billing addresses as presented below:\nThree Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nUnited States and Canada $ 15,920 $ 22,031 $ 47,930 $ 56,783\nAsia 1,520 2,412 5,512 5,315\nEurope 2,995 1,345 8,568 6,775\nOther — 930 2,182 2,074\nTotal revenue $ 20,435 $ 26,718 $ 64,192 $ 70,947\nCustomer Concentration\nPortions of the Company’s sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers. Significant customers are defined as customers representing greater than 10% of\nconsolidated revenue. Revenue from two significant customers represented an aggregate of 38% and two significant customers represented 30% of our consolidated revenue for\nthe three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, and revenue from two significant customers represented an aggregate of 40% and 39% of our consolidated\nrevenue for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, respectively.\nNOTE 15. Subsequent Event\nRepayment and Termination of Credit Agreement\nOn August 5, 2024, we voluntarily prepaid approximately $9.4 million to repay (with effect as of August 8, 2024) (the “Repayment”) in full all amounts outstanding and\npayable under the Credit Agreement. In connection with the termination of the Credit Agreement, the total amount repaid by the Company of approximately $9.4 million\nconsisted of approximately $8.5 million of principal, approximately $0.8 million of accrued interest, including interest that would have accrued through the\n26\none-year anniversary of the Forbearance Agreement, approximately $0.1 million of prepayment premium and approximately $0.1 million of customary expenses of the\nSuccessor Agent and the Lenders.\nAs a result of the Repayment, all of the Obligations (as defined in the Credit Agreement) are and shall be deemed satisfied in full and the Credit Agreement, the other Loan\nDocuments (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and any other documents, instruments, certificates, financing statements, and agreements related to the Credit Agreement\nterminate (collectively, the “Financing Documents”). As a result of the termination of the Credit Agreement, the Successor Agent, the Lenders and their respective participants,\nif any, shall have no further commitment to provide loans or other financial accommodations under the Credit Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents. We have\nreceived confirmation (in the form of a customary payoff letter) of such termination from the Successor Agent on behalf of the Lenders.\n27\nITEM 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in\nFinancial Statements under Item 1 within this Quarterly Report, together with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other information\nincluded in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2023. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans,\nestimates, and beliefs. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking\nStatements preceding Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.\nBusiness Overview\nEMCORE Corporation is a leading provider of sensors and navigation systems for the aerospace and defense market. We leverage industry-leading Photonic Integrated Chip\n(PIC), Quartz MEMS, and Lithium Niobate chip-level technology to deliver state-of-the-art component and system-level products across our end-market applications. Over the\nlast five years, we have expanded our scope and portfolio of inertial sensor products through the acquisitions of Systron Donner Inertial, Inc. (“SDI”) in June 2019, the Space\nand Navigation (“S&N”) business of L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (“L3H”) in April 2022, and the FOG and Inertial Navigation Systems business (“EMCORE Chicago”) of\nKVH Industries, Inc. (“KVH”) in August 2022. Our multi-year transition from a broadband company to an inertial navigation company has now been completed following the\nsales of (i) our cable TV, wireless, sensing and defense optoelectronics business lines and (ii) our chips business line and indium phosphide wafer fabrication operations.\nWe have fully vertically-integrated manufacturing capability at our facilities in Budd Lake, NJ, Concord, CA, and Tinley Park, IL (the “Tinley Park Facility”). These facilities\nsupport our manufacturing strategy for Fiber Optic Gyroscope (“FOG”), Ring Laser Gyro (“RLG”), Photonic Integrated Chip (“PIC”), and Quartz Micro Electro-Mechanical\nSystem (“QMEMS”) products for inertial navigation. Our manufacturing facilities maintain ISO 9001 quality management certification, and we are AS9100 aerospace quality\ncertified at our facilities in Concord, CA and Budd Lake, NJ. Our best-in-class components and systems support a broad array of inertial navigation applications.\nOur operations include wafer fabrication (lithium niobate and quartz), device design and production, fiber optic module and subsystem design and manufacture, and PIC-based\nand QMEMS-based component design and manufacture. Many of our manufacturing operations are computer-monitored or controlled to enhance production output and\nstatistical control. Our manufacturing processes involve extensive quality assurance systems and performance testing. We have one reporting segment, Inertial Navigation,\nwhose product technology categories include: (a) FOG, (b) QMEMS, and (c) RLG, in each case which serves the aerospace and defense market.\nRecent Developments\nApril 2023 Restructuring and May 2024 Restructuring\nIn April 2023, we initiated a restructuring program that included the strategic shutdown of our Broadband business segment (including our cable TV, wireless, sensing and\nchips product lines) and the discontinuance of our defense optoelectronics product line (the “April 2023 Restructuring”). Our Board of Directors performed a thorough review\nof a number of factors including the competitive landscape, declining revenue and gross profit of these discontinued businesses, the current and expected profitability of these\ndiscontinued businesses, our cost structure, and our strategic focus on our Inertial Navigation business segment, and concluded that these discontinued businesses were non-\nstrategic, unsustainable, and could not be restructured in a way that would have allowed us to achieve profitable growth and cash preservation. During the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, the Broadband business segment and defense optoelectronics product line were considered as held for sale based upon the existence at such time of an\nexecuted non-binding letter of intent with respect to the PF Transaction (as defined below) and in consideration of ongoing negotiations for the sale of the chips business. Given\nthe then-prospective sale of the Broadband business segment and defense optoelectronics product line we identified these asset groups as discontinued operations during the\nquarter ended September 30, 2023. We discontinued operations of our chips business and indium phosphide wafer fabrication facility during the quarter ended September 30,\n2023, consummated the PF Transaction during the three months ended December 31, 2023 and consummated the Chips Transaction (as defined below) on April 30, 2024.\nIn May 2024, we initiated a restructuring program that includes the full closure of our Alhambra, CA facility, headcount reductions and additional reductions in operating\nexpenses (the “May 2024 Restructuring”). Our Board of Directors performed a thorough review of a number of factors including our competitive landscape, expected revenue\nand profitability, and cost structure, and concluded that our then-current structure and operations would not allow us to achieve profitable growth and cash generation. We\nexpect the full closure of the Alhambra facility to be completed during the quarter ending September 30, 2024\n28\nand was not considered a part of our previously identified and reported discontinued operations as these actions were part of a consolidation and expense reduction program.\nPrimarily as a result of these restructurings, we (i) have eliminated approximately 200 positions across all locations, collectively representing approximately 50% of our total\nworkforce prior to such reductions, and (ii) consolidated facility space by shutting down our operations at the Alhambra facility (including sublease of three of the five\nbuildings in Alhambra pursuant to the Chips Transaction and PF Transaction) and seeking to sublease the remaining available space in such facility, transferred our\nmanufacturing support and engineering center in China to PF pursuant to the PF Transaction, and plan to relocate personnel in Concord, California to the operations area from\nthe adjacent office building, collectively representing an approximately 35% reduction in the aggregate square footage occupied by our facilities.\nThe personnel reduction actions that we have taken in connection with the May 2024 Restructuring are expected to result in annualized cost savings of approximately $17.0\nmillion, exclusive of severance costs. One-time employee severance and termination costs related to the May 2024 Restructuring of approximately $1.9 million and $3.1\nmillion were incurred during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024. For the three months ended June 30, 2024, we also incurred $1.3 million of restructuring expense\nincluding $0.8 million in impairment of the Alhambra inventory, $0.3 million of impairment of the Alhambra manufacturing execution system, and $0.2 million in costs to tear-\ndown, pack and move equipment out of the Alhambra facility.\nWe anticipate that cash and non-cash charges will be incurred and recorded in future reporting periods and we may incur additional expenses in connection with these\nrestructurings that are not currently contemplated. The charges that we expect to incur in connection with the restructuring are estimates and subject to a number of\nassumptions, and actual results may differ materially.\nReverse Stock Split\nOn March 15, 2024, our shareholders approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to effect a reverse split of our outstanding common stock at a ratio ranging\nfrom 5:1 to 12:1 at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company. On March 15, 2024, the Board of Directors approved a reverse split and set a reverse stock\nsplit ratio of 10:1 for our outstanding shares of common stock. The reverse stock split was effective on April 1, 2024, and began trading on a reverse stock split-adjusted basis\non April 2, 2024. As of the effective time of the reverse split, every 10 issued and outstanding shares of our common stock was automatically reclassified into one issued and\noutstanding share of our common stock, with any fractional shares being rounded up to the next whole share. Proportionate adjustments were made to the number of shares of\ncommon stock underlying our outstanding equity awards, warrants, the number of shares issuable under our equity incentive plans and other existing agreements, as well as the\nexercise or conversion price, as applicable.\nHale Credit Agreement\nOn August 9, 2022, we and S&N, our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of August 9, 2022, among the Company, S&N, the lenders\nparty thereto and Wingspire Capital LLC, as administrative agent for the lenders (“Wingspire”), as amended pursuant to that First Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of\nOctober 25, 2022, among the Company, S&N, EMCORE Chicago, our wholly-owned subsidiary (together with the Company and S&N, the “Borrowers”), the lenders party\nthereto and Wingspire, to add EMCORE Chicago as a Borrower and include certain of its assets in the borrowing base (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit\nAgreement provided for two credit facilities: (a) an asset-based revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $40.0 million, subject to a borrowing base\nconsisting of eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory (subject to certain reserves), and (b) a term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $5,965,000.\nOn April 29, 2024, Wingspire, HCP-FVU, LLC, HCP Fund V-FVU, LLC and Bessel Holdings LLC (each an affiliate of Hale Capital Management, L.P. and collectively,\n“Hale” or “New Lenders”), and HCP-FVU, LLC, as administrative agent for New Lenders (in such capacity, the “Successor Agent”), entered into an Assignment Agreement\n(the “Assignment Agreement”) pursuant to which Hale acquired all of the Wingspire’s interest in the credit facilities extended by Wingspire to us pursuant to the Credit\nAgreement and all of the Loan Documents (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and any other documents, instruments, certificates, financing statements and agreements\nrelating to the Credit Agreement. In connection with the Assignment Agreement, we entered into a Forbearance Agreement and Second Amendment to Credit Agreement with\nS&N and EMCORE Chicago, Hale, and the Successor Agent dated April 29, 2024 (the “Forbearance Agreement”). Under the terms of the Forbearance Agreement, Hale\nagreed: (i) not to accelerate the obligations or exercise other default remedies under the Credit Agreement and related documents; (ii) not to enforce any of the provisions or\nterms of the Credit Agreement and the related collateral documents relating to the occurrence of one or more cash dominion trigger events; and (iii) to direct the Successor\nAgent not to accelerate the obligations, exercise default remedies or take any such enforcement action or enforcement of provisions under the Credit Agreement and related\ndocuments during the period (the “Forbearance Period”) beginning on April 29, 2024 through the earliest of: (i) May 31, 2024; (ii) the date that any breach or default occurs or\nis\n29\ndetermined to have occurred under the Credit Agreement or any other related document, including the Forbearance Agreement; and (iii) the date that we initiate any judicial,\nadministrative or arbitration proceeding against Hale or the Successor Agent. The Forbearance Agreement also amended the Credit Agreement, to, among other things, set a\nfixed interest rate of 12% per annum (with an additional 6% upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, which shall not apply during the\nForbearance Period to any of the events of default as to which the forbearance applies) on each loan. The Forbearance Agreement reduced the aggregate principal amount that\nwe could draw under the revolving credit facility from $40.0 million to $4.6 million, subject to a borrowing base consisting of eligible accounts receivable, eligible inventory\nand eligible equipment (subject to certain reserves). The Forbearance Agreement also provided that we could elect to pay all or a portion of the interest that would accrue under\nthe Credit Agreement as payment-in-kind, which would allow us to increase the principal balance of the loans due and payable upon maturity, rather than making interest\npayment in cash. In addition, the Forbearance Agreement provided for certain financial covenants, loosened the circumstances under which we would have to comply with a\nfixed charge coverage ratio, and eliminated all restrictions relating to cash dominion.\nOn April 29, 2024 (the “Issuance Date”), in consideration of the Forbearance Agreement, we issued to Successor Agent a warrant (the “Warrant”) to purchase an aggregate of\n1,810,528 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $2.73 per share. The Warrant is exercisable, at any time and from time to time, for 10 years following the Issuance\nDate. Under the terms of the Warrant, we have a right to force Successor Agent to exercise the Warrant under certain Forced Exercise Conditions (as defined in the Warrant)\nand issue a replacement warrant, and Successor Agent has a right to require us to purchase the unexercised portion of the Warrant under certain circumstances, including upon a\nFundamental Transaction (as defined in the Warrant). If we are required to purchase the unexercised portion of the Warrant, we may elect to pay such repurchase price in the\nform of an unsecured promissory note.\nThe Warrant provides for certain adjustments to the exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant in certain circumstances, including a full-\nratchet anti-dilution adjustment in connection with certain issuances of Common Stock and convertible securities by us below the then current exercise price of the Warrant. We\nalso agreed to register for resale with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) the shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant. The Warrant contains restrictions\non Successor Agent’s ability to exercise the Warrant, such that Successor Agent shall not be entitled to exercise the Warrant if the total number of shares of Common Stock then\nbeneficially owned by Successor Agent, and its affiliates and any other persons whose beneficial ownership of Common Stock would be aggregated with Successor Agent’s\nother ownership of our Common Stock, exceeds 4.999% of the total number of issued and outstanding shares of our Common Stock (the “Threshold Percentage”). However,\nSuccessor Agent has the right at any time and from time to time, to increase the Threshold Percentage to 9.999%. Additionally, Successor Agent shall not have the right to\nexercise the Warrant if the total number of shares of Common Stock then beneficially owned by Successor Agent, and its affiliates and any other persons whose beneficial\nownership of Common Stock would be aggregated with Successor Agent’s other ownership of our Common Stock, exceeds 19.99%, unless shareholder approval is obtained by\nus, as may be required by the applicable rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Stock Market or any such other exchange on which our shares are then listed, or unless such\nshareholder approval requirement has been waived by the Nasdaq Stock Market. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Warrant, the sum of the number of shares of\nCommon Stock that may be issued under the Warrant is limited to 19.99% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the issuance date of the Warrant (the “Exchange\nCap”), unless shareholder approval is obtained by us to issue more than the Exchange Cap, as may be required by the applicable rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Stock\nMarket or any such other exchange on which our shares are then listed, or unless such shareholder approval requirement has been waived by the Nasdaq Stock Market.\nThe Credit Agreement contained representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants that are generally customary for credit facilities of this type. Among others,\nthe Credit Agreement contained various covenants that, subject to agreed-upon exceptions, limit the Borrowers’ and their respective subsidiaries’ ability to incur indebtedness,\ngrant liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, enter into swap agreements, make loans, acquisitions and investments, change the nature of their business, acquire or sell\nassets or consolidate or merge with or into other persons or entities, declare or pay dividends or make other restricted payments, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into\nburdensome agreements, change fiscal year, amend organizational documents, and use proceeds to fund any activities of or business with any person that is the subject of\ngovernmental sanctions. In addition, the Credit Agreement required that, for any period commencing upon the occurrence of an event of default and until such time as no event\nof default is continuing, the Borrowers satisfy a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.10:1.00. The Credit Agreement also included customary events of\ndefault, the occurrence of which, following any applicable grace period, would permit the lenders to, among other things, declare the principal, accrued interest and other\nobligations of the Borrowers under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable, and exercise rights and remedies available to the lenders under the Credit\nAgreement or applicable law or equity.\n30\nIn connection with the Credit Agreement, the Borrowers entered into a pledge and security agreement pursuant to which the obligations under the Credit Agreement were\nsecured on a senior secured basis (subject to permitted liens) by substantially all assets of the Borrowers and substantially all assets of any future guarantors.\nOn June 14, 2024, the Company received a written notice (the “June 14 Notice”) from HCP-FVU, LLC, as Successor Agent, under the Credit Agreement, that an alleged event\nof default had occurred. The June 14 Notice specified that in the Successor Agent’s view, certain defaults occurred under the Credit Agreement due to the Borrowers’ failure to:\n(i) provide a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its subsidiaries together without a “going concern” or like qualification or exception, (ii) deliver a compliance\ncertificate with financial reporting along with concurrent analysis, (iii) deliver notice to the New Lenders as to election to pay all or a portion of interest as PIK interest prior to\nthe payment deadlines of May 1, 2024 and June 1, 2024, and (iv) provide certain projections as required under the Credit Agreement. As a result of these alleged defaults, the\nJune 14 Notice stated that the Successor Agent was exercising its right to accrue interest at the default rate of 18% beginning May 1, 2024 and that the Borrowers were required\nto appoint a Chief Restructuring Officer in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, the selection of whom was subject to the consent of the New Lenders.\nOn June 21, 2024, the Company received a subsequent written notice (the “June 21 Notice”) from the Successor Agent in which the Successor Agent stated that it would not be\naccelerating the amounts owed under the Credit Agreement nor taking any remedies afforded to it under the Credit Agreement other than accruing interest at the default rate of\n18% for the seven-day period beginning June 21, 2024. The June 21 Notice further stated that the Successor Agent was not waiving any New Lenders’ rights or remedy\navailable under the Credit Agreement. On July 3, 2024, the Company received a written notice (the “July 3 Notice”, and together with the June 14 Notice and the June 21\nNotice, the “Default Notices”) from the Successor Agent that an alleged Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Agreement) had occurred due to the Borrowers’ failure to (i)\ncomply with certain covenants set forth in the Forbearance Agreement, and (ii) deliver to the Successor Agent and New Lenders material sufficient to determine whether the\nBorrowers are in compliance with certain covenants set forth in the Forbearance Agreement. In the July 3 Notice, the Successor Agent stated that the loans under the Credit\nAgreement would continue to accrue interest at the default rate of 18% due to the additional default alleged in the July 3 Notice. The July 3 Notice further stated that the\nSuccessor Agent was not waiving any of New Lenders’ rights or remedy available under the Credit Agreement.\nThe Company responded to the June 14 Notice advising the Successor Agent that the Company believed that no default or event of default under the Credit Agreement existed\nin connection with the alleged defaults described in the June 14 Notice.\nOn August 5, 2024, we voluntarily prepaid approximately $9.4 million to repay (with effect as of August 8, 2024) (the “Repayment”) in full all amounts outstanding and\npayable under the Credit Agreement. In connection with the termination of the Credit Agreement, the total amount repaid by the Company of approximately $9.4 million\nconsisted of approximately $8.5 million of principal, approximately $0.8 million of accrued interest, including interest that would have accrued through the one-year\nanniversary of the Forbearance Agreement, approximately $0.1 million of prepayment premium and approximately $0.1 million of customary expenses of the Successor Agent\nand the Lenders.\nAs a result of the Repayment, all of the Obligations (as defined in the Credit Agreement) are and shall be deemed satisfied in full and the Credit Agreement, the other Loan\nDocuments (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and any other documents, instruments, certificates, financing statements, and agreements related to the Credit Agreement\nterminate (collectively, the “Financing Documents”). As a result of the termination of the Credit Agreement, the Successor Agent, the Lenders and their respective participants,\nif any, shall have no further commitment to provide loans or other financial accommodations under the Credit Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents. We have\nreceived confirmation (in the form of a customary payoff letter) of such termination from the Successor Agent on behalf of the Lenders.\nDivestiture to HieFo Corporation\nOn April 30, 2024, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “HieFo Purchase Agreement”), with HieFo Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“HieFo”), pursuant to\nwhich we agreed to transfer to HieFo substantially all of the assets primarily related to our discontinued chips business line, including with respect to equipment, contracts,\nintellectual property and inventory, including without limitation our indium phosphide wafer fabrication equipment (the “Chips Transaction”), in consideration for a purchase\nprice equal to $2.9 million in cash and assumption by HieFo of certain assumed liabilities, $1.0 million of which was received by us in the quarter ended December 31, 2023 in\nconnection with the execution of a non-binding letter of intent related to the Chips Transaction and $1.9 million of which was received by us upon closing of the Chips\nTransaction. The signing and closing of the Chips Transaction occurred simultaneously.\nIn connection with the Chips Transaction, we and HieFo entered a transition services agreement pursuant to which we are providing certain migration and transition services to\nfacilitate an orderly transition of the operation of the chips business line to\n31\nHieFo in consideration for fees payable to us for such services as agreed between us and HieFo for a period of up to 12 months following consummation of the Chips\nTransaction, and we and HieFo entered into a sublease pursuant to which we are subleasing to HieFo (i) initially, all of one building and a portion of a second building\n(collectively occupying approximately 21,750 square feet) and (ii) beginning January 1, 2026, all of such two buildings (collectively occupying approximately 25,000 square\nfeet) at our Alhambra, California facility through the remaining term of our lease of such facility ending September 30, 2031, with a pro rata portion of the rent for such facility\nbeing payable to us beginning on July 1, 2024.\nDivestiture to Photonics Foundries\nOn October 11, 2023, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, by and among us, PF, and Ortel LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary\nof PF (the “Buyer”), pursuant to which (i) we agreed to transfer to the Buyer, and Buyer agreed to assume, substantially all of the assets and liabilities primarily related to the\nBusinesses, including with respect to employees, contracts, intellectual property and inventory, and (ii) Buyer agreed to provide a limited license back to us of the patents being\nsold to the Buyer (the “PF Transaction”). The PF Transaction excludes our chip business, indium phosphide wafer fabrication facilities and all assets not primarily related to the\nBusinesses. The signing and closing of the PF Transaction occurred simultaneously, except with respect to our assets located in China. On November 30, 2023, we transferred\nto the Buyer, and the Buyer assumed, substantially all of the assets and liabilities of each of our subsidiaries in China.\nIn connection with the PF Transaction, the parties entered into a transition services agreement pursuant to which we are providing certain migration and transition services to\nfacilitate an orderly transaction of the operation of the Businesses to the Buyer in the 12-month period following consummation of the PF Transaction, and we and the Buyer\nentered into a sublease pursuant to which we are subleasing to the Buyer one of our buildings (occupying approximately 12,500 square feet) at our Alhambra, California facility\nfor the 12-month period immediately following the closing of the PF Transaction without payment of rent. With respect to the Buyer’s assumption of that certain Manufacturing\nSupply Agreement, dated August 9, 2021 (as amended, the “Fastrain Manufacturing Agreement”), by and among the Company, Shenzhen Fastrain Technology Co., Ltd., Hong\nKong Fastrain Company Limited, and Fastrain Technology Malaysia SDN. BHD (collectively, “Fastrain”), we (i) made a payment to Fastrain in the amount of approximately\n$0.4 million immediately prior to the closing of the PF Transaction and (ii) provided a guaranty of PF’s and the Buyer’s obligations with respect to payment of certain long-\nterm liabilities that were originally agreed to and set forth in the Fastrain Manufacturing Agreement and assigned to PF and the Buyer in the PF Transaction, in an aggregate\namount expected to equal up to approximately $5.5 million, approximately $4.2 million of which will not become payable, if at all, until January 2026, provided that if such\nguaranty is exercised by Fastrain, we will have the right to require the Buyer to reassign to us all intellectual property assigned to the Buyer in the PF Transaction and we will\nhave the right to recover damages from PF and the Buyer.\nAugust 2023 Equity Offering\nIn August 2023, we closed our offering of 2,260,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $5.00 per share, and, to certain investors, pre-funded warrants (each, a “Pre-\nFunded Warrant”) to purchase 1,190,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $4.9999999 for each Pre-Funded Warrant (which represents the per share public offering\nprice for our common stock in such offering less the $0.0000001 per share exercise price for each such Pre-Funded Warrant), resulting in net proceeds to us from the offering,\nafter deducting the placement agent commissions and other offering expenses, of approximately $15.6 million. The shares were sold by us pursuant to an Underwriting\nAgreement, dated as of August 17, 2023, between us and the Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC as the sole managing underwriter. In the quarter ended March 31, 2024, certain\nholders of Pre-Funded Warrants exercised such warrants, resulting in the issuance to such holders of an aggregate amount of 400,000 shares of Common Stock, and in the\nquarter ended June 30, 2024, certain holders of Pre-Funded Warrants exercised such warrants, resulting in the issuance to such holders an aggregate amount of 790,000 shares\nof Common Stock. As of June 30, 2024, no Pre-Funded Warrants remained outstanding.\nFebruary 2023 Equity Offering\nOn February 17, 2023, we closed our offering of 1,545,454 shares of our common stock at a price of $11.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds to us from the offering, after\ndeducting the placement agent commissions and other offering expenses, of $15.4 million. The shares were sold by us pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of\nFebruary 17, 2023, between the Company and each purchaser named in the signature pages thereto and a Placement Agency Agreement, dated as of February 15, 2023, by and\nbetween the Company and A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners.\nEconomic Conditions\n32\nThe increased instability of global economic conditions and inflationary risks are adding to the uncertainty of our business. These adverse conditions could result in longer sales\ncycles, increased costs to manufacture our products, and increased price competition. Given the dynamic nature of these macroeconomic conditions, we cannot reasonably\nestimate their full impact on our ongoing business, results of operations, and overall financial performance.\nResults of Operations - Continuing Operations\nThree Months Ended June 30,\n(in thousands, except percentages) 2024 2023 Change\nRevenue $ 20,435 $ 26,718 $ (6,283) (23.5)%\nCost of revenue 15,422 19,458 (4,036) (20.7)\nGross profit 5,013 7,260 (2,247) (31.0)\nOperating expense:\nSelling, general, and administrative 4,624 5,714 (1,090) (19.1)\nResearch and development 3,530 4,345 (815) (18.8)\nRestructuring 1,347 — 1,347 100.0\nSeverance 1,856 11 1,845 16,772.7\nImpairment 2,919 — 2,919 100.0\nTotal operating expense 14,276 10,070 4,206 41.8\nOperating loss $ (9,263) $ (2,810) $ (6,453) (229.6)%\nNine Months Ended June 30,\n(in thousands, except percentages) 2024 2023 Change\nRevenue $ 64,192 $ 70,947 $ (6,755) (9.5)%\nCost of revenue 49,844 54,447 (4,603) (8.5)\nGross profit 14,348 16,500 (2,152) (13.0)\nOperating expense:\nSelling, general, and administrative 17,270 24,092 (6,822) (28.3)\nResearch and development 10,865 13,442 (2,577) (19.2)\nRestructuring 1,347 — 1,347 100.0\nSeverance 3,086 27 3,059 11,329.6\nImpairment 3,007 — 3,007 100.0\nGain on sale of assets (31) (1,147) 1,116 97.3\nTotal operating expense 35,544 36,414 (870) (2.4)\nOperating loss $ (21,196) $ (19,914) $ (1,282) (6.4)%\nRevenue\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024, revenue decreased by $6.3 million or 23.5% compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease of $7.1\nmillion related our Budd Lake operations as a result of the termination of the TAIMU program by our customer followed by a modest slowdown from our BoRG program\ndemand, offset by improved shipments in units for our MK48 program out of our Concord facility.\nFor the nine months ended June 30, 2024, revenue decreased by $6.8 million or 9.5% compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the termination of the\nTAIMU program by our customer and lower revenue from FOG, and QMEMS product sales due to lower demand from the customer than in the previous period.\nGross Profit\nGross profit is revenue less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists of raw materials, compensation expense, depreciation, amortization, accretion expense, and other\nmanufacturing overhead costs, expenses associated with excess and obsolete inventories, and product warranty costs. Historically, gross profit as a percentage of revenue,\nwhich we refer to as gross margin,\n33\nhas fluctuated significantly due to revenue and production volumes over fixed manufacturing costs, product mix, manufacturing yields, and inventory charges (e.g., scrap\nfactors, excess and obsolete, inventory valuation adjustments).\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024, gross profit decreased by $2.2 million or 31.0% and gross margin decreased from 27.2% to 24.5% compared to the same period in\nthe prior year, due to lower volume of sales utilizing the same fixed overhead costs.\nFor the nine months ended June 30, 2024, gross profit decreased by $2.2 million or 13.0% and gross margin decreased from 23.3% to 22.4% compared to the same period in the\nprior year, due to lower volume of sales utilizing the same fixed overhead costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) consists primarily of personnel-related expenditures for sales and marketing, IT, finance, legal, and human resources support\nfunctions.\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024, SG&A decreased by $1.1 million or 19.1% compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by compensation expense\nreduction as a result of headcount reductions described above in “Recent Developments”.\nFor the nine months ended June 30, 2024, SG&A decreased by $6.8 million or 28.3% compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by compensation expense\nreduction as a result of headcount reductions described above in “Recent Developments”.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development (“R&D”) includes personnel-related expenditures, project costs, and facility-related expenses. We intend to continue to invest in R&D programs\nbecause they are essential to our future growth.\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024, R&D expense decreased by $0.8 million or 18.8% compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by the headcount\nreductions described above in “Recent Developments” which delivered compensation cost savings supported by discretionary cost management savings and a modest increase\nin costs directly correlated to contract revenue transferred from R&D into Cost of Revenue.\nFor the nine months ended June 30, 2024, R&D expense decreased by $2.6 million or 19.2% compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by the headcount\nreductions described above in “Recent Developments” which delivered compensation cost savings supported by discretionary cost management savings and a modest increase\nin costs directly correlated to contract revenue transferred from R&D into Cost of Revenue.\nRestructuring\nFor the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, restructuring expense totaled approximately $1.3 million associated with $0.8 million in impairment of the Alhambra\ninventory, $0.3 million of impairment of the Alhambra manufacturing execution system, and $0.2 million in costs to tear-down, pack and move equipment out of the Alhambra\nfacility.\nSeverance\nFor the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, severance totaled approximately $1.9 million and $3.1 million, respectively, associated with headcount reductions,\nprimarily at our Concord, CA and Alhambra, CA facilities.\nImpairment\nFor the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, impairment expense totaled approximately $2.9 million and $3.0 million, respectively, associated with a write-off of $2.4\nmillion of Alhambra leasehold improvements and a write-off of $0.5 million of Alhambra ROU assets.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt and Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability\n34\nDuring the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, in consideration of the Forbearance Agreement, the Company issued the Warrant to the Successor Agent to purchase an\naggregate of 1,810,528 (post-reverse split) shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $2.73 per share. The Warrant is exercisable, at any time and from\ntime to time, for 10 years following the Issuance Date. The terms of the Warrant did not allow for equity classification and as a result, the Company recorded the fair value of\nthe Warrant of $5.1 million as of the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation method, which resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment and a non-current liability. The\nliability classification of the Warrant requires that the Company revalue the Warrant at the end of each reporting and therefore, at June 30, 2024, the fair value of the warrant\nand corresponding non-current liability were reduced by $3.0 million, resulting in a net non-cash expense of $2.1 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024\nincluded in the caption “Loss on extinguishment of debt and change in fair value of warrant liability.” See Note 10 - Credit Agreement and Note 13 - Equity.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have recently experienced significant losses from our operations and used a significant amount of cash in connection with strategic acquisitions to further our strategy of\nfocusing on our Inertial Navigation business. As a result of our recent cash shortage, we have taken actions to manage our liquidity and will need to continue to manage our\nliquidity as we continue to restructure our operations to focus on our Inertial Navigation business. As of June 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $9.0 million,\nincluding restricted cash of $0.5 million and cash in escrow of $0.7 million, and net working capital, totaled $44.2 million. Net working capital, calculated as current assets\n(including inventory) minus current liabilities, is a financial metric we use which represents available operating liquidity.\nWe have taken a number of actions to continue to support our operations and meet our obligations:\n• In April 2023, we initiated a restructuring program that included the strategic shutdown of our Broadband business segment (including our cable TV, wireless, sensing\nand chips product lines) and the discontinuance of our defense optoelectronics product line (the “April 2023 Restructuring”). Our Board of Directors performed a\nthorough review of a number of factors including the competitive landscape, declining revenue and gross profit of these discontinued businesses, the current and\nexpected profitability of these discontinued businesses, our cost structure, and our strategic focus on our Inertial Navigation business segment, and concluded that\nthese discontinued businesses were non-strategic, unsustainable, and could not be restructured in a way that would have allowed us to achieve profitable growth and\ncash preservation. During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Broadband business segment and defense optoelectronics product line were considered as held\nfor sale based upon the existence at such time of an executed non-binding letter of intent with respect to the PF Transaction and in consideration of ongoing\nnegotiations for the sale of the chips business. Given the then-prospective sale of the Broadband business segment and defense optoelectronics product line, we\nidentified these asset groups as discontinued operations during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. We discontinued operations of our chips business and indium\nphosphide wafer fabrication facility during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, consummated the PF Transaction during the three months ended December 31, 2023\nand consummated the Chips Transaction on April 30, 2024. In May 2024, we initiated the May 2024 Restructuring. Our Board of Directors performed a thorough\nreview of a number of factors including our competitive landscape, expected revenue and profitability, and cost structure, and concluded that our then-current structure\nand operations would not allow us to achieve profitable growth and cash generation. We expect the full closure of the Alhambra facility to be completed during the\nquarter ending September 30, 2024. Primarily as a result of these restructurings, we (i) have eliminated approximately 200 positions across all locations, collectively\nrepresenting approximately 50% of our total workforce prior to such reductions, and (ii) consolidated facility space by shutting down our operations at the Alhambra\nfacility (including sublease of three of the five buildings in Alhambra pursuant to the Chips Transaction and PF Transaction) and seeking to sublease the remaining\navailable space in such facility, transferred our manufacturing support and engineering center in China to PF pursuant to the PF Transaction, and plan to relocate\npersonnel in Concord, California to the operations area from the adjacent office building, collectively representing an approximately 35% reduction in the aggregate\nsquare footage occupied by our facilities. The personnel reduction actions that we have taken in connection with the May 2024 Restructuring are expected to result in\nannualized cost savings of approximately $17.0 million, exclusive of severance costs. One-time employee severance and termination costs related to the May 2024\nRestructuring of approximately $1.9 million and $3.1 million were incurred during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024. For the three months ended June\n30, 2024, we also incurred $1.3 million of restructuring expense including $0.8 million in impairment of Alhambra inventory, $0.3 million of impairment of the\nAlhambra manufacturing execution system, and $0.2 million in costs to tear-down, pack and move equipment out of the Alhambra facility. We anticipate that cash and\nnon-cash charges will be incurred and recorded in future reporting periods and we may incur additional expenses in connection with these restructurings that are not\ncurrently contemplated. The charges that we expect to incur in connection with these restructurings are estimates and subject to a number of assumptions, and actual\nresults may differ materially.\n• On April 30, 2024, we entered into the HieFo Purchase Agreement with HieFo, with respect to the Chips Transaction for a purchase price equal to $2.92 million in\ncash and assumption by HieFo of certain assumed liabilities, $1 million of which was received by us in the quarter ended December 31, 2023 and $1.92 million of\nwhich was received by us\n35\nupon closing of the Chips Transaction on April 29, 2024. We and HieFo also entered a transition services agreement pursuant to which we are providing certain\nmigration and transition services to facilitate an orderly transition of the operation of the chips business line to HieFo in consideration for fees payable to us for such\nservices as agreed between us and HieFo for a period of up to 12 months following consummation of the Chips Transaction, and we HieFo entered into a sublease\npursuant to which we are subleasing to HieFo (i) initially, all of one building and a portion of a second building (collectively occupying approximately 21,750 square\nfeet) and (ii) beginning January 1, 2026, all of such two buildings (collectively occupying approximately 25,000 square feet) at our Alhambra, California facility\nthrough the remaining term of our lease of such facility ending September 30, 2031, with a pro rata portion of the rent for such facility being payable to us beginning\non July 1, 2024.\n• In August 2023, we closed our offering of 2,260,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $5.00 per share, and, to certain investors, Pre-Funded Warrants to\npurchase 1,190,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $4.9999999 for each Pre-Funded Warrant (which represents the per share public offering price for our\ncommon stock in such offering less the $0.0000001 per share exercise price for each such Pre-Funded Warrant), resulting in net proceeds to us from the offering, after\ndeducting the placement agent commissions and other offering expenses, of approximately $15.6 million. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations – Recent Developments under the heading “August 2023 Equity Offering” for additional information regarding the equity\noffering.\n• In February 2023, we closed our offering of 1,545,455 shares of our common stock at a price of $11.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds to us from the offering of\n$15.4 million. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Recent Developments under the heading “February\n2023 Equity Offering” for additional information regarding the equity offering.\nOur existing balances of cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, together with additional actions we may take to further reduce our expenses and/or additional\nfunds we may receive if we elect to raise capital through additional debt or equity issuances or from our efforts to monetize certain assets, are anticipated to provide us with\nsufficient financial resources to meet cash requirements for operations, working capital, and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months from the issuance date of the\nJune 30, 2024 condensed consolidated financial statements. As a result, these condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The\ngoing concern assumption contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, substantial doubt about our ability to\ncontinue as a going concern exists as we may not be successful in executing on our plans to manage our liquidity, including recognizing the expected benefits from our\nrestructuring described above, and our ability to continue to operate as a going concern could be impaired, which could in turn cause a significant decline in our stock price and\ncould result in a significant loss of value for our shareholders.\nWe continue to explore a range of options to further address our capitalization and liquidity. If we raise funds by issuing debt securities or incurring loans, this form of financing\nwould have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. The availability and the terms under which we can borrow additional capital\ncould be disadvantageous, and the terms of debt securities or borrowings could impose significant restrictions on our operations. Macroeconomic conditions and credit markets\ncould also impact the availability and cost of potential future debt financing. If we raise capital through the issuance of additional equity, such sales and issuance would dilute\nthe ownership interests of the existing holders of our common stock. There can be no assurances that any additional debt or equity financing would be available to us or if\navailable, that such financing would be on favorable terms to us. In addition, if adequate funds are not available to fund our future operations, we may need to curb our business\nplans, which could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects and results of operations.\nCash Flow\nNine Months Ended June 30,\n(in thousands, except percentages) 2024 2023 Change\nNet cash used in operating activities - continuing operations $ (14,800) $ (30,346) $ 15,546 51.2 %\nNet cash provided by investing activities $ 383 $ 5,795 $ (5,412) (93.4)%\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities $ (3,465) $ 11,803 $ (15,268) (129.4)%\nFor the nine months ended June 30, 2024, our operating activities used cash primarily due to our net loss less non-cash adjustments. The cash used in operating activities -\ncontinuing operations decreased by 51.2% compared to the previous period due the April 2023 Restructuring. See further discussion in Recent Developments.\nFor the nine months ended June 30, 2024, our investing activities provided cash primarily from a deposit on our assets held for sale less purchases and deposits on property,\nplant, and equipment. The cash provided by investing activities decreased by\n36\n93.4% due to the sale lease back of the Tinley Park facility which occurred in the previous period and did not repeat in the current period.\nFor the nine months ended June 30, 2024, our financing activities used cash primarily for payments pursuant to the Credit Agreement and payments towards our financing\narrangement related to insurance premiums. The cash provided by financing activities deceased by 129.4% due to the proceeds from issuance of common stock which occurred\nin the previous period and did not repeat in the current period.\nRefer to Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for further detail.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nAs of the date of this report, there were no material changes to our contractual obligations and commitments outside the ordinary course of business since September 30, 2023\nas reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nEMS Guarantee\nIn addition to the operating leases as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, in connection with the PF Transaction, with\nrespect to the Buyer’s assumption of the Fastrain Manufacturing Agreement, we provided a guaranty of PF’s and the Buyer’s obligations with respect to payment of certain\nlong-term liabilities that were originally agreed to and set forth in the Fastrain Manufacturing Agreement and assigned to PF and the Buyer in the PF Transaction, in an\naggregate amount expected to equal up to approximately $5.5 million, approximately $4.2 million of which will not become payable, if at all, until January 2026, provided that\nif such guaranty is exercised by the EMS provider, we will have the right to require the Buyer to reassign to us all intellectual property assigned to the Buyer in the PF\nTransaction and we will have the right to recover damages from PF and the Buyer.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts\nof assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the\nreported period. If these estimates differ significantly from actual results, the impact to the condensed consolidated financial statements may be material. There have been no\nmaterial changes in our critical accounting estimates from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. Please refer to\nPart II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 for a discussion of our critical accounting estimates.\nITEM 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur disclosure controls and procedures, (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange\nAct”)), are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and\nreported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We designed our disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that information required to be\ndisclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal\nfinancial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with assistance from other members of our\nmanagement, have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2024 and, based upon this evaluation, has concluded that our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures contained material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting which were identified by the Company. A material weakness is a deficiency\nor combination of deficiencies in internal controls over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim\nfinancial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company determined that communications with regard to internal control objectives were not effective to require employees to report the\nexistence of new or novel arrangements for technical accounting review, which resulted in the Company’s failure to design and implement effective controls over such\ntransactions. As of September 30, 2023, the control deficiency resulted in a material error associated with identification of the existence of certain insurance premium\n37\nand supplier financing agreements, whereby (i) certain items on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet were underreported in “Other current assets” with a consistent dollar\namount underreported for “Financing payable” within the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and (ii) certain items on the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows\nwere underreported in Payments to financing payables within “Cash flows from financing activities” and similar such underreporting of such items in other assets in “Cash\nflows from operating activities”. This error has been corrected in the consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, and as a result,\nthis material weakness did not result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements previously filed or included in this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K.\nAs of June 30, 2024, we identified a second material weakness in internal controls related to the accounting for financial instruments and financing transactions. In particular,\nour accounting analysis of the Warrant issued to the Successor Lender Hale on April 29, 2024 was not sufficiently robust to result in appropriate classification of the instrument\nas a liability with change in its fair value remeasured at the end of every quarterly reporting period and recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. This error has been\ncorrected in the condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, and as a result, this material weakness did not result\nin a material misstatement to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Interim Report on Form 10-Q.\nWe have identified and are implementing actions intended to improve the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures\nand will continue to do so until such remediation is complete. Management intends to remediate the material weaknesses described above primarily through a combination of\n(i) revisiting and clarifying, as needed, Company policies with respect to required communications when entering binding arrangements, (ii) communicating to employees the\nimportance of elevating new and/or novel arrangements for technical accounting oversight in their respective internal control areas, (such communication, including compliance\nwith existing or revised policy, is expected to be delivered through employee training) and (iii) initiating thorough accounting analysis on every new financial instrument and\nfinancing arrangement or modification to a financing arrangement.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no other changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act)\nduring the quarter ended June 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting other\nthan the identification of the second material weakness as reported above. See the description of the material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting outlined in\n“Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures” above.\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1.

Business.\n\nOrganization\n\nEMCORE Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (referred to herein as the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “EMCORE”), was established in 1986 as a New Jersey corporation. We became publicly traded in 1997 and are listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol EMKR. Our headquarters and principal executive offices are located in Alhambra, California. For specific information about products or the markets served please visit our website at https://www.emcore.com. The information contained in or linked to our website is not a part of, nor incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K or a part of any other report or filing with the SEC.\n\nDescription of the Business\n\nWe are a leading provider of sensors and navigation systems for the aerospace and defense market. Over the last five years, EMCORE has expanded its scale and portfolio of inertial sensor products through the acquisitions of Systron Donner Inertial, Inc. (“SDI”) in June 2019, the Space and Navigation business of L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (“S&N”) in April 2022, and the FOG and Inertial Navigation Systems business of KVH Industries, Inc. (“EMCORE Chicago”) in August 2022. Our multi-year transition from a broadband company to an inertial navigation company has now been completed following the sale of our cable TV, wireless, sensing and defense optoelectronics business lines and the shutdown of our chips business line and indium phosphide wafer fabrication operations.\n\nWe have fully vertically-integrated manufacturing capability at our headquarters in Alhambra, CA, and at our facilities in Budd Lake, NJ, Concord, CA, and Tinley Park, IL. These facilities support our manufacturing strategy for Fiber Optic Gyroscope (“FOG”), Ring Laser Gyro (“RLG”), Photonic Integrated Chip (“PIC”), and Quartz Micro Electro-Mechanical System (“QMEMS”) products for inertial navigation. Our manufacturing facilities maintain ISO 9001 quality management certification, and we are AS9100 aerospace quality certified at our facilities in Alhambra, CA, Concord, CA, and Budd Lake, NJ. Our best-in-class components and systems support a broad array of inertial navigation applications. \n\nOur operations include wafer fabrication (lithium niobate and quartz), device design and production, fiber optic module and subsystem design and manufacture, and PIC-based and QMEMS-based component design and manufacture. Many of our manufacturing operations are computer-monitored or controlled to enhance production output and statistical control. Our manufacturing processes involve extensive quality assurance systems and performance testing.\n\nPrincipal Products and Markets\n\nWe have one reporting segment, Inertial Navigation, whose product technology categories include: (a) FOG, (b) QMEMS, and (c) RLG, in each case which serve the aerospace and defense market.\n\nThrough our vertically-integrated infrastructure, we have adapted the same technologies, chip designs, and production assets applicable to our former cable TV products to our closed-loop FOG products. EMCORE’s patented PIC significantly advances FOG technology in our open-loop FOG products with a planar optical chip that replaces individual fiber optic components for easy integration and outstanding repeatability unit-to-unit. Our SDI QMEMS technology uses a one-piece, inertial sensing element to measure angular rotational velocity and is micro-machined using sophisticated photolithographic processes which are at the forefront of Micro Electro Mechanical System (“MEMS”) technology. Our advanced RLG technology delivers high performance, reliability, and quality pointing and position capability for land navigation and is deployed on key programs including the Multiple Launch Rocket System (“MLRS”) and High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System (“HIMARS”). These technologies have broad applications within the aerospace and defense markets for high-value-added products for land, sea, air, and space navigation.\n\nFOG - Our FOG technologies have received multiple U.S. patents and have been qualified for several key military programs for applications including unmanned aerial systems, line-of-site stabilization, aviation, and aeronautics. Our FOG products range from tactical to navigation grade gyros, inertial measurement units (“IMU”) and inertial navigation systems (“INS”) where performance specifications improve depending on the grade, giving customers the flexibility to choose the product and performance level that best meets their application. Our FOG-based IMUs can deliver performance up to strategic grade and along with our INS provide compelling size, weight, and power (“SWaP”) performance compared to competing units and legacy designs to deliver high precision and better performance in compact, portable form factors.\n\n5\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nQMEMS - Our QMEMS gyroscopes, accelerometers, IMUs, and INS products deliver SWaP performance and cost advantages over alternative technologies. With our experience in these technologies, we are developing leading-edge disciplines which are enabling advanced performance capabilities in mission-critical applications worldwide.

We aim to design and build innovative products that are valued by our customers with the intention to grow our product line using innovative technology. We seek solutions that maximize performance in transformative aerospace and defense systems.\n\nOur industry is characterized by rapid changes in process technologies with increasing levels of functional integration. Research and development efforts focus on maintaining our technological competitive edge to improve the quality and features of existing products. We strive to design new proprietary production technologies and products, improving the performance of existing materials, components, and subsystems, and reducing costs in the product manufacturing process. Many projects have focused on developing lower-cost versions of our existing products. In view of the high cost of development, we solicit research and development contracts that provide opportunities to enhance our core technology base and promote the commercialization of targeted products.\n\nDistribution Methods\n\nWe sell products worldwide through multiple channels made up of our direct sales force, application engineers, third-party sales representatives, and distributors. Our sales force is aligned according to product line to maximize expertise. We communicate with customers’ engineering, manufacturing, and purchasing personnel throughout the sales cycle to provide optimized customer solutions through product design, qualifications, performance, and price. As a result, we develop strategic and long-lasting customer relationships with tailored products and services. Marketing efforts are focused on increasing brand awareness, communicating our technological advantages, and generating leads. We use a variety of marketing methods including our website and e-marketing, participation at trade shows, press releases and media relations, selective advertising, and social media to achieve these goals.\n\nCompetitive Business Conditions, Our Competitive Position in the Industry, and Methods of Competition\n\nThe markets we serve are extremely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change. Primary competitive factors are product cost, yield, throughput, performance, reliability, breadth of product line, product reputation, customer satisfaction, and customer loyalty to competitors’ technologies. We face competition from numerous domestic and international companies, who may have significant engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and financial resources. In addition, competitors may develop enhancements to, or future generations of, products that offer superior price and performance characteristics.\n\nAlthough our markets are competitive, there are substantial barriers to entry. These barriers include significant dependence on existing patents, the time and costs required to develop products, the technical difficulty in manufacturing semiconductor-based products, the lengthy sales and qualification cycles, and the difficulties in hiring and retaining skilled employees with the required scientific and technical backgrounds. \n\nWe sell products to current and future potential competitors. As the markets for our products grow, new competitors are likely to emerge and current competitors may increase their market share. In the European Union (“EU”) and certain countries throughout the world, political and legal arrangements encourage the purchase of domestically produced goods which places us at a disadvantage in those regions or countries. \n\nSources and Availability of Raw Materials and Principal Suppliers\n\n6\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, and equipment. Supplier relationships are reviewed to mitigate risks and lower costs, especially where we depend on a few suppliers for critical components or raw materials. Communications with suppliers are ongoing to prevent interruptions and our supply chain management is focused on maintaining quality while lowering purchase prices through standardized purchasing efficiencies and design requirements. We strive to limit inventories to levels sufficient to meet near-term needs. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, the majority of production for our Broadband segment, while still a part of EMCORE, was through our contract manufacturers, while all of our Inertial Navigation related production was through our vertically-integrated manufacturing operations.\n\nDependence on Major Customers\n\nOur major customers include L3 Harris and Lockheed Martin, each of whom represented greater than 10% of consolidated revenue in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. See [Note 15 – Revenue Information](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_136) in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about significant customers.\n\nPatents and Trademarks\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, we held approximately 35 U.S. patents and approximately 33 foreign patents and approximately 31 additional patent applications are pending. The issued patents cover various products in the major markets we serve. Our U.S. patents will expire on varying dates between 2023 and 2039. These patents and patent applications claim protection for various aspects of current or planned commercial versions of our materials, components, subsystems, and systems. We also register our trademarks in the United States and other key international markets where we do business.\n\nEffect of Governmental Regulations on the Business\n\nWe operate globally and are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. These laws and regulations are subject to change, and any such change may require us to improve our technologies, incur expenditures, or both, in order to comply with such laws and regulations. We are subject to rules promulgated by the SEC pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act regarding the use of “conflict minerals”. These rules have imposed and will continue to impose additional costs and may introduce new risks related to the ability to verify the origin of any “conflict minerals” used in our products. For information about governmental regulations applicable to our business, refer to [Item 1A, “Risk Factors”](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_22) included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n\nCosts and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws (Federal, State, and Local)\n\nWe are subject to U.S. federal, state, and local laws and regulations concerning the use, storage, handling, generation, treatment, emission, release, discharge, and disposal of certain materials used in research and development and production operations, as well as laws and regulations concerning environmental remediation, homeland security, and employee health and safety. The production of wafers and devices involves the use of certain hazardous raw materials, including, but not limited to, ammonia, phosphine, and arsine. We have in-house professionals to address compliance with applicable environmental, homeland security, and health and safety laws and regulations. We believe that we are currently in material compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local environmental protection laws and regulations.\n\nHuman Capital Resources\n\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified personnel is essential to continued success. Competition is intense in recruiting personnel within the high tech and aerospace and defense industries. We are focused on retaining key contributors, developing staff, and cultivating their continued commitment. As of September 30, 2023, we had approximately 371 employees, of which approximately 355 employees are located in the U.S., and approximately 350 are full-time employees.\n\nAvailable Information\n\nWe are subject to the information requirements of the Exchange Act. We file periodic reports, current reports, proxy statements, and other information with the SEC. The SEC maintains a website at http://www.sec.gov that contains all of our information that has been filed or furnished electronically with the SEC. Available free of charge on the SEC website as well as our Investor Relations website at https://investor.emcore.com/ is a link to the Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable, after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.\n\n7\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\n8\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nITEM 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, some of which have manifested and any of which may occur in the future, in addition to the other information contained in this report before making an investment decision with respect to any of our securities. Our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted by any of these risks, which could in turn adversely affect our stock price. Additional risks not currently known to us or other factors not perceived by us as material risks could also present significant risks to our business.\n\nRisks Related to Demand, Competition, Product Development and Manufacture, and Operations\n\nWe have incurred losses from continuing operations and our future profitability is not certain.\n\nFor the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, we incurred a loss from continuing operations of $49.4 million and $40.8 million, respectively. Our operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and we cannot be certain that we will be profitable or that we will not experience substantial losses in the future. If we are not able to increase revenue and reduce our costs, we may not be able to achieve profitability in future periods and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\n\nWhile the Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, we do not currently have sufficient working capital to fund our planned operations for the next twelve months and substantial doubt exists as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP assuming we will continue as a going concern. The going concern assumption contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern exists.\n\nWe have recently experienced significant losses from our operations and used a significant amount of cash, amounting to a net loss of $75.4 million and net cash outflows from operations of $30.3 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, and we expect to continue to incur losses and use cash in our operations as we continue to restructure our business. As a result of our recent cash outflows, we have taken actions to manage our liquidity and will need to continue to manage our liquidity as we continue to restructure our operations to focus on our Inertial Navigation business. As of September 30, 2023, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $26.7 million and we had $9.9 million available under our Credit Agreement (as defined in [Note ](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_121)[11](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_121)[ - Credit Agreement](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_121) in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nWe are evaluating the sufficiency of our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and amounts expected to be available under our Credit Agreement, together with additional actions we could take (including those\n\nmade in connection with our restructuring program announced in April 2023) to further reduce our expenses and/or potentially raising capital through additional debt or equity issuances, or from the potential monetization of certain assets. However, we may not be successful in executing on our plans to manage our liquidity, including recognizing the expected benefits from our previously announced restructuring program, or raising additional funds if we elect to do so, and as a result substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern exists.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements included herein do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset amounts or the classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\n\nWe may not be able to obtain capital when desired on favorable terms, if at all, or without dilution to shareholders.\n\nWe operate in industries that make our prospects difficult to evaluate and predict. It is possible that we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or otherwise have the capital resources to meet our future capital needs. If this occurs, we may need additional financing to continue operations or to execute on our current or future business strategies, including to:\n\n•invest in research and development efforts, including by hiring additional technical and other personnel;\n\n•maintain and expand operating or manufacturing infrastructure;\n\n•acquire complementary businesses, products, services or technologies; or\n\n•otherwise pursue strategic plans and respond to competitive pressures.\n\nIf we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our shareholders could be significantly diluted, and these newly-issued securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior \n\n9\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nto those of existing shareholders. We cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, if and when needed, our ability to fund our operations, take advantage of unanticipated opportunities, develop or enhance our products, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly limited. Furthermore, in the event adequate capital is not available to us as required, or is not available on favorable terms, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives including, but not limited to, selling additional assets, exiting additional business lines, further reductions of our capital expenditures, delaying, reducing the scope of or eliminating one or more research and development programs, selling and marketing initiatives, and restructuring our existing debt obligations on new terms that may be less favorable than the existing terms, if available at all. If we are unable to manage discretionary spending, raise additional capital, or implement any of the above activities, as needed, we may need to further curtail planned activities to reduce costs, which could include additional reductions in workforce, additional eliminations of business activities and services, and further reductions in other operating expenses. Doing so could potentially have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and future prospects.\n\nOur secured credit facility contains financial and restrictive covenants that we may not satisfy, and that, if not satisfied, could result in the acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness and limit our ability to borrow additional funds. The credit facility also imposes restrictions that may limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.\n\nOur Credit Agreement, dated as of August 9, 2022 (the “Credit Agreement”), among the Company, S&N, the lenders party thereto and Wingspire Capital LLC (“Wingspire”), as administrative agent for the lenders, subjects us to various financial and other affirmative and negative covenants with which we must comply on an ongoing or periodic basis. These include financial covenants pertaining to a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and covenants requiring the mandatory prepayment of amounts outstanding under the revolver under specified circumstances. The Credit Agreement also subjects us to various restrictions on our ability to engage in certain activities, such as raising capital or acquiring businesses. These restrictions may limit or restrict our cash flow and our ability to pursue business opportunities or strategies that we would otherwise consider to be in our best interests. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains a cash dominion provision, requiring us to maintain a minimum amount of liquidity. As of September 30, 2023, this minimum amount of liquidity that we needed to maintain was $12.5 million. If we fall below this minimum amount of liquidity for a period of three consecutive days, or if there occurs an event of default under the Credit Agreement, then our lender can exercise certain rights, including taking control of our bank accounts and cash resources. In addition, if an event of default occurs under the Credit Agreement, our lenders can accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness under that agreement to make it due and payable immediately. If we trigger the cash dominion provision or if an event of default occurs under the Credit Agreement and if in either case our lenders elect to exercise their rights, we may not be able to pay our debts and other monetary obligations as they come due, and our ability to continue to operate as a going concern could be impaired, which could in turn cause a significant decline in our stock price and could result in a significant loss of value for our shareholders.\n\nWe may be unable to realize the level of the anticipated benefits that we expect from exiting businesses and restructuring our operations, which may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\n\nFrom time to time, we may decide to exit certain businesses or otherwise undertake restructuring, reorganization, or other strategic initiatives to realign our resources with our growth strategies, operate more efficiently, and reduce costs. For example, on April 21, 2023, we announced the shutdown of our Broadband business segment and our defense optoelectronics product line and on October 11, 2023, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Photonics Foundries, Inc. and Ortel LLC (collectively, the “Buyer”) pursuant to which we agreed to transfer substantially all of the assets and liabilities primarily related to our cable TV, wireless, sensing and our defense optoelectronics product lines, including with respect to employees, contracts, intellectual property, and inventory (the “PF Transaction”). The successful implementation of our restructuring activities may from time to time require us to effect business and asset dispositions, workforce reductions, facility consolidations and closures, restructurings, management changes, reductions in investments, shut-downs or discontinuance of businesses, and other actions, each of which may depend on a number of factors that may not be within our control. \n\nAny such effort to restructure or streamline our organization may result in restructuring or other costs, such as severance and termination costs, contract and lease termination costs, asset impairment charges, and other costs. In particular, we expect that material cash and non-cash charges will be incurred and recorded in our future reporting periods as a result of the shutdown of our Broadband business segment and the discontinuance of our defense optoelectronics product line. Also, with respect to the Buyer’s assumption of the Company’s manufacturing agreement with its electronics manufacturing services (“EMS”) provider for its cable TV products as part of the PF Transaction, we provided a guaranty of the Buyer’s obligations with respect to payment of certain long-term liabilities that were originally agreed to and set forth in the manufacturing agreement and assigned to the Buyer in the PF Transaction, in an aggregate amount expected to equal up to approximately $5.5 million, approximately $4.2 million of which will not become payable until January 2026, provided that if such guaranty is exercised by the EMS \n\n10\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nprovider, we will have the right to require the Buyer to reassign to us all intellectual property assigned to the Buyer in the PF Transaction and we will have the right to recover damages from the Buyer.\n\nFurther, as a result of restructuring initiatives, we may experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge and proficiency, adverse effects on employee morale, loss of key employees and other retention issues. Reorganization and restructuring can impact a significant amount of management and other employees’ time and resources, which may divert attention from operating and growing our business. Further, upon completion of any restructuring initiatives, our business may not be more efficient or effective than prior to the implementation of the plan and we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits, including cost savings, which would adversely affect our business, competitive position, operating results, and financial condition.\n\nWe are a small company and dependent on a few products for success.\n\nWe are a small company with a narrow, focused portfolio of products. Our small size could cause our cash flow, results of operations, and growth prospects to be more volatile and makes us more vulnerable to focused competition. As a small company, we will be subject to greater revenue fluctuations if our older product lines’ sales were to decline faster than we anticipate. In addition, we may not be able to appropriately restructure or maintain our supporting functions to fit the needs of a small company, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\nWe are substantially dependent on revenues from a small number of customers. The loss of or decrease in sales from any one of these customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\nA small number of customers account for a significant portion of our revenue, and dependence on orders from a relatively small number of customers makes our relationship with each customer critically important to our business. For example, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, sales to two customers accounted for an aggregate of 40% and 40% of total consolidated revenues, respectively. Revenue from any major customer may decline or fluctuate significantly in the future. We may not be able to offset any decline in sales from existing major customers with sales from new customers or other existing customers. Because of reliance on a limited number of customers, any decrease in sales from, or loss of, one or more of these customers without a corresponding increase in sales from other customers would harm our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.\n\nIn addition, any negative developments in the business of existing significant customers could result in significantly decreased sales to these customers, which could seriously harm our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. If there is consolidation among our customer base, customers may be able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale, which could adversely affect profitability. If we are required to reduce pricing, revenue and gross margins would be adversely impacted. Consolidation among our customer base may also lead to reduced demand for our products, replacement of our products by the combined entity with those of competitors, and cancellations of orders, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\nAlthough we are attempting to expand our customer base, the markets in which we sell our products are dominated by a relatively small number of companies, thereby limiting the number of potential customers. Accordingly, success will depend on our continued ability to develop and manage relationships with significant customers, and we expect that the majority of sales will continue to depend on sales of our products to a limited number of customers for the foreseeable future.\n\nFuture revenue is inherently unpredictable. As a result, operating results are likely to fluctuate from period to period, and we may fail to meet the expectations of analysts and/or investors, which may cause volatility in our stock price and may cause the stock price to decline.\n\nOur quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated substantially in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control. Factors that could cause quarterly or annual operating results to fluctuate include:\n\n•increases or decreases in the markets for customers’ products;\n\n•discontinuation by vendors of, or unavailability of, components or services used in our products;\n\n•disruptions or delays in our manufacturing processes or in our supply of raw materials or product components;\n\n•a failure to anticipate changing customer product requirements;\n\n•market acceptance of our products;\n\n•cancellations or postponements of previously placed orders;\n\n11\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\n•increased financing costs or any inability to obtain necessary financing;\n\n•the impact on our business of current or future cost reduction measures;\n\n•a loss of key personnel or the shortage of available skilled workers;\n\n•economic conditions in various geographic areas where we or our customers do business;\n\n•the impact of political uncertainties, such as government sequestration and uncertainties surrounding the federal budget, customer spending, and demand for our products;\n\n•significant warranty claims, including those not covered by suppliers;\n\n•product liability claims;\n\n•other conditions affecting the timing of customer orders;\n\n•reductions in prices for our products or increases in the costs of raw materials;\n\n•effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling prices of our products;\n\n•fluctuations in manufacturing yields;\n\n•obsolescence of products;\n\n•research and development expenses incurred associated with new product introductions;\n\n•natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, and floods;\n\n•pandemics, including COVID-19;\n\n•the emergence of new industry standards;\n\n•the loss or gain of significant customers;\n\n•the introduction of new products and manufacturing processes;\n\n•changes in technology;\n\n•intellectual property disputes;\n\n•customs (including tariffs imposed on our products or raw materials, equipment, or components used in the production of our products), import/export, and other regulations of the countries in which we do business;\n\n•the occurrence of merger and acquisition activities; and\n\n•acts of war, terrorism, or violence and international conflicts or crises.\n\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of results of operations should not be solely relied upon as indicators of future performance.\n\nThe acquisitions of EMCORE Chicago and S&N, and acquisitions of other companies or investments in joint ventures with other companies could adversely affect operating results, dilute shareholders’ equity, or cause us to incur additional debt or assume contingent liabilities.\n\nTo increase business, maintain competitive position, or for other business or strategic reasons, we may acquire other companies or engage in joint ventures or similar transactions in the future. For example, in August 2022, we acquired EMCORE Chicago from KVH Industries, Inc. and in April 2022, we acquired S&N from L3Harris Technologies, Inc. The acquisitions of EMCORE Chicago and S&N, and any other acquisitions, joint ventures, and similar transactions that we may enter into from time to time, involve a number of risks that could harm our business and result in EMCORE Chicago, S&N, and/or any other acquired business or joint venture not performing as expected, including:\n\n•problems integrating the acquired operations, personnel, technologies, or products with the existing business and products;\n\n•failure to achieve cost savings or other financial or operating objectives with respect to an acquisition;\n\n•possible adverse short-term effects on cash flows or operating results, and the use of cash and other resources for the acquisition that might affect liquidity, and that could have been used for other purposes;\n\n•diversion of management’s time and attention from our existing business to the acquired business or joint venture;\n\n•potential failure to retain key technical, management, sales, and other personnel of the acquired business or joint venture;\n\n•difficulties in retaining relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired business, particularly where such customers or suppliers compete with us;\n\n•difficulties in the integration of financial reporting systems, which could cause a delay in the issuance of, or impact the reliability of the consolidated financial statements;\n\n•failure to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including a delay in or failure to successfully integrate these businesses into our internal control over financial reporting;\n\n•insufficient experience with technologies and markets in which the acquired business is involved, which may be necessary to successfully operate and integrate the business;\n\n•reliance upon joint ventures which we do not control;\n\n•subsequent impairment of goodwill and acquired long-lived assets, including intangible assets; and\n\n12\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\n•assumption of liabilities including, but not limited to, lawsuits, environmental liabilities, regulatory liabilities, tax examinations, and warranty issues.\n\nWe may decide that it is in our best interests to enter into acquisitions, joint ventures, or similar transactions that are dilutive to earnings per share or that adversely impact margins as a whole. In addition, acquisitions or joint ventures could require investment of significant financial resources and require us to obtain additional equity financing, which may dilute shareholders’ equity, or require us to incur indebtedness.\n\nWe expect to consider from time to time further strategic opportunities that may involve acquisitions, dispositions, investments in joint ventures, partnerships, and other strategic alternatives that may enhance shareholder value, any of which may result in the use of a significant amount of management resources or significant costs, and we may not be able to fully realize the potential benefit of such transactions.\n\nWe expect to continue to consider acquisitions, dispositions, investments in joint ventures, partnerships, and other strategic alternatives that may enhance shareholder value. The Strategy and Alternatives Committee of the Board of Directors and management may from time to time be engaged in evaluating potential transactions and other strategic alternatives. In addition, from time to time, we may engage financial advisors, enter into non-disclosure agreements, conduct discussions, and undertake other actions that may result in one or more transactions. Although there would be uncertainty that any of these activities or discussions would result in definitive agreements or the completion of any transaction, we may devote a significant amount of management resources to analyzing and pursuing such a transaction, which could negatively impact operations. In addition, we may incur significant costs in connection with seeking such transactions or other strategic alternatives regardless of whether the transaction is completed. In the event that we consummate an acquisition, disposition, partnership, or other strategic alternative in the future, we cannot be certain that we would fully realize the anticipated benefits of such a transaction and cannot predict the impact that such strategic transaction might have on our operations or stock price.\n\nThe market price for our common stock has experienced significant price and volume volatility and is likely to continue to experience significant volatility in the future. This volatility may impair the ability to finance strategic transactions with our stock and otherwise harm our business.\n\nOur stock price has experienced significant price and volume volatility for the past several years, and our stock price is likely to experience significant volatility in the future. The trading price of our common stock may be influenced by factors beyond our control, such as the volatility of the financial markets, uncertainty surrounding domestic and foreign economies, conditions and trends in the markets we serve, changes in the estimation of the future size and growth rate of our markets, publication of research reports, and recommendations by financial analysts relating to our business, the business of competitors, or the industries in which we operate and compete, changes in market valuation or earnings of competitors, legislation or regulatory policies, practices, or actions, sales of our common stock by principal shareholders, and the trading volume of our common stock. The historical market prices of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices and we may be unable to sustain or increase the value of our common stock. We have historically used equity incentive compensation as part of our overall compensation arrangements. The effectiveness of equity incentive compensation in retaining key employees may be adversely impacted by volatility in our stock price. Significant declines in our stock price may also interfere with the ability, if needed, to raise additional funds through equity financing or to finance strategic transactions with our stock. In addition, there may be increased risk of securities litigation following periods of fluctuations in our stock price. Securities class action lawsuits are often brought against companies after periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. These and other consequences of volatility in our stock price which could be exacerbated by macroeconomic conditions that affect the market generally, or our industries in particular, could have the effect of diverting management’s attention and could materially harm our business.\n\nOur operating results could be harmed if we are unable to obtain timely deliveries of sufficient materials, components, or services of acceptable quality from sole or limited sources, or if the prices of materials, components, or services for which we do not have alternative sources increase.\n\nWe currently obtain materials, components, and services used in our products from limited or sole sources. We generally do not carry significant inventories of any raw materials. The reliance on a sole supplier, single qualified vendor, or limited number of suppliers could result in delivery or quality problems or reduced control over product pricing, reliability, and performance. For example, during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, COVID-19 driven component shortages and delays required us to source critical components from alternative sources and, in some cases, to design in alternative parts and qualify them with customers on short schedules. Because we often do not account for a significant part of our suppliers’ businesses, we may not have access to sufficient capacity from these suppliers in periods of high demand. In addition, since we generally do not have \n\n13\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nguaranteed supply arrangements with suppliers, we risk serious disruption to operations if an important supplier terminates product lines, changes business focus, or goes out of business, and we may need large end-of-life purchases when a sole source supplier is ceasing manufacturing of required components. Because some of these suppliers are located overseas, we may be faced with higher costs of purchasing these materials if the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, or if import tariffs are imposed on these materials. If we were to change any of our limited or sole source suppliers, we would be required to re-qualify each new supplier. Re-qualification could prevent or delay product shipments that could adversely affect results of operations and cash flows. In addition, reliance on these suppliers may adversely affect production if the components vary in quality or quantity. If we are unable to obtain timely deliveries of sufficient components of acceptable quality or if the prices of components for which we do not have alternative sources increase, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur products are complex and may take longer to develop and qualify than anticipated and we face lengthy sales and qualification cycles for our new products and, in many cases, must invest a substantial amount of time and money before we receive orders.\n\nWe regularly develop new products and use new technologies in these products. These products often take substantial time to develop because of the complexity, rigorous testing, and qualification requirements and because customer and market requirements can change during the product development or qualification process. Most of our products are tested by current and potential customers as part of the development and qualification process to determine whether they meet customer or industry specifications. The length of the qualification process, which can span a year or more, varies substantially by product and customer and, thus, can cause results of operations and cash flows to be unpredictable. During a given qualification period, we invest significant resources and allocate substantial production capacity to manufacture these new products prior to any commitment to purchase by customers. In addition, it is difficult to obtain new customers during the qualification period as customers are reluctant to expend the resources necessary to qualify a new supplier if they have one or more existing qualified sources. If we are unable to meet applicable specifications or do not receive sufficient orders to profitably use allocated production capacity, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be adversely affected.\n\nHistorical and future budgets for operating expenses, capital expenditures, operating leases, and service contracts are based upon assumptions as to the future market acceptance of our products. Because of the lengthy lead times required for product development and the changes in technology that typically occur while a product is being developed, it is difficult to accurately estimate customer demand for any given product. If our products do not achieve an adequate level of customer demand, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be adversely affected.\n\nOur products are difficult to manufacture. Production could be disrupted and results of operations and cash flows could suffer if production yields are low as a result of manufacturing difficulties.\n\nWe manufacture many of our products in our own production facilities. Difficulties in the production process, such as contamination, raw material quality issues, human error, or equipment failure, could cause a substantial percentage of products to be nonfunctional. These problems may be difficult to detect at an early stage of the manufacturing process and are often time-consuming and expensive to correct. Lower-than-expected production yields may delay shipments or result in unexpected levels of warranty claims, either of which could adversely affect results of operations and cash flows. We have experienced difficulties in achieving planned yields in the past, particularly in pre-production and upon initial commencement of full production volumes, which have adversely affected gross margins. Because the majority of our manufacturing costs are fixed, achieving planned production yields is critical to results of operations and cash flows. Changes in manufacturing processes required as a result of changes in product specifications, changing customer needs, and the introduction of new product lines could significantly reduce manufacturing yields, resulting in low or negative margins on those products. In addition, transitioning to automation in certain manufacturing processes could result in manufacturing delays or significantly reduce manufacturing yields.\n\nManufacturing yields depend on a number of factors, including the stability and manufacturability of the product design, manufacturing improvements gained over cumulative production volumes, the quality and consistency of component parts, and the nature and extent of customization requirements by customers. Higher volume demand for more mature designs requiring less customization generally results in higher manufacturing yields than products with lower volumes, less mature designs, and requiring extensive customization. Capacity constraints, raw materials shortages, logistics issues, the introduction of new product lines and changes in customer requirements, manufacturing facilities, or processes or those of third-party component suppliers have historically caused, and may in the future cause, significantly reduced manufacturing yields, negatively impacting the gross margins on, and production capacity for, those products. Our ability to maintain sufficient manufacturing yields is particularly important with respect to certain products we manufacture, as a result of the long manufacturing process. \n\n14\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nMoreover, an increase in the rejection and rework rate of products during the quality control process before, during, or after manufacture would result in lower yields, gross margins, and production capacity. Finally, manufacturing yields and margins can also be lower if we receive and inadvertently use defective or contaminated materials from suppliers.\n\nWe also have substantial risk of interruption in manufacturing resulting from fire, natural disaster, equipment failures, acts of government, or similar events, because we manufacture most of our products using few facilities, and do not have back-up facilities available for manufacturing these products. We could also incur significant costs to repair or replace products that are defective and, in some cases, costly product redesigns and/or rework may be required to correct a defect. Additionally, any defect could adversely affect our reputation and result in the loss of future orders.\n\nSome of the capital equipment used in the manufacture of our products have been developed and made specifically for us, may not be readily available from multiple vendors, and would be difficult to repair or replace if they were to become damaged or stop working. If any of these suppliers were to experience financial difficulties or go out of business, or if there were any damage to, or a breakdown of manufacturing equipment at a time when we are manufacturing commercial quantities of our products, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected.\n\nIf we do not keep pace with rapid technological change, our products may not be competitive.\n\nWe compete in markets that are characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions, changes in customer requirements, evolving industry standards, continuous improvement in products, and the use of our existing products in new applications. We may not be able to develop the underlying core technologies necessary to create new products and enhancements to our existing products at the same rate as or faster than competitors, to develop products that effectively compete with competitors’ products used in new applications or to license the technology from third parties that is necessary for our products. Product development delays may result from numerous factors, including:\n\n•changing product specifications and customer requirements;\n\n•unanticipated engineering complexities;\n\n•expense reduction measures we have implemented and others we may implement;\n\n•difficulties in hiring and retaining necessary technical personnel; and\n\n•difficulties in allocating engineering resources and overcoming resource limitations.\n\nWe cannot be certain that we will be able to identify, develop, manufacture, market, or support new or enhanced products successfully, if at all, or on a timely, cost effective, or repeatable basis. Future performance will depend on successful development and introduction of, as well as market acceptance of, new and enhanced products that address market changes, as well as current and potential customer requirements and ability to respond effectively to product announcements by competitors, technological changes, or emerging industry standards. Because it is generally not possible to predict the amount of time required and the costs involved in achieving certain research, development, and engineering objectives, actual development costs may exceed budgeted amounts and estimated product development schedules may be extended. If we are unable to develop, manufacture, market, or support new or enhanced products successfully, or incur budget overruns or delays in research and development efforts, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be adversely affected.\n\nIncreased spending to develop and improve technology may adversely impact financial results.\n\nWe may increase research and development and/or capital expenditures and expenses above our historical run-rate model in order to attempt to improve existing technology and develop new technology. Increasing investments in research and development of technology could cause our cost structure to fall out of alignment with demand for our products, which would have a negative impact on financial results. If we are unable to fund these types of expenditures, we may be unable to improve technology or develop new technologies, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Further, our research and development programs may not produce successful results, and our new products and services may not achieve market acceptance, create additional revenue, or become profitable, which could materially harm our business, prospects, financial results, and liquidity.\n\nThe competitive and rapidly evolving nature of our industries and pressure from competitors with greater resources has in the past resulted in and is likely in the future to result in reductions in our product prices and periods of reduced demand for our products.\n\n15\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nWe face substantial competition from a number of companies, many of which have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, and technical resources than we do. Larger-sized competitors often spend more on research and development, which could give those competitors an advantage in meeting customer demands and introducing technologically innovative products before we do. We expect that existing and new competitors will continue to improve the design of their existing products and will introduce new products with enhanced performance characteristics.\n\nThe introduction of new products and more efficient production of existing products by competitors have resulted, and are likely in the future to result in, price reductions, increases in expenses, and reduced demand for our products. In addition, competitors may be willing to provide their products at lower prices, accept a lower profit margin, or spend more capital in order to obtain or retain business. These competitive forces could diminish our market share and gross margins, resulting in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\nNew competitors may also enter our markets, including some current and potential customers who may attempt to integrate their operations by producing their own components or acquiring a competitor, thereby reducing demand for our products. In addition, rapid product development cycles, increasing price competition due to maturation of technologies, the emergence of new competitors with lower cost structures, and industry consolidation resulting in competitors with greater financial, marketing, and technical resources could result in lower prices or reduced demand for our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\nExpected and actual introductions of new and enhanced products may cause customers to defer or cancel orders for existing products and may cause our products to become obsolete. A slowdown in demand for existing products ahead of a new product introduction could result in a write-down in the value of inventory on hand related to existing products. We have in the past experienced a slowdown in demand for existing products and delays in new product development and such delays may occur in the future. To the extent customers defer or cancel orders for existing products due to a slowdown in demand or in anticipation of a new product release, or if there is any delay in development or introduction of our new products or enhancements of our products, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected.\n\nCustomer demand is difficult to forecast and, as a result, we may be unable to optimally match production with customer demand.\n\nWe make planning and spending decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, personnel needs and other resource requirements, based on estimates of customer demand. While customers generally provide us with their demand forecasts, they are typically not contractually committed to buy any quantity of products beyond firm purchase orders. The short-term nature of customer commitments and the possibility of unexpected changes in demand for their products limit the ability to accurately predict future customer demand. On occasion, customers have required rapid increases in production, which has strained resources. We may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet the volume demands of customers, or one or more suppliers may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our volume demands. Conversely, a downturn in the markets in which our customers compete can cause, and in the past has caused, customers to significantly reduce the amount of products ordered from us or to cancel existing orders, leading to lower utilization of our facilities. Because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed, reduction in customer demand would have an adverse effect on gross margin, results of operations, and cash flow. During an industry downturn, there is also a higher risk that a larger portion of trade receivables would be uncollectible. In addition, certain arrangements with component vendors require us to purchase minimum quantities of components within specific time periods, which could cause us to hold excess inventories of these components during periods concurrent with a decrease in customer demand for our products.\n\nA failure to attract and retain managerial, technical, and other key personnel could reduce revenue and operational effectiveness.\n\nFuture success depends, in part, on the ability to attract and retain certain key personnel, including scientific, operational, financial, and managerial personnel. In addition, technical personnel represent a significant asset and serve as the source of our technological and product innovations. The competition for attracting and retaining key employees (especially scientists, technical personnel, senior managers, and executives) is intense. Because of this competition for skilled employees, we may be unable to retain existing personnel or attract additional qualified employees in the future to keep up with business demands and changes, and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected. The risks involved in recruiting and retaining these key personnel may be increased by our historical lack of profitability, the volatility of our stock price, and the perceived effect of previously implemented reductions in workforce and other cost reduction efforts.\n\n16\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nOur ability to achieve operational and material cost reductions and to realize production efficiencies for operations is critical to long-term profitability.\n\nWe have implemented a number of operational and material cost reductions and productivity improvement initiatives, which are intended to reduce our cost structure at both the cost of revenue and the operating expense levels. Cost reduction initiatives often involve the re-design of our products, which requires customers to accept and qualify the new designs, potentially creating a competitive disadvantage for our products. These initiatives can be time-consuming, disruptive to operations, and costly in the short-term. Successfully implementing these and other cost-reduction initiatives throughout operations is critical to future competitiveness and ability to achieve long-term profitability. However, we cannot be certain that these initiatives will be successful in creating profit margins sufficient to sustain our current operating structure and business.\n\nOur products may contain defects that could cause us to incur significant costs, divert management’s attention, result in a loss of customers, and result in product liability claims.\n\nOur products are complex and undergo quality testing and formal qualification by customers and us. However, defects may occur from time to time. Customer’ testing procedures involve evaluating our products under likely and foreseeable failure scenarios and over varying amounts of time. For various reasons, such as the occurrence of performance problems that are unforeseeable in testing or that are detected only when products age or are operated under peak stress conditions, our products may fail to perform as expected long after customer acceptance. Failures could result from faulty components or design, problems in manufacturing, or other unforeseen reasons. For the majority of our products, we provide a product warranty of one year or less from the date of shipment. As a result, we could incur significant costs to repair or replace defective products under warranty, particularly when such failures occur in installed systems. We have experienced failures in the past and will continue to face this risk going forward, as our products are widely deployed throughout the world in multiple demanding environments and applications. In addition, we may in certain circumstances, honor warranty claims after the warranty has expired or for problems not covered by warranty in order to maintain customer relationships. Any significant product failure could result in product recalls, product liability claims, lost future sales of the affected product, and other products, as well as customer relations problems, litigation, and damage to our reputation.\n\nIn addition, our products are typically embedded in, or deployed in conjunction with, customers’ products, which incorporate a variety of components, modules, and subsystems and may be expected to interpolate with modules and subsystems produced by third parties. As a result, not all defects are immediately detectable and when problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. These problems may cause us to incur significant damages or warranty and repair costs, divert the attention of engineering personnel from product development efforts, and cause significant customer relations problems or loss of customers, all of which would harm our business. The occurrence of any defects in products could also give rise to liability for damages caused by such defects. Although we carry product liability insurance to mitigate this risk, insurance may not adequately or entirely cover costs that may arise from defects in products or otherwise, nor will it protect us from reputational harm that may result from such defects. Costs incurred in connection with product recalls or warranty or product liability claims may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\nShifts in industry-wide demands and inventories could result in significant inventory write-downs.\n\nThe life cycles of some products depend heavily upon the life cycles of the end products into which our products are designed. Products with short life cycles require us to manage production and inventory levels closely. We evaluate ending inventories on a quarterly basis for excess quantities, impairment of value, and obsolescence. This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand based upon input received from customers, sales team, and management. If inventories on hand are in excess of demand, or if they are generally greater than 12 months old, appropriate write-downs may be recorded. In addition, we write off inventories that are considered obsolete based upon changes in customer demand, manufacturing process changes that result in existing inventory obsolescence, or new product introductions which eliminate demand for existing products. Remaining inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of manufacturing cost or net realizable market value.\n\nIf future demand or market conditions are less favorable than estimates, inventory write-downs may be required. We cannot be certain that obsolete or excess inventories, which may result from unanticipated changes in the estimated total demand for our products and/or the estimated life cycles of the end products into which our products are designed, will not affect us beyond the inventory charges that we have already taken.\n\nThe types of sales contracts we use in the markets we serve subject us to unique risks in each of those markets.\n\n17\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nFor most of our products, we do not have long-term supply contracts with customers and typically sell our products pursuant to purchase orders with short lead times, and even where we do have long-term supply contracts, customers are typically not obligated to purchase any minimum amount of our products. As a result, in most cases customers could stop purchasing our products at any time, and we must fulfill orders in a timely manner to keep them satisfied.\n\nRisks associated with an absence of long-term purchase commitments with customers include the following:\n\n•customers can stop purchasing our products at any time without penalty;\n\n•customers may purchase products from competitors; and\n\n•customers are not required to make minimum purchases.\n\nThese risks are increased by the fact that our customers include large, sophisticated companies that have considerable purchasing power and control over their suppliers. If we are unable to fulfill these orders in a timely manner, it is likely that we will lose sales and customers.\n\nThe majority of our development contracts are for a fixed price, and fixed price development work inherently has more uncertainty than production contracts and, therefore, entails more variability in estimates of the cost to complete the work. Many of these development programs have very complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise, we may experience schedule delays and adverse cost impacts, which could increase estimated cost to perform the work, either of which could adversely affect results of operations. Some fixed price development contracts include initial production units in their scope of work. Successful performance of these contracts depends on the ability to meet production specifications and delivery rates. If we are unable to meet these contract requirements, revenue from these contracts could be reduced through the incorporation of liquidated damages, the contract could be terminated for default, and we could be subject to other financially significant consequences. We use our best judgment to estimate the cost to perform the work and the price we will eventually be paid on fixed price development programs. While we believe the cost and price estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, future events could result in unfavorable adjustments to those estimates which in turn would adversely affect results of operations.\n\nWe are subject to risks associated with the availability and coverage of insurance.\n\nFor certain risks, we do not maintain insurance coverage because of cost or availability. Because we retain some portion of our insurable risks, and in some cases self-insure completely, unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\nRisks Related to International Sales and Operations\n\nWe previously had operations in China withrespect to our Broadband business, which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in China.\n\nIn an effort to keep costs down, we previously operated certain logistic functions with respect to our Broadband business in China, which operations were sold in connection with the Broadband transaction. Our previous China based activities were subject to greater political, legal, and economic risks than those faced by our other operations. In particular, the political, legal, and economic climate in China (both at the national and regional levels) is extremely volatile and unpredictable. We may be adversely affected by changes in, or any previous failure to comply with, Chinese laws and regulations, such as those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, intellectual property, labor and employment laws, and other matters. Moreover, the enforceability of applicable existing Chinese laws and regulations is uncertain. For example, since Chinese administrative and court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory and contract terms, it may be more difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection we would receive. In addition, protections of intellectual property rights and confidentiality in China may not be as effective as in the U.S. or other countries or regions. All of these uncertainties could limit the legal protections available to us and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.\n\nAlso, if we are found to be, or to have been, in violation of Chinese laws or regulations governing technology import and export, the relevant regulatory authorities have broad discretion in dealing with such violations, including, but not limited to, issuing a warning, levying fines, restricting us from benefiting from these technologies inside or outside of China, confiscating our earnings generated from the import or export of such technology or even restricting our future import and export of any technology.\n\n18\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nWe are required to pay income taxes in China subject to certain tax relief. In the event that we become subject to any increased taxes or new forms of taxation imposed by authorities in China, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\n\nWe have significant international sales, which expose us to additional risks and uncertainties.\n\nFor the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, sales to customers located outside the U.S. and Canada accounted for approximately 23% and 7%, respectively, of consolidated revenue, with revenue assigned to geographic regions based on customers’ billing address. Sales to customers in Europe represent the majority of international sales. We believe that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of revenue as we seek international expansion opportunities. In addition, certain sales to customers with a U.S. billing address may be physically shipped to a location outside of the U.S. International sales and operations are subject to a number of material risks, including, but not limited to:\n\n•political and economic instability or changes in U.S. government policy with respect to the foreign countries where customers are located may inhibit export of products and limit potential customers’ access to U.S. dollars in a country or region in which those potential customers are located;\n\n•we may experience difficulties in enforcing legal contracts or the collecting of foreign accounts receivable in a timely manner and we may be forced to write off these receivables;\n\n•tariffs and other barriers may make our products less cost competitive or may reduce gross margin on these products;\n\n•the laws of certain foreign countries may not adequately protect our trade secrets and intellectual property or may be burdensome to comply with;\n\n•potentially adverse tax consequences to customers may damage cost competitiveness;\n\n•customs, import/export, and other regulations of the countries in which we do business may adversely affect our business;\n\n•different technical standards or requirements, such as country or region specific requirements to eliminate the use of lead, which we may incorporate into certain products, could prevent us from selling these products in these regions;\n\n•currency fluctuations may make our products less cost competitive, affecting overseas demand for our products or otherwise adversely affecting our business; and\n\n•language and other cultural barriers may require us to expend additional resources competing in foreign markets or hinder the ability to effectively compete.\n\nNegative developments in one or more countries or regions in which we operate or sell our products could result in a reduction in demand for our products, the cancellation or delay of orders already placed, difficulties in producing and delivering our products, threats to our intellectual property, difficulty in collecting receivables, or a higher cost of doing business, any of which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. In addition, we may be exposed to legal risks under the laws of the countries outside the U.S. in which we do business, as well as the laws of the U.S. governing our business activities in those other countries, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”).\n\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property Rights, Litigation, and Cybersecurity\n\nFailure to obtain or maintain the right to use certain intellectual property may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\nOur industries are characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. From time to time we have received, and may receive in the future, notice of claims of infringement of other parties’ proprietary rights and licensing offers to commercialize third party patent rights. Numerous patents in our industries are held by others, including competitors and certain academic institutions. Competitors may seek to gain a competitive advantage, or other third parties may seek an economic return on their intellectual property portfolios, by making infringement claims against us. We cannot be certain that:\n\n•infringement claims (or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims) will not be asserted against us or that such claims will not be successful;\n\n•future assertions will not result in an injunction against the sale of infringing products, which could require us to cease the manufacture, use or sale of the infringing products, processes, or technology and expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, adversely affecting our business, results of operations, and cash flows;\n\n•any patent owned or licensed by us will not be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged; or\n\n•we will not be required to obtain licenses or pay substantial damages for past, present, and future use of the infringing technology, the expense of which may adversely affect results of operations and cash flows.\n\n19\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nFor example, in June 2018, Phoenix commenced an arbitration against us with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in New York and a special proceeding against us in the New York Supreme Court, Commercial Division. In June 2019, an interim award (the “Interim Award”) was issued in connection with certain of the claims in the AAA proceeding and in October 2019, the arbitrator issued a Modified Partial Final Award, which incorporated by reference the terms of the Interim Award and ordered and awarded, among other items, (a) an award to Phoenix of attorneys’ fees and costs in the amount of approximately $3.8 million, (b) an award to Phoenix of $1.0 million in damages owing for unpaid royalties through June 30, 2019, (c) an award to Phoenix of $0.1 million in prejudgment interest, calculated at the New York statutory rate of 9% simple interest; and (d) payment to Phoenix of a royalty of 7.5% of the sale price on (i) future customer payments for certain EMCORE product contracts entered into prior to the Interim Award and (ii) customer payments for future sales of any product using any of the five trade secret subparts deemed in the Interim Award to have been misappropriated by EMCORE (collectively, the “Deemed Trade Secrets”), in each case payable in a single lump sum within one month of completion of the calendar quarter in which payment has been received from the customer, subject to certain limitations, until such time as EMCORE has in good faith determined, and can so document, that it has completely ceased use of the Deemed Trade Secrets.\n\nIn addition, effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign jurisdictions. Litigation, which could result in substantial cost and diversion of resources, may be necessary to defend our rights or defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others. In certain circumstances, our intellectual property rights associated with government contracts may be limited.\n\nIf we fail to protect, or incur significant costs in defending, our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, our business and results of operations could be materially harmed.\n\nSuccess depends to a significant degree on the ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, and unfair competition laws, as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions, to establish and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. We have applied for patent registrations in the U.S. and selected international jurisdictions, most of which have been issued. We cannot guarantee that pending applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities. Moreover, existing and future patents and trademarks may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary rights or may be held invalid or unenforceable in court. Failure to obtain patent registrations or a successful challenge to our registrations in the U.S. or other foreign countries may limit the ability to protect the intellectual property rights that these applications and registrations are intended to cover.\n\nWe also attempt to protect our intellectual property, including our trade secrets and know-how, through the use of trade secret and other intellectual property laws, as well as contractual provisions. We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees and independent consultants. We also use non-disclosure agreements with other third parties who may have access to our proprietary technologies and information. Such measures, however, provide only limited protection, and we cannot be certain that our confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements will not be breached, especially after employees end their employment or engagement with us or with them, and that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known by competitors or that we will have adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of proprietary information. Unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer our products or portions of our products, otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property, or may independently develop similar or equivalent trade secrets or know-how. If we fail to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, or if such intellectual property and proprietary rights are infringed or misappropriated, we could lose our competitive advantage and our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially harmed.\n\nPolicing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation, unauthorized use, or other infringement of our intellectual property rights. Further, we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights from misappropriation or other infringement in foreign countries where we have not applied for patent protections, and where effective patent, trademark, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws may be unavailable, or may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as U.S. law.\n\nIn the future, we may need to take legal actions to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or from otherwise gaining access to our technology. Protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights and determining their validity and scope could result in significant litigation costs and require significant time and attention from our technical and management personnel, which could significantly harm our business. The availability of financial resources may limit the ability to commence or defend such litigation. In addition, we may not prevail in such proceedings. An adverse outcome of such proceedings may reduce our competitive advantage or otherwise harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\n20\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nWe may be obligated to indemnify customers and vendors for claims that our intellectual property infringes the rights of others, which may result in substantial expense to us.\n\nWe may be required to indemnify customers or vendors for intellectual property claims made against them for products incorporating our technology. As such, claims against customers and vendors may require us to incur substantial expenses, such as legal expenses, damages for past infringement, or royalties for future use. Future indemnity claims could adversely affect business relationships and result in substantial costs to us.\n\nWe face certain litigation risks that could harm our business.\n\nWe may become subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in or outside the ordinary course of business. The results of legal proceedings are difficult to predict. Moreover, complaints that may be filed against us may not specify the amount of damages that plaintiffs seek, and we therefore may be unable to estimate the possible range of damages that might be incurred should these lawsuits be resolved against us. If any litigation is resolved against us, we could be subject to substantial damages. Thus, an unfavorable outcome or settlement of one or more lawsuits may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Even if litigation is not resolved against us, the uncertainty and expense associated with unresolved lawsuits could seriously harm our business, financial condition, and reputation. Litigation is costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to normal business operations.\n\nCosts of defending litigation have been significant in the past, may continue, and may not be covered by our insurance policies. The defense of litigation could also result in diversion of management’s time and attention away from business operations, which could harm our business.\n\nWe could be subject to legal consequences if we fail to comply with the Modified Partial Final Award issued in connection with the Phoenix legal proceedings.\n\nIn the Interim Award incorporated by reference into the Modified Partial Final Award the arbitrator determined and ordered that we are required to pay Phoenix a royalty of 7.5% of the sale price on (a) future customer payments for certain of our product contracts previously entered into at the time the Interim Award was issued and (b) customer payments for future sales of any product using any Deemed Trade Secret, in each case payable in a single lump sum within one month of completion of the calendar quarter in which payment has been received from the customer, and we are required to concurrently submit to Phoenix a written report that sets forth the calculation of the amount of the royalty payment in a form similar to previous royalty reports, provided that following the first $1.0 million of royalty payments on our EMP-1 product only, inclusive of payments made to date, we are required to pay to Phoenix a royalty of 2.25% of the sale price (net of any warranty work, returns, rebates, discounts, or credits) with respect to subsequent sales of our EMP-1 product. We are required to continue to make royalty payments in this manner until such time as we have in good faith determined, and can so document, that we have completely ceased use of the Deemed Trade Secrets, and must provide notice of this determination to Phoenix. It is possible that additional legal proceedings will follow in connection with delivery of this notice to Phoenix, which would require us to incur additional costs and divert management’s attention. If we fail to comply with these obligations, we could be subject to additional claims, penalties, or judgments, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, we could be subject to significant legal costs and expenses in connection with the interpretation of certain of the obligations pursuant to the Interim Award, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\nOur business and operations could be adversely impacted in the event of a failure or security breach of our information technology infrastructure.\n\nWe rely upon the capacity, reliability, and security of our information technology hardware and software infrastructure and the ability to expand and update this infrastructure in response to changing needs. We are constantly updating our information technology infrastructure. Although we have a disaster recovery plan, any failure to manage, expand, and update our information technology infrastructure or any failure in the operation of this infrastructure could harm our business. In addition, we may be subject to a heightened risk of potential security breaches due to our sales to, and work with, government customers and the technologies that we develop for the defense industry.\n\nThe secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business and reputation. Despite implementation of security measures, systems are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks, worms, and other malicious software programs or other attacks, covert introduction of malware to computers and networks, unauthorized access, including impersonation of unauthorized users, efforts to discover and exploit any security vulnerabilities or securities weaknesses, and other similar disruptions. These types of attacks have increased, in general, as more businesses implement \n\n21\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nremote working environments. Our business is also subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism by third parties as well as intentional and unintentional acts by employees or other insiders with access privileges. Customers’ network and storage applications may be subject to similar disruptions. It is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused by such incidents. Data breaches and any unauthorized access or disclosure of information, employee information, or intellectual property could compromise our intellectual property, trade secrets, and other sensitive business information, any of which could result in legal action against us, exposure of our intellectual property to competitors, damages, fines, and other adverse effects. A data security breach could also lead to public exposure of personal information of employees, customers, and others. Any such theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased security costs or costs related to defending legal claims.\n\nCyber-attacks, such as computer viruses, or other forms of cyber terrorism, may disrupt access to our network or storage applications. Such disruptions could result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or delays or interruptions in the production or shipment of products. Data security breaches involving data center customers could affect their financial condition and ability to continue to purchase our products. In addition, cyber-attacks may cause us to incur significant remediation costs, result in product development delays, disrupt key business operations, and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. These incidents could also subject us to liability, expose us to significant expense, and cause significant harm to our reputation and our business.\n\nIn addition, our technology infrastructure and systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, and telecommunications failures. Our products contain sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that may contain security problems, security vulnerabilities, or defects in design or manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that could interfere with the intended operation of our products. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our technology infrastructure, systems, or data or inappropriate disclosure of confidential information or sensitive or personal information, it could harm relationships with customers and other third parties and damage our brand and reputation and our business. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\n\nWe may be subject to theft, loss, or misuse of personal data about employees, customers, or other third parties, which could increase expenses, damage our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings.\n\nThe theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. Global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex compliance regulatory environment. Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant. In addition, inadvertent failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others or cause us to incur penalties or other significant legal liability or change business practices.\n\nRisks Related to Governmental Regulation\n\nWe could be subject to legal and regulatory consequences if we fail to comply with applicable export control laws and regulations.\n\nExports of certain products are subject to export controls imposed by the U.S. government and administered by the U.S. Departments of State and Commerce. In certain instances, these regulations may require pre-shipment authorization from the administering department. For products subject to the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) administered by the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security, the requirement for a license is dependent on the type and end use of the product, the final destination, the identity of the end user, and whether a license exception might apply. Virtually all exports of products subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) administered by the Department of State’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, require a license.\n\nObtaining necessary export licenses can be difficult and time-consuming. Failure to obtain necessary export licenses could significantly reduce revenue and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We could be subject to investigation and potential regulatory consequences, including, but not limited to, a no-action letter, monetary penalties, debarment from government contracting, or denial of export privileges and criminal sanctions, any of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Compliance with U.S. government regulations may also subject us to significant fees and expenses, including legal expenses, and require us to expend \n\n22\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nsignificant time and resources. Finally, the absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position.\n\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation, and failure to comply with applicable regulations could subject us to penalties that may restrict the ability to conduct business.\n\nAs a contractor and/or subcontractor to the U.S. government, we are subject to and must comply with various government regulations that impact revenue, operating costs, profit margins, and the internal organization and operation of our business. The most significant regulations and regulatory authorities affecting the portion of our business related to U.S. government contracts include the following:\n\n•the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement, and other supplemental agency regulations which comprehensively regulate the formation and administration of, and performance under, U.S. government contracts;\n\n•the Truth in Negotiations Act which requires certification and disclosure of all factual cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations;\n\n•the False Claims Act and the False Statements Act which impose penalties for payments made on the basis of false facts provided to the government and on the basis of false statements made to the government, respectively; and\n\n•the FCPA which prohibits U.S. companies from providing anything of value to a foreign official to help obtain, retain, or direct business, or obtain any unfair advantage.\n\nFailure to comply with applicable regulations, rules and approvals, or misconduct by any employee, could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, the loss of government contracts, or suspension or debarment from contracting with the U.S. government generally, any of which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We are also subject to certain regulations of comparable government agencies in other countries, and failure to comply with these non-U.S. regulations could also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\nOur business related to government contracts subjects us to additional risks.\n\nWe believe that for the foreseeable future the growth of our Inertial Navigation product line will depend, to a certain degree, on the ability to win government contracts and subcontracts, in particular from the Department of Defense. Many government customers are subject to budgetary constraints and our continued performance under these contracts or subcontracts, or award of additional contracts or subcontracts from these agencies, could be jeopardized by spending reductions, including constraints on government spending imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011 and its subsequent amendments, budget cutbacks at these agencies, or government shutdowns. The funding of U.S. government programs is uncertain and dependent on continued congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds based on an annual budgeting process. We cannot be certain that current levels of congressional funding for our products and services will continue and that our business related to these products will not decline or increase at currently anticipated levels, or that we will not be subject to delays in the negotiation of contracts or increased costs due to changes in the funding of U.S. government programs or government shutdowns. A significant decline in government expenditures generally, or with respect to programs for which we provide products, could adversely affect our business and prospects. In addition, U.S. government contracts generally permit the government to terminate the contract without prior notice, at the government’s convenience, or for default based on performance. Government customers can also decline to exercise previously disclosed contract options. A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and adversely affect our ability to obtain future contracts and orders. Furthermore, on contracts for which we are a subcontractor and not the prime contractor, the U.S. government could terminate the prime contract for convenience or otherwise, irrespective of our performance as a subcontractor. Also, sales to the U.S. government and its contractors as well as foreign military and government customers, either directly or as a subcontractor to other contractors, often use a competitive bidding process and have unique purchasing and delivery requirements, which often makes the timing of sales to these customers unpredictable.\n\nIn addition, our business could be adversely affected by a negative audit or investigation by the U.S. government. U.S. government agencies, primarily the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Defense Contract Management Agency, routinely audit and investigate government contractors. These agencies review a contractor’s performance under its contracts, cost structure, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards. These agencies also may review the adequacy of, and a contractor’s compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor’s purchasing, quality, accounting, property, estimating, compensation, and management information systems. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific cost reimbursement contract will not be reimbursed, while such costs already reimbursed must be refunded. If an audit or investigation of our business were to uncover improper or illegal activities, then we could be subject to \n\n23\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\ncivil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government. We could experience serious harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety or illegal acts were made against us, even if the allegations were inaccurate. In addition, responding to governmental audits or investigations may involve significant expense and divert management attention. Moreover, if any administrative processes and business systems are found not to comply with the applicable requirements, we may be subject to increased government scrutiny or required to obtain additional governmental approvals that could delay or otherwise adversely affect the ability to compete for or perform contracts. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows may be adversely affected.\n\nThe costs of compliance with state, federal, and international legal and regulatory requirements, such as environmental, labor, trade, and tax regulations, and customers’ standards of corporate citizenship could increase operating costs.\n\nWe are subject to environmental and health and safety laws and regulations and must obtain certain permits and licenses relating to the use of hazardous materials in production activities. If control systems are unsuccessful in preventing a release of these materials into the environment or other adverse environmental conditions or human exposure occurs, we could experience interruptions in operations and incur substantial remediation and other costs or liabilities. We are also subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations related to safety, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes, the purpose of which are to protect the health and safety of workers. Failure to comply with OSHA requirements and other related state regulations, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements, and monitoring and control of occupational exposure to regulated substances, could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and financial condition if we are subjected to significant penalties, fines, or compliance costs. In addition, certain foreign laws and regulations place restrictions on the concentration of certain hazardous materials, including, but not limited to, lead, mercury, and cadmium, in our products. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to future liabilities or result in the limitation or suspension of the sale or production of our products. These regulations include the EU’s Restrictions on Hazardous Substances and Directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment. Failure to comply with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations may limit the ability to export products to the EU and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, we purchase certain chemicals from Europe and Asia that are unique, nearing the end of life, and could be subject to future changes to environmental regulations in the country of origin and/or the U.S. In the event new restrictions are placed on any such chemicals, they may be difficult to replace, and may require us to re-design or re-validate existing products that use such chemicals in their production.\n\nIn connection with compliance with such environmental laws and regulations, as well as compliance with industry environmental initiatives, the standards of business conduct required by some customers, and commitment to sound corporate citizenship in all aspects of our business, we could incur substantial compliance and operating costs and be subject to disruptions to operations. In addition, in recent years, there has been increased media scrutiny and associated reports focusing on a potential link between working in semiconductor manufacturing clean room environments and certain illnesses, primarily different types of cancers. Regulatory agencies and industry associations have begun to study the issue to see if any actual correlation exists. Because we utilize clean rooms, we may become subject to liability claims. These reports may also affect the ability to recruit and retain employees. If we were found to be in violation of environmental and safety regulations laws or noncompliance with industry initiatives or standards of conduct, we could be subject to government fines or liabilities owed to customers, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\nIn addition, climate change is a significant topic of discussion and potential regulatory activity and has generated and may continue to generate federal or other regulatory responses in the near future. If we or component suppliers fail to timely comply with applicable legislation, customers may refuse to purchase products or we may face increased operating costs as a result of taxes, fines, or penalties, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has commenced a program to evaluate the security of certain chemicals which may be of interest to terrorists, including chemicals utilized by us. This evaluation may lead to regulations or restrictions affecting the ability to utilize these chemicals or the costs of doing so.\n\nWe are subject to anti-corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the FCPA. Failure to comply with these laws could result in penalties which could harm our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\nWe are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business and/or other benefits, along with various other anti-corruption \n\n24\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nlaws. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure that we, our employees, and other intermediaries comply with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws to which we are subject, we cannot be certain that such policies or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability under the FCPA or other laws for actions taken by employees and other intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we may acquire.\n\nWe export products for sale internationally. This puts us in frequent contact with persons who may be considered “foreign officials” under the FCPA, resulting in an elevated risk of potential FCPA violations. If we are not in compliance with the FCPA and other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities (including local laws), we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws by U.S. or foreign authorities could harm our reputation and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\nWe have identified a material weakness in our system of internal controls over financial reporting and have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2023. If we fail to properly remediate the material weakness or any future deficiencies or material weaknesses or to maintain proper and effective internal controls, material misstatements in our financial statements could occur and impair our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements and could adversely affect investor confidence in our financial reports, which could negatively affect our business.\n\nWe are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. These provisions provide for the identification of material weaknesses or other lesser deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, which is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nIn connection with the preparation of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, we identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\n\nAs more fully described in [Item 9A. ](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_148)[“Controls and Procedures](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_148)[”](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_148), we determined that communications with regard to internal control objectives were not effective to require employees to report the existence of new or novel arrangements for technical accounting review, which resulted in our failure to design and implement effective controls over such transactions. \n\nThe control deficiency resulted in a material error associated with identification of the existence of certain insurance premium and supplier financing agreements, whereby (i) certain items on our consolidated balance sheet were underreported in “Other current assets” with a consistent dollar amount underreported for “Financing payable” within our consolidated balance sheet and (ii) certain items on our consolidated statements of cash flows were underreported in payments to financing payables within “Cash flows from financing activities” and similar such underreporting of such items in other assets in “Cash flows from operating activities”. This error has been corrected in the consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, and as a result, this material weakness did not result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements previously filed or included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although we have identified and are implementing actions intended to improve the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures as more fully described in [Item 9A. “Controls and Procedures”](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_148), and will continue to do so until such remediation is complete, there is no assurance that the actions we take will remediate the material weakness. \n\nWe can give no assurance that additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future. Any failure to remediate the material weakness, or the development of new material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, could result in material misstatements in our financial statements. We cannot be certain that the improvement measures taken will ensure adequate controls over financial processes and reporting in the future. Any failure to implement required, new, or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm operating results or cause us to fail to meet reporting obligations. This could cause us to fail to meet our reporting and financial obligations, which in turn could have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require significant resources to correct the material weaknesses or deficiencies, subject us to fines, penalties or judgments, or harm our reputation.\n\nInadequate internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have an adverse effect on the trading price of our equity securities. Further, the impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on the Board of Directors or as executive officers, which could harm our business.\n\n25\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nOur internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, failure or interruption of information technology systems, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed and the Company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations.\n\nWe could be required to record an impairment charge as a result of changes to assumptions used in our impairment testing.\n\nWe have substantial long-lived assets recorded on the balance sheet. If we make changes in our business strategy or if market or other conditions adversely affect business operations, we may be forced to record an impairment charge related to these assets, which would adversely impact results of operations. Impairment assessment inherently involves judgment as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions. Future events and changes in market conditions, underlying business operations, competition, or technologies may impact assumptions as to prices, costs, holding periods, or other factors that may result in changes in estimates of future cash flows. Although we believe the assumptions we used in testing for impairment are reasonable, we will continue to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of definite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment on an ongoing basis, and test indefinite-lived intangible assets annually or more frequently as indicated, and significant changes in any one assumption could produce a significantly different result. In such a circumstance, we may incur substantial impairment charges, which would adversely affect financial results. In any period where our stock price, as determined by market capitalization, is less than book value, this too could indicate a potential impairment and we may be required to record an impairment charge in that period.\n\nCompliance with regulations related to conflict minerals and other regulations with respect to our supply chains could increase costs and affect the manufacturing and sale of our products.\n\nPublic companies are required to disclose the use of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold (collectively, “conflict minerals”) mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries (the “covered countries”) if a conflict mineral(s) is necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by us. We may determine, as part of compliance efforts, that certain products or components we obtain from suppliers contain conflict minerals. If we are unable to conclude that all products are free from conflict minerals originating from covered countries, this could have a negative impact on our business, reputation, and/or results of operations. We may also encounter challenges to satisfy customers who require that products be certified as conflict free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage. Compliance with these rules could also affect the sourcing and availability of some of the minerals used in the manufacture of products or components we obtain from suppliers, including the ability to obtain products or components in sufficient quantities and/or at competitive prices. Certain customers are requiring additional information from us regarding the origin of raw materials and complying with these customer requirements may cause us to incur additional costs. Our supply chain is complex and we may be unable to verify the origins for all metals used in products.\n\nIn addition, the U.S. federal government has issued policies for federal procurement focused on eradicating the practice of forced labor and human trafficking, and the United Kingdom and the State of California have issued laws that require us to disclose our policy and practices for identifying and eliminating forced labor and human trafficking in our supply chain. Several customers, as well as the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition, have also issued expectations to eliminate these practices that may impact us. While we have a policy and management systems to identify and avoid these practices in our supply chain, we cannot guarantee that suppliers will always be in conformance to these laws and expectations. We may face enforcement liability and reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently meet these expectations. Moreover, we are likely to encounter challenges with customers if we cannot satisfy their forced and trafficked labor polices and they may choose a competitor’s product.\n\nWe may undergo an “ownership change”within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code, which could affect our ability to offset U.S. federal income tax against our net operating losses and certain of our tax credit carryovers.\n\nIn September 2023, our Board of Directors adopted the Section 382 Tax Benefits Preservation Plan to diminish the risk that we could experience an “ownership change” as defined in Section 382 (“Section 382”) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), which could substantially limit or permanently eliminate our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryovers (collectively, the “NOLs”) to reduce potential future income tax obligations. Under the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Treasury Department, these NOLs may be “carried forward” in certain circumstances to offset any current and future taxable income and thus reduce federal income tax liability, subject to certain requirements and restrictions. While the amount and timing of our future taxable income cannot be predicted with any certainty and, accordingly, \n\n26\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nwe cannot predict the amount of these NOLs that will ultimately be used to reduce its income tax liability, to the extent that the NOLs do not otherwise become limited, these NOLs could be a potentially valuable asset to us. As of September 30, 2023, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $391.5 million.\n\nIn general, under Section 382, an “ownership change” occurs if a shareholder or a group of shareholders who are deemed to own at least 5% of a company’s stock individually or collectively increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. If an ownership change occurs, Section 382 would impose an annual limit on the amount of the Company’s NOLs that can be used to offset the Company’s federal taxable income equal to the product of the total value of the Company’s outstanding equity immediately prior to the ownership change (reduced by certain items specified in Section 382) and the federal long-term tax-exempt interest rate in effect for the month of the ownership change. A number of complex rules apply to calculating this annual limit and there are several special rules that, depending on the rule involved, may apply to reduce or increase such limit. If we were to undergo one or more “ownership changes” within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code, our NOLs and certain of our tax credits existing as of the date of each ownership change may be unavailable, in whole or in part, to offset U.S. federal income tax resulting from our operations or any gains from the disposition of any of our assets and/or business, which could result in increased U.S. federal income tax liability. While we periodically monitor our NOLs and currently believe that an ownership change that would impair the value of its NOLs has not occurred, the complexity of Section 382’s provisions and the limited knowledge any public company has about the ownership of its publicly traded stock make it difficult to determine whether an ownership change has in fact occurred. Furthermore, there is no assurance that we will be able to fully utilize our NOLs and we may be required to record an additional valuation allowance related to the amount of the NOLs that may not be realized.\n\nThe Section 382 Tax Benefits Preservation Plan is intended to act as a deterrent to any person or group acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.99% or more of our outstanding common stock without the approval of the Board of Directors. A person who acquires, without the approval of the Board of Directors, beneficial ownership (other than as a result of repurchases of stock by the Company, dividends or distributions by the Company or certain inadvertent actions by shareholders) of 4.99% or more of the outstanding common stock (including any ownership interest held by that person’s Affiliates and Associates as defined under the Section 382 Tax Benefits Preservation Plan) could be subject to significant dilution. Although the Section 382 Tax Benefits Preservation Plan is intended to reduce the likelihood of an “ownership change” that could adversely affect us, there is no assurance that the restrictions on transferability in the rights plan will prevent all transfers that could result in such an “ownership change”. The Section 382 Tax Benefits Preservation Plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or could discourage a third party from acquiring, our Company or a large block of our common stock. A third party that acquires 4.99% or more of our common stock could suffer substantial dilution of its ownership interest under the terms of the Section 382 Tax Benefits Preservation Plan through the issuance of common stock or common stock equivalents to all shareholders other than the acquiring person. The foregoing provisions may adversely affect the marketability of our common stock by discouraging potential investors from acquiring our stock. In addition, these provisions could delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors and could make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us, or impede an attempt to acquire a significant or controlling interest in us, even if such events might be beneficial to us and our shareholders. \n\nCertain provisions of New Jersey law and our governing documents may make a takeover of our Company difficult even if such takeover could be beneficial to shareholders.\n\nCertain provisions of our organizational documents and New Jersey law could discourage potential acquisition proposals, delay, or prevent a change in control of the Company, or limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of common stock. For example, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws:\n\n•provide that directors may be removed at any time, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors cast at a meeting of shareholders called for that purpose;\n\n•provide that a super majority vote of shareholders is required to amend some portions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, including requiring approval by the holders of 80% or more of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors for certain business combinations unless these transactions meet certain fair price criteria and procedural requirements or are approved by two-thirds of continuing directors;\n\n•authorize the issuance of preferred stock, without any requirement of vote or class vote of shareholders, commonly referred to as “blank check” preferred stock, which shares of preferred stock may have rights senior to those of common stock;\n\n•limit the persons who can call special shareholder meetings; shareholders do not have authority to call a special meeting of shareholders;\n\n27\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\n•establish advance notice requirements that must be complied with by shareholders to nominate persons for election to the Board of Directors or to propose matters that can be acted on by shareholders at shareholder meetings;\n\n•do not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors; and\n\n•provide for the filling of vacancies on the Board of Directors by action of 66 2/3% of the directors and not by the shareholders.\n\nThese and other provisions in our organizational documents could allow the Board of Directors to affect the rights of shareholders in a number of ways, including making it difficult for shareholders to replace members of the Board of Directors. Because the Board of Directors is responsible for approving the appointment of members of the management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt to replace the current management team. These provisions could also limit the price that investors would be willing to pay in the future for shares of common stock. We may in the future adopt other measures that may have the effect of delaying or discouraging an unsolicited takeover, even if the takeover were at a premium price or favored by a majority of unaffiliated shareholders. Certain of these measures may be adopted without any further vote or action by shareholders and this could depress the price of our common stock.\n\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\nIf we fail to satisfy all applicable Nasdaq continued listing requirements, including the $1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement, our common stock may be delisted from Nasdaq, which could have an adverse impact on the liquidity and market price of our common stock.\n\nOur common stock is currently listed on Nasdaq, which has qualitative and quantitative continued listing requirements, including corporate governance requirements, public float requirements, and a $1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement. Our common stock price is currently and may in the future be below the minimum bid price for continued listing on Nasdaq. On June 23, 2023, we received a letter (the “Notification Letter”) from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC stating that we were not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirements set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) because our common stock failed to maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days, and that to regain compliance, the closing bid price of our common stock must be at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days at any time prior to December 20, 2023. On September 18, 2023, we applied to transfer our securities to The Nasdaq Capital Market, as allowed under Nasdaq rules, and on December 21, 2023, Nasdaq granted such request and a corresponding extension of the date by which we must regain compliance such that in order to regain compliance, the closing bid price of our common stock must be at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days at any time prior to June 17, 2024. While the Notification Letter has no immediate effect on the listing or trading of our common stock on Nasdaq, we intend to actively monitor the bid price for our common stock between now and June 17, 2024 and will consider available options to resolve the deficiency and regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, such as a reverse stock split. If our common stock is delisted, it would likely have an adverse effect on the liquidity of our common stock, decrease the market price of our common stock, result in the potential loss of confidence by investors, suppliers, customers, and employees, and fewer business development opportunities, and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for our continuing operations.\n\nOur business and results of operations may continue to be negatively impacted by general economic and financial market conditions and market conditions in the industries in which we operate, and such conditions may increase the other risks that affect our business.\n\nIn recent years, the world’s financial markets have experienced significant turmoil, resulting in reductions in available credit, increased costs of credit, extreme volatility in security prices, potential changes to existing credit terms, and rating downgrades of investments. These conditions have and may continue to materially and adversely affect the market conditions in the industries in which we operate and cause many customers to reduce their spending plans, leading them to draw down their existing inventory, and reduce orders for our products, which, in turn, may adversely impact our revenues. We cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery, worldwide or within our industries. It is possible that adverse macroeconomic developments, including inflation, slowing growth or recession, and rising interest rates, could result in further setbacks, and that these customers, or others, could as a result, significantly reduce their capital expenditures, draw down their inventories, reduce production levels of existing products, defer introduction of new products, or place orders and accept delivery for products for which they do not pay us due to their economic difficulties or other reasons. If any of these events occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be adversely affected. Management continues to evaluate the impact of macroeconomic events, including inflation, on our business and our future plans and intends to take appropriate measures to help alleviate their impact, but there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. A weak or declining economy could also strain our suppliers, possibly resulting in supply \n\n28\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\ndisruption, or cause our customers to delay making payments for our products. A severe or prolonged economic downturn, such as the global financial crisis, could also reduce our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. \n\nFurther, the funding of the defense programs that incorporate our products and services is subject to the overall U.S. government budget and appropriation decisions and processes, which are driven by numerous factors beyond our control, including geo-political, macroeconomic, public health and political conditions. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of adverse economic conditions in the United States and other countries, but the longer the duration or the greater the severity, the greater the risks we face in operating our business. The near-term potential for recessionary economic conditions and possible stagflation (persistent high inflation and stagnant economic demand) presents increased risks to our business.\n\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events could have an adverse effect on our business.\n\nNatural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, and floods, could adversely affect operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to one or more facilities, the temporary closure of one or more facilities or those of our suppliers, a temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market, a temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers, a temporary disruption in the transportation of goods from overseas, and delays in the delivery of goods. Public health issues, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, whether occurring in the U.S. or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or customers, or have an adverse impact on customer demand. As a result of any of these events, we may be required to suspend operations in some or all locations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. These events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to receive products from suppliers. Although we maintain business interruption insurance and other insurance intended to cover some of these risks, such insurance may be inadequate, whether because of coverage amount, policy limitations, the financial viability of the insurance companies issuing such policies, or other reasons.\n\nWe may not pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, the only opportunity to achieve a return on an investment in our common stock may be an increase in the price of our common stock.\n\nWe may not pay dividends in the future. The terms of our loan and security agreement with our financial institution restrict our ability to pay dividends. Consequently, the only opportunity to achieve a return on an investment in our common stock may be through an increase in the market price of our common stock over the price paid, of which there is no guarantee.\n\n***\n\nThe risks above are not the only risks we face. If any of the events described in our risk factors actually occur, or if additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial materialize, then our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially affected.\n\nITEM 1B.

Over the last five years, we have expanded our scale and portfolio of inertial sensor products through the acquisitions of Systron Donner Inertial, Inc. (“SDI”) in June 2019, the Space and Navigation business of L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (“S&N”) in April 2022, and the FOG and Inertial Navigation Systems business of KVH Industries, Inc. (“EMCORE Chicago”) in August 2022. Our multi-year transition from a broadband company to an inertial navigation company has now been completed following the sale of our cable TV, wireless, sensing and defense optoelectronics business lines and the shutdown of our chips business line and indium phosphide wafer fabrication operations.\n\nWe have fully vertically-integrated manufacturing capability at our headquarters in Alhambra, CA, and at our facilities in Budd Lake, NJ, Concord, CA, and Tinley Park, IL. These facilities support our manufacturing strategy for Fiber Optic Gyroscope (“FOG”), Ring Laser Gyro (“RLG”), Photonic Integrated Chip (“PIC”), and Quartz Micro Electro-Mechanical System (“QMEMS”) products for inertial navigation. Our manufacturing facilities maintain ISO 9001 quality management certification, and we are AS9100 aerospace quality certified at our facilities in Alhambra, CA, Concord, CA, and Budd Lake, NJ. Our best-in-class components and systems support a broad array of inertial navigation applications. \n\nOur operations include wafer fabrication (lithium niobate and quartz), device design and production, fiber optic module and subsystem design and manufacture, and PIC-based and QMEMS-based component design and manufacture. Many of our manufacturing operations are computer-monitored or controlled to enhance production output and statistical control. Our manufacturing processes involve extensive quality assurance systems and performance testing.\n\nWe have one reporting segment, Inertial Navigation, whose product technology categories include: (a) FOG, (b) QMEMS, (c) RLG, in each case which serve the aerospace and defense market.\n\nRecent Developments\n\nDivestiture to Photonics Foundries\n\n31\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nOn October 11, 2023, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), by and among us, Photonics Foundries, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“PF”), and Ortel LLC a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of PF (the “Buyer”), pursuant to which (i) we agreed to transfer to the Buyer, and Buyer agreed to assume, substantially all of the assets and liabilities primarily related to our cable TV, wireless, sensing and defense optoelectronics business lines (the “Businesses”), including with respect to employees, contracts, intellectual property and inventory, and (ii) Buyer agreed to provide a limited license back to us of the patents being sold to the Buyer (the “Divestiture Transaction”). The Divestiture Transaction excludes our chip business, indium phosphide wafer fabrication facilities and all assets not primarily related to the Businesses. The signing and closing of the Divestiture Transaction occurred simultaneously, except with respect to our assets located in China. On November 30, 2023, we transferred to the Buyer, and the Buyer assumed, substantially all of the assets and liabilities of each of our subsidiaries in China. \n\nIn connection with the Divestiture Transaction, the parties entered into a transition services agreement pursuant to which we will provide certain migration and transition services to facilitate an orderly transaction of the operation of the Businesses to the Buyer in the 12-month period following consummation of the Divestiture Transaction, and we and the Buyer entered into a sublease pursuant to which we will sublease to the Buyer one of our buildings (occupying approximately 12,500 square feet) at our Alhambra, California facility for the 12-month period immediately following the closing of the Divestiture Transaction without payment of rent. With respect to the Buyer’s assumption of that certain Manufacturing Supply Agreement, dated August 9, 2021 (as amended, the “Fastrain Manufacturing Agreement”), by and among the Company, Shenzhen Fastrain Technology Co., Ltd., Hong Kong Fastrain Company Limited, and Fastrain Technology Malaysia SDN. BHD (collectively, “Fastrain”), we (i) made a payment to Fastrain in the amount of approximately $0.4 million immediately prior to the closing of the Divestiture Transaction and (ii) provided a guaranty of PF’s and the Buyer’s obligations with respect to payment of certain long-term liabilities that were originally agreed to and set forth in the Fastrain Manufacturing Agreement and assigned to PF and the Buyer in the Divestiture Transaction, in an aggregate amount expected to equal up to approximately $5.5 million, approximately $4.2 million of which will not become payable, if at all, until January 2026, provided that if such guaranty is exercised by Fastrain, we will have the right to require the Buyer to reassign to us all intellectual property assigned to the Buyer in the Divestiture Transaction and we will have the right to recover damages from PF and the Buyer.\n\nAugust 2023 Equity Offering\n\nOn August 23, 2023, we closed our offering of 22,600,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $0.50 per share, and, to certain investors, pre-funded warrants (each, a “Pre-Funded Warrant”) to purchase 11,900,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $0.49999999 for each Pre-Funded Warrant (which represents the per share public offering price for our common stock in such offering less the $0.00000001 per share exercise price for each such Pre-Funded Warrant), resulting in net proceeds to us from the offering, after deducting the placement agent commissions and other offering expenses, of approximately $15.6 million. The shares were sold by us pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement, dated as of August 17, 2023, between us and the Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC as the sole managing underwriter.\n\nRestructuring\n\nIn April 2023, we initiated a restructuring program that includes the strategic shutdown of our Broadband business segment (including our cable TV, wireless, sensing and chips product lines) and the discontinuance of our defense optoelectronics product line. Our Board of Directors performed a thorough review of a number of factors including the competitive landscape, declining revenue and gross profit of these discontinued businesses, the current and expected profitability of these discontinued businesses, our cost structure, and our strategic focus on our Inertial Navigation business segment, and concluded that these discontinued businesses are non-strategic, currently unsustainable, and cannot be restructured in a way that will allow us to achieve profitable growth and cash preservation. During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Broadband business segment and defense optoelectronics product line were considered as held for sale based upon (i) the existence of an executed non-binding letter of intent with respect to the Divestiture Transaction as described above as of such date and (ii) in consideration of ongoing negotiations for the sale of the chips business. Given the prospective sale of the Broadband business segment and defense optoelectronics product line we have identified these asset groups as discontinued operations during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. We discontinued operations of our chips business and indium phosphide wafer fabrication facility during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. As a result of this restructuring and the Divestiture Transaction, we (i) have eliminated approximately 70 positions in the U.S. (primarily in Alhambra, California) and approximately 30 positions in China, collectively representing approximately 22% of our total workforce, (ii) expect to consolidate facility space by reducing the space used at our Alhambra campus from five to two buildings (including closure of our indium phosphide wafer fabrication facility in Alhambra) and relocating personnel in Concord, California to the operations area from the adjacent office building, and (iii) have transferred our manufacturing support and engineering center in China pursuant to the Divestiture Transaction, collectively representing an approximately 25% reduction in the aggregate square footage occupied by our facilities. One-time employee severance and termination costs related to the restructuring of approximately $2.3 million were incurred in, and are presented in the loss from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. We \n\n32\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nanticipate that cash and non-cash charges will be incurred and recorded in future reporting periods and we may incur additional expenses in connection with this restructuring that are not currently contemplated. The charges that we expect to incur in connection with the restructuring are estimates and subject to a number of assumptions, and actual results may differ materially.\n\nFebruary 2023 Equity Offering\n\nOn February 17, 2023, we closed our offering of 15,454,546 shares of our common stock at a price of $1.10 per share, resulting in net proceeds to us from the offering, after deducting the placement agent commissions and other offering expenses, of $15.4 million. The shares were sold by us pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of February 17, 2023, between the Company and each purchaser named in the signature pages thereto and a Placement Agency Agreement, dated as of February 15, 2023, by and between the Company and A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners.\n\nAcquisition of KVH Industries, Inc. FOG and Inertial Navigation Systems Business\n\nOn August 9, 2022, we completed the acquisition of the KVH Industries, Inc. (“KVH”) FOG and Inertial Navigation Systems business (“EMCORE Chicago”) pursuant to that certain Asset Purchase Agreement entered into as of August 9, 2022 by and among the Company, Delta Acquisition Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and KVH, pursuant to which we acquired substantially all of KVH’s assets and liabilities primarily related to the segment, including property interests in the Tinley Park facility located at 8412 West 185th St., Tinley Park, Illinois (the “Tinley Park Facility”), for aggregate consideration of approximately $55.0 million, exclusive of transaction costs and expenses and subject to certain post-closing working capital adjustments.\n\nTinley Park Sale and Leaseback Transaction\n\nOn December 13, 2022, EMCORE Chicago consummated the sale of its real property interest in the Tinley Park Facility to 8400 W 185TH STREET INVESTORS, LLC (the “Tinley Park Buyer”), resulting in net proceeds of approximately $10.3 million. The sale was made pursuant to the terms of that certain Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Tinley Park Purchase Agreement”) dated as of November 1, 2022, by and between EMCORE Chicago and HSRE Fund VII Holding Company, LLC, an affiliate of the Tinley Park Buyer. In connection with the sale of the real property interests in the Tinley Park Facility, after considering multiple transaction structures, EMCORE Chicago entered into a long-term Single-Tenant Triple Net Lease (the “Lease Agreement”) with Buyer pursuant to which EMCORE Chicago leased back the Tinley Park Facility for a twelve (12) year term commencing on December 13, 2022, unless earlier terminated or extended in accordance with the terms of the Lease Agreement.\n\nWingspire Credit Agreement\n\nOn August 9, 2022, the Company and EMCORE Space & Navigation Corporation, our wholly-owned subsidiary (“S&N”), entered into that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of August 9, 2022, among the Company, S&N, the lenders party thereto and Wingspire Capital LLC, as administrative agent for the lenders (“Wingspire”), as amended pursuant to that First Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of October 25, 2022, among the Company, S&N, EMCORE Chicago Inertial Corporation, our wholly-owned subsidiary (together with the Company and S&N, the “Borrowers”), the lenders party thereto and Wingspire, to add EMCORE Chicago as a Borrower and include certain of its assets in the borrowing base (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement provides for two credit facilities: (a) an asset-based revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $40.0 million, subject to a borrowing base consisting of eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory (subject to certain reserves), and (b) a term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $5,965,000. The proceeds of the loans made under the Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement will mature on August 8, 2025, and will bear interest, at a rate per annum equal to term SOFR plus a margin of (i) 3.75% or 5.50% in the case of revolving loans, depending on the applicable assets corresponding to the borrowing base pursuant to which the applicable loans are made and (ii) 5.50% in the case of term loans. In addition, the Borrowers will be responsible for the Agent’s annual collateral monitoring fees as well as the lenders’ fees and expenses. The Borrowers may also be required to pay an unused line fee of 0.50% in respect of the undrawn portion of the revolving commitments, which is generally based on average daily usage of the revolving facility during the immediately preceding month.\n\nThe Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties, reporting and other affirmative covenants, and negative covenants that are generally customary for credit facilities of this type. Among others, the Credit Agreement contains various covenants that, subject to agreed-upon exceptions, limit the Borrowers’ and their respective subsidiaries’ ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, enter into swap agreements, make loans, acquisitions and investments, change the nature of their business, acquire or sell assets or consolidate or merge with or into other persons or entities, declare or pay dividends or make other restricted payments, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into \n\n33\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nburdensome agreements, change fiscal year, amend organizational documents, and use proceeds to fund any activities of or business with any person that is the subject of governmental sanctions. In addition, the Credit Agreement requires that, for any period commencing upon the occurrence of an event of default or excess availability under the Credit Agreement being less than the greater of $5.0 million and 15% of the revolving commitments until such time as no event of default is continuing and excess availability under the Credit Agreement is at least the greater of $5.0 million and 15% of the revolving commitments for a period of 60 consecutive days, the Borrowers satisfy a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.10:1.00. The Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default, the occurrence of which, following any applicable grace period, would permit the lenders to, among other things, declare the principal, accrued interest and other obligations of the Borrowers under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable, and exercise rights and remedies available to the lenders under the Credit Agreement or applicable law or equity.\n\nIn connection with the Credit Agreement, the Borrowers entered into a pledge and security agreement pursuant to which the obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured on a senior secured basis (subject to permitted liens) by substantially all assets of the Borrowers and substantially all assets of any future guarantors.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, an aggregate principal amount of $6.4 million was outstanding pursuant to the revolving credit facility and an aggregate principal amount of $4.2 million was outstanding pursuant to the term loan facility.\n\nAcquisition of L3Harris Space and Navigation Business\n\nOn April 29, 2022, we completed the previously announced acquisition of the L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (“L3H”) Space and Navigation business (“S&N”) pursuant to that certain Sale Agreement, dated as of February 14, 2022 (as amended, the “Sale Agreement”), entered into by and among the Company, Ringo Acquisition Sub, Inc. and L3H, pursuant to which we acquired certain intellectual property, assets, and liabilities of S&N for aggregate consideration of approximately $5.0 million, exclusive of transaction costs and expenses and subject to certain post-closing working capital adjustments. Following the completion of the working capital adjustments, the final purchase price was approximately $4.9 million.\n\nEconomic Conditions\n\nThe increased instability of global economic and inflationary risks are adding to the uncertainty of our business. These adverse conditions could result in longer sales cycles, increased costs to manufacture our products, and increased price competition. Given the dynamic nature of these macroeconomic conditions, we cannot reasonably estimate their full impact on our ongoing business, results of operations, and overall financial performance.\n\nOther Significant Actions that Affect the Comparability of Our Operating Results and Financial Condition\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements require us to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure at the date of our financial statements. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have an impact on our statement of operations. We believe that our accounting policies for goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets are the only estimates critical to an understanding and evaluation of our financial results for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, as discussed below. We develop estimates based on historical experience and on various assumptions about the future that are believed to be reasonable based on the best information available to us. The reported financial position or results of operations may be materially different under changed conditions or when using different estimates and assumptions, particularly with respect to significant accounting policies. In the event that estimates or assumptions prove to differ from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. We have other significant accounting policies that do not generally require subjective estimates or judgments or would not have a material impact on our results of operations. Our significant accounting policies are described in [Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_94).\n\nInventory\n\nInventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (first-in, first-out). Inventory that is expected to be used within the next twelve months is classified as current inventory. We write-down inventory once it has been determined that conditions exist that may not allow the inventory to be sold for its intended purpose or the inventory is determined to be excess or obsolete \n\n34\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nbased on assumptions about future demand and market conditions. The charge related to inventory write-downs is recorded as a cost of revenue. We evaluate inventory levels at least quarterly against sales forecasts on a significant part-by-part basis, in addition to determining its overall inventory risk. We have incurred, and may in the future incur, charges to write-down inventory.\n\nLong-Lived Intangible and Other Assets\n\nWe follow FASB ASC Topic 360, Property Plant, and Equipment (“ASC 360”). ASC 360 requires review of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of intangible assets with estimated lives and other long-lived assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If these comparisons indicate that an asset is not recoverable, we will recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds the related estimated fair value. Estimated fair value is based on either discounted future operating cash flows or appraised values, depending on the nature of the asset. \n\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, for the reporting unit formerly known as Aerospace & Defense, an indication of goodwill impairment (after electing to quantitatively test goodwill) was a trigger to test long-lived assets, and for the discontinued reporting unit formerly known as Broadband, the change in intended use of our leased facilities and right-of-use (ROU) assets due to the restructuring of our business led to reevaluating those retained asset groups. Recoverability of the long-lived assets was measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset groups to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset groups. The comparison indicated that certain of the asset groups was not recoverable, and an impairment of $1.4 million was recorded, as this was the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeded the related estimated fair value, which was based on discounted future operating cash flows.\n\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, there was a triggering event of negative cash flows and operating losses at the FOG asset group level within the Inertial Navigation product line of the A&D segment that indicated the carrying amounts of our long-lived assets may not have been recoverable. In accordance with ASC 360, with regard to our long-lived assets, we performed an undiscounted cash flow analysis and concluded that the carrying value of the asset group was not recoverable. Accordingly, we then performed an analysis to estimate the fair value of the other long-lived assets and recognized an impairment charge of $3.0 million against the FOG property, plant, and equipment for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group’s other long-lived assets exceeded their estimated fair value.\n\nGoodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets\n\nWe follow the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”). ASC 350 requires the completion of a goodwill impairment test and test of other indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually based on either an optional qualitative assessment (Step 0) or a quantitative analysis (Step 1) comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset to its carrying value as of the test date. \n\nDuring the quarter ended June 30, 2023, we elected to change our annual test date from December 31st of each year to July 1st of each year, unless there are indications requiring a more frequent impairment test. Any impairment charges are based on the quantitative (Step 1) analysis. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, we performed a qualitative analysis (Step 0) of goodwill at December 31, 2022 to meet the annual criteria, and after the change in annual test date to July 1st, we subsequently, at July 1, 2023 elected to proceed directly to a quantitative analysis (Step 1) of the Company's goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset related to a certain Company trademark.\n\nThe July 1, 2023 indefinite-lived intangible asset test included a certain Company trademark as of July 1, 2023. The quantitative (Step 1) analysis performed over such trademark utilized the relief from royalty method of the income approach to determine the fair value. It concluded that the carrying value of such trademark, which was $2.2 million, exceeded the fair value and impairment expense of $1.3 million was recorded. We performed a qualitative (Step 0) analysis over the in-process research and development (IPR&D) at July 1 2023. However, in the quarter ended September 30, 2023, it was determined that the Company would abandon the project underlying the remaining IPR&D and, as a result of this determination, the carrying value of $0.8 million was impaired during the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\nThe July 1, 2023 quantitative (Step 1) analysis of goodwill utilized a weighted income and market approach concluded that the carrying value of the reporting unit that carried the goodwill, including goodwill (adjusted for trademark impairment) was greater than the fair value of equity of the reporting unit, and impairment expense of $19.0 million was recorded.\n\n35\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nPurchase Accounting\n\nThe Company accounts for acquisitions of businesses under the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the Company records assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair value on the date of acquisition. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable net assets. Estimated fair values of acquired assets and liabilities are provisional and could change as additional information is received. When appropriate, our estimates of the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired include assistance from independent third-party valuation firms. Valuations are finalized as soon as practical, but not later than one year from the acquisition date. Any subsequent changes to purchase price allocations result in a corresponding adjustment to goodwill.\n\nInventory, long-lived assets, goodwill, and other intangible assets generally represent the largest components of our acquisitions. Inventory is valued utilizing net realizable value method. Property, plant, and equipment is valued utilizing a cost and market approach. Intangible assets are recognized at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition and generally consist of customer relationships, technology, in-process research and development (“IPR&D”), and trademarks. Determination of the estimated fair value of intangible assets requires judgment. The estimated fair value of technology, IPR&D, and trademarks, is determined utilizing the relief from royalty method. Under this form of income approach, a royalty rate based on observed market royalties is applied to projected revenue supporting the technology, IPR&D, and trademarks and discounted to present value. The estimated fair value of customer relationships is determined using the multiple period excess earnings method. Under this form of income approach, net cash flows attributable to the subject asset are typically calculated net of fair returns on and of all assets that are necessary to realize the cash flows. Cash flows of the subject intangible asset are charged amounts representing a return of and a return on these contributory assets (based on the fair values of the contributory assets).\n\nResults of Operations\n\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 is presented below. \n\nYear Ended September 30,  \n---  \n(in thousands, except percentages) | 2023 | 2022 | Change  \nRevenue | $ | 97,716  | $ | 45,318 | $ | 52,398  | 115.6  | %  \nCost of revenue | 74,323  | 41,252 | 33,071  | 80.2   \nGross profit | 23,393  | 4,066 | 19,327  | 475.3   \nOperating expense:  \nSelling, general, and administrative | 32,731  | 28,224 | 4,507  | 16.0   \nResearch and development | 17,910  | 13,782 | 4,128  | 30.0   \nImpairment | 22,612  | 2,956  | 19,656  | 665.0   \nSeverance | 27  | 140  | (113) | (80.7)  \nGain on sale of assets | (1,147) | —  | (1,147) | (100.0)  \nTotal operating expense | 72,133 | 45,102 | 27,031 | 59.9%  \nOperating loss | (48,740) | (41,036) | (7,704) | (18.8)%  \n  \nRevenue\n\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, revenue increased from the prior fiscal year primarily driven by the acquisitions of S&N and EMCORE Chicago. Together, S&N and EMCORE Chicago contributed to a full year of revenue, $67.0 million, in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 and only a partial year of revenue, $16.2 million, in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 which represented an increase of $50.8 million.\n\nGross Profit\n\nGross profit is revenue less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists of raw materials, compensation expense, depreciation, amortization, accretion expense, and other manufacturing overhead costs, expenses associated with excess and obsolete inventories, and product warranty costs. Historically, gross profit as a percentage of revenue, which we refer to as gross margin, has fluctuated significantly due to revenue and production volumes over fixed manufacturing costs, product mix, manufacturing yields, and inventory charges (e.g., scrap factors, excess and obsolete, inventory valuation adjustments).\n\n36\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, gross profit increased from the prior fiscal year primarily driven by higher product revenue. Gross margin also increased as a result of a more favorable product mix. \n\nSelling, General, and Administrative\n\nSelling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) consists primarily of personnel related expenditures for sales and marketing, IT, finance, legal, and human resources support functions.\n\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, SG&A increased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the acquisitions of S&N and EMCORE Chicago. Together, S&N and EMCORE Chicago contributed to a full year of SG&A expenses in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 and only a partial year of SG&A expenses compared to the prior period which represented an increase of $3.5 million.\n\nResearch and Development\n\nResearch and development (“R&D”) include personnel related expenditures, project costs, and facility-related expenses. We intend to continue to invest in R&D programs because they are essential to our future growth.\n\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, R&D expense increased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the acquisitions of S&N and Emcore Chicago. Together, S&N and EMCORE Chicago contributed to a full year of research and development expenses compared to the prior period which represented an increase of $5.2 million.\n\nImpairment charge\n\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, impairment charge totaled approximately $22.6 million as we wrote down goodwill of $19.0 million, trademarks of $1.3 million, IPR&D of $0.8 million and asset groups of $1.4 million.\n\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, impairment charge totaled approximately $3.0 million as we wrote down long-lived assets related to our FOG products as there was a triggering event of negative cash flows and operating losses at the FOG asset group level that indicated the carrying amounts of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable.\n\nSeverance\n\nFor the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, severance totaled approximately $27.0 thousand and $140.0 thousand, respectively, associated with headcount reductions, primarily at our Alhambra, CA facility. See [Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Recent Developments](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_46) under the heading “Restructuring” for discussion on severance expense related to discontinued operations.\n\nGain on Sale of Assets \n\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, gain on sale of assets totaled approximately $1.1 million, primarily related to the consummation of the sale of the real property interests in the Tinley Park Facility.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nWe have recently experienced significant losses from our operations and used a significant amount of cash in connection with strategic acquisitions to further our strategy of focusing on our Inertial Navigation business. As a result of our recent cash shortage, we have taken actions to manage our liquidity and will need to continue to manage our liquidity as we continue to restructure our operations to focus on our Inertial Navigation business. As of September 30, 2023, cash and cash equivalents totaled $26.7 million and net working capital totaled $63.6 million. Net working capital, calculated as current assets (including inventory) minus current liabilities, is a financial metric we use which represents available operating liquidity. \n\nWe have taken a number of actions to continue to support our operations and meet our obligations: \n\n•In August 2023, we closed our offering of 22,600,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $0.50 per share, and, to certain investors, Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase 11,900,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $0.49999999 for each Pre-Funded Warrant (which represents the per share public offering price for our common stock in such offering less the $0.00000001 per share exercise price for each such Pre-Funded Warrant), resulting in net proceeds to us from the offering, after deducting the placement agent commissions and other offering expenses, of approximately \n\n37\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\n$15.6 million. See [Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Recent Developments](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_52) under the heading “August 2023 Equity Offering” for additional information regarding the equity offering.\n\n•In April 2023, we initiated a restructuring program that includes the strategic shutdown of our Broadband business segment (including our cable TV, wireless, sensing, and chips product lines) and the discontinuance of our defense optoelectronics product line. Our Board of Directors performed a thorough review of a number of factors including the competitive landscape, declining revenue and gross profit of these discontinued businesses, the current and expected profitability of these discontinued businesses, our cost structure, and our strategic focus on our Inertial Navigation segment, and concluded that these discontinued businesses are non-strategic, currently unsustainable, and cannot be restructured in a way that will allow us to achieve profitable growth and cash preservation. During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Broadband business segment and defense optoelectronics product line were considered as held for sale based upon (i) the existence of an executed non-binding letter of intent with respect to the Divestiture Transaction as described above as of such date and (ii) in consideration of ongoing negotiations for the sale of the chips business.Given the prospective sale of the Broadband business segment and defense optoelectronics product line we have identified these asset groups as discontinued operations during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. We discontinued operations of our chips business and indium phosphide wafer fabrication facility during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. As a result of this restructuring and the Divestiture Transaction, we have eliminated approximately 75 positions in the U.S. (primarily in Alhambra, California) and approximately 25 positions in China, collectively representing approximately 22% of our total workforce, and expect to consolidate facility space by reducing the space used at our Alhambra campus from five to two buildings (including closure of our indium phosphide wafer fabrication facility in Alhambra), will relocate personnel in Concord, California to the operations area from the adjacent office building, and transferred our manufacturing support and engineering center in China pursuant to the Divestiture Transaction, collectively representing an approximately 25% reduction in the aggregate square footage occupied by our facilities. One-time employee severance and termination costs related to the restructuring of approximately $2.3 million was recognized in the loss from discontinued operations in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. We anticipate that material cash and non-cash charges will be incurred and recorded in future reporting periods and we may incur additional expenses in connection with the restructuring that are not currently contemplated. The charges that we expect to incur in connection with the restructuring are estimates and subject to a number of assumptions, and actual results may differ materially.\n\n•In February 2023, we closed our offering of 15,454,546 shares of our common stock at a price of $1.10 per share, resulting in net proceeds to us from the offering of $15.4 million. See [Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Recent Developments](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_52) under the heading “February 2023 Equity Offering” for additional information regarding the equity offering.\n\n•In December 2022, we consummated the sale of the real property interests in the Tinley Park Facility to the Tinley Park Buyer, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $10.3 million, pursuant to the terms of the Tinley Park Purchase Agreement.\n\n•In August 2022, we entered into the Credit Agreement with Wingspire that provides us with (a) an asset-based revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $40.0 million, subject to a borrowing base consisting of eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory (subject to certain reserves), and (b) a term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $5,965,000. As of September 30, 2023, an aggregate principal amount of $20.9 million was outstanding pursuant to the revolving credit facility and an aggregate principal amount of $4.2 million was outstanding pursuant to the term loan facility, and an additional $9.9 million was available for borrowing. See [Note 11 - Credit Agreement ](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_121) in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Credit Agreement.\n\nOur existing balances of cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and amounts expected to be available under the Credit Agreement, together with additional actions we may take to further reduce our expenses and/or additional funds we may receive if we elect to raise capital through additional debt or equity issuances or from our efforts to monetize certain assets, are anticipated to provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet cash requirements for operations, working capital, and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months from the issuance date of these financial statements. As a result, these financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. However, we may not be successful in executing on our plans to manage our liquidity, including recognizing the expected benefits from our restructuring described above, and our ability to continue to operate as a going concern could be impaired, which could in turn cause a significant decline in our stock price and could result in a significant loss of value for our shareholders.\n\nThe Credit Agreement subjects us to various financial and other affirmative and negative covenants with which we must comply on an ongoing or periodic basis. These include financial covenants pertaining to a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and covenants requiring the mandatory prepayment of amounts outstanding under the revolver under specified circumstances. The agreements also subject us to various restrictions on our ability to engage in certain activities, such as raising capital or acquiring businesses. These restrictions may limit or restrict our cash flow and our ability to pursue business opportunities or strategies that we would otherwise consider to be in our best interests. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains a cash dominion provision, requiring us to maintain a minimum amount of liquidity. As of September 30, 2023, this minimum amount \n\n38\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nof liquidity that we needed to maintain was $12.5 million. If we fall below this minimum amount of liquidity for a period of three consecutive days, or if there occurs an event of default under the Credit Agreement, then our lender can exercise certain rights, including taking control of our bank accounts and cash resources. In addition, if an event of default occurs under the Credit Agreement, our lenders can accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness under that agreement to make it due and payable immediately. If we trigger the cash dominion provision or if an event of default occurs under the Credit Agreement and if in either case our lenders elect to exercise their rights, we may not be able to pay our debts and other monetary obligations as they come due, and our ability to continue to operate as a going concern could be impaired, which could in turn cause a significant decline in our stock price and could result in a significant loss of value for our shareholders.\n\nWe continue to explore a range of options to further address our capitalization and liquidity. If we raise funds by issuing debt securities or incurring loans, this form of financing would have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. The availability and the terms under which we can borrow additional capital could be disadvantageous, and the terms of debt securities or borrowings could impose significant restrictions on our operations. Macroeconomic conditions and credit markets could also impact the availability and cost of potential future debt financing. If we raise capital through the issuance of additional equity, such sales and issuance would dilute the ownership interests of the existing holders of our common stock. There can be no assurances that any additional debt or equity financing would be available to us or if available, that such financing would be on favorable terms to us. In addition, if adequate funds are not available to fund our future operations or meet our Credit Agreement obligations, we may need to curb our business plans, which could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects and results of operations.\n\nCash Flow\n\nYear Ended September 30,  \n---  \n(in thousands, except percentages) | 2023 | 2022 | Change  \nNet cash used in operating activities (net of acquired assets and assumed liabilities) | $ | (30,270) | $ | (24,258) | $ | (6,012) | 24.8  |  %  \nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities | $ | 9,155  | $ | (62,940) | $ | 72,095  | 114.5  |  %  \nNet cash provided by financing activities | $ | 24,400  | $ | 15,200  | $ | 9,200  | 60.5  |  %  \n  \nOperating Activities\n\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, operating activities used cash of $30.3 million, primarily due to net loss of $49.4 million and adjustments for non-cash charges, including depreciation, amortization, and accretion expense of $4.8 million, stock-based compensation expense of $5.4 million, an impairment charge of $22.6 million offset by a gain on disposal of assets of $1.1 million. The change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of an increase in accounts receivable of $1.9 million, an increase in customer deposits of $3.7 million, and a decrease in accounts payable of $0.5 million, offset by a decrease in contract assets of $4.6 million, a decrease in inventory of $6.0 million, a decrease in other assets of $3.2 million, an increase in ROU liability of $0.9 million, and an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $0.3 million.\n\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, operating activities used cash of $24.3 million, primarily due to net loss of $40.8 million and adjustments for non-cash charges, including depreciation, amortization, and accretion expense of $1.7 million, stock-based compensation expense of $4.6 million, an impairment charge of $3.0 million, and changes in operating assets and liabilities (or working capital components) of $7.1 million. The change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of a decrease in accounts receivable of $1.6 million, a decrease in inventory of $2.4 million and an increase in accounts payable of $1.1 million, an increase in contract liabilities of $2.7 million, and increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $3.0 million, offset by an increase in contract assets of $2.7 million and a decrease in current operating lease liabilities of $0.4 million.\n\nInvesting Activities\n\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, cash provided by investing activities totaled $9.2 million, primarily due to $10.9 million from the disposal and purchase of property, plant and equipment, net.\n\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, investing activities used cash of $62.9 million, primarily due to $59.9 million used in our acquisitions of the S&N and EMCORE Chicago businesses and capital-related expenditures of $3.1 million.\n\nFinancing Activities\n\n39\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, financing activities provided cash of $24.4 million, primarily due to proceeds from sale of common stock, net of issuance costs, of $31.0 million, offset by payments to our line of credit of $3.5 million.\n\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, financing activities provided cash of $15.2 million, primarily due to proceeds from credit facilities of $22.7 million, offset by payments towards credit facilities of $7.2 million and taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards of $0.3 million.\n\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\n\nContractual obligations and commitments over the next five fiscal years are summarized in the table below and are presented as of September 30, 2023:\n\n(in thousands) | Total | Less Than a Year | 1 to 3 Years | 4 to 5 Years | Over 5 Years  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nPurchase obligations | $ | 27,375  | $ | 26,719  | $ | 646  | $ | 10  | $ | —   \nAsset retirement obligations | 4,194  | —  | 1,984  | —  | 2,210   \nOperating lease obligations | 39,589  | 4,614  | 7,209  | 5,587  | 22,179   \nPension obligations | 5,536  | 613  | 1,130  | 1,125  | 2,668   \nTotal contractual obligations and commitments | $ | 76,694  | $ | 31,946  | $ | 10,969  | $ | 6,722  | $ | 27,057   \n  \nInterest payments are not included in the contractual obligations and commitments table above since they are insignificant to consolidated results of operations. \n\nPurchase Obligations\n\nPurchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services as of September 30, 2023. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust requirements based on business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services. The purchase obligations of $27.4 million as of September 30, 2023, set forth above primarily relates to open purchase orders to our component suppliers, service partners, and other vendors.\n\nAsset Retirement Obligations\n\nWe have known conditional Asset Retirement Obligation (“ARO”) conditions, such as certain asset decommissioning and restoration of rented facilities to be performed in the future. ARO includes assumptions related to renewal option periods where we expect to extend facility lease terms. Revisions in estimated liabilities can result from revisions of estimated inflation rates, escalating retirement costs, and changes in the estimated timing of settling the ARO. See [Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_127) in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to ARO.\n\nOperating Lease Obligations\n\nOperating leases include non-cancelable terms and exclude renewal option periods, property taxes, insurance, and maintenance expenses on leased properties.

Description of Business\n\nWe are a leading provider of sensors and navigation systems for the aerospace and defense market. Over the last five years, EMCORE has expanded its scale and portfolio of inertial sensor products through the acquisitions of Systron Donner Inertial, Inc. (“SDI”) in June 2019, the Space and Navigation business of L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (“S&N”) in April 2022, and the FOG and Inertial Navigation Systems business of KVH Industries, Inc. (“EMCORE Chicago”) in August 2022. Our multi-year transition from a broadband company to an inertial navigation company has now been completed following the sale of our cable TV, wireless, sensing and defense optoelectronics business lines and the shutdown of our chips product line and indium phosphide wafer fabrication operations.\n\nWe have fully vertically-integrated manufacturing capability at our headquarters in Alhambra, CA, and at our facilities in Budd Lake, NJ, Concord, CA, and Tinley Park, IL. These facilities support our manufacturing strategy for Fiber Optic Gyroscope (“FOG”), Ring Laser Gyro (“RLG”), Photonic Integrated Chip (“PIC”), and Quartz Micro Electro-Mechanical System (“QMEMS”) products for inertial navigation. Our manufacturing facilities maintain ISO 9001 quality management certification, and we are AS9100 aerospace quality certified at our facilities in Alhambra, CA, Concord, CA, and Budd Lake, NJ. Our best-in-class components and systems support a broad array of inertial navigation applications. \n\nOur operations include wafer fabrication (lithium niobate and quartz), device design and production, fiber optic module and subsystem design and manufacture, and PIC-based and QMEMS-based component design and manufacture. Many of our manufacturing operations are computer-monitored or controlled to enhance production output and statistical control. Our manufacturing processes involve extensive quality assurance systems and performance testing.\n\nNOTE 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation \n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the assets, liabilities, shareholders’ equity, and operating results of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of, nor do we hold a significant variable interest in, any variable interest entity.\n\nDiscontinued Operations\n\nIn April 2023, we initiated a restructuring program that included the strategic shutdown of our Broadband business segment (including our cable TV, wireless, sensing and chips product lines) and the discontinuance of our defense optoelectronics product line. During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Broadband business segment and defense optoelectronics product line were considered as held for sale based upon (i) the existence of an executed non-binding letter of intent to sell our Broadband business segment (other than our chips product line) and our defense optoelectronics product line and (ii) in consideration of ongoing negotiations for the sale of the chips business. Given the prospective sale of the Broadband business segment and defense optoelectronics product line, we identified these asset groups as discontinued operations during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. We ceased operations of our chips business and indium phosphide wafer fabrication facility during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. In accordance with the authoritative guidance for discontinued operations (Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 205-20), the Company determined that these business lines met held-for sale and discontinued operations accounting criteria during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Accordingly, the Company classified the results of these business lines as discontinued operations in its consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. Additionally, the related assets and liabilities associated with these business lines were classified as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented. See [Note 16 — Discontinued Operations](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_1480) for additional information.\n\nOn October 11, 2023, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement to transfer substantially all of the assets and liabilities primarily related to the Company’s cable TV, wireless, sensing and defense optoelectronics business lines to Photonics Foundries, Inc. On October 24, 2023, the Company entered into a non-binding letter of intent with a buyer to sell substantially all of the assets and liabilities related to the Company’s chips business, including assets related to the Company’s indium phosphide wafer fabrication operations.\n\nGoing Concern Basis \n\n47\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nThe consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles assuming we will continue as a going concern. The going concern assumption contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern exists.\n\nWe have recently experienced significant losses from our operations and used a significant amount of cash, amounting to a net loss of $75.4 million and net cash outflows from operations of $30.3 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, and we expect to continue to incur losses and use cash in our operations as we continue to restructure our business. As a result of our recent cash outflows, we have taken actions to manage our liquidity and will need to continue to manage our liquidity as we continue to restructure our operations to focus on our Inertial Navigation business. As of September 30, 2023, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $26.7 million and we had $9.9 million available under our Credit Agreement (as defined in [Note ](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_121)[11](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_121)[ - Credit Agreement](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_121) in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nWe are evaluating the sufficiency of our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and amounts expected to be available under our Credit Agreement, together with additional actions we could take (including those\n\nmade in connection with our restructuring program announced in April 2023) to further reduce our expenses and/or potentially raising capital through additional debt or equity issuances, or from the potential monetization of certain assets. However, we may not be successful in executing on our plans to manage our liquidity, including recognizing the expected benefits from our previously announced restructuring program, or raising additional funds if we elect to do so, and as a result substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern exists.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. Such estimates include accounts receivable, inventories, goodwill, long-lived assets, product warranty liabilities, legal contingencies, income taxes, asset retirement obligations, and pension obligation, as well as the evaluation associated with the going concern determination.\n\nWe develop estimates based on historical experience and on various assumptions about the future that are believed to be reasonable based on the best information available to us. Our reported financial position or results of operations may be materially different under changed conditions or when using different estimates and assumptions, particularly with respect to significant accounting policies. In the event that estimates or assumptions prove to differ from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information.\n\nConcentration of Credit Risk\n\nFinancial instruments that may subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivable. When necessary, we perform credit evaluations on customers’ financial condition and occasionally we request deposits in advance of shipping product to customers. These financial evaluations require significant judgment and are based on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, current economic trends, historical payment patterns, bad debt write off experience, and financial review of the particular customer.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents consists primarily of bank deposits and highly liquid short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase.\n\nAccounts Receivable\n\nWe regularly evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to meet their financial obligations to us. The allowance is based on the age of receivables and a specific identification of receivables considered at risk of collection. We classify charges associated with the allowance for doubtful accounts as selling, general, and administrative expense.\n\nInventory\n\n48\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nInventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (first-in, first-out). Inventory that is expected to be used within the next 12 months is classified as current inventory. We write down inventory once it has been determined that conditions exist that may not allow the inventory to be sold for its intended purpose or the inventory is determined to be excess or obsolete based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions. The charge related to inventory write-downs is recorded as cost of revenue. We evaluate inventory levels at least quarterly against an estimate of future demand on a significant part-by-part basis, in addition to determining its overall inventory risk. We have incurred, and may in the future incur, charges to write-down of inventory. See [Note 6 - Inventory](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_106) in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to inventory.\n\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment\n\nProperty, plant, and equipment are recorded at cost. Plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We depreciate equipment over three to seven years, furniture and fixtures over five years, computer hardware and software over three to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the asset life or the lease term. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. The costs for major renewals and improvements are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives of the related asset. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of the assets are removed from the accounts upon disposition and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. See [Note 7 - Property, Plant, and Equipment, net](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_109) in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the impairment charge during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.\n\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\n\nIntangible assets of the Company that are considered to have an indefinite life include goodwill and a certain Company trademark. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. We follow the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”). ASC 350 requires the completion of a goodwill impairment test and test of other indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually based on either an optional qualitative assessment (Step 0) or a quantitative analysis (Step 1) comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset to its carrying value as of the test date.\n\nValuation of Long-lived Assets\n\nLong-lived assets consist primarily of intangible assets, net and property, plant, and equipment, net. Since long-lived assets are subject to amortization and depreciation/amortization, we review these assets for impairment in accordance with the provisions of ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment. Intangible assets that not considered to have an indefinite useful life are itemized in [Note 8 - Intangible Assets and Goodwill](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_112) and are amortized over their useful lives. We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment testing of long-lived assets consists of determining whether the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group is recoverable, in other words, whether the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group exceeds the carrying amount. The determination of the existence of impairment involves judgments that are subjective in nature and may require the use of estimates in forecasting future results and cash flows related to an asset or group of assets. In making this determination, we use certain assumptions, including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets, which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization, the length of service that assets will be used in operations, and estimated salvage values.\n\nLeases\n\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at its inception. Right of use (ROU) assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its estimated incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments considering the term of the lease, which is derived from information available at the lease commencement date. The lease term includes renewal options when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised, and excludes termination options. To the extent that the Company’s agreements have variable lease payments, the Company includes variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate and excludes those that depend on facts or circumstances occurring after the commencement date, other than the passage of time. Lease expense for these leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities that arise from short-term (12 months or less) leases for any class of \n\n49\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nunderlying asset. Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, current operating lease liabilities, and non-current operating lease liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.\n\nAsset Retirement and Environmental Obligations\n\nPursuant to ASC 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations, an ARO is recorded when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset and the fair value of the liability can reasonably be estimated. Upon initial recognition of an ARO, a company increases the carrying amount of the long-lived asset by the same amount as the liability. Over time, the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value through charges to operations costs. The initial capitalized costs are depleted over the useful lives of the related assets through charges to depreciation, and/or amortization. If the fair value of the estimated ARO changes, an adjustment is recorded to both the ARO and the asset retirement cost. Revisions in estimated liabilities can result from revisions of estimated inflation rates, escalating retirement costs, and changes in the estimated timing of settling ARO liabilities.\n\nPension Plan\n\nWith the acquisition of S&N, we acquired the assets and assumed the liabilities associated with a pension plan, now named the EMCORE Space & Navigation Corporation Pension Plan (the “Pension Plan”), which is a defined benefit pension plan providing postretirement benefits to certain employees. As of July 1, 2022, the Pension Plan was amended to freeze benefit plan accruals for participants.\n\nThe investments in the Pension Plan are measured at fair value using quoted market prices or the net asset value per share as a practical expedient. The projected benefit obligations associated with the Pension Plan are determined based on actuarial models utilizing mortality tables and discount rates applied to the expected benefit term.\n\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nWe determine the fair value of financial instruments in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. ASC Topic 820 (“ASC 820”), Fair Value Measurements, establishes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. This standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value:\n\n•Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\n•Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly, through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.\n\n•Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on assumptions used to measure assets or liabilities at fair value.\n\nClassification of an asset or liability within this hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value under ASC 820 must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\n\nCash and cash equivalents consists primarily of bank deposits or highly liquid short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase. Restricted cash represents cash temporarily reserved by the Company. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash are based on Level 1 measurements. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, contract assets, prepaid expenses, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and contract liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nTo determine the proper revenue recognition, we perform the following five steps: (a) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (b) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (c) determine the transaction price; (d) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (e) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy a performance obligation. We only apply the five step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the goods or services we transfer to the customer.\n\nThe majority of revenues are from product sales to customers pursuant to purchase orders. Revenues from product sales are recognized when the customer obtains control of our product, which occurs at a point in time. The Company has elected to \n\n50\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\naccount for shipping and handling activities as a fulfillment cost as permitted by the standard. When we perform shipping and handling activities after the transfer of control to the customer (e.g. when control transfers prior to delivery), they are considered fulfillment activities, and accordingly, the costs are accrued when the related revenue is recognized. We expense incremental costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that we would have recognized is one year or less.\n\nWe also enter into non-recurring engineering contracts. We recognize revenue for these arrangements over time or at a point in time depending on our evaluation of when the customer obtains control of the promised goods or services. For contracts that include multiple performance obligations, we allocate revenue to each performance obligation based on estimates of the relative standalone selling price that we would charge the customer for each promised product or service. \n\nIn addition, we follow the percentage of completion method of revenue recognition for the majority of our S&N revenue, as these contracts typically are for products specific to the customer and there is no alternative use for the product. We recognize revenue progressively as the customer takes control of the manufactured products built to customer specifications. Under these S&N manufacturing contracts with customers, the customer controls all of the work-in-progress as products are being built.\n\nIn certain instances, inventory is maintained by customers at consigned locations. Revenues from consigned sales are recognized when the customer obtains control of our product, which occurs at a point in time. This is typically when the customer pulls product for use.\n\nWe use a number of wholesale distributors around the world and recognize revenue when the wholesale distributor obtains control of our product, which occurs at a point in time, typically upon shipment. Wholesale distributors are contractually obligated to pay us on standard commercial terms, consistent with our end-use customers. We do not sell to wholesale distributors on consignment and do not give wholesale distributors a right-of-return.\n\nReceivables, Net\n\nReceivables, net, include amounts billed and currently due from customers. The amounts due are stated at their net estimated realizable value. Payments are generally due within 90 days or less of invoicing and do not include a significant financing component. We maintain an allowance for credit loss to provide for the estimated amount of receivables that will not be collected. The allowance is based upon an assessment of customer creditworthiness, historical payment experience, the age of outstanding receivables, and collateral to the extent applicable. \n\nContract Assets\n\nA contract asset is recognized when the Company has recognized revenue, but has not issued an invoice for payment. Contract assets are classified as current assets and transferred to receivables when the entitlement to payment becomes unconditional. The Company’s contract assets are generally converted to trade account receivables within 90 days, at which time the Company is entitled to payment of the fixed price upon delivery of the finished product subject to customer payment terms.\n\nContract Liabilities\n\nA contract liability is recognized when the Company has billed and received payment from a customer, but has not yet earned revenue. Contract liabilities are classified as current liabilities and transferred to revenue when revenue recognition standards have been met.\n\nRemaining Performance Obligations\n\nRemaining performance obligations represent the transaction price of firm orders for long-term contracts which control has not transferred to the customer. As of September 30, 2023, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $11.8 million. The Company expects to recognize revenue on the remaining performance obligations by fiscal year 2025.\n\nProduct Warranty Reserves\n\nWe provide customers with warranty claims for certain products and warranty-related services are not considered a separate performance obligation. Pursuant to ASC 450, Contingencies, we make estimates of product warranty expense using historical experience rates and accrue estimated warranty expense as a cost of revenue. We estimate the costs of warranty obligations \n\n51\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nbased on historical experience of known product failure rates and anticipated rates of warranty claims, use of materials to repair or replace defective products, and service delivery costs incurred in correcting the product issues. In addition, from time to time, specific warranty accruals may be made if unforeseen technical problems arise.\n\nDisaggregation of Revenue\n\nFor additional information on the disaggregated revenues by geographical region and major product category, see [Note 15 – Revenue Information](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_136) in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nIn accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for income taxes, we recognize income taxes using an asset and liability approach. This approach requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. The measurement of current and deferred taxes is based on provisions of the enacted tax law. The effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated.\n\nThe authoritative guidance provides for recognition of deferred tax assets if the realization of such deferred tax assets is more likely than not to occur based on an evaluation of all available evidence, both positive and negative, and the relative weight of the evidence. We have determined that at this time it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets attributable to all other items will not be realized, primarily due to uncertainties related to the ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards before they expire. Accordingly, we have established a valuation allowance for such deferred tax assets which we do not expect to realize. If there is a change in the ability to realize deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been established, then the tax valuation allowance may decrease in the period in which we determine that realization is more likely than not. Likewise, if we determine that it is not more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized, then a valuation allowance may be established for such deferred tax assets and the tax provision may increase in the period in which we make the determination. See [Note 12 - Income and Other Taxes](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_124) in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to income taxes.\n\nPurchase Accounting\n\nThe Company accounts for acquisitions of businesses under the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the Company records assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair value on the date of acquisition. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable net assets. Estimated fair values of acquired assets and liabilities are provisional and could change as additional information is received. When appropriate, our estimates of the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired include assistance from independent third-party valuation firms. Valuations are finalized as soon as practicable, but not later than one year from the acquisition date. Any subsequent changes to purchase price allocations result in a corresponding adjustment to goodwill.\n\nInventory, long-lived assets, goodwill, and other intangible assets generally represent the largest components of our acquisitions. Inventory is valued utilizing net realizable value method. Property, plant, and equipment is valued utilizing a cost and market approach. Intangible assets are recognized at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition and generally consist of customer relationships, technology, IPR&D, and trademarks. Determination of the estimated fair value of intangible assets requires judgment. The estimated fair value of technology, IPR&D, and trademarks, is determined utilizing the relief from royalty method. Under this form of income approach, a royalty rate based on observed market royalties is applied to projected revenue supporting the technology, IPR&D, and trademarks and discounted to present value. The estimated fair value of customer relationships is determined using the multiple period excess earnings method. Under this form of income approach, net cash flows attributable to the subject asset are typically calculated net of fair returns on and of all assets that are necessary to realize the cash flows. Cash flows of the subject intangible asset are charged amounts representing a return of and a return on these contributory assets (based on the fair values of the contributory assets).\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\n\nThe were no recently adopted accounting pronouncements.\n\nRecent Accounting Standards or Updates Not Yet Effective\n\n52\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, a final standard on improvements to income tax disclosures. The standard requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity's effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The standard is intended to benefit investors by providing more detailed income tax disclosures that would be useful in making capital allocation decisions and applies to all entities subject to income taxes. The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. This accounting standard is effective in the first quarter of the Company's fiscal year ended September 30, 2026. The Company does not expect the adoption of this new guidance to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nNOTE 3. Acquisitions\n\nOn April 29, 2022, we completed the acquisition of the L3H S&N business for a total purchase price of approximately $5.0 million in cash, exclusive of transaction costs and expenses and subject to certain post-closing working capital adjustments, resulting in a final adjusted purchase consideration transferred of $4.9 million. Following the closing, S&N results are included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date. Revenue and net income of S&N of $31.1 million and $4.2 million, respectively, is included in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. Revenue and net income of S&N from the acquisition date of $10.1 million and $0.5 million, respectively, is included in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.\n\nOn August 9, 2022, we completed the acquisition of EMCORE Chicago, pursuant to which we acquired substantially all of KVH’s assets and liabilities primarily related to its FOG and Inertial Navigation Systems business, including property interests in the Tinley Park facility located at 8412 West 185th St., Tinley Park, Illinois (the “Tinley Park Facility”), for aggregate consideration of approximately $55.0 million, exclusive of transaction costs and expenses and subject to certain post-closing working capital adjustments. Following the closing, EMCORE Chicago results are included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date. Revenue and net loss of EMCORE Chicago of $35.9 million and $14.8 million, respectively, is included in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. The loss was primarily attributable to the impairment and write off of goodwill of $15.9 million. Revenue and net income of EMCORE Chicago from the acquisition date of $6.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively, is included in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.\n\nFinal Purchase Price Allocation\n\nThe total purchase price for the S&N acquisition was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Since the acquisition, the purchase price allocation for S&N changed by a $2.3 million reduction to contract assets and a $0.6 million reduction to the asset retirement obligation, resulting in a corresponding increase to intangible assets and goodwill acquired. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable net assets.\n\nThe table below represents the final purchase price allocation to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of S&N based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date based on management’s best estimates and assumptions:\n\n53\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\n(in thousands) | Amount  \n---|---  \nTangible assets acquired:  \nAccounts receivable | $ | 803  \nInventory | 370  \nContract assets | 3,920  \nOperating lease right-of-use assets | 1,529  \nProperty, plant, and equipment | 1,996  \nNet pension benefit assets | 1,727  \nIntangible assets acquired | 2,740  \nGoodwill | 3,108  \nLiabilities assumed:  \nAccounts payable | (1,226)  \nAccrued expenses | (622)  \nContract liabilities | (6,024)  \nOperating lease liabilities | (1,565)  \nAsset retirement obligations | (1,895)  \nTotal purchase consideration | $ | 4,861  \n  \nThe total purchase price for the EMCORE Chicago acquisition was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values as of the acquisition date.

Contract liabilities represent payments received in advance of providing services under certain contract and were $1.6 million and $5.3 million as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Revenue recognized in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 relating to contract liabilities as of the beginning of the respective fiscal year was $5.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively.\n\nNOTE 6.

During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, the Company sold certain equipment and recognized a gain on sale of assets of $1.1 million.\n\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, for the reporting unit formerly known as Aerospace & Defense, an indication of goodwill impairment (after electing to quantitatively test goodwill) was a trigger to test long-lived assets. Recoverability of the long-lived assets was measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset groups to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset groups. The comparison indicated that the assets were recoverable.\n\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, there was a triggering event of negative cash flows and operating losses at the FOG asset group level within the Inertial Navigation product line that indicated the carrying amounts of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable. In accordance with ASC 360, with regard to our long-lived assets, we performed an undiscounted cash flow analysis and concluded that the carrying value of the asset group was not recoverable. Accordingly, we then performed an analysis to estimate the fair value of the other long -lived assets and recognized an impairment charge within operating expenses of $3.0 million against the FOG property, plant, and equipment by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group’s other long-lived assets exceeded their estimated fair value for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Key assumptions utilized in the determination of fair value include expected future cash flows and working capital requirements. While we believe the expectations and assumptions about the future are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain.\n\nOn December 13, 2022, EMCORE Chicago consummated the sale of the real property interests in the Tinley Park Facility to 8400 W 185TH STREET INVESTORS, LLC (the “Tinley Park Buyer”), resulting in net proceeds of approximately $10.3 million, pursuant to the terms of that certain Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Tinley Park Purchase Agreement”) dated as of November 1, 2022, by and between EMCORE Chicago and HSRE Fund VII Holding Company, LLC, an affiliate of the Tinley Park Buyer. In connection with the sale of the real property interests in the Tinley Park Facility, we entered into a long-term Single-Tenant Triple Net Lease (the “Lease Agreement”) with the Tinley Park Buyer pursuant to which we leased back the Tinley Park Facility for a 12 year term commencing on December 13, 2022, unless earlier terminated or extended in accordance with the terms of the Lease Agreement.\n\nGeographical Concentrations\n\nLong-lived assets consist of land, building, property, plant, and equipment. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, approximately all of our long-lived assets were located in the United States.\n\nNOTE 8. Intangible Assets and Goodwill\n\nIntangible assets arose from the acquisition of SDI in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 and the acquisitions of S&N and EMCORE Chicago in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of: (a) 7.0 years for patents (b) 8.0 years for customer relationships, and (c) 2.0-8.0 years for technology. IPR&D is indefinite-lived until completion of the related development project, at which point amortization of the carrying value of the technology will commence. If it is determined that the IPR&D will not come to completion, it is impaired at that time. A certain Company trademark is indefinite-lived.\n\nThe following table summarizes changes in intangible assets, net:\n\n57\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nSeptember 30,  \n---  \n(in thousands) | 2023 | 2022  \nBalance at beginning of period | $ | 14,790 | $ | 167  \nAdditions from acquisition | 1,470 | 14,740  \nWrite off due to impairment | (2,125) | —  \nAmortization | (1,890) | (117)  \nBalance at end of period | $ | 12,245 | $ | 14,790  \n  \nDuring the fiscal year ended September 31, 2023, in accordance with ASC 350, the Company performed a quantitative (Step 1) analysis to determine the fair value of a certain Company trademark. The Company utilized the relief from royalty method and concluded that the carrying value of such trademark of $2.2 million exceeded the fair value and impairment expense of $1.3 million was recorded. Key assumptions utilized in the determination of fair value include expected future revenues and estimated royalty rates. While we believe the expectations and assumptions about the future are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain.\n\nWith respect to EMCORE Chicago's acquired IPR&D, those projects were completed in the quarter ended December 31, 2022 and were classified as technology assets and assigned an eight-year useful life. With respect to a certain IPR&D project arising from the acquisition of S&N, it was determined during the quarter ended September 31, 2023, that the Company would abandon the project underlying the remaining IPR&D and the carrying value of $0.8 million was impaired.\n\nThe weighted average remaining useful lives by definite-lived intangible asset category are as follows:\n\n(in thousands, except weighted average remaining life) | September 30, 2023  \n---|---  \nWeighted Average Remaining Life (in years) | Gross Carrying Amount | Accumulated Amortization | Net Book Value  \nTechnology | 13.0 | $ | 16,901 | $ | (9,527) | $ | 7,374  \nCustomer relationships | 4.0 | 4,690 | (674) | 4,016  \nDefinite-lived intangible assets total | $ | 21,591 | $ | (10,201) | $ | 11,390  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2023 trademarks were approximately $0.9 million.\n\n(in thousands, except weighted average remaining life) | September 30, 2022  \n---|---  \nWeighted Average Remaining Life (in years) | Gross Carrying Amount | Accumulated Amortization | Net Book Value  \nTechnology | 5.4 | $ | 10,991 | $ | (8,261) | $ | 2,730  \nCustomer relationships | 4.6 | 3,260 | (50) | 3,210  \nDefinite-lived intangible assets total | $ | 14,251 | $ | (8,311) | $ | 5,940  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2022 IPR&D and trademarks was approximately $6.7 million and $2.2 million, respectively.\n\nEstimated future amortization expense for intangible assets recorded by the Company at September 30, 2023 is as follows:\n\n(in thousands) | Amount  \n---|---  \n2024 | $ | 1,956  \n2025 | 1,930  \n2026 | 1,527  \n2027 | 1,504  \n2028 | 1,491  \nThereafter | 2,982  \nTotal amortization expense | $ | 11,390  \n  \n58\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nGoodwill is recorded when the consideration for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. As of September 30, 2022, $17.8 million of the Company’s goodwill of $17.9 million related to the S&N and EMCORE Chicago acquisitions. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, we recognized an additional $1.2 million due to a change in purchase price valuation. None of the Company’s goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. \n\nThe following table summarizes changes in goodwill:\n\nYear Ended September 30,  \n---  \n(in thousands) | 2023 | 2022  \nBalance at beginning of period | $ | 17,894 | $ | 69  \nAdditions from acquisition | 1,150 | 17,825  \nWrite off from impairment | (19,044) | —  \nBalance at end of period | $ | — | $ | 17,894  \n  \nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, in accordance with ASC 350, the Company performed a quantitative (Step 1) analysis of goodwill utilizing a weighted income and market approach and concluded that the carrying value of the reporting unit that carried the goodwill (adjusted for trademark impairment) was greater than the fair value of equity of the reporting unit, and impairment expense of $19.0 million was recorded. Key assumptions utilized in the determination of fair value include forecasted financial performance of the Company. While we believe the expectations and assumptions about the future are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain.\n\nNOTE 9. Benefit Plans\n\nWe assumed the Pension Plan on April 29, 2022 as a result of the acquisition of S&N. The Pension Plan was frozen to new hires as of March 31, 2007 and employees hired on or after April 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the Pension Plan. On July 1, 2022, the Pension Plan was amended to freeze benefit plan accruals for participants. As a result of the freeze, a curtailment was triggered and a restatement of the benefit obligation and plan assets occurred, although no gain or loss resulted. The annual measurement date for the Pension Plan is September 30. Benefits are based on years of credited service at retirement. Annual contributions to the Pension Plan are not less than the minimum funding standards outlined in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. We maintain the Pension Plan with the goal of ensuring that it is adequately funded to meet its future obligations. We did not make any contributions to the Pension Plan during the period from April 29, 2022 to September 30, 2022 or for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.\n\nThe following table presents the benefit obligation, fair value of the plan assets, and funded status of the plan:\n\nSeptember 30,  \n---  \n(in thousands) | 2023 | 2022  \nChange in Benefit Obligation  \nBenefit obligation at beginning of period | $ | 7,332 | $ | 8,203  \nService cost | 105 | 49  \nInterest cost | 372 | 130  \nParticipant contributions | — | —  \nAmendments | — | —  \nActuarial losses (gains) | (461) | (901)  \nBenefits paid | (634) | (149)  \nBusiness combinations and (divestitures) | — | —  \nCurtailments, settlements and/or special/contractual termination benefits | — | —  \nBenefit obligation at end of year | $ | 6,714 | $ | 7,332  \nChange in Plan Assets  \nFair value at beginning of period | $ | 9,469 | $ | 9,930  \nActual return on plan assets | (214) | (312)  \nCompany contributions | — | —  \nParticipant contributions | — | —  \nBenefits paid | (634) | (149)  \nExpenses paid | — | —  \nBusiness combinations and (divestitures) | — | —  \n  \n59\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nCurtailments, settlements and/or special/contractual termination benefits | — | —  \n---|---|---  \nFair value at end of year | $ | 8,621 | $ | 9,469  \nFunded Status  \nFunded status at end of year | $ | 1,907 | $ | 2,137  \nAmounts Recognized in Balance Sheets  \nNon-current assets | $ | 1,907 | $ | 2,137  \nCurrent liabilities | $ | — | $ | —  \nNon-current liabilities | $ | — | $ | —  \nAmounts Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income  \nTransition obligation (asset) | $ | — | $ | —  \nPrior service cost (credit) | $ | — | $ | —  \nNet loss (gain) | $ | (350) | $ | (441)  \nNet periodic pension cost  \nService cost | $ | 105 | $ | 49  \nInterest cost | 372 | 130  \nExpected return on plan assets | (337) | (148)  \nAmortization of transition obligation (asset) | — | —  \nAmortization of prior service cost (credit) | — | —  \nAmortization of net loss (gain) | — | —  \nRecognition due to settlement, curtailment, and special/contractual termination benefits | — | —  \nNet periodic pension cost | $ | 140 | $ | 31  \nOther Changes in Plan Assets and Benefit Obligations Recognized in Other Comprehensive Loss  \nNet loss (gain) | $ | 91 | $ | (441)  \nPrior service cost (credit) | — | —  \nAmortization of net (loss) gain | — | —  \nAmortization of prior service cost (credit) | — | —  \nAmortization of initial asset | — | —  \nTotal recognized in other comprehensive (loss) income | $ | 91 | $ | (441)  \nActuarial (Gain) Loss by Source  \nUpdated census | $ | (255) | $ | (55)  \nUpdated discount rate | (206) | (846)  \nTotal | $ | (461) | $ | (901)  \nEstimated Future Benefit Payments  \n2024 | $ | 613 | $ | 600  \n2025 | 575 | 579  \n2026 | 555 | 562  \n2027 | 567 | 575  \n2028 | 558 | 573  \nThereafter | 2,668 | 2,748  \nTotal | $ | 5,536 | $ | 5,637  \nWeighted Average Assumptions to Determine Benefit Obligations at Year End  \nDiscount rate | 5.9% | 5.6%  \nRate of compensation increase | N/A | N/A  \nWeighted Average Assumptions to Determine Net Periodic Pension Cost  \nDiscount rate | 5.6% | 4.4%  \n  \n60\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nRate of compensation increase | N/A | N/A  \n---|---|---  \nExpected long-term return on plan assets | 3.7% | 3.7%  \n  \nNet pension asset is included as a component of other non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022.

Under this savings plan, participating employees may defer a portion of their pretax earnings, up to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limit. Our matching contribution in cash for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 was approximately $1.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively.\n\nNOTE 10.

Credit Agreement\n\nWingspire Credit Agreement\n\nOn August 9, 2022, EMCORE and EMCORE Space & Navigation Corporation, our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into that certain Credit Agreement with the lenders party thereto and Wingspire Capital LLC (“Wingspire”), as administrative agent for the lenders, as amended pursuant to that First Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of October 25, 2022, among EMCORE and EMCORE Space & Navigation Corporation, EMCORE Chicago Inertial Corporation, our wholly-owned subsidiary (together with the Company and S&N, the “Borrowers”), the lenders party thereto and Wingspire to add EMCORE Chicago as a Borrower and include certain of its assets in the borrowing base (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement provides for two credit facilities: (a) an asset-based revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $40.0 million, subject to a borrowing base consisting of eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory (subject to certain reserves), and (b) a term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $6.0 million.\n\nThe proceeds of the loans made under the Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement will mature on August 8, 2026, and will bear interest, at a rate per annum equal to term SOFR plus a margin \n\n61\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nof (i) 3.75% or 5.50% in the case of revolving loans, depending on the applicable assets corresponding to the borrowing base pursuant to which the applicable loans are made and (ii) 5.50% in the case of the term loans. In addition, the Borrowers are responsible for Wingspire’s annual collateral monitoring fees as well as the lenders’ fees and expenses, including a closing fee of 1.0% of the aggregate principal amount of the commitments as of the closing with respect to revolving loans and 1.50% of the aggregate principal amount of the term loans. The Borrowers may also be required to pay an unused line fee of 0.50% in respect to the undrawn portion of the revolving commitments, which is generally based on average daily usage of the revolving facility during the immediately preceding month.\n\nThe Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants that are generally customary for credit facilities of this type. Among others, the Credit Agreement contains various covenants that, subject to agreed upon exceptions, limit the Borrowers’ and their respective subsidiaries’ ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, enter into swap agreements, make loans, acquisitions and investments, change the nature of their business, acquire or sell assets or consolidate or merge with or into other persons or entities, declare or pay dividends or make other restricted payments, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into burdensome agreements, change fiscal year, amend organizational documents, and use proceeds to fund any activities of or business with any person that is the subject of governmental sanctions. In addition, the Credit Agreement requires that, for any period commencing upon the occurrence of an event of default or excess availability under the Credit Agreement being less than the greater of $5.0 million and 15% of the revolving commitments until such time as no event of default shall be continuing and excess availability under the Credit Agreement shall be at least the greater of $5.0 million and 15% of the revolving commitments for a period of 60 consecutive days, the Borrowers satisfy a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.10:1.00.\n\nThe Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default, the occurrence of which, following any applicable grace period, would permit the lenders to, among other things, declare the principal, accrued interest and other obligations of the Borrowers under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable, and exercise rights and remedies available to the lenders under the Credit Agreement or applicable law or equity.\n\nIn connection with the Credit Agreement, the Borrowers entered into a pledge and security agreement pursuant to which the obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured on a senior secured basis (subject to permitted liens) by substantially all assets of the Borrowers and substantially all assets of any future guarantors.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, an aggregate principal amount of $6.4 million was outstanding pursuant to the revolving credit facility and an aggregate principal amount of $4.2 million was outstanding pursuant to the term loan facility. Also, as of September 30, 2023, the revolving credit facility had approximately $9.9 million available for borrowing. Provided that no event of default has occurred, and subject to availability limitations, loans under the revolving credit facility can continue to be drawn/redrawn/outstanding until expiration in 2026.\n\nOur future term loan repayments is as follows:\n\n(in thousands) | Amount  \n---|---  \n2024 | $ | 852  \n2025 | 852  \n2026 | 2,478  \nTotal loan payments | $ | 4,182  \n  \nNOTE 12.

Income tax expense for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 is comprised primarily of state minimum tax expense. Income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 is comprised primarily federal refund of AMT credit and state minimum tax expense.\n\nFor the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the effective tax rate on operations was 0.1%, and (0.3)%, respectively. The lower tax rate for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 is primarily due to the reversal of tax expense related to the change on indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Company uses some estimates to forecast permanent differences between book and tax accounting.\n\nWe have not provided for income taxes on non-U.S. subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings as of September 30, 2023 because we plan to indefinitely reinvest the unremitted earnings of the non-U.S. subsidiaries and all of the non-U.S. subsidiaries historically have negative earnings and profits.\n\nAll deferred tax assets have a full valuation allowance at September 30, 2023. On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates the positive and negative evidence to assess whether the more likely than not criteria, has been satisfied in determining whether there will be further adjustments to the valuation allowance.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes of approximately $391.5 million which begin to expire in 2024. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $95.0 million which begin to expire in 2024. As of September 30, 2023, the Company also had tax credits (primarily foreign income and U.S. research and development tax credits) of approximately $0.3 million. The research credits begin to expire in 2024. Utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations set forth in Section 382 (“Section 382”) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) and similar state provisions. The Company prepared an Internal Revenue Code 382 analysis to determine the annual limitations on the Company’s consolidated net operating loss carryforwards. As a result of the $391.5 million of U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, approximately $111.6 million is subject to an annual limitation and $279.9 million of the net operating losses are not subject to an annual limitation. Such annual limitations could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization.\n\nNOTE 13. Commitments and Contingencies\n\nLeases\n\n64\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nWe lease certain facilities and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Operating lease amounts exclude property taxes, insurance, and maintenance expenses on leased properties. As of September 30, 2023, our operating leases had remaining lease terms of approximately 1 year to 12 years, some of which included options to extend 5 additional years. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded $3.7 million and $2.0 million of operating lease expense, respectively. The Company’s finance leases and short term leases are immaterial. \n\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, there was a change in circumstances surrounding the use of our leased facilities and related right-of-use (ROU) assets due to the restructuring of our business and active pursuit of selling the discontinued operations and the indium phosphide wafer fabrication facility assets. Recoverability of the long-lived assets was measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset groups to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset groups. The comparison indicated that certain of the asset groups was not recoverable, and an impairment of $1.4 million was recorded as this was the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeded the related estimated fair value, which was based on discounted future operating cash flows.\n\nMaturities of operating lease liabilities as of September 30, 2023 were as follows:\n\n(in thousands) | Amount  \n---|---  \n2024 | $ | 4,614  \n2025 | 4,137  \n2026 | 3,072  \n2027 | 2,757  \n2028 | 2,830  \nThereafter | 22,179  \nTotal lease payments | $ | 39,589  \nLess imputed interest | (15,674)  \nTotal operating lease liabilities | $ | 23,915  \n  \nWeighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate related to operating leases are as follows:\n\nSeptember 30,  \n---  \n2023 | 2022  \nWeighted average remaining lease term (years) | 10.0 | 9.8  \nWeighted average discount rate | 9.5 | % | 5.4 | %  \n  \nSupplemental cash information and non-cash activities related to operating leases are as follows:\n\nSeptember 30,  \n---  \n(in thousands) | 2023 | 2022  \nOperating cash outflows from operating leases | $ | 3,749 | $ | 2,011  \nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities | $ | 2,577 | $ | 1,529  \n  \nAsset Retirement Obligations\n\nARO consists of legal requirements to decommission assets, restore the existing leased facilities to their original state, and perform certain environmental work due to the presence of a manufacturing fabrication operation. ARO includes assumptions related to renewal option periods for those facilities where we expect to extend lease terms. The Company recognizes its estimate of the fair value of its ARO in the period incurred in long-term liabilities and is also capitalized as property, plant and equipment. The fair value of ARO was estimated by discounting projected cash flows over the estimated life of the related assets using credit adjusted risk-free rates which ranged from 1.73% to 4.03%.\n\nThe following table summarizes ARO activity:\n\n65\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nSeptember 30,  \n---  \n(in thousands) | 2023 | 2022  \nBalance at beginning of period | $ | 4,664 | $ | 2,049  \nAcquisition-related adjustment | (604) | 2,500  \nAccretion expense | 134 | 90  \nRevision in estimated cash flows | — | 25  \nBalance at end of period | $ | 4,194 | $ | 4,664  \n  \nIndemnifications\n\nWe have agreed to indemnify certain customers against claims of infringement of intellectual property rights of others in our sales contracts with these customers. Historically, we have not paid any claims under these customer indemnification obligations. We enter into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers pursuant to which we agree to indemnify them for certain potential expenses and liabilities arising from their status as a director or executive officer of the Company. We maintain director and officer insurance, which covers certain liabilities relating to our obligation to indemnify our directors and executive officers in certain circumstances. It is not possible to determine the aggregate maximum potential loss under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular claim.\n\nLegal Proceedings\n\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings, claims, and litigation, either asserted or unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of business. The outcome of these matters is currently not determinable and we are unable to estimate a range of loss, should a loss occur, from these proceedings. The ultimate outcome of legal proceedings involves judgments, estimates, and inherent uncertainties and the results of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty. Professional legal fees are expensed when incurred. We accrue for contingent losses when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable. In the event that estimates or assumptions prove to differ from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Should we fail to prevail in any legal matter, or should several legal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, then the financial results of that particular reporting period could be materially affected.\n\nIntellectual Property Lawsuits\n\nWe protect our proprietary technology by applying for patents where appropriate and, in other cases, by preserving the technology, related know-how, and information as trade secrets. The success and competitive position of our product lines are impacted by the ability to obtain intellectual property protection for research and development efforts. We have, from time to time, exchanged correspondence with third parties regarding the assertion of patent or other intellectual property rights in connection with certain of our products and processes.\n\nResilience Litigation\n\nIn February 2021, Resilience Capital (“Resilience”) filed a complaint against us with the Delaware Chancery Court containing claims arising from the February 2020 sale of SDI’s real property (the “Concord Property Sale”) located in Concord, California (the “Concord Real Property”) to Eagle Rock Holdings, LP (“Buyer”) and that certain Single-Tenant Triple Net Lease, dated as of February 10, 2020, entered into by and between SDI and the Buyer, pursuant to which SDI leased from the Buyer the Concord Real Property for a 15 year term. The Resilience complaint seeks, among other items, (a) a declaration that the Concord Property Sale included a non-cash component, (b) a decree requiring us and Resilience to follow the appraisal requirements set forth in that certain Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “SDI Purchase Agreement”), dated as of June 7, 2019, by and among the Company, The Resilience Fund IV, L.P., The Resilience Fund IV-A, L.P., Aerospace Newco Holdings, Inc. and Ember Acquisition Sub, Inc., (c) recovery of Resilience’s costs and expenses, and (d) pre- and post-judgment interest.\n\nIn April 2021, we filed with the Delaware Chancery Court our answer to the Resilience complaint and counterclaims against Resilience, in which we are seeking, among other items, (a) dismissal of the Resilience complaint and/or granting of judgment in favor of EMCORE with respect to the Resilience complaint, (b) entering final judgment against Resilience awarding damages to us for Resilience’s fraud and breaches of the SDI Purchase Agreement in an amount to be proven at trial and not less than $1,565,000, (c) a judicial determination of the respective rights and duties of us and Resilience under the SDI Purchase Agreement, (d) an award to us of costs and expenses, and (e) pre- and post-judgment interest. \n\n66\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nIn April 2023, we and Resilience entered into a Settlement and Release Agreement (the “Resilience Settlement Agreement”). The material financial terms of the Resilience Settlement Agreement required (i) a payment of $0.5 million by us to Resilience, which payment was made by us during the three months ended June 30, 2023, (ii) appraisals of the Concord Real Property, conducted in 2023 with a date of value as of January 2, 2020, which resulted in a further payment obligation by us in an amount equal to approximately $1.3 million, which payment was made by us in October 2023, and (iii) a mutual release of all claims, including claims arising under the SDI Purchase Agreement, and a dismissal of the litigation by all parties.On October 10, 2023, the Delaware Chancery Court granted the parties' stipulation of dismissal with prejudice to the Delaware Chancery Court of all claims made by each party.\n\nIn April 2023, the underwriters of the representation and warranty insurance policies the Company acquired in connection with the SDI Purchase Agreement agreed to pay the Company $1.15 million within 15 business days in exchange for a release of any and all claims under the policies. We received payment during the three months ended June 30, 2023.\n\nNOTE 14. Equity\n\nTax Preservation Plan\n\nOn September 28, 2023, our Board of Directors approved and adopted a Section 382 Tax Benefits Preservation Plan, dated as of September 28, 2023, by and between the Company and Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, as rights agent (the “Rights Agent”) (the “Section 382 Tax Benefits Preservation Plan”). Pursuant to the Section 382 Tax Benefits Preservation Plan, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (each, a “Right”) for each outstanding share of common stock. The dividend is distributable on October 12, 2023 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 12, 2023.\n\nThe Board of Directors adopted the Section 382 Tax Benefits Preservation Plan to diminish the risk that the Company could experience an “ownership change” as defined in Section 382 of the Code, which could substantially limit or permanently eliminate the Company’s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryovers (collectively, the “NOLs”) to reduce potential future income tax obligations. Under the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Treasury Department, these NOLs may be “carried forward” in certain circumstances to offset any current and future taxable income and thus reduce federal income tax liability, subject to certain requirements and restrictions. While the amount and timing of the Company’s future taxable income cannot be predicted with any certainty and, accordingly, the Company cannot predict the amount of these NOLs that will ultimately be used to reduce its income tax liability, to the extent that the NOLs do not otherwise become limited, these NOLs could be a potentially valuable asset to the Company. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $391.5 million and $424.9 million, respectively.\n\nIn general, under Section 382, an “ownership change” occurs if a shareholder or a group of shareholders who are deemed to own at least 5% of the common stock individually or collectively increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. If an ownership change occurs, Section 382 would impose an annual limit on the amount of the Company’s NOLs that can be used to offset the Company’s federal taxable income equal to the product of the total value of the Company’s outstanding equity immediately prior to the ownership change (reduced by certain items specified in Section 382) and the federal long-term tax-exempt interest rate in effect for the month of the ownership change. A number of complex rules apply to calculating this annual limit and there are several special rules that, depending on the rule involved, may apply to reduce or increase such limit. If an ownership change were to occur, the limitations imposed by Section 382 could result in a substantial delay in the timing of the usage of the NOLs or in a material amount or all of the NOLs expiring unused and, therefore, significantly impair or eliminate the value of such NOLs. While the Company periodically monitors its NOLs and currently believes that an ownership change that would impair the value of its NOLs has not occurred, the complexity of Section 382’s provisions and the limited knowledge any public company has about the ownership of its publicly traded stock make it difficult to determine whether an ownership change has in fact occurred.\n\nThe Section 382 Tax Benefits Preservation Plan is intended to act as a deterrent to any person or group acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.99% or more of the outstanding common stock without the approval of the Board of Directors. A person who acquires, without the approval of the Board of Directors, beneficial ownership (other than as a result of repurchases of stock by the Company, dividends or distributions by the Company or certain inadvertent actions by shareholders) of 4.99% or more of the outstanding common stock (including any ownership interest held by that person’s Affiliates and Associates as defined under the Section 382 Tax Benefits Preservation Plan) could be subject to significant dilution. Shareholders who beneficially own 4.99% or more of the outstanding common stock prior to the first public announcement by the Company of the Board of Directors’ adoption of the Section 382 Tax Benefits Preservation Plan will not trigger the Section 382 Tax Benefits Preservation Plan so long as they do not acquire beneficial ownership of additional shares of the common stock (other than pursuant to a dividend or distribution paid or made by the Company on the outstanding shares of common stock or pursuant to a \n\n67\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nsplit or subdivision of the outstanding shares of common stock) at a time when they still beneficially own 4.99% or more of such stock. In addition, the Board of Directors retains the sole discretion to exempt any person or group from the penalties imposed by the Section 382 Tax Benefits Preservation Plan.\n\nEquity Plans\n\nWe provide long-term incentives to eligible officers, directors, and employees in the form of equity-based awards. We maintain four equity incentive compensation plans, collectively described as our “Equity Plans”: (a) the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2010 Plan”), (b) the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2012 Plan”), (c) the Amended and Restated 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”), and (d) the 2022 New Employee Inducement Plan.\n\nWe issue new shares of common stock to satisfy awards granted under our Equity Plans. In December 2022, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to the 2019 Plan, which, following shareholder approval at our 2023 annual meeting of shareholders, increased the maximum number of shares of the Company’s common stock that may be issued or transferred pursuant to awards under the 2019 Plan by an additional 1.549 million shares. \n\nStock Options\n\nMost stock options vest and become exercisable over four to five years and have a contractual life of 10 years. Certain stock options awarded are intended to qualify as incentive stock options pursuant to Section 422A of the Code.\n\nThe Company has estimated the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The expected volatility assumption is based on the historical daily price data of the Company’s common stock over a period equivalent to the weighted average expected life of the Company’s options. The expected term of options granted is derived using assumed exercise rates based on historical exercise patterns and represents the period of time the options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free interest rate is based on the actual U.S. Treasury zero-coupon rates for bonds matching the expected term of the option as of the option grant date. The dividend yield of zero is based upon the fact that the Company has not historically declared or paid cash dividends, and does not expect to declare or pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity under the Equity Plans for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023:\n\nNumber of Shares | Weighted Average Exercise Price | Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life (in years) | Aggregate Intrinsic Value (*) (in thousands)  \n---|---|---|---  \nOutstanding as of September 30, 2022 | 9,981 | $ | 4.52  \nGranted | — | —  \nExercised | — | —  \nForfeited | — | —  \nExpired | 976 | 3.84  \nOutstanding as of September 30, 2023 | 9,005 | $ | 4.59 | 1.30 | $ | —  \nExercisable as of September 30, 2023 | 9,005 | $ | 4.59 | 1.30 | $ | —  \nVested and expected to vest as of September 30, 2023 | 9,005 | $ | 4.59 | 1.30 | $ | —  \n  \n___________________________________________\n\n(*) Intrinsic value for stock options represents the “in-the-money” portion or the positive variance between a stock option’s exercise price and the underlying stock price. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, the intrinsic value of options exercised was $0.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, there was no unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested stock options granted under the Equity Plans.\n\nValuation Assumptions\n\nThere were no stock option grants for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.\n\n68\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nTime-Based Restricted Stock\n\nTime-based restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and restricted stock awards (“RSAs”) granted to employees under the 2010 Plan, 2012 Plan, the 2019 Plan, or the 2022 New Employee Inducement Plan typically vest over 3 to 4 years and are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the vesting or lapse of the restrictions, as applicable. RSUs are not considered issued or outstanding common stock until they vest. RSAs are considered issued and outstanding on the grant date and are subject to forfeiture if specified vesting conditions are not satisfied. The value of RSUs is determined by the stock price on the grant date.\n\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to RSUs subject to time-based vesting requirements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023:\n\nRSUs  \n---  \nNumber of Shares | Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value  \nNon-vested as of September 30, 2022 | 2,947,130 | $ | 3.90  \nGranted | 2,896,650 | 1.00  \nVested | (1,314,313) | 3.72  \nForfeited | (499,391) | 2.55  \nNon-vested as of September 30, 2023 | 4,030,076 | $ | 2.04  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2023, there was approximately $6.5 million of remaining unamortized stock-based compensation expense associated with RSUs, which will be expensed over a weighted average remaining service period of approximately 3.1 years. The 4.0 million outstanding non-vested and expected to vest RSUs have an aggregate intrinsic value of $1.9 million and a weighted average remaining contractual term of 1.8 years. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the intrinsic value of RSUs vested was approximately $1.3 million and $3.0 million, respectively. The weighted average grant date fair value of RSUs granted during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 was $1.00 and $3.46 per share, respectively. \n\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, $27.3 thousand of RSAs vested. As of September 30, 2022, there was no remaining unamortized stock-based compensation expense associated with RSAs.\n\nPerformance-Based Restricted Stock\n\nPerformance based restricted stock units (“PSUs”) granted to employees under the 2012 Plan or 2019 Plan typically vest over 1 to 3 years and are subject to forfeiture in whole, if employment terminates, or in whole or in part, if specified vesting conditions are not satisfied in each case prior to vesting. PSUs are not considered issued or outstanding common stock until they vest. PSUs that are granted to executive officers and key employees are provided as long-term incentive compensation that is based on relative total shareholder return, which measures performance against the Russell Microcap Index.\n\nPSUs are valued based on a Monte Carlo simulation model to reflect the impact of the PSUs market condition. The probability of satisfying a market condition is considered in the estimation of the grant-date fair value for PSUs and the compensation cost is not reversed if the market condition is not achieved, provided the requisite service has been provided.\n\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to PSUs for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023:\n\nPSUs  \n---  \nNumber of Shares (at target) | Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value  \nNon-vested as of September 30, 2022 | 1,809,053 | $ | 4.37  \nGranted | 634,650 | 0.97  \nVested | (291,285) | 2.47  \nForfeited | (448,000) | 3.81  \nNon-vested as of September 30, 2023 | 1,704,418 | $ | 3.57  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2023, there was approximately $2.7 million of remaining unamortized stock-based compensation expense associated with PSUs, which will be expensed over a weighted average remaining service period of approximately 1.3 years. The 1.7 million outstanding non-vested and expected to vest PSUs have an aggregate intrinsic value of approximately $0.8\n\n69\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nmillion and a weighted average remaining contractual term of 1.3 years. For each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the intrinsic value of PSUs vested was $0.3 million. The weighted average grant date fair value of PSUs granted during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 was $0.97 and $4.51 per share, respectively. \n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\nThe following table sets forth stock-based compensation expense by award type:\n\nYear Ended September 30,  \n---  \n(in thousands) | 2023 | 2022  \nRSUs and RSAs | $ | 4,203 | $ | 2,576  \nPSUs | 2,306 | 2,314  \nOutside director equity awards and fees in common stock | 378 | 484  \nTotal stock-based compensation expense | $ | 6,888 | $ | 5,374  \n  \nThe following table sets forth stock-based compensation expense by expense type:\n\nYear Ended September 30,  \n---  \n(in thousands) | 2023 | 2022  \nCost of revenue | $ | 1,742 | $ | 952  \nSelling, general, and administrative | 1,324 | 3,591  \nResearch and development | 3,823 | 831  \nTotal stock-based compensation expense | $ | 6,888 | $ | 5,374  \n  \nCapital Stock\n\nAuthorized capital stock consists of 100 million shares of common stock, no par value, and 5,882,352 shares of preferred stock, $0.0001 par value. No shares of preferred stock were outstanding as of September 30, 2023.\n\nOn August 23, 2023, we closed our offering of 22,600,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $0.50 per share, and, to certain investors, pre-funded warrants (each, a “Pre-Funded Warrant”) to purchase 11,900,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $0.49999999 for each pre-funded warrant (which represents the per share public offering price for our common stock in such offering less the $0.00000001 per share exercise price for each such Pre-Funded Warrant), resulting in net proceeds to us from the offering, after deducting the placement agent commissions and other offering expenses, of approximately $15.6 million. The shares were sold by us pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement, dated as of August 17, 2023, between us and the Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC as the sole managing underwriter.\n\nOn February 17, 2023, we closed our offering of 15,454,546 shares of our common stock at a price of $1.10 per share, resulting in net proceeds to us from the offering, after deducting the placement agent commissions and other offering expenses, of $15.4 million. The shares were sold by us pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of February 17, 2023, between the Company and each purchaser named in the signature pages thereto and a Placement Agency Agreement, dated as of February 15, 2023, by and between the Company and A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023 and 2022, we had 84.0 million and 44.5 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding, respectively. There were no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2023 and 2022.\n\nLoss Per Share\n\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share:\n\n70\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nYear Ended September 30,  \n---  \n(in thousands, except per share data) | 2023 | 2022  \nNumerator  \nNet loss from continuing operations | $ | (49,413) | $ | (40,761)  \n(Loss) income from discontinued operations including loss on disposal of $9.6 million, net of tax benefit of $0 | $ | (25,946) | $ | 16,428  \nNet loss | $ | (75,359) | $ | (24,333)  \nDenominator  \nWeighted average number of shares and preferred warrants outstanding - basic | 51,510 | 37,269  \nEffect of dilutive securities  \nStock options | — | —  \nPSUs, RSUs, and restricted stock | — | —  \nWeighted average number of shares and preferred warrants outstanding - diluted | 51,510 | 37,269  \nLoss from continuing operations per share - basic and diluted | $ | (0.96) | $ | (1.09)  \nLoss from discontinued operations per share - basic and diluted | $ | (0.50) | $ | 0.44  \nNet loss per share - basic and diluted | $ | (1.46) | $ | (0.65)  \nWeighted average antidilutive options, unvested RSUs and RSAs, unvested PSUs and ESPP shares excluded from the computation | 3,305 | 858  \n  \nBasic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net loss for the period by the weighted-average number of common stock and pre-funded warrants outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net loss for the period by the weighted average number of common stock and pre-funded warrants outstanding during the period, plus the dilutive effect of outstanding RSUs, PSUs, and stock options, as applicable pursuant to the treasury stock method. Basic and diluted shares outstanding includes the weighted average of the effect of the Company's outstanding pre-funded warrants as the exercise price of such pre-funded warrants requires nominal consideration to be given for the delivery of the corresponding shares of common stock. Certain of the Company's outstanding share-based awards, noted in the table above, were excluded because they were anti-dilutive, but they could become dilutive in the future. The anti-dilutive stock options and shares of outstanding and unvested restricted stock were excluded from the computation of earnings per share for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 due to the Company incurring a net loss for such periods.\n\nFuture Issuances\n\nCommon stock reserved for future issuances as of September 30, 2023 was as follows:\n\nAmount  \n---  \nExercise of outstanding stock options | 9,005  \nUnvested RSUs | 4,030,076  \nUnvested PSUs (at 100% maximum payout) | 1,704,418  \nIssuance of stock-based awards under the Equity Plans | 513,561  \nPurchases under the officer and director share purchase plan | 88,741  \nTotal reserved | 6,345,801  \n  \nNOTE 15. Revenue Information\n\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized revenue related to a certain multi-year repair and support contract. Repairs pricing is definitized and revenue is recognized as performed/completed. Support pricing is undefinitized until receipt of annual purchase order and revenue is variable consideration and subject to constraint. Variable consideration and constraints are reassessed at each reporting date as uncertainties are resolved or new information arises regarding remaining uncertainties For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized $4.2 million in support revenue related to (i) the definitized amount for calendar year 2022 as all revenue was constrained in previous periods due to lack of history with the customer until finalization of pricing, and receipt of payment, during the quarter ended September 30, 2023 of approximately $2.5 million and (ii) $1.7 million associated with proposed support pricing for calendar year 2023 reflecting a change in estimate with respect to constraint of calendar year 2023 revenue. Constraint was reduced for the calendar year 2023 support pricing due to added experience with the customer.\n\n71\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nReportable Segment\n\nConcurrent with the discontinuance of the Broadband business segment and defense optoelectronics product line during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Company only has one reportable segment, Inertial Navigation, for which financial information is available and upon which operating results are evaluated by the chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer, to assess performance and to allocate resources.\n\nGeographical Concentration\n\nThe following table sets forth revenue by geographic area based on customers’ billing addresses:\n\nYear Ended September 30,  \n---  \n(in thousands) | 2023 | 2022  \nUnited States and Canada | $ | 75,143 | $ | 42,177  \nAsia | 8,714 | 710  \nEurope | 10,444 | 1,242  \nOther | 3,415 | 1,189  \nTotal revenue | $ | 97,716 | $ | 45,318  \n  \nCustomer Concentration\n\nPortions of the Company’s sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers. Significant customers are defined as customers representing greater than 10% of consolidated revenue. There were two significant customers representing an aggregate of 40.4% and 39.7% of consolidated revenue for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nNOTE 16. Discontinued Operations\n\nIn April 2023, we initiated a restructuring program that includes the strategic shutdown of our Broadband business segment (including our cable TV, wireless, sensing and chips product lines) and the discontinuance of our defense optoelectronics product line. During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Broadband business segment and defense optoelectronics product line were considered as held for sale based upon (i) the existence of an executed non-binding letter of intent to sell our Broadband business segment (other than our chips product line) and our defense optoelectronics product line and (ii) in consideration of ongoing negotiations for the sale of the chips product line business. Given the prospective sale of the Broadband business segment and defense optoelectronics product line, we identified these asset groups as discontinued operations during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. We ceased operations of our chips business and indium phosphide wafer fabrication facility during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. In accordance with the authoritative guidance for discontinued operations (Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 205-20), the Company determined that these business lines met held-for sale and discontinued operations accounting criteria during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Accordingly, the Company classified the results of these business lines as discontinued operations in its consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. Additionally, the related assets and liabilities associated with these business lines were classified as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented.\n\nIn connection with (i) certain cash reduction actions approved by the Board in November 2022 and (ii) the restructuring program, the Board approved modifications to RSUs and PSUs previously granted to 36 employees under the 2019 Plan whose service with the Company was terminated. The modifications accelerated the vesting of 429 thousand RSUs and 291 thousand PSUs that had been scheduled to vest subsequent to each such employee’s termination of employment with EMCORE. The modifications resulted in incremental stock-based compensation expense of $0.6 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.\n\nThe following table presents key components of assets and liabilities that were classified as held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets:\n\n72\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nSeptember 30,  \n---  \n(in thousands) | 2023 | 2022  \nCash | $ | 81 | $ | 526  \nAccounts receivable, net of credit loss of $0 | 974 | 4,250  \nContract assets | — | 757  \nInventory | 10,063 | 10,753  \nOther current assets | 1,154 | 1,728  \nProperty, plant, and equipment, net | 4,131 | 13,291  \nOperating lease right-of-use assets | 56 | 99  \nTotal assets | 16,459 | 31,404  \nRemeasurement of assets | 9,195 | —  \nAssets held for sale | 7,264 | 31,404  \nAccounts payable | 1,854 | 2,350  \nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities | 1,697 | 1,427  \nContract liabilities | — | 29  \nOperating lease liabilities - current | 22 | 42  \nOperating lease liabilities - non-current | 36 | 57  \nOther comprehensive income | 1,053 | 860  \nTotal liabilities | $ | 4,662 | $ | 4,765  \n  \nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a loss related to the remeasurement of the discontinued business lines to fair value less cost to sell of $9.6 million. The selling costs were approximately $0.4 million.\n\nThe following table presents key components of net (loss) income that were classified as discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of operations:\n\nYear Ended September 30,  \n---  \n(in thousands) | 2023 | 2022  \nRevenue | $ | 9,674 | $ | 78,808  \nCost of Revenue | (16,723) | (53,156)  \nGross Profit | (7,049) | 25,652  \nSelling, general, and administrative | 2,810 | 5,486  \nResearch and development | 3,459 | 4,754  \nSeverance | 2,597 | 1,213  \nLoss (gain) on sale of assets | 10,407 | (2,685)  \nOther (income) expense | (376) | 456  \n(Loss) income from discontinued operations | $ | (25,946) | $ | 16,428  \n  \nNOTE 17. Subsequent Events\n\nDivestiture to Photonics Foundries\n\nOn October 11, 2023, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), by and among the Company, Photonics Foundries, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“PF”), and Ortel LLC a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of PF (the “Buyer”), pursuant to which (i) the Company agreed to transfer to the Buyer, and Buyer agreed to assume, substantially all of the assets and liabilities primarily related to the Company’s cable TV, wireless, sensing and defense optoelectronics business lines (the “Businesses”), including with respect to employees, contracts, intellectual property and inventory, and (ii) Buyer agreed to provide a limited license back to the Company of patents being sold to the Buyer (the “Transaction”). The Transaction excludes the Company’s chip business, indium phosphide wafer fabrication facilities and all assets not primarily related to the Businesses.\n\n73\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nThe signing and closing of the Transaction occurred simultaneously, except with respect to the assets of the Company located in China. On November 30, 2023, the Company transferred to the Buyer, and the Buyer assumed, substantially all of the assets and liabilities of each of the Company’s subsidiaries in China. \n\nIn connection with the Transaction, the parties entered a transition services agreement pursuant to which the Company will provide certain migration and transition services to facilitate an orderly transaction of the operation of the Businesses to the Buyer in the 12-month period following consummation of the Transaction, and the Company and the Buyer entered into a sublease pursuant to which the Company will sublease to the Buyer one of the Company’s buildings (occupying approximately 12,500 square feet) at its Alhambra, California facility for the 12-month period immediately following the closing of the Transaction without payment of rent. With respect to the Buyer’s assumption of our manufacturing agreement with our electronics manufacturing services (“EMS”) provider for our cable TV products, the Company (i) made a payment to the EMS provider in the amount of approximately $0.4 million immediately prior to the closing of the transaction and (ii) provided a guaranty of PF’s and the Buyer’s obligations with respect to payment of certain long-term liabilities that were originally agreed to and set forth in the manufacturing agreement and assigned to PF and the Buyer in the Transaction, in an aggregate amount expected to equal up to approximately $5.5 million, approximately $4.3 million of which will not become payable, if at all, until January 2026, provided that if such guaranty is exercised by the EMS provider, the Company will have the right to require the Buyer to reassign to the Company all intellectual property assigned to the Buyer in the Transaction and the Company will have the right to recover damages from PF and the Buyer.\n\nChips Business Divestiture LOI\n\nOn October 24, 2023, the Company entered into a non-binding letter of intent with a buyer to sell substantially all of the assets and liabilities related to the Company’s chips business line, including assets related to the Company’s indium phosphide wafer fabrication operations.\n\n74\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors\n\nEMCORE Corporation:\n\nOpinions on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited EMCORE Corporation and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness, described below, on the achievement of the objectives in the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated December 27, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\n\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A material weakness related to ineffective controls over new or novel transactions as a result of ineffective communication has been identified and included in management’s assessment. The material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2023 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report on those consolidated financial statements.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n75\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\n/s/ KPMG LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2010. \n\nIrvine, California\n\nDecember 27, 2023 \n\n76\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors\n\nEMCORE Corporation:\n\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of EMCORE Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated December 27, 2023 expressed an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\nGoing Concern\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nCritical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\nNet realizable value of inventory\n\n77\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nAs discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, net inventory for continuing operations was $28.9 million at September 30, 2023 compared to $26.3 million at September 30, 2022, which is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company writes-down inventory once it has been determined that conditions exist that may not allow the inventory to be sold for its intended purpose or the inventory is determined to be excess or obsolete. The determination of the excess and obsolete inventory requires management to make assumptions related to estimates of future inventory demand and market conditions.\n\nWe identified the evaluation of net realizable value of inventory as a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate future inventory demand and market conditions, including whether past consumption and recent purchases used in the Company’s model were indicative of future inventory demand.\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the inventory process, including controls over the assumptions described above. We evaluated historical write down trends, historical sales of older inventory, and relevant changes in the overall business environment, including changes in key customers, product lines, and competitors, to assess the Company’s model. For a sample of products within inventory, we compared the Company’s determination of past consumption and recent purchases used to estimate future inventory demand of the product to supporting documentation.\n\nValuation of goodwill for the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit\n\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company performs goodwill impairment testing on an annual basis unless there are indications requiring a more frequent impairment test. During the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company performed a quantitative impairment analysis and determined the fair value of the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit using a combination of the discounted cash flow method and the guideline public company method. The Company recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $19.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2023. \n\nWe identified the evaluation of the fair value of the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit used in the goodwill impairment analysis as a critical audit matter. Specifically, revenue growth rates, discount rate, and multiples of revenue selected amongst a range of ratios derived from comparable entities with similar operations and economic characteristics, used to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit required challenging auditor judgment to evaluate as they represented subjective determinations of future market and economic conditions that were also sensitive to variation. Minor changes to these assumptions could have had a significant effect on the Company’s assessment of the fair value of the goodwill. Additionally, the audit effort associated with the evaluation of the fair value used in the goodwill impairment analysis required specialized skills and knowledge.\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the critical audit matter. This included controls related to the Company’s determination of the estimated fair value of the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit, including controls over the discount rate and selection of multiples of revenue of comparable entities. We evaluated the reasonableness of the Company’s revenue growth rates by comparing the growth rate assumptions to forecasted growth rates in the Company’s and its peer companies’ analyst reports. We compared the Company’s historical revenue forecasts to actual results to assess the Company’s ability to accurately forecast. In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\n\n•evaluating the discount rate used by management by comparing it against a discount rate range that was independently developed using publicly available market data for comparable entities\n\n•evaluating the selected multiples of revenue by comparing the underlying source information to publicly available market data\n\n•developing an estimate of the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit’s fair value using the reporting unit’s cash flow forecast and an independently developed discount rate and multiples of revenue, and comparing the result to the Company’s fair value estimate.\n\n/s/ KPMG LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2010. \n\nIrvine, California\n\nDecember 27, 2023 \n\n78\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nITEM 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\n\nNone.\n\nITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures.\n\nDisclosure Controls and Procedure\n\nManagement, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as a result of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.\n\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with the participation of management, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023 based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, due to the material weakness described below, the Company’s management has concluded that, as of September 30, 2023, the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\n\nThe Company determined that communications with regard to internal control objectives were not effective to require employees to report the existence of new or novel arrangements for technical accounting review, which resulted in the Company’s failure to design and implement effective controls over such transactions. \n\nThe control deficiency resulted in a material error associated with identification of the existence of certain insurance premium and supplier financing agreements, whereby (i) certain items on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet were underreported in “Other current assets” with a consistent dollar amount underreported for “Financing payable” within the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and (ii) certain items on the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows were underreported in Payments to financing payables within “Cash flows from financing activities” and similar such underreporting of such items in other assets in “Cash flows from operating activities”. This error has been corrected in the consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, and as a result, this material weakness did not result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements previously filed or included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nKPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and issued an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. KPMG LLP’s report is included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\n\nManagement’s Remediation Plan\n\nWe have identified and are implementing actions intended to improve the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures and will continue to do so until such remediation is complete. Management intends to remediate the material weakness described above primarily through a combination of (i) revisiting and clarifying, as needed, Company policies with respect to required communications when entering binding arrangements, and (ii) communicating to employees the importance of elevating new and/or novel arrangements for technical accounting oversight in their respective internal control areas. Such communication, including compliance with existing or revised policy, is expected to be delivered through employee training. \n\n79\n\n[Table of Contents](#i1ca1d681c4df4954b31763f468e36876_7)\n\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting other than as related to the identification of the material weakness described above. The design of processes, systems, and controls allows for remote execution with accessibility to secure data.\n\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\n\nManagement, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that disclosure controls or internal controls over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by individual acts, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based, in part, upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with associated policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\n\nITEM 9B. Other Information.\n\nNone.\n\nITEM 9C.

Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures reflect the Company’s core ongoing operating performance and facilitates\ncomparisons across reporting periods. The Company uses these measures when evaluating its financial results and for planning and forecasting of future periods. The Company believes that these non-GAAP\nmeasures are also useful to investors in assessing its operating performance. While the Company believes in the usefulness of these non-GAAP measures, there are limitations. Non-GAAP measures may not be\nreported by other companies in the Company’s industry and/or may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in calculation. Further, the Company\nbelieves that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures\nshould only be used to evaluate the Company’s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures and investors should consult the appendix of this presentation for reconciliations of\nthese non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure.\nTrademarks:\nEMCORE and the EMCORE logo are trademarks of EMCORE Corporation.
