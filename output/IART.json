The evaluation demonstrates an average cost savings of €419 to €1,279 per patient, when using Integra’s DuraSeal PEG dural sealant hydrogel instead of fibrin glue. Depending on the country, consistent cost reduction per procedure averaged around 22%, except for Italy where the analysis resulted in 15% consistent cost reduction per procedure.\n\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks after posterior cranial fossa (PCF) surgery are a significant cause of longer hospital stays, hospital readmissions and other costly post-surgical interventions. Current practice to seal the operative site after primary closure aid the healing process and protect the patient from CSF leaks widely relies on either fibrin glue or PEG hydrogel.2\n\nThe analysis, published in the _Journal of Comparative Effectiveness Research_ in February 2024, was conducted by Giuseppe Talamonti3, Jorn-Andre Horaczek4, Rafael Torrejon Torres5, Lisa Da Deppo6 and Marissa J Carter7. This economic analysis is based on a peer-reviewed prospective observational study of 200 patients that found PEG hydrogel was associated with positive clinical outcomes of PEG-based hydrogels8 compared to fibrin glue in PCF surgeries. A decision tree was developed on a previous U.S. model9 and input costs that were derived from European country-specific published sources. The results demonstrated that the clinical effectiveness of Integra’s DuraSeal Dural Sealant at preventing CSF leaks compared to fibrin glue after PCF surgery may help hospitals reduce costs.\n\nMarissa Carter, PhD, MA, president of Strategic Solutions, a consultancy specializing in clinical trials and real-world data health economic studies, said “This follow-up health economics study in the use of PEG hydrogel as a dural sealant to prevent CSF leaks and other complications resulting from PCF surgery is very timely. Most of all, it is gratifying to see the original model developed in the United States now successfully applied to five European countries in which cost savings are also demonstrated. Thanks to this collaboration between the manufacturer and clinicians, it is hopeful that these results will enable greater access to DuraSeal for patients undergoing surgery.”\n\nDuraSeal can be a viable, cost-effective alternative to fibrin glue in PCF surgery in Europe. As a direct consequence of the decreased occurrence of adverse CSF leaks and related complications, DuraSeal, despite its higher up-front cost, reduces overall PCF operative spend.\n\n“This recently published economic evaluation supports DuraSeal in the management of PCF surgery to our customers, providing strong evidence for healthcare professionals to reduce CSF leaks and cost-saving improvement for hospitals and healthcare systems,” said Harvinder Singh, Integra’s executive vice president and president, International. “This study outcome reinforces our commitment to our neuro access & repair strategy, innovating new treatment pathways, and restoring patient lives through technologies that transform surgical care.”\n\n**Abstract of the analysis and the full analysis** can be found [here](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=T5wGEuJBnEZkQEu6HB-Z-rrvWdbgGQKeonJcycTgfMp99f1k_T6JPcmJrX7mbwheB7YZ-MZx4TT_N-50Mm46fEfVyb3JJQHux_TF_lLF3QkuIXHNnSkfhLl11LGoAIIVkSWYaObCjBs2coXf1KiLhEEVFtDsDFaOO4GI_jp1TtdxFi1DZKolUgkpDHgX-XzEOA0T_uc23xw42e68HZ7ooQ==)\n\n**About Integra LifeSciences** At Integra LifeSciences, we are driven by our purpose of restoring patients’ lives.

Organic revenues consist of total revenues excluding the effects of currency exchange rates, revenues from current-period acquisitions and product divestitures. Organic revenues excluding Boston consist of total revenues, excluding (i) the effects of currency exchange rates, revenues from current-period acquisitions and product divestitures and (ii) revenues associated with Boston produced products including sales reported prior to the manufacturing stoppage and voluntary global recall of all products manufactured at the Company’s Boston, Massachusetts facility and distributed between March 1, 2018 and May 22, 2023, as previously disclosed in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 23, 2023 (the “recall”), and the impact of sales return provisions recorded. Adjusted EBITDA consists of GAAP net income excluding: (i) depreciation and amortization; (ii) other income (expense); (iii) interest income and expense; (iv) income tax expense (benefit); and (v) those operating expenses also excluded from adjusted net income. The measure of adjusted net income consists of GAAP net income, excluding: (i) structural optimization charges; (ii) divestiture, acquisition and integration-related charges; (iii) EU Medical Device Regulation-related charges; (iv) charges related to the recall and the transition of Boston-related manufacturing operations to the Company’s Braintree, Massachusetts facility; (v) intangible asset amortization expense; and (vi) income tax impact from adjustments. The measure of adjusted gross margin is calculated by dividing adjusted gross profit by total revenues. Adjusted gross profit consists of GAAP gross profit adjusted for: (i) structural optimization charges; (ii) divestiture, acquisition and integration-related charges; (iii) charges related to the recall and the transition of Boston-related manufacturing operations to the Company’s Braintree, Massachusetts facility; (iv) EU Medical Device Regulation-related charges; and (v) intangible asset amortization expense. The adjusted earnings per diluted share measure is calculated by dividing adjusted net income attributable to diluted shares by diluted weighted average shares outstanding. The measure of free cash flow consists of GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. The adjusted free cash flow conversion measure is calculated by dividing free cash flow by adjusted net income. The measure of net debt consists of GAAP total debt (excluding deferred financing costs) less short-term investments, cash and cash equivalents.\n\nReconciliations of GAAP revenues to organic revenues, GAAP revenues to organic revenues excluding Boston, GAAP net income to adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted net income, GAAP gross profit to adjusted gross profit, GAAP gross margin to adjusted gross margin, GAAP total debt to net debt, and GAAP earnings per diluted share to adjusted earnings per diluted share all for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the GAAP operating cash flow to free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow conversion for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, appear in the financial tables in this release.\n\nThe Company believes that the presentation of organic revenues and the other non-GAAP measures provide important supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to the Company's financial condition and results of operations. For further information regarding why Integra believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors, the specific manner in which management uses these measures, and some of the limitations associated with the use of these measures, please refer to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K regarding this earnings press release filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
