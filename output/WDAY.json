Prior period amounts have been recast for gains and losses on strategic investments to conform to this presentation. There was no impact to prior period amounts presented in this release for acquisition-related costs or realignment costs since no qualifying costs were incurred in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024.\n\n**_Non-GAAP Financial Measures_**\n\nTo provide investors and others with additional information regarding Workday's results, we have disclosed the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP diluted net income (loss) per share, and free cash flows. Workday has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this earnings release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP operating income (loss) and non-GAAP operating margin differ from GAAP in that they exclude share-based compensation expenses, employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions, amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related costs, and realignment costs. Non-GAAP diluted net income (loss) per share differs from GAAP in that it excludes share-based compensation expenses, employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions, amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related costs, realignment costs, gains and losses on strategic investments, and income tax effects. Free cash flows differ from GAAP cash flows from operating activities in that it treats capital expenditures as a reduction to cash flows.\n\nWorkday's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate Workday's financial performance. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures reflect Workday's ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in Workday's business. Management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating Workday's operating results and prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies.\n\nManagement believes excluding the following items from the GAAP Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations is useful to investors and others in assessing Workday's operating performance due to the following factors:\n\n  * _Share-based compensation expenses._ Share-based compensation primarily consists of non-cash expenses for employee restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan, and includes share-based compensation associated with acquisitions. Although share-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees and executives, this expense is determined using a number of factors, including our stock price, volatility, and forfeiture rates, that are beyond our control and generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period. Further, share-based compensation expenses are not reflective of the value ultimately received by the grant recipients.\n  * _Employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions_. We exclude the employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions in order to show the full effect that excluding share-based compensation expenses has on our operating results. Similar to share-based compensation expenses, this tax expense is dependent on our stock price and other factors that are beyond our control and do not correlate to the operation of our business.\n  * _Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets_. For business combinations, we generally allocate a portion of the purchase price to intangible assets. The amount of the allocation is based on estimates and assumptions made by management and is subject to amortization. The amount of purchase price allocated to intangible assets and the term of the related amortization can vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition and thus we do not believe this activity is reflective of our ongoing operations. Although we exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets from these non-GAAP financial measures, we believe that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation.\n  * _Acquisition-related costs._ Acquisition-related costs include direct transaction costs, such as due diligence and advisory fees, and certain compensation and integration-related expenses. We exclude the effects of acquisition-related costs as we believe these transaction-specific expenses are inconsistent in amount and frequency and do not correlate to the operation of our business.\n  * _Realignment costs._ Realignment costs are associated with a formal restructuring plan and are primarily related to employee severance, the closure of facilities, and cancellation of certain contracts. We exclude these expenses because they are not reflective of ongoing business and operating results.\n  * _Gains and losses on strategic investments._ Our strategic investments include investments in early stage companies that are valuable to Workday customers and complementary to Workday products. Gains and losses on strategic investments may result from observable price adjustments and impairment charges on non-marketable equity securities, ongoing mark-to-market adjustments on marketable equity securities, and the sale of equity investments. We do not rely on these securities to fund our ongoing operations nor do we actively trade publicly held securities, and therefore we do not consider the gains and losses on these strategic investments to be reflective of our ongoing operations.\n  * _Income tax effects._ We utilize a fixed long-term projected tax rate in our computation of the non-GAAP income tax provision to provide better consistency across the reporting periods. In projecting this long-term non-GAAP tax rate, we utilize a three-year financial projection that excludes the direct impact of the items excluded from GAAP income in calculating our non-GAAP income. The projected rate considers other factors such as our current operating structure, existing tax positions in various jurisdictions, and key legislation in major jurisdictions where we operate. For fiscal 2025 and 2024, we determined the projected non-GAAP tax rate to be 19%, which reflects currently available information, as well as other factors and assumptions. We will periodically re-evaluate this tax rate, as necessary, for significant events, relevant tax law changes, material changes in the forecasted geographic earnings mix, and any significant acquisitions.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, with regards to free cash flows, Workday's management believes that reducing cash provided by (used in) operating activities by capital expenditures is meaningful to investors and others because it provides an enhanced view of cash flow generation from the ongoing operations of our business, and it balances operating results, cash management, and capital efficiency.\n\nThe use of these non-GAAP measures have certain limitations as they do not reflect all items of expense or cash that affect Workday's operations. Workday compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Further, these non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Management encourages investors and others to review Workday's financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\n\n**Gartner Disclaimer**\n\nGartner does not endorse any vendor, product or service depicted in its research publications, and does not advise technology users to select only those vendors with the highest ratings or other designation.

On the call we have\nCarl Eschenbach, our CEO, Zane Rowe, our CFO, Doug Robinson, our Co-President, and\nDavid Somers, our Chief Product Officer. Following prepared remarks, we will take questions.\nOur press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website, where this call\nis being simultaneously webcast.\nBefore we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call,\nparticularly our guidance, are based on the information we have as of today, and include\nforward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand,\noperations and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and\nassumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to the press release\nand the risk factors in documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission,\nincluding our fiscal 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our most recent Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q for additional information on risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause\nactual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements.\nIn addition, during today’s call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe\nare useful as supplemental measures of Workday’s performance. These non-GAAP measures\nshould be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP results.\nYou can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including\nreconciliations with comparable GAAP results, in our earnings press release, in our investor\npresentation, and on the Investor Relations page of our website.\nThe webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 90 days on our company website\nunder the Investor Relations link. Additionally, the transcript of this call and our quarterly\ninvestor presentation will be posted on our Investor Relations website following this call. Also,\nthe Customers page of our website includes a list of selected customers and is updated\nmonthly.\nOur fourth quarter fiscal 2025 quiet period begins on January 15th, 2025. Unless otherwise\nstated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our\nfiscal 2024.\nWith that, I will hand the call over to Carl.\n1\nCEO Remarks\nThank you, Justin, and thank you all for joining us today.\nI’m pleased to report another quarter of solid financial performance in Q3, with 16% subscription\nrevenue growth and non-GAAP operating margins of 26%.\nThese results are a testament to the strong customer relationships we have across industries,\nthe growing demand of our AI innovations, and the power of our ecosystem around the world.\nMore and more organizations are consolidating on the Workday platform for a few key reasons:\nThey want to reduce total cost of ownership, simplify their operations, and harness the power of\nAI across our best-in-class HR and Finance solutions and provide employees with an amazing\nuser experience. Workday gives them the ultimate advantage.\nThat was evident in the growth we had in full suite, and in our net new wins, and customer\nexpansions across geographies, segments along with industries.\nSeveral industries were strong in the quarter, and government and higher education were two of\nthe standouts. Roughly 90% of the wins in these industries were full suite. In Q3 the Defense\nIntelligence Agency expanded its business with Workday, and Lake County Illinois, Maryland\nGeneral Assembly, New Jersey Institute of Technology, and University System of Georgia all\nchose Workday to modernize their systems and meet the rising expectations of their\nconstituents.\nThis quarter, Professional and Business Services became the third industry to exceed $1B in\nannual recurring revenue, alongside Financial Services and Retail and Hospitality. Advantage\nSolutions, Connells Limited and Flight Centre Travel Group all selected Workday.\nAnd in healthcare, we had a huge full suite win with CommonSpirit Health, one of the largest\nnonprofit healthcare systems in the U.S., as well as Community Health System and Valley\nChildren’s Healthcare.\nFrom a product perspective, our HCM solutions are really setting the pace when it comes to the\nfuture of work. In the quarter we had wins with Brookshire Grocery Company, IOI Group,\nProMach, Royal Mail, and TeamHealth, just to name a few.\nWe're also continuing to invest in our Financials business, and that’s driving demand for our full\nsuite. More than 35% of our new core customers in Q3 were full suite. And in Q3, we were\nagain named a Leader in the 2024 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Cloud HCM Suites for\n1,000+ Employee Enterprises1, Cloud ERP for Service-Centric Enterprises2, and Financial\nPlanning Software3.\nAnd speaking of Planning, that business had a great Q3. We either expanded or formed new\nrelationships with some fantastic organizations like Deloitte, the Fitness and Lifestyle Group,\nMotion Picture Association, and Tenet Healthcare. And we were thrilled to have AWS go live on\nPlanning in Q3!\nAI is top of mind for every CEO right now, and they're all looking for the right partner to guide\nthem through this transformation.\n2\nThat's where Workday comes in.\nOur customers know that an investment in Workday is an investment in AI, and we’re seeing a\nton of excitement and demand for our AI solutions. In Q3 alone, more than 30% of our customer\nexpansions involved one or more of our AI solutions, including Talent Optimization, Extend Pro\nand Recruiter Agent powered by HiredScore. Talent Optimization remains one of our fastest\ngrowing SKUs and it’s driving tangible value—customers have experienced up to a 39%\nreduction in turnover.\nRecruiter Agent, in particular, had a huge quarter, with wins at Johnson Controls, Cox\nEnterprises, and UofL Health. In fact, the team closed more new logos in Q3 than in its 12-year\nhistory, and our new ACV more than quadrupled compared to Q2. And what’s awesome is that\nRecruiter Agent is boosting the average selling price of our core recruiting solution by almost\n150%.\nIt’s clear that customers are ready to invest in AI that's built for their specific needs and delivers\nreal results. They want solutions that are easy to implement and provide value quickly, without\nneeding a ton of IT support. This growing demand shows the huge opportunity we have to grow\nand monetize this part of our business.\nSo, let’s talk about how we’re going to capture this opportunity with our innovation.\nWith more than 70 million users under contract generating more than 800 billion transactions a\nyear on our platform, our AI leverages the world’s largest and cleanest HR and Finance dataset.\nIn our industry, where decisions are high-stakes and complex, the quality and quantity of our\ndata is a critical differentiator. And the combination of this data—with our ability to understand\nthe context behind it—enables Workday to unlock value in a way no competitor can do.\nAt Rising, we unveiled Illuminate—the next generation of Workday AI. With Illuminate, we’re\nunlocking a whole new level of productivity and human potential by accelerating manual tasks,\nassisting every employee, and ultimately transforming entire business processes.\nAs part of Illuminate we launched a set of new AI agents that uniquely transform some of the\nmost complex business processes in HR and Finance—such as recruiting, expense\nmanagement and succession planning.\nRecruiter Agent is available now, Expenses Agent is expected to become available by the end\nof the year, and several more will soon follow.\nWe believe Optimize Agent, which is coming out next year, is going to be a true game-changer.\nIt pinpoints bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and areas where processes aren't running as smoothly\nas they could be. The possibilities with this are endless, and I'm fired up about it.\nBeyond the agents Workday is delivering, we're collaborating with our partners to support agent\nto agent communication for employee self-service needs. Salesforce is a great example here.\nSo is our recent partnership with Microsoft on its M365 Copilot Employee Self-Service Agent.\nWe also updated Workday Assistant, with our GenAI copilot. Employees can use it to ask\nquestions in natural language about anything from their pay and benefits to company policies—\nand get quick, personalized answers. More than 2,000 of our HCM customers are using the\n3\ncurrently available Workday Assistant to improve efficiency, including one of our customers who\nhas been able to cut down HR case volumes by almost 30%. We believe the new copilot will\nhelp drive even further increases in productivity, allowing employees and HR departments to\nfocus on more strategic work.\nCIOs get super excited when we talk about Workday Assistant. Other solutions out there require\norganizations to take sensitive data, like payroll info, and move it outside their core system.\nThat's a big risk no one wants to take.\nWith Workday, everything stays secure within our trusted platform.\nContinuing to accelerate our AI roadmap, we closed our acquisition of Evisort, a leading\ndocument intelligence platform. Consider this—Over 80% of business data is unstructured—\nmaking it difficult to search, analyze, or use effectively. This includes critical information locked\naway in contracts, invoices, and policy documents, just to name a few. With Evisort's powerful\nAI, our customers can now unlock critical insights from this untapped data, empowering them to\nmake faster, more informed business decisions.\nThe strength of the Workday platform continues to draw interest from customers and partners\nalike. We've now got over 1,000 customers building their own custom apps on our platform\nusing Extend, making it one of our fastest-growing products ever. In fact, new ACV for Extend\nmore than doubled within the quarter compared to last year.\nExtend Pro, which allows you to build AI-first apps with our AI Gateway and Developer co-pilot,\nis having an even greater impact, with its average selling price double that of Extend\nEssentials.\nOur partner ecosystem has grown nearly 5x in just 18 months and is more diverse than ever.\nOur partners are becoming increasingly critical to our growth, sourcing over 10% of our net new\nACV in Q3, and a similar percentage of our new pipeline.\nWe’ve seen rapid adoption of our \"Built on Workday\" program, which we launched less than 6\nmonths ago. We've already got over 40 partners on board, and partners like Kainos are\ngenerating revenue from it.\nAt Rising, we announced Workday Wellness, which gives companies real-time insights into how\ntheir employees are using their benefits. This helps them design more tailored benefits\nprograms right within Workday HCM to improve the overall employee experience. We're excited\nto have Guardian, The Hartford, Mutual of Omaha, and Unum already signed on as strategic\npartners.\nInternational growth continues to be one of Workday’s most compelling opportunities. This past\nquarter, I spent time with customers and our amazing Workmates in the UK, Ireland, Germany,\nFrance, and Japan. The energy and excitement is incredible.\nIn Q3, we formed a new strategic partnership with NTT Data, one of the most influential system\nintegrators in Japan.\nAnd in APAC, we formed new relationships with Estia, a major Australian aged care provider,\nand Flight Centre, a leading Australian travel and leisure brand. We also expanded our footprint\nwith United Overseas Bank, one of the largest banks in Singapore.\n4\nOver in EMEA, we faced the same deal scrutiny we’ve called out the last few quarters, but we\nhad our largest-ever public sector win with the Department for Science, Innovation and\nTechnology in the UK. That's generating a lot of interest from other UK public agencies. We also\nhad major wins with big enterprises like Decathlon in France and Goldbeck in Germany.\nAnd we’re gearing up for Rising EMEA in Amsterdam in just a few weeks!\nThe relationships we're building around the world point to the significant long-term potential of\nour international business. While only 25% of our revenue comes from outside the U.S. today,\nwe're laying the groundwork for something much bigger.\nBefore I wrap up, I wanted to give you a quick update on the team. We recently announced that\nDoug Robinson, who has been an incredible leader over the past 14 years, will be retiring at the\nend of the fiscal year. I can’t thank Doug enough for the tremendous impact he’s had on\nWorkday. We’re excited to have him continue on as an advisor to the company.\nWith Doug's retirement, I'm thrilled to welcome Rob Enslin to Workday as our new President,\nChief Commercial Officer. Workday continues to be a magnet for great talent and Rob is\nanother great example. He’s a world-class executive with 30 years of experience in the\nenterprise space. He brings fantastic customer and partner relationships and a proven track\nrecord of success. He's the perfect person to lead our go-to-market efforts as we move into our\nnext phase of growth.\nAs you can see, it was a busy quarter!\nWe have a clear target between now and FY27 of driving mid-teens subscription revenue\ngrowth while expanding non-GAAP operating margins to 30%. We plan to achieve this by\ncontinuing to innovate and take share in our core markets, while also streamlining operations\nacross the company.\nBut what really excites me is the opportunity we have ahead of us as we lead our customers\nthrough the AI revolution and help them transform their organizations for the future of work.\nI'm incredibly grateful to my Workmates for their contributions this quarter. With our amazing\nculture, continuous innovation, and the trust of our customers, Workday is in a fantastic position\nto drive sustainable, profitable growth at scale.\nThanks again, and to those of you in the U.S., Happy Thanksgiving!\nWith that, I’ll hand it over to Zane.\nCFO Remarks\nThanks, Carl. And thank you to everyone for joining today’s call. In Q3, we continued to make\nprogress across a number of our key growth areas, as we lay the foundation for durable,\nprofitable growth at scale.\n5\nSubscription revenue in the third quarter was $1.959 billion, up 16%. Professional services\nrevenue was $201 million, resulting in total revenue of $2.160 billion, growth of 16%.\nU.S. revenue in Q3 totaled $1.62 billion, and international revenue totaled $537 million, both\ngrowing 16%.\n12-month subscription revenue backlog, or cRPO, was $6.98 billion at the end of Q3, increasing\n15%.\nTotal subscription revenue backlog at the end of the quarter was $22.19 billion, up 20%.\nGross revenue retention rates remained strong at 98%.\nOur non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $569 million, resulting in a non-GAAP\noperating margin of 26.3%.\nQ3 operating cash flow was $406 million, in line with our expectations though down year-over-\nyear, impacted by the stronger-than-expected collections activity we called out in Q2.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased $157 million dollars of our shares at an average price of\n$242.42 per share. We had $902 million in remaining authorization under our buyback program\nas of quarter end.\nWe ended Q3 with $7.2 billion in cash and marketable securities.\nAs of October 31st, headcount stood at nearly 20,500 workmates around the globe, as we\ncontinue to hire talent across targeted growth areas.\nA few of our strategic wins in Q3 have future product deliverables in FY26. This slightly impacts\nour near-term results, as these wins won’t fully benefit subscription revenue until next year.\nWe expect Q4 FY25 subscription revenue to be $2.025 billion, growth of 15%, and full-year\nsubscription revenue of $7.703 billion, an increase of 17%. We expect Q4 cRPO growth to be\nbetween 13.5% and 14.5%.\nWe expect Q4 professional services revenue of approximately $155 million, resulting in full year\nprofessional services revenue of $712 million.\nWe continue to balance targeted investments in key growth areas with increased focus on\ncompanywide efficiencies. As a result, we are raising our FY25 non-GAAP operating margin\nguidance to 25.5%, and we anticipate a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 25.0% in\nQ4.\nGAAP operating margin for both the fourth quarter and full year is expected to be approximately\n20 percentage points lower than the non-GAAP rate.\n6\nThe estimated FY25 non-GAAP tax rate remains at 19%.\nWe are maintaining our FY25 operating cash flow expectations of $2.350 billion, and we now\nexpect capital expenditures of approximately $300 million.\nWe are making good progress across our key growth initiatives, in particular with our partner\necosystem and developing AI opportunities, supporting our medium-term target of mid-teens\ngrowth. As an early view, we anticipate FY26 subscription revenue of approximately $8.8 billion,\nor about 14% growth.\nWe expect our first quarter subscription revenue growth to be slightly lower than our overall\ngrowth rate for FY26. This is largely due to the impact of the leap year, which creates just over a\none point headwind to Q1 subscription revenue growth. We expect a slightly higher growth rate\nin the second half, driven in part by emerging AI opportunities and deliverables tied to strategic\nwins from the third quarter which I referenced earlier.\nWe are investing for growth, while at the same time focused on driving efficiencies across the\nbusiness.

Prior period amounts have been recast for gains and losses on strategic investments to conform to this presentation. There was no impact to prior period amounts presented in this release for acquisition-related costs or realignment costs since no qualifying costs were incurred in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024.\n\n**_Non-GAAP Financial Measures_**\n\nTo provide investors and others with additional information regarding Workday's results, we have disclosed the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP diluted net income (loss) per share, and free cash flows. Workday has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this earnings release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP operating income (loss) and non-GAAP operating margin differ from GAAP in that they exclude share-based compensation expenses, employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions, amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related costs, and realignment costs. Non-GAAP diluted net income (loss) per share differs from GAAP in that it excludes share-based compensation expenses, employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions, amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related costs, realignment costs, gains and losses on strategic investments, and income tax effects. Free cash flows differ from GAAP cash flows from operating activities in that it treats capital expenditures as a reduction to cash flows.\n\nWorkday's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate Workday's financial performance. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures reflect Workday's ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in Workday's business. Management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating Workday's operating results and prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies.\n\nManagement believes excluding the following items from the GAAP Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations is useful to investors and others in assessing Workday's operating performance due to the following factors:\n\n  * _Share-based compensation expenses._ Share-based compensation primarily consists of non-cash expenses for employee restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan, and includes share-based compensation associated with acquisitions. Although share-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees and executives, this expense is determined using a number of factors, including our stock price, volatility, and forfeiture rates, that are beyond our control and generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period. Further, share-based compensation expenses are not reflective of the value ultimately received by the grant recipients.\n  * _Employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions_. We exclude the employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions in order to show the full effect that excluding share-based compensation expenses has on our operating results. Similar to share-based compensation expenses, this tax expense is dependent on our stock price and other factors that are beyond our control and do not correlate to the operation of our business.\n  * _Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets_. For business combinations, we generally allocate a portion of the purchase price to intangible assets. The amount of the allocation is based on estimates and assumptions made by management and is subject to amortization. The amount of purchase price allocated to intangible assets and the term of the related amortization can vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition and thus we do not believe this activity is reflective of our ongoing operations. Although we exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets from these non-GAAP financial measures, we believe that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation.\n  * _Acquisition-related costs._ Acquisition-related costs include direct transaction costs, such as due diligence and advisory fees, and certain compensation and integration-related expenses. We exclude the effects of acquisition-related costs as we believe these transaction-specific expenses are inconsistent in amount and frequency and do not correlate to the operation of our business.\n  * _Realignment costs._ Realignment costs are associated with a formal restructuring plan and are primarily related to employee severance, the closure of facilities, and cancellation of certain contracts. We exclude these expenses because they are not reflective of ongoing business and operating results.\n  * _Gains and losses on strategic investments._ Our strategic investments include investments in early stage companies that are valuable to Workday customers and complementary to Workday products. Gains and losses on strategic investments may result from observable price adjustments and impairment charges on non-marketable equity securities, ongoing mark-to-market adjustments on marketable equity securities, and the sale of equity investments. We do not rely on these securities to fund our ongoing operations nor do we actively trade publicly held securities, and therefore we do not consider the gains and losses on these strategic investments to be reflective of our ongoing operations.\n  * _Income tax effects._ We utilize a fixed long-term projected tax rate in our computation of the non-GAAP income tax provision to provide better consistency across the reporting periods. In projecting this long-term non-GAAP tax rate, we utilize a three-year financial projection that excludes the direct impact of the items excluded from GAAP income in calculating our non-GAAP income. The projected rate considers other factors such as our current operating structure, existing tax positions in various jurisdictions, and key legislation in major jurisdictions where we operate. For fiscal 2025 and 2024, we determined the projected non-GAAP tax rate to be 19%, which reflects currently available information, as well as other factors and assumptions. We will periodically re-evaluate this tax rate, as necessary, for significant events, relevant tax law changes, material changes in the forecasted geographic earnings mix, and any significant acquisitions.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, with regards to free cash flows, Workday's management believes that reducing cash provided by (used in) operating activities by capital expenditures is meaningful to investors and others because it provides an enhanced view of cash flow generation from the ongoing operations of our business, and it balances operating results, cash management, and capital efficiency.\n\nThe use of these non-GAAP measures have certain limitations as they do not reflect all items of expense or cash that affect Workday's operations. Workday compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Further, these non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Management encourages investors and others to review Workday's financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\n\n**Gartner Disclaimer**\n\nGartner does not endorse any vendor, product or service depicted in its research publications, and does not advise technology users to select only those vendors with the highest ratings or other designation.
