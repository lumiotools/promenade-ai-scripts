Additionally, the Company strengthened its cash balance in the second half by raising a total of $7.5 million in September through its IPO, including proceeds from the over-allotment option, before deductions.\n\n\n\n**Performance Analysis:**\n\n  * The reduction in revenue was largely attributed to the global economic downturn, particularly impacting the home building and renovation sectors, and the ongoing geopolitical tensions from the Russian-Ukrainian war.\n  * Gross profit margin witnessed a decline to 20.6% in the first half of 2023.\n  * Selling and distribution expenses saw a decrease of 30.4%, primarily due to lower shipping costs resulting from the decreased revenue.\n  * Basic and diluted Loss Per Share were recorded at approximately $0.01 for the first half of 2023.\n\n\n\n**Strategic Initiatives and Future Outlook:**\n\n  * Nature Wood is actively pursuing new opportunities in the burgeoning market of carbon credit sales, anticipating this venture to contribute significantly to future revenues with high margins.\n  * \"In the face of ongoing global economic challenges and various geopolitical tensions, including the significant impact of the Russian-Ukrainian war, our business has continued to encounter headwinds in the latter half of 2023. These broad economic and political factors have notably affected demand in the construction and home renovation markets, which are crucial for our product line. Consequently, we foresee that these adverse conditions will significantly impact our financial performance for the second half of the year,\" stated Mr. Jianjun Zeng, Chairman of Nature Wood.\n\n\n\n\"However, looking beyond the immediate horizon, our long-term outlook is marked by optimism and confidence. We recognize the immense potential in our primary markets, underpinned by expanding middle classes and low consumer debt levels. Our strategic focus on emerging opportunities, such as the high-margin carbon credit market, aligns with global trends towards sustainability and positions us favorably for future growth. We remain steadfast in our commitment to operational excellence and innovation, ensuring that Nature Wood is well-equipped to capitalize on the evolving market dynamics and deliver value to our stakeholders.\"\n\n**Operational Highlights:**\n\n  * The Company has intensified its focus on streamlining operations and reducing overhead costs to maintain financial stability and support future growth.\n  * Nature Wood continues to leverage its vertically integrated model to optimize supply chain efficiency and enhance product quality.\n\n\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n  * The detailed financial statements and analysis can be accessed in the Company's filings with the SEC and on the Nature Wood website.\n\n\n\nAbout Nature Wood Group Limited\n\nNature Wood Group Limited is a global leading vertically-integrated forestry company that focuses on FSC business operations, timber and wood products industry.
