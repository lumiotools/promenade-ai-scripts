A mission greater than making money for its shareholders. Or its owners. But that’s exactly what Sezzle is. A company with a mission. With values and a purpose. A company driven to financially empower the next generation. A generation comfortable with technology, but uncomfortable with traditional financial institutions. A generation of artists, entrepreneurs and athletes. That is our purpose. Our reason for being. And we’re proud to have so many amazing partners joining us on our journey. Sezzle is committed to digital accessibility, and to conforming to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.essentialaccessibility.com/blog/web-content-accessibility-guidelines-wcag/) 2.1, Level AA and complying with the Department of Justice’s [Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Standards](https://www.essentialaccessibility.com/blog/ada-guidelines-compliance/) for Accessible Design, and other applicable regulations. To accomplish this, we have partnered with eSSENTIAL Accessibility to administer our accessibility program and oversee its governance. Their accessibility program evaluates and audits our digital products on an ongoing basis in accordance with best practices and is supported by a diverse team of accessibility professionals, including users of assistive technologies. The platform, moreover, goes beyond minimum compliance requirements by making an [assistive CX technology application](https://www.essentialaccessibility.com/sezzle/) available to customers who have trouble typing, gesturing, moving a mouse, or reading. The application is free to download and it incorporates tools such as mouse and keyboard replacements, voice recognition, speech enablement, hands-free/touch-free navigation, and more. We want to hear from you if you encounter any accessibility barriers on our digital properties. Please contact our Customer Support at [+1-888-540-1867](tel:+1-888-540-1867). \n"
