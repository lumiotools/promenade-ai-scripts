(NASDAQ: TWIN)** today reported results for the first quarter ended September 27, 2024.\n\n**_Fiscal First Quarter 2025 Highlights_**\n\n  * _Sales increased 14.7% year-over-year to $72.9 million_\n  *  _Gross margin of 26.5%, expanded 30 basis points over prior year_\n  *  _Net loss attributable to Twin Disc was ($2.8) million and EBITDA* of $1.7 million, accounting for a ($1.1) million currency loss_\n  *  _Robust six-month backlog of $144.3 million supported by healthy ongoing demand_\n\n\n\n**_CEO Perspective_**\n\n“We delivered double-digit revenue growth in the first quarter, primarily driven by the acquisition of Katsa Oy in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, along with continued strength in Marine and Propulsion. Veth remains well-positioned as we meet solid demand with inventory strategically built up throughout the prior year. While a slowdown in Asian Oil and Gas markets impacted Land-Based Transmissions, we are encouraged by stabilization in Industrial, supported by healthy order trends. Additionally, the integration of Katsa is progressing ahead of plan, and is expected to contribute meaningfully to performance in both Marine and Propulsion and Industrial,” commented John H. Batten, President and Chief Executive Officer of Twin Disc. “We maintain a cautiously optimistic outlook for fiscal 2025 and expect to continue capturing healthy end market demand to drive growth, strengthening our long-term financial position,” concluded Mr. Batten.\n\n**_First Quarter Results_**\n\nSales for the fiscal 2025 first quarter increased 14.7% year-over-year to $72.9 million, driven by the addition of Katsa Oy, along with strength in the Company’s Marine and Propulsion Systems and Industrial product segments.\n\nSales by product group (certain amounts have been reclassified from Marine and Propulsion to Other):\n\n**Product Group**| **Q1 FY25 Sales**| **Q1 FY24 Sales**| **Change (%)**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**(Thousands of $):**  \nMarine and Propulsion Systems| $| 42,100 | $| 34,255 | 22.9| %  \nLand-Based Transmissions| 17,284 | 18,577 | -7.0| %  \nIndustrial| 9,169 | 5,685 | 61.3| %  \nOther| 4,344 | 5,037 | -13.8| %  \n**Total**|  $| 72,897 | $| 63,554 | 14.7| %  \n  \nTwin Disc delivered double-digit growth year-over-year in the European and Latin American regions. The distribution of sales across geographical regions shifted, with a greater proportion of sales coming from the Europe and Other regions, which include the Middle East and South America, with a lower proportion of sales coming from North America.\n\nGross profit increased 16.1% to $19.3 million compared to $16.6 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. First quarter gross margin increased approximately 30 basis points to 26.5% from the prior year period, reflecting the benefit of incremental volume partially offset by an unfavorable product mix.\n\nMarketing, engineering and administrative (ME&A) expense increased by $2.6 million, or 15.1%, to $19.5 million, compared to $16.9 million in the prior year quarter. The increased ME&A expense was primarily driven by the addition of Katsa, an adjustment to stock compensation expense, and an inflationary impact on wages and benefits.\n\nNet loss attributable to Twin Disc for the quarter was ($2.8) million, or ($0.20) per diluted share, compared to net loss attributable to Twin Disc of ($1.2) million, or ($0.09) per diluted share, for the first fiscal quarter of 2024. The year-over-year change was driven by an increase in Other Expense ($1.5 million) related to a currency loss ($1.1 million) and an increase in the amortization of the net actuarial loss related to the Company’s domestic defined benefit pension plan ($0.5 million). Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) were $1.7 million in the first quarter, down 23.0% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nOn a consolidated basis, the backlog of orders to be shipped over the next six months is approximately $144.3 million, compared to $133.7 million at the end of the fourth quarter. As a percentage of six-month backlog, inventory increased from 97.6% at the end of the fourth quarter, to 99.7% at the end of the first quarter. Compared to the first fiscal quarter of 2024, cash decreased 18.2% to $16.7 million, total debt increased 37.6% to $29.8 million, and net debt* increased $11.9 million to $13.1 million. The increase was primarily attributable to higher long-term debt related to the Katsa acquisition.\n\n**_CFO Perspective_**\n\nJeffrey S. Knutson, Vice President of Finance, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary stated, \"Our team has maintained its focus on capturing demand to deliver sales growth in the quarter. We saw a near-term impact to operating cash generation, largely due to a combination of increased inventories and a shift in order timing by certain customers. Moving ahead, we are well-positioned to deliver improved free cash flow, strengthening the balance sheet as we strive to meet our updated financial targets.\"\n\n**_Discussion of Results_**\n\nTwin Disc will host a conference call to discuss these results and to answer questions at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time on November 6, 2024. The live audio webcast will be available on Twin Disc’s website at [https://ir.twindisc.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=r65FZoZLFjhARw7rc2gl0twi3F3Nmj7bCPPFX8Jda29VlwpIm4BvHdK3_j-j4Azdf1tnQQS6-O3ae8UaoawcyQPgI6yBc6q4X3LdfamJ9tU=).

The words “anticipates,” “believes,” “intends,” “estimates,” and “expects,” or similar anticipatory expressions, usually identify forward-looking statements. The Company intends that such forward-looking statements qualify for the safe harbors from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from current expectations. Such risks and uncertainties include the impact of general economic conditions and the cyclical nature of many of the Company’s product markets; foreign currency risks and other risks associated with the Company’s international sales and operations; the ability of the Company to successfully implement price increases to offset increasing commodity costs; the ability of the Company to generate sufficient cash to pay its indebtedness as it becomes due; and the possibility of unforeseen tax consequences and the impact of tax reform in the U.S. or other jurisdictions. These and other risks are described under the caption “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of the Company’s most recent Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as supplemented in subsequent periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, the making of such statements should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the results expressed therein will be achieved. The Company assumes no obligation, and disclaims any obligation, to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events, new information, or otherwise.\n\n**_*Non-GAAP_** **_Financial_** **_Information_**\n\nFinancial information excluding the impact of asset impairments, restructuring charges, foreign currency exchange rate changes and the impact of acquisitions, if any, in this press release are not measures that are defined in U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). These items are measures that management believes are important to adjust for in order to have a meaningful comparison to prior and future periods and to provide a basis for future projections and for estimating our earnings growth prospects. Non-GAAP measures are used by management as a performance measure to judge profitability of our business absent the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and acquisitions. Management analyzes the company’s business performance and trends excluding these amounts. These measures, as well as EBITDA, provide a more consistent view of performance than the closest GAAP equivalent for management and investors. Management compensates for this by using these measures in combination with the GAAP measures. The presentation of the non-GAAP measures in this press release are made alongside the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n\n**_Definitions_**\n\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) is calculated as net earnings or loss excluding interest expense, the provision or benefit for income taxes, depreciation, and amortization expenses.\n\nNet debt is calculated as total debt less cash.\n\nInvestors:Riveron[TwinDiscIR@Riveron.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=YkrLmEDR3wphNcLxVWq8ABq_DxqqHRexmE4ghE2vZg8zL9-9A16tbL64K7k-QOFvwOSfhlN7EvPp7mcBnwf15f_spQBuK5-tH5oNrcme3J4=)\n\nSource: Twin Disc, Incorporated\n\n**CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND**  \n---  \n**COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)**  \n(In thousands, except per-share data;
