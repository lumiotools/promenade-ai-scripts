(Nasdaq: VNET) (\"VNET\" or the \"Company\"), a leading carrier- and cloud-neutral internet data center services provider in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n\"We achieved strong third quarter results mainly driven by our wholesale IDC business,\" said Josh Sheng Chen, Founder, Executive Chairperson and interim Chief Executive Officer of VNET. \"Our wholesale IDC business maintained its strong growth momentum as we capitalized on rising AI-driven demand. We also continued attracting high-quality customers during the third quarter, with six new order wins totaling 84MW. Notably, we won a new wholesale order from an Internet customer for 32MW at our Huailai IDC Campus, one of our green computing clusters in Hebei province. Moving forward, we will continue to develop our high-performance data centers and green business, providing reliable, premium IDC services to meet market demand. Propelling VNET's high-quality, sustainable development remains our priority as we strive to deliver value to all of our stakeholders.\" \n\nQiyu Wang, Chief Financial Officer of VNET, commented, \"In the third quarter, we remained focused on high-quality revenue businesses with high margins. Our total net revenues increased by 12.4% year over year to RMB2.12 billion, mainly driven by remarkable wholesale revenue growth of 86.4% year over year. Our adjusted EBITDA also grew by 17.1% year over year to RMB594.8 million in the third quarter of 2024. We previously reported adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2023 at RMB507.9 million. Such figure included VAT surplus deduction benefit of RMB13.3 million, which is now considered non-continuable due to the termination of preferential tax policies since January 1, 2024 (the \"Discontinued VAT Benefits\"). The year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA would be 20.2% if the Discontinued VAT Benefits were excluded from the adjusted EBITDA calculation for the same period last year. We also aim to enter a definitive agreement with one of China's leading insurance companies by the end of 2024 to form a pre-REITs fund. The fund will feature the first and second phases of our Taicang IDC Campus as the underlying assets, with us retaining approximately a 51% interest in the fund. This will further strengthen our cash reserves and support our sustainable development. Looking ahead, we will continue strengthening our core capabilities and capitalizing on AI-driven opportunities to create long-term shareholder value.\"\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Total net revenues increased by 12.4% to RMB2.12 billion (US$302.2 million) from RMB1.89 billion in the same period of 2023.\n    * Net revenues from the IDC business[1] increased by 18.4% to RMB1.50 billion (US$213.5 million) from RMB1.27 billion in the same period of 2023.\n      * Net revenues from the wholesale IDC business (\"wholesale revenues\") increased by 86.4% to RMB523.0 million (US$74.5 million) from RMB280.6 million in the same period of 2023.\n      * Net revenues from the retail IDC business (\"retail revenues\") decreased slightly by 1.0% to RMB975.5 million (US$139.0 million) from RMB984.9 million in the same period of 2023.\n    * Net revenues from the non-IDC business[2] increased by 0.2% to RMB622.3 million (US$88.7 million) from RMB621.4 million in the same period of 2023.\n  * Adjusted cash gross profit (non-GAAP) increased by 16.6% to RMB860.7 million (US$122.6 million) from RMB738.4 million in the same period of 2023.

Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, our IDC business was subdivided into wholesale IDC business and retail IDC business according to the nature and scale of our data center projects. Prior to 2024, the subdivision was based on customer contract types.  \n---  \n[2] Non-IDC business consists of cloud services and VPN services.  \n[3] For wholesale IDC business, certain projects hosted in our E-JS02 data center with an aggregate of 27MW capacity were excluded and are expected to be continuously excluded from in-service wholesale due to pending commercial discussion with the client. Such projects were included as in-service wholesale from the first quarter of 2021 to the fourth quarter of 2023, given that such projects had been delivered to the client based on the terms of the MOU.  \n[4] Utilization rate is calculated by dividing capacity utilized by customers by the capacity in service.  \n[5] Mature wholesale capacity refers to wholesale data centers in which utilization rate is at or above 80%.  \n[6] Ramp-up wholesale capacity refers to wholesale data centers in which utilization rate is below 80%.  \n[7] Total capacity committed is the capacity committed to customers pursuant to customer agreements remaining in effect.  \n[8] Commitment rate is calculated by total capacity committed divided by total capacity in service.  \n[9] Total capacity pre-committed is the capacity under construction which is pre-committed to customers pursuant to customer agreements remaining in effect.  \n[10] Pre-commitment rate is calculated by total capacity pre-committed divided by total capacity under construction.  \n[11] For retail IDC business, since the first quarter of 2024, we have excluded a certain number of reserved cabinets from the capacity in service. Reserved cabinets refer to those that have not been utilized on a large scale, those that are planned to be closed, or those that are planned to be further upgraded. As of September 30, 2023, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2024, 4,426, 4,150, and 4,150 reserved cabinets, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of utilization rate of retail IDC business capacity.  \n[12] Mature retail capacity refers to retail data centers that came into service prior to the past 24 months.  \n[13] Ramp-up retail capacity refers to retail data centers that came into service within the past 24 months, or mature retail data centers that have undergone improvements within the past 24 months.  \n  \n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**TOTAL NET REVENUES:** Total net revenues in the third quarter of 2024 were RMB2.12 billion (US$302.2 million), representing an increase of 12.4% from RMB1.89 billion in the same period of 2023.

Specifically, the Company now expects total net revenues for 2024 to be between RMB8,000 million to RMB8,100 million, representing year-over-year growth of 7.9% to 9.3%, and adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) to be in the range of RMB2,280 million to RMB2,300 million, representing year-over-year growth of 11.8% to 12.8%. Such figure in the third quarter of 2023 adjusted EBITDA included Discontinued VAT Benefits of RMB13.3 million. The year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA would be 16.4% to 17.4% if the Discontinued VAT Benefits were excluded from the adjusted EBITDA calculation for the same period last year.\n\nThe forecast reflects the Company's current and preliminary views on the market and its operational conditions and is subject to change.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company's management will host an earnings conference call at 8:00 PM U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, November 20, 2024, or 9:00 AM Beijing Time on Thursday, November 21, 2024.\n\nFor participants who wish to join the call, please access the links provided below to complete the online registration process.\n\nEnglish line:<https://s1.c-conf.com/diamondpass/10043189-1ej64l.html>\n\nChinese line (listen-only mode): <https://s1.c-conf.com/diamondpass/10043190-a2lrfs.html>\n\nParticipants can choose between the English and Chinese options for pre-registration above.
