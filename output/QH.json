(\"Panasonic Navinfo\"), a joint venture company. The collaboration aims to strengthen export support for new energy vehicles (NEVs) through technological and service innovation, improve full-process management, and help Chinese NEVs excel in the global market.\n\nThe used NEV market holds vast potential but faces challenges such as difficulty in assessing battery conditions, lack of transaction security, and limited after-sales support. To address these issues, Quhuo International offers repair, inspection, value-added reconditioning, and cross-border B2B trade services for domestic used car and NEV manufacturers as well as global dealers, driving optimization and upgrades in the industry.\n\nQuhuo International, founded in 2023, exported over 13,000 vehicles to regions including the Middle East, Africa, and South America by the end of the same year, with 9,836 successfully delivered. With reconditioning bases in Guangzhou and Chengdu and partnerships with 58 global distributors, Quhuo International has built a strong supply chain network. Quhuo International is also developing the Carnuxt trading platform to improve the reliability and efficiency of used car exports.\n\nPanasonic Navinfo supports export assurance with its digital lithium battery lifecycle management solution, offering health diagnostics, safety risk alerts, and extended battery life to meet the high standards of NEV exports. Leveraging Panasonic's 100 years of battery expertise and 30 years of lithium battery experience, Panasonic Navinfo can analyze all major battery types on the market.\n\nThe 7th CIIE, a major platform for global trade, hosted 3,496 exhibitors from 129 countries and regions, offering an ideal setting for international collaboration. The partnership with Panasonic Navinfo leverages CIIE's reach, combining Quhuo International's expertise in used car exports with Panasonic Navinfo's advanced battery technology to enhance NEV export support and drive high-quality industry growth.\n\nQuhuo International and Panasonic Navinfo will collaborate on key NEV export stages. The partnership will introduce Panasonic Navinfo's battery screening services to ensure exported vehicles meet international standards, enhancing transaction security and vehicle value. Post-export, Panasonic Navinfo will offer battery monitoring services, including real-time tracking, early risk alerts, and after-sales support, to improve customer experience. Together with upstream and downstream partners, the two companies aim to maximize battery lifecycle value and drive green growth in the NEV trade market.\n\nThe parties plan to leverage innovation in technology and services to boost the competitiveness of exported used vehicles, foster industry value chain synergy, and expand global market reach. Looking ahead, the two companies will deepen their collaboration to develop industry standards, attract more partners, and enhance the ecosystem, driving further growth in China's NEV exports.\n\nMr. Bo Liang, General Manager of Quhuo International, said: \"Quhuo International is dedicated to improving the full-process assurance system for used NEV exports. This collaboration with Panasonic Navinfo brings advanced battery testing and assurance technologies, enhancing vehicle safety and customer confidence, and helping more high-quality Chinese NEVs enter global markets.\"\n\nLeslie Yu, Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Quhuo Limited, stated: \"Quhuo International prioritizes innovation in technology and services to create a win-win environment for manufacturers, dealers, and consumers. This partnership is aimed to strengthen support for NEV exports. Moving forward, we will refine export processes and collaborate with more partners to promote the sustainable growth of Chinese NEVs in global markets.\"\n\nAbout Quhuo Limited\n\nQuhuo Limited (NASDAQ: QH) (\"Quhuo\" or the \"Company\") is a leading gig economy platform focusing on local life services in China.

According to data released by Quhuo, GMV for the 7-day period was up 92% year-over-year, with average daily GMV up 123%. Peak occupancy reached 90% of available rooms.\n\nAccording to estimates from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of China, approximately 765 million domestic trips were made during the National Day holiday in 2024, a 5.9% increase year-over-year. In response to this travel surge, Chengtu initiated an early business upgrade in September, focusing on enhancing guest experiences and leveraging innovative strategies to stand out from the competition.\n\nOn September 1, 2024, Chengtu launched its own booking platform, offering 2,000 high-quality listings across 51 cities in China. Chengtu also offered six functional room types—Care, E-sports, Business Travel, Family, Cinema, and Elegant Retreat—designed to meet different consumer needs. The first batch of rooms was piloted successfully in Tianjin, marking Chengtu's shift from property management to value creation. These tailored options allow Chengtu to offer customized accommodation solutions for a variety of customers.\n\nMoreover, Chengtu stays focused on consumer needs, continually improving service quality and guest experience. Chengtu has identified key concerns for homestay users: accurate property listings, easy booking, fair pricing, and clean, safe accommodations. Chengtu has taken several steps to address these priorities.\n\nFor property listings, Chengtu uses professional photographers for on-site shoots and provides detailed descriptions, including room themes, amenities, transportation, dining, and nearby attractions. This helps guests easily plan their trips with a clear understanding of the property before booking. For booking channels, Chengtu has simplified the process with its new platform. Guests can book through Chengtu's mini program or third-party platforms for a seamless experience. As for pricing, Chengtu ensures fairness, prohibiting price hikes or cancellations during holidays, and uses a dynamic pricing system to match market demand. It also runs promotions like \"Trial Stay Days\", offering quality accommodations at discounted rates.\n\nFor hygiene and safety, Chengtu has built a comprehensive system. Smart locks and self-service check-ins protect guest privacy and security while simplifying the process by eliminating key handovers. Chengtu's cleaning team follows strict protocols, thoroughly cleaning each room after every guest and changing all linens between stays to ensure spotless conditions. Regular inspections and maintenance cover everything from utilities to amenities, ensuring every property meets high-end hotel standards, giving guests peace of mind.\n\nChengtu values guest feedback to continuously improve its services. The customer service team promptly addresses issues and uses reviews to guide improvements. By optimizing services and driving product innovation, Chengtu has adapted to market changes, achieving steady growth compared to the Labor Day holiday earlier this year and the National Day holiday last year. This helped Chengtu strengthen its position in the competitive homestay market.\n\nTong Ji, the General Manager of Chengtu, said: \"Our National Day holiday performance highlights our continued efforts in improving services and innovating products. Our goal is not just to meet demand but to offer personalized, high-quality stays that bring unique value to our customers. Moving forward, Chengtu will keep enhancing the customer experience and expanding its product lines to boost satisfaction and strengthen our competitiveness.\"\n\nLeslie Yu, Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Quhuo, stated: \"Chengtu's National Day performance showcases Quhuo's strategic focus and execution in the homestay market. With great service and ongoing product innovation, Chengtu will continue to deliver greater value for customers and partners.\"\n\nAbout Quhuo Limited\n\nQuhuo Limited (NASDAQ: QH) (\"Quhuo\" or the \"Company\") is a leading gig economy platform focusing on local life services in China.
