(Nasdaq: CNFR)** (“Conifer” or the “Company”) today announced results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. This quarter, the Company reported a $61 million gain on the sale of its insurance agency operations, completed in August of this year, along with an adjusted operating loss of over $7 million in the period.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * $61 Million gain on sale of insurance agency operations\n  * Adjusted operating loss of $7.4 million or ($0.60) a share\n  * Net income of $53.3 million for the period\n\n\n\n**Management Comments**\n\nBrian Roney, CEO of Conifer, commented, \"Third quarter results reflect the successful culmination of the sale of our insurance agency operations to Bishop Street Underwriters. With the sale, and the majority of our commercial lines production in runoff, we are focusing underwriting efforts on select personal lines, particularly in Texas and Midwest homeowners.”\n\n**Reduction of Commercial Lines Business**\n\nFor the period, total Gross Written Premium was down almost 61% overall, and net earned premium was down 39%. As a result of the sale completed in August 2024, we no longer have any insurance agency operations, and we expect a significant decline in revenue. We expect commercial lines business to represent 10% or less of our written premiums going forward. As a result, we expect any future premiums will primarily consist of personal lines business, notably our homeowner’s insurance portfolio in Texas and the Midwest. As detailed in the personal lines results overview below, gross written premium for those lines of business for the third quarter of 2024 increased 10% from the prior year period.\n\n**2024 Third Quarter Financial Results Overview**\n\n**At and for the Three Months Ended September 30,**| **At and for the Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **% Change**| **2024**| **2023**| **% Change**  \n**(dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts)**  \nGross written premiums| $| 15,086| $| 38,548| -60.9| %| $| 58,370| $| 119,436| -51.1| %  \nNet written premiums| 11,174| 5,689| 96.4| %| 39,812| 53,359| -25.4| %  \nNet earned premiums| 14,601| 23,979| -39.1| %| 48,154| 69,114| -30.3| %  \nNet investment income| 1,391| 1,439| -3.3| %| 4,411| 4,036| 9.3| %  \nNet realized investment gains (losses)| (7| )| -| **| (125| )| -| **  \nChange in fair value of equity investments| (29| )| (87| )| 66.7| %| (182| )| 595| -130.6| %  \nNet income (loss) allocable to common shareholders| 52,788| (2,706| )| **| 48,912| (6,444| )| **  \nNet income (loss) allocable to common shareholders per share, diluted| $| 4.32| $| (0.22| )| $| 4.00| $| (0.53| )  \nAdjusted operating income (loss)*| (7,352| )| (4,275| )| **| (9,554| )| (8,456| )| **  \nAdjusted operating income (loss) per share, diluted*| $| (0.60| )| $| (0.35| )| **| $| (0.78| )| $| (0.69| )| **  \nBook value per common share outstanding| $| 4.01| $| 0.24| $| 4.01| $| 0.24  \nWeighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted| 12,222,881| 12,222,881| 12,222,881| 12,219,713  \nUnderwriting ratios:  \nLoss ratio (1)| 103.8| %| 86.9| %| 84.8| %| 77.8| %  \nExpense ratio (2)| 39.3| %| 33.9| %| 35.2| %| 36.3| %  \nCombined ratio (3)| 143.1| %| 120.8| %| 120.0| %| 114.1| %  \n* The \"Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures\" section of this release defines and reconciles data that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles.  \n** Percentage is not meaningful  \n(1) The loss ratio is the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of net losses and loss adjustment expenses to net earned premiums and other income from underwriting operations.  \n(2) The expense ratio is the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of policy acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses to net earned premiums and other income from underwriting operations.  \n(3) The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. A combined ratio under 100% indicates an underwriting profit. A combined ratio over 100% indicates an underwriting loss.  \n  \n**2024 Third Quarter Gross Written Premium**\n\nGross written premiums decreased significantly in the third quarter of 2024 to $15 million, compared to $38.5 million in the prior year period. This decrease reflects the Company’s fundamental shift away from commercial lines insurance business. We expect this to continue to decrease following the sale of our insurance agency operations, as the commercial lines business produced in the future by our former insurance agency operations will be written by other carriers.\n\n**Commercial Lines Financial and Operational Review**\n\n**Commercial Lines Financial Review**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **% Change**| **2024**| **2023**| **% Change**  \n**(dollars in thousands)**  \nGross written premiums| $| 4,018| $| 28,492| -85.9| %| $| 23,562| $| 92,228| -74.5| %  \nNet written premiums| 1,481| (3,155| )| 146.9| %| 14,053| 29,571| -52.5| %  \nNet earned premiums| 6,428| 17,315| -62.9| %| 23,906| 51,925| -54.0| %  \nUnderwriting ratios:  \nLoss ratio| 168.0| %| 88.8| %| 102.1| %| 76.0| %  \nExpense ratio| 29.1| %| 31.7| %| 29.1| %| 35.1| %  \nCombined ratio| 197.1| %| 120.5| %| 131.2| %| 111.1| %  \nContribution to combined ratio from net (favorable) adverse prior year development| 123.4| %| 23.3| %| 41.9| %| 7.9| %  \nAccident year combined ratio (1)| 73.7| %| 97.2| %| 89.3| %| 103.2| %  \n(1) The accident year combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio, less changes in net ultimate loss estimates from prior accident year loss reserves. The accident year combined ratio provides management with an assessment of the specific policy year's profitability and assists management in their evaluation of product pricing levels and quality of business written.  \n  \nThe Company’s commercial lines production was down almost 86% in the quarter and represented roughly 27% of total gross written premium in the third quarter of 2024. Commercial lines net earned premium was down 63% for the same period. In the quarter, the commercial lines loss ratio was up significantly, as we further focused on strengthening reserves overall.\n\n**Personal Lines Financial and Operational Review**\n\n**Personal Lines Financial Review**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **% Change**| **2024**| **2023**| **% Change**  \n**(dollars in thousands)**  \nGross written premiums| $| 11,068| $| 10,056| 10.1| %| $| 34,808| $| 27,208| 27.9| %  \nNet written premiums| 9,693| 8,844| 9.6| %| 25,759| 23,788| 8.3| %  \nNet earned premiums| 8,173| 6,664| 22.6| %| 24,248| 17,189| 41.1| %  \nUnderwriting ratios:  \nLoss ratio| 53.3| %| 82.0| %| 67.8| %| 83.3| %  \nExpense ratio| 47.4| %| 39.7| %| 41.2| %| 39.9| %  \nCombined ratio| 100.7| %| 121.7| %| 109.0| %| 123.2| %  \nContribution to combined ratio from net (favorable) adverse prior year development| -0.7| %| -6.3| %| 0.6| %| -6.8| %  \nAccident year combined ratio| 101.4| %| 128.0| %| 108.4| %| 130.0| %  \n  \nPersonal lines premium represented 73% of total gross written premium for the quarter. Personal lines gross written premium increased 10% from the prior year period to just over $11 million for the third quarter of 2024, led by growth in the Company’s low-value dwelling line of business in Texas and the Midwest. Despite significant storm activity in the period and for the year, the combined ratio for personal lines business improved compared to the same period in 2023.\n\n**Combined Ratio Analysis**\n\n**Three Months EndedSeptember 30,**| **Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nUnderwriting ratios:  \nLoss ratio| 103.8| %| 86.9| %| 84.8| %| 77.8| %  \nExpense ratio| 39.3| %| 33.9| %| 35.2| %| 36.3| %  \nCombined ratio| 143.1| %| 120.8| %| 120.0| %| 114.1| %  \nContribution to combined ratio from net (favorable) adverse prior year development| 53.9| %| 15.0| %| 21.1| %| 4.2| %  \nAccident year combined ratio| 89.2| %| 105.8| %| 98.9| %| 109.9| %  \n  \n**Net Investment Income** Net investment income was $1.4 million for both the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**Change in Fair Value of Equity Securities** During the quarter, the Company reported a loss from the change in fair value of equity investments of $29,000, compared to a $87,000 loss in the prior year period.\n\n**Net Income (Loss) allocable to common shareholders** The Company reported net income allocable to common shareholders of $52.8 million, or $4.32 per share, for the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**Adjusted Operating Income (Loss)**\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, the Company reported an adjusted operating loss of $7.4 million, or $0.60 per share. See Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures.\n\n**About Conifer Holdings** Conifer Holdings, Inc. is a Michigan-based property and casualty holding company.

Forward-looking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events or our future financial or operating performance, and include Conifer’s expectations regarding future revenue, premiums, earnings, its capital position, expansion, and business strategies. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on management’s good-faith belief and reasonable judgment based on current information. The forward-looking statements are qualified by important factors, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including those described in our Form 10-K (“Item 1A Risk Factors”) filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024, the Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 13, 2024 and subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the SEC. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this press release speaks only as of the date hereof or as of the date specified herein. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by any applicable laws or regulations.\n\n**Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures** Conifer prepares its public financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Statutory data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules as defined by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' (NAIC) Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP data.\n\nWe believe that investors’ understanding of Conifer’s performance is enhanced by our disclosure of adjusted operating income. Our method for calculating this measure may differ from that used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. We define adjusted operating income (loss), a non-GAAP measure, as net income (loss) excluding: 1) net realized investment gains and losses, 2) change in fair value of equity securities and 3) net income from discontinued operations. We use adjusted operating income as an internal performance measure in the management of our operations because we believe it gives our management and other users of our financial information useful insight into our results of operations and our underlying business performance.\n\n**Reconciliations of adjusted operating income (loss) and adjusted operating income (loss) per share:**\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n(dollar in thousands, except share and per share amounts)  \nNet income (loss) allocable to common shareholders| $| 52,788| $| (2,706| )| $| 48,912| $| (6,444| )  \nLess:  \nNet realized investment gains (losses)| (7| )| -| (125| )| -  \nChange in fair value of equity securities| (29| )| (87| )| (182| )| 595  \nNet income from discontinued operations| 60,176| 1,656| 58,773| 1,417  \nImpact of income tax expense (benefit) from adjustments *| -| -| -| -  \nAdjusted operating income (loss)| $| (7,352| )| $| (4,275| )| $| (9,554| )| $| (8,456| )  \nWeighted average common shares, diluted| 12,222,881| 12,222,881| 12,222,881| 12,219,713  \nDiluted income (loss) per common share:  \nNet income (loss) allocable to common shareholders| $| 4.32| $| (0.22| )| $| 4.00| $| (0.53| )  \nLess:  \nNet realized investment gains (losses)| -| -| (0.01| )| -  \nChange in fair value of equity securities| -| (0.01| )| (0.02| )| 0.05  \nNet income from discontinued operations| 4.92| 0.14| 4.81| 0.11  \nImpact of income tax expense (benefit) from adjustments *| -| -| -| -  \nAdjusted operating income (loss), per share| $| (0.60| )| $| (0.35| )| $| (0.78| )| $| (0.69| )  \n  \n***** The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.

(Nasdaq: CNFR)** (“Conifer” or the “Company”) today announced results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights (compared to the prior year period)**\n\n  * Expense ratio improved 5.8 percentage points to 32.1%\n  * Net investment income increased 11.2% over the prior year period to $1.5 million\n  * Significant progress in planned gross written premium shift toward MGA model\n\n\n\n**Management Comments**\n\nNick Petcoff, CEO of Conifer, commented, \"We are pleased to report significant advances in our strategic transformation. Our main focus is shifting premium away from the traditional risk-bearing carrier revenue model to a more sustainable and scalable production-based revenue approach. This change reflects our commitment to aligning our business model with market demands by creating long-term value.”\n\n**Strategic Turn toward Non-Risk Bearing Revenue**\n\nConifer saw significant progress in the second quarter of 2024 in its initiative to run commercial gross written premium through its wholly owned managing general agency (“MGA”), Conifer Insurance Services (CIS). This strategic shift away from a traditional risk-bearing revenue model to focus instead on a wholesale agency, production-based approach began in late 2023, and the Company expects 100% of future commercial gross written premium to flow through its MGA.\n\nThis approach is intended to optimize Conifer’s resources and will complement the Company’s shift to primarily focus on commission revenues within its MGA. Accordingly, Conifer anticipates that substantially all commercial lines business will be directly written by third-party insurers with A.M. Best ratings of A- or better by the end of the third quarter in 2024.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, Conifer continued advancing its plan to direct premium to capacity providers for coverage across multiple commercial lines of business. Furthermore, the transfer of cannabis premium to capacity providers has progressed at a steady pace, and the Company expects to ultimately shift all premium for this line of business to its capacity partners as well. The Company expects that this and other capacity initiatives will significantly boost the premiums placed by its agency segment, ultimately driving higher commission revenue over time.\n\nThe Company has continued to underwrite low-value homeowners business in Texas and the Midwest. As detailed in the Personal Lines results overview below, premium for the second quarter of 2024 increased 23.0% from the prior year period.\n\n**2024 Second Quarter Financial Results Overview**\n\n**At and for the Three Months Ended June 30,**| **At and for the Six Months Ended June 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **% Change**| **2024**| **2023**| **% Change**  \n**(dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts)**  \nGross written premiums| $| 18,971| $| 44,674| -57.5%| $| 43,284| $| 80,888| -46.5%  \nNet written premiums| 13,247| 29,328| -54.8%| 28,638| 47,670| -39.9%  \nNet earned premiums| 16,666| 23,183| -28.1%| 33,553| 45,135| -25.7%  \nNet investment income| 1,505| 1,354| 11.2%| 3,057| 2,661| 14.9%  \nNet realized investment gains (losses)| (118| )| -| **| (118| )| -| **  \nChange in fair value of equity investments| (196| )| (12| )| **| (153| )| 682| **  \nNet income (loss) allocable to common shareholders| (3,950| )| (4,739| )| (3,876| )| (3,738| )  \nEarnings (loss) per share, diluted| $| (0.32| )| $| (0.39| )| $| (0.32| )| $| (0.31| )  \nAdjusted operating income (loss)*| (3,636| )| (4,727| )| (3,605| )| (4,420| )  \nAdjusted operating income (loss) per share*| $| (0.30| )| $| (0.39| )| $| (0.30| )| $| (0.36| )  \nBook value per common share outstanding| $| (0.10| )| $| 1.38| $| (0.10| )| $| 1.38  \nWeighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted| 12,222,881| 12,220,331| 12,222,881| 12,218,102  \nUnderwriting ratios:  \nLoss ratio (1)| 91.5| %| 83.0| %| 76.6| %| 72.9| %  \nExpense ratio (2)| 32.1| %| 37.9| %| 33.4| %| 37.6| %  \nCombined ratio (3)| 123.6| %| 120.9| %| 110.0| %| 110.5| %  \n* The \"Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures\" section of this release defines and reconciles data that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles.  \n** Percentage is not meaningful  \n(1) The loss ratio is the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of net losses and loss adjustment expenses to net earned premiums and other income from underwriting operations.  \n(2) The expense ratio is the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of policy acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses to net earned premiums and other income from underwriting operations.  \n(3) The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio.

The accident year combined ratio provides management with an assessment of the specific policy year's profitability and assists management in their evaluation of product pricing levels and quality of business written.  \n  \nThe Company’s commercial lines of business represented 35.7% of total gross written premium in the second quarter of 2024. As noted above, premium decreased considerably year over year in keeping with the strategic shift to a commission-based revenue model through Conifer’s managing general agency, CIS.\n\n**Personal Lines Financial and Operational Review**\n\n**Personal Lines Financial Review**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended June 30,**| **Six Months Ended June 30,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **% Change**| **2024**| **2023**| **% Change**  \n**(dollars in thousands)**  \nGross written premiums| $| 12,189| $| 9,913| 23.0| %| $| 23,740| $| 17,152| 38.4| %  \nNet written premiums| 8,962| 8,843| 1.3| %| 16,066| 14,944| 7.5| %  \nNet earned premiums| 7,985| 5,696| 40.2| %| 16,075| 10,525| 52.7| %  \nUnderwriting ratios:  \nLoss ratio| 104.6| %| 100.1| %| 75.2| %| 84.1| %  \nExpense ratio| 39.5| %| 39.2| %| 38.1| %| 40.0| %  \nCombined ratio| 144.1| %| 139.3| %| 113.3| %| 124.1| %  \nContribution to combined ratio from net  \n(favorable) adverse prior year development| 9.3| %| -6.4| %| 1.4| %| -7.2| %  \nAccident year combined ratio| 134.8| %| 145.7| %| 111.9| %| 131.3| %  \n  \nPersonal lines, representing 64.3% of total gross written premium for the quarter. Personal lines gross written premium increased 23.0% from the prior year period to $12.2 million for the second quarter of 2024, led by growth in the Company’s low-value dwelling line of business in Texas and the Midwest. Seasonal spring storms significantly impacted our personal lines results for the quarter, mainly from the Oklahoma based business, which is in run-off. The run-off for that book is expected to be largely complete by the end of this year.\n\n**Combined Ratio Analysis**\n\n**Three Months Ended June 30,**| **Six Months Ended June 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nUnderwriting ratios:  \nLoss ratio| 91.5| %| 83.0| %| 76.6| %| 72.9| %  \nExpense ratio| 32.1| %| 37.9| %| 33.4| %| 37.6| %  \nCombined ratio| 123.6| %| 120.9| %| 110.0| %| 110.5| %  \nContribution to combined ratio from net (favorable)  \nadverse prior year development| 16.8| %| 2.2| %| 6.9| %| -1.5| %  \nAccident year combined ratio| 106.8| %| 118.7| %| 103.1| %| 112.0| %  \n  \n**Net Investment Income** Net investment income was $1.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to $1.4 million in the prior year period.\n\n**Change in Fair Value of Equity Securities** During the quarter, the Company reported a loss from the change in fair value of equity investments of $196,000, compared to a $12,000 loss in the prior year period.\n\n**Net Income (Loss) allocable to common shareholders** The Company reported net loss allocable to common shareholders of $4.0 million, or $0.32 per share, for the second quarter of 2024.\n\n**Adjusted Operating Income (Loss)** In the second quarter of 2024, the Company reported an adjusted operating loss of $3.6 million, or $0.30 per share.

Forward-looking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events or our future financial or operating performance, and include Conifer’s expectations regarding premiums, earnings, its capital position, expansion, and growth strategies. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on management’s good-faith belief and reasonable judgment based on current information. The forward-looking statements are qualified by important factors, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including those described in our form 10-K (“Item 1A Risk Factors”) filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024 and subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the SEC. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this report speaks only as of the date hereof or as of the date specified herein. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by any applicable laws or regulations.\n\n**Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures** Conifer prepares its public financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Statutory data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules as defined by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' (NAIC) Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP data.\n\nWe believe that investors’ understanding of Conifer’s performance is enhanced by our disclosure of adjusted operating income. Our method for calculating this measure may differ from that used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. We define adjusted operating income (loss), a non-GAAP measure, as net income (loss) excluding: 1) net realized investment gains and losses and 2) change in fair value of equity securities. We use adjusted operating income as an internal performance measure in the management of our operations because we believe it gives our management and other users of our financial information useful insight into our results of operations and our underlying business performance.\n\n**Reconciliations of adjusted operating income (loss) and adjusted operating income (loss) per share:**\n\n**Three Months Ended June 30,**| **Six Months Ended June 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n(dollar in thousands, except share and per share amounts)  \nNet income (loss) allocable to common shareholders| $| (3,950| )| $| (4,739| )| $| (3,876| )| $| (3,738| )  \nLess:  \nNet realized investment gains (losses)| (118| )| -| (118| )| -  \nChange in fair value of equity securities, net of tax| (196| )| (12| )| (153| )| 682  \nImpact of income tax expense (benefit) from adjustments *| -| -| -| -  \nAdjusted operating income (loss)| $| (3,636| )| $| (4,727| )| $| (3,605| )| $| (4,420| )  \nWeighted average common shares, diluted| 12,222,881| 12,220,331| 12,222,881| 12,218,102  \nDiluted income (loss) per common share:  \nNet income (loss) allocable to common shareholders| $| (0.32| )| $| (0.39| )| $| (0.32| )| $| (0.31| )  \nLess:  \nNet realized investment gains (losses)| (0.01| )| -| (0.01| )| -  \nChange in fair value of equity securities| (0.01| )| -| (0.01| )| 0.05  \nImpact of income tax expense (benefit) from adjustments *| -| -| -| -  \nAdjusted operating income (loss), per share| $| (0.30| )| $| (0.39| )| $| (0.30| )| $| (0.36| )  \n  \n**Conifer Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries**  \n---  \n**Consolidated Balance Sheets**  \n**(dollars in thousands)**  \n**June 30,**| **December 31,**  \n**2024**| **2023**  \n**Assets**| **(Unaudited)**  \nInvestment securities:  \nDebt securities, at fair value (amortized cost of $132,889 and $135,370, respectively)| $| 119,371| $| 122,113  \nEquity securities, at fair value (cost of $1,844 and $2,385, respectively)| 1,660| 2,354  \nShort-term investments, at fair value| 23,339| 20,838  \nTotal investments| 144,370| 145,305  \nCash and cash equivalents| 9,697| 11,125  \nPremiums and agents' balances receivable, net| 30,583| 29,369  \nReceivable from Affiliate| 1,174| 1,047  \nReinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses| 74,358| 70,807  \nReinsurance recoverables on paid losses| 8,614| 12,619  \nPrepaid reinsurance premiums| 13,494| 28,908  \nDeferred policy acquisition costs| 4,606| 6,285  \nOther assets| 6,038| 6,339  \n**Total assets**|  $| 292,934| $| 311,804  \n**Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity**  \n**Liabilities:**  \nUnpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses| $| 174,786| $| 174,612  \nUnearned premiums| 44,820| 65,150  \nReinsurance premiums payable| 1,408| 246  \nDebt| 24,832| 25,061  \nFunds held under reinsurance agreements| 23,602| 24,550  \nPremiums payable to other insureds| 19,299| 13,986  \nAccounts payable and accrued expenses| 5,352| 5,310  \n**Total liabilities**|  294,099| 308,915  \n**Commitments and contingencies**|  -| -  \n**Shareholders' equity:**  \nPreferred stock, no par value (10,000,000 shares authorized;

(Nasdaq: CNFR)** (“Conifer” or the “Company”) today announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\n**First Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights (compared to the prior year period)**\n\n  * Combined ratio was 96.7%, an improvement of 2.8 percentage points from Q1 2023\n  * Expense ratio improved 2.6 percentage points to 34.7%\n  * Net investment income increased 18.7% over the prior year period to $1.6 million\n  * Net income allocable to common shareholders of $74,000, or $0.01 per share, based on 12.2 million weighted average shares outstanding\n\n\n\n**Management Comments**\n\nNick Petcoff, CEO of Conifer, commented, \"We are pleased to see the early signs of progress resulting from our strategic shift away from a risk-bearing carrier revenue model, toward wholesale agency, production-based revenue. Results to date have been encouraging, and we are proud to report a profitable first quarter for Conifer.”\n\n**Strategic Shift to Non-Risk Bearing Revenue**\n\nAs previously announced, Conifer made the strategic decision to shift its revenue model to focus on a wholesale agency, production-based approach beginning in 2024. Progress to date has been steady, and the Company’s return to profitability in the first quarter of 2024 underscores the effectiveness of this strategic initiative.\n\nBased on initial indications, Conifer ultimately plans to redirect all commercial gross written premium through its wholly owned managing general agency (“MGA”), Conifer Insurance Services (“CIS”). Accordingly, the Company anticipates that substantially all commercial lines business will be directly written by third-party insurers with A.M. Best ratings of A- or better by the end of the second quarter of 2024.\n\nConifer made considerable progress during the first quarter of 2024 in directing premium to capacity providers for coverage across multiple lines of business. Furthermore, the Company has ramped up transfer of cannabis premium to capacity providers and expects to ultimately shift all premium for this line of business to its capacity partners as well. The Company anticipates that this and other capacity initiatives will lead to substantially increased premiums placed for its agency segment and generate greater commission revenue over time.\n\nThe Company does plan to continue retaining and underwriting low-value homeowners business in Texas and the Midwest. As detailed in the Personal Lines results overview below, premium for the first quarter of 2024 increased 59.6% from the prior year period. Moreover, this line of business has demonstrated strong performance, leading to a combined ratio of 83.0% for the quarter.\n\n**2024 First Quarter Financial Results Overview**\n\n**At and for the Three Months Ended March 31,**  \n---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **% Change**  \n**(dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts)**  \nGross written premiums| $| 24,313| $| 36,214| -32.9| %  \nNet written premiums| 15,391| 18,342| -16.1| %  \nNet earned premiums| 16,887| 21,952| -23.1| %  \nNet investment income| 1,552| 1,307| 18.7| %  \nChange in fair value of equity investments| 43| 694| -93.8| %  \nNet income (loss) allocable to common shareholders| 74| 1,001| **  \nEarnings (loss) per common share, basic and diluted| $| 0.01| $| 0.08  \nAdjusted operating income (loss)*| 188| 307| **  \nAdjusted operating income (loss) per share, diluted*| $| 0.02| $| 0.03| **  \nBook value per common share outstanding| $| 0.21| $| 1.82  \nWeighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted| 12,222,881| 12,215,849  \nUnderwriting ratios:  \nLoss ratio (1)| 62.0| %| 62.2| %  \nExpense ratio (2)| 34.7| %| 37.3| %  \nCombined ratio (3)| 96.7| %| 99.5| %  \n* The \"Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures\" section of this release defines and reconciles data that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles.  \n** Percentage is not meaningful  \n(1) The loss ratio is the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of net losses and loss adjustment expenses to net earned premiums and other income from underwriting operations.  \n(2) The expense ratio is the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of policy acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses to net earned premiums and other income from underwriting operations.  \n(3) The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. A combined ratio under 100% indicates an underwriting profit. A combined ratio over 100% indicates an underwriting loss.  \n  \n**2024 First Quarter Gross Written Premium**\n\nGross written premiums decreased 32.9% in the first quarter of 2024 to $24.3 million, compared to$36.2 million in the prior year period. This decrease reflects the Company’s planned decision to reduce premium leverage on our operating subsidiaries and focus on non-risk bearing revenue. **Commercial Lines Financial and Operational Review**\n\n**Commercial Lines Financial Review**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended March 31,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **% Change**  \n**(dollars in thousands)**  \nGross written premiums| $| 12,762| $| 28,975| -56.0| %  \nNet written premiums| 8,287| 12,241| -32.3| %  \nNet earned premiums| 8,797| 17,123| -48.6| %  \nUnderwriting ratios:  \nLoss ratio| 76.5| %| 61.4| %  \nExpense ratio| 32.7| %| 36.2| %  \nCombined ratio| 109.2| %| 97.6| %  \nContribution to combined ratio from net  \n(favorable) adverse prior year development| 0.5| %| -4.8| %  \nAccident year combined ratio (1)| 108.7| %| 102.4| %  \n(1) The accident year combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio, less changes in net ultimate loss estimates from prior accident year loss reserves. The accident year combined ratio provides management with an assessment of the specific policy year's profitability and assists management in their evaluation of product pricing levels and quality of business written.  \n  \nThe Company’s commercial lines of business represented 52.5% of total gross written premium in the first quarter of 2024. As noted above, premium decreased considerably year over year as Conifer executed its planned shift over to its commission-based revenue model with our managing general agency, CIS. For example, as part of the planned reduction in premiums written, substantially all of the Security Guard program is now no longer being written on Conifer paper.\n\n**Personal Lines Financial and Operational Review**\n\n**Personal Lines Financial Review**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended March 31,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **% Change**  \n**(dollars in thousands)**  \nGross written premiums| $| 11,551| $| 7,239| 59.6| %  \nNet written premiums| 7,104| 6,101| 16.4| %  \nNet earned premiums| 8,090| 4,829| 67.5| %  \nUnderwriting ratios:  \nLoss ratio| 46.2| %| 65.3| %  \nExpense ratio| 36.8| %| 40.8| %  \nCombined ratio| 83.0| %| 106.1| %  \nContribution to combined ratio from net  \n(favorable) adverse prior year development| -6.3| %| -8.1| %  \nAccident year combined ratio| 89.3| %| 114.2| %  \n  \nPersonal lines, representing 47.5% of total gross written premium for the quarter, consists primarily of low-value dwelling homeowner’s insurance in Texas and the Midwest.\n\nPersonal lines gross written premium increased 59.6% from the prior year period to $11.6 million for the first quarter of 2024, led by growth in the Company’s low-value dwelling line of business in Texas.\n\nConifer was pleased to report strong performance in the premium it chose to retain: Personal Lines business posted a combined ratio of 83.0% for the first quarter of 2024. This represents an improvement of more than 23 percentage points compared to the prior year period.\n\n**Combined Ratio Analysis**\n\n**Three Months Ended March 31,**  \n---  \n**2024**| **2023**  \nUnderwriting ratios:  \nLoss ratio| 62.0| %| 62.2| %  \nExpense ratio| 34.7| %| 37.3| %  \nCombined ratio| 96.7| %| 99.5| %  \nContribution to combined ratio from net (favorable)  \nadverse prior year development| -2.7| %| -5.6| %  \nAccident year combined ratio| 99.4| %| 105.1| %  \n  \n_Combined Ratio:_ The Company's combined ratio was 96.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, an improvement of 2.8 percentage points compared to the prior year period.

The Company is traded on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol CNFR. Additional information is available on the Company's website at [www.ir.cnfrh.com](http://www.ir.cnfrh.com).\n\n**Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures** Conifer prepares its public financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Statutory data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules as defined by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' (NAIC) Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP data.\n\nWe believe that investors’ understanding of Conifer’s performance is enhanced by our disclosure of adjusted operating income. Our method for calculating this measure may differ from that used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. We define adjusted operating income (loss), a non-GAAP measure, as net income (loss) excluding: 1) net realized investment gains and losses, 2) change in fair value of equity securities and 3) Other gains (losses). We use adjusted operating income as an internal performance measure in the management of our operations because we believe it gives our management and other users of our financial information useful insight into our results of operations and our underlying business performance.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statement**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events or our future financial or operating performance, and include Conifer’s expectations regarding premiums, earnings, its capital position, expansion, and growth strategies. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on management’s good-faith belief and reasonable judgment based on current information. The forward-looking statements are qualified by important factors, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including those described in our form 10-K (“Item 1A Risk Factors”) filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024 and subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the SEC. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this report speaks only as of the date hereof or as of the date specified herein.

These forward-\nlooking statements include, without limitation, statements regarding our industry, business strategy, plans, goals\nand expectations concerning our market position, product expansion, future operations, margins, profitability,\nfuture efficiencies, and other financial and operating information. When used in this discussion, the words “may,”\n“believes,” “intends,” “seeks,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “estimates,” “expects,” “should,” “assumes,” “continues,”\n“potential,” “could,” “will,” “future” and the negative of these or similar terms and phrases are intended to identify\nforward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, inherent risks and other factors that\nmay cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results,\nperformance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements\nrepresent our management’s beliefs and assumptions only as of the date of this presentation. Our actual future\nresults may be materially different from what we expect due to factors largely outside our control, including the\noccurrence of severe weather conditions and other catastrophes, the cyclical nature of the insurance industry, future\nactions by regulators, our ability to obtain reinsurance coverage at reasonable rates and the effects of competition.\nThese and other risks and uncertainties associated with our business are described under the heading “Risk\nFactors” in our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and our earnings press release for the quarter\nended June 30, 2024, which should be read in conjunction with this presentation. The company and subsidiaries\noperate in a dynamic business environment, and therefore the risks identified are not meant to be exhaustive. Risk\nfactors change and new risks emerge frequently. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update\nthese forward-looking statements publicly, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those\nanticipated in the forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future.\n2\nQ2 2024 H\nIGHLIGHTS\nSTRATEGIC SHIFT FUTURE PROFITABILITY ADJUSTED BOOK VALUE OF\nEXPECTED $2.26 PER SHARE\nAgency Commission Income\nfor Q2 2024: $8.8M Q2 2024 Expense Ratio: 32.1%, Includes $28.8M of DTAs\n+8.6M over Q2 2023 well below 35%near-term target ($2.36 per share)\nFocus is on a production-based\nOptimizing Commercial Lines Total adjusted book value of\nrevenue model\nbusiness through utilization of $2.26 as of quarter ended\ncapacity providers with A.M.

Statutory data is\nprepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules as defined by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' (NAIC) Accounting Practices and Procedures\nManual, and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP data.\nWe believe that investors’ understanding of Conifer’s performance is enhanced by our disclosure of adjusted operating income. Our method for calculating this measure may\ndiffer from that used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. We define adjusted operating income (loss), a non-GAAP measure, as net income (loss)\nexcluding: 1) net realized investment gains and losses, 2) change in fair value of equity securities and 3) Other gains (losses). We use adjusted operating income as an internal\nperformance measure in the management of our operations because we believe it gives our management and other users of our financial information useful insight into our\nresults of operations and our underlying business performance.\n14"
