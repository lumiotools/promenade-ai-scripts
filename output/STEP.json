All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking. Words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “estimate,” “expect,” “future,” “intend,” “may,” “plan” and “will” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current plans, estimates and expectations and are inherently uncertain. The inclusion of any forward-looking information in this release should not be regarded as a representation that the future plans, estimates or expectations contemplated will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are subject to various risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, global and domestic market and business conditions, our successful execution of business and growth strategies, the favorability of the private markets fundraising environment, successful integration of acquired businesses and regulatory factors relevant to our business, as well as assumptions relating to our operations, financial results, financial condition, business prospects, growth strategy and liquidity and the risks and uncertainties described in greater detail under the “Risk Factors” section of our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on May 24, 2024, as such factors may be updated from time to time. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted management and advisory fees, net, adjusted revenues, adjusted net income (on both a pre-tax and after-tax basis), adjusted net income per share, adjusted weighted-average shares, fee-related earnings, fee-related earnings margin, gross realized performance fees and net realized performance fees. We have provided this non-GAAP financial information, which is not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as information supplemental and in addition to the financial measures presented in this earnings release that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented in this earnings release. The presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures in this earnings release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry or across different industries.

ANI represents the after-tax net realized income attributable to us. ANI does not reflect legacy Greenspring carried interest allocation revenues, legacy Greenspring carried interest-related compensation and legacy Greenspring investment income (loss) as none of the economics are attributable to us. The components of revenues used in the determination of ANI (“adjusted revenues”) comprise adjusted management and advisory fees, net, adjusted incentive fees (including the deferred portion) and realized carried interest allocations. In addition, ANI excludes: (a) unrealized carried interest allocation revenues and related compensation, (b) unrealized investment income (loss), (c) equity-based compensation for awards granted prior to and in connection with our IPO, profits interests issued by our non-wholly owned subsidiaries, and unrealized mark-to-market changes in the fair value of the profits interests issued in the private wealth subsidiary, (d) amortization of intangibles, (e) net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests in our subsidiaries and realized gains attributable to the profits interests issued in the private wealth subsidiary, (f) charges associated with acquisitions and corporate transactions, and (g) certain other items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance (as listed in the table below). ANI is fully taxed at our blended statutory rate. We believe ANI and adjusted revenues are useful to investors because they enable investors to evaluate the performance of our business across reporting periods.\n\n**Fee-Related Earnings**\n\nFee-related earnings, or “FRE,” is a non-GAAP performance measure used to monitor our baseline earnings from recurring management and advisory fees. FRE is a component of ANI and comprises adjusted management and advisory fees, net, less adjusted expenses which are operating expenses other than (a) performance fee-related compensation, (b) equity-based compensation for awards granted prior to and in connection with our IPO, profits interests issued by our non-wholly owned subsidiaries, and unrealized mark-to-market changes in the fair value of the profits interests issued in the private wealth subsidiary, (c) amortization of intangibles, (d) charges associated with acquisitions and corporate transactions, and (e) certain other items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance (as listed in the table below). FRE is presented before income taxes. We believe FRE is useful to investors because it provides additional insight into the operating profitability of our business and our ability to cover direct base compensation and operating expenses from total fee revenue.\n\nThe table below shows a reconciliation of GAAP measures to additional non-GAAP measures. We use the non-GAAP measures presented below as components when calculating FRE and ANI (as defined below). We believe these additional non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in evaluating both the baseline earnings from recurring management and advisory fees, which provide additional insight into the operating profitability of our business, and the after-tax net realized income attributable to us, allowing investors to evaluate the performance of our business. These additional non-GAAP measures remove the impact of Consolidated Funds that we are required to consolidate under GAAP, and certain other items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance.\n\n**Three Months Ended**| **Six Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n_(in thousands)_| **September 30, 2023**| **December 31, 2023**| **March 31, 2024**| **June 30,

AUM/AUA reflects final data for the prior period, adjusted for net new client account activity through the period presented, and does not include post-period investment valuation or cash activity. Net asset value (“NAV”) data for underlying investments is as of the prior period, as reported by underlying managers up to the business day occurring on or after 100 days, or 115 days at the fiscal year-end, following the prior period end. When NAV data is not available by the business day occurring on or after 100 days, or 115 days at the fiscal year-end, following the prior period end, such NAVs are adjusted for cash activity following the last available reported NAV.\n\n(1)| Allocation of AUM by asset class is presented by underlying investment asset classification.  \n---|---  \n(2)| Total capital responsibility equals assets under management (AUM) plus assets under advisement (AUA).  \n  \n**Contacts**\n\n**Shareholder Relations:** Seth Weiss _[shareholders@stepstonegroup.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=464yN65FxwzqyOPeWHSK1qPstLk7k0JXirhuSxABiSddZTsmXPkfLlVGbj6NECVyi531O6u7KTRyo2oZFygl_Lo6pnmdCH_UZN2WW1khUznzrjnsZRfK2evPr-6dqEX_)_ 1-212-351-6106\n\n**Media:** Brian Ruby / Chris Gillick / Matt Lettiero, ICR _[StepStonePR@icrinc.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=vXLaPTTisDHbPuNVMQW-D4X0uUCHFmNOomiFduyijl9G1X20rNwQOwEpwcuX8Fv4b6cQUj518-dXi8IGiigjH68q6eGT0LGuDwbpNX42EpM=)_ 1-203-682-8268\n\n**Glossary**\n\nAssets under advisement, or “AUA,” consists of client assets for which we do not have full discretion to make investment decisions but play a role in advising the client or monitoring their investments. We generally earn revenue for advisory-related services on a contractual fixed fee basis. Advisory-related services include asset allocation, strategic planning, development of investment policies and guidelines, screening and recommending investments, legal negotiations, monitoring and reporting on investments, and investment manager review and due diligence. Advisory fees vary by client based on the scope of services, investment activity and other factors. Most of our advisory fees are fixed, and therefore, increases or decreases in AUA do not necessarily lead to proportionate changes in revenue. We believe AUA is a useful metric for assessing the relative size of our advisory business.\n\nOur AUA is calculated as the sum of (i) the NAV of client portfolio assets for which we do not have full discretion and (ii) the unfunded commitments of clients to the underlying investments. Our AUA reflects the investment valuations in respect of the underlying investments of our client accounts on a three-month lag, adjusted for new client account activity through the period end. Our AUA does not include post-period investment valuation or cash activity. AUA as of September 30, 2024 reflects final data for the prior period (June 30, 2024), adjusted for net new client account activity through September 30, 2024. NAV data for underlying investments is as of June 30, 2024, as reported by underlying managers up to the business day occurring on or after 100 days following June 30, 2024. When NAV data is not available by the business day occurring on or after 100 days following June 30, 2024, such NAVs are adjusted for cash activity following the last available reported NAV.\n\nAssets under management, or “AUM,” primarily reflects the assets associated with our separately managed accounts (“SMAs”) and focused commingled funds. We classify assets as AUM if we have full discretion over the investment decisions in an account or have responsibility or custody of assets. Although management fees are based on a variety of factors and are not linearly correlated with AUM, we believe AUM is a useful metric for assessing the relative size and scope of our asset management business.\n\nOur AUM is calculated as the sum of (i) the net asset value (“NAV”) of client portfolio assets, including the StepStone Funds and (ii) the unfunded commitments of clients to the underlying investments and the StepStone Funds. Our AUM reflects the investment valuations in respect of the underlying investments of our funds and accounts on a three-month lag, adjusted for new client account activity through the period end. Our AUM does not include post-period investment valuation or cash activity. AUM as of September 30, 2024 reflects final data for the prior period (June 30, 2024), adjusted for net new client account activity through September 30, 2024. NAV data for underlying investments is as of June 30, 2024, as reported by underlying managers up to the business day occurring on or after 100 days following June 30, 2024. When NAV data is not available by the business day occurring on or after 100 days following June 30, 2024, such NAVs are adjusted for cash activity following the last available reported NAV.\n\nConsolidated Funds refer to the StepStone Funds that we are required to consolidate as of the applicable reporting period. We consolidate funds and other entities in which we hold a controlling financial interest.\n\nConsolidated VIEs refer to the variable interest entities that we are required to consolidate as of the applicable reporting period. We consolidate VIEs in which we hold a controlling financial interest.\n\nFee-earning AUM, or “FEAUM,” reflects the assets from which we earn management fee revenue (i.e., fee basis) and includes assets in our SMAs, focused commingled funds and assets held directly by our clients for which we have fiduciary oversight and are paid fees as the manager of the assets. Our SMAs and focused commingled funds typically pay management fees based on capital commitments, net invested capital and, in certain cases, NAV, depending on the fee terms. Management fees are only marginally affected by market appreciation or depreciation because substantially all of the StepStone Funds pay management fees based on capital commitments or net invested capital. As a result, management fees and FEAUM are not materially affected by changes in market value. We believe FEAUM is a useful metric in order to assess assets forming the basis of our management fee revenue.\n\nLegacy Greenspring entities refers to certain entities for which the Company, indirectly through its subsidiaries, became the sole and/or managing member in connection with the Greenspring acquisition.\n\nSSG refers solely to StepStone Group Inc., a Delaware corporation, and not to any of its subsidiaries.\n\nStepStone Funds refer to SMAs and focused commingled funds of the Company, including acquired Greenspring funds, for which the Partnership or one of its subsidiaries acts as both investment adviser and general partner or managing member.\n\nThe Partnership refers solely to StepStone Group LP, a Delaware limited partnership, and not to any of its subsidiaries.\n\nTotal capital responsibility equals AUM plus AUA. AUM includes any accounts for which StepStone Group has full discretion over the investment decisions, has responsibility to arrange or effectuate transactions, or has custody of assets. AUA refers to accounts for which StepStone Group provides advice or consultation but for which the firm does not have discretionary authority, responsibility to arrange or effectuate transactions, or custody of assets.\n\nUndeployed fee-earning capital represents the amount of capital commitments to StepStone Funds that has not yet been invested or considered active but will generate management fee revenue once invested or activated. We believe undeployed fee-earning capital is a useful metric for measuring the amount of capital that we can put to work in the future and thus earn management fee revenue thereon.\n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/YTY5YTgxNmMtMThjMS00ZjhiLWIwZmMtYzAzNGRmMzAxZGRiLTEyMDYwOTU=/tiny/StepStone-Group-Inc.png)\n\n## StepStone - Investor Tools\n\n[ RSS Feeds ](/shareholder-services/rss-feeds)\n\n[ Print Page ]()\n\n[ Share ]()\n\n[ Email Alerts ](/shareholder-resources/email-alerts)\n\n  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https://shareholders.stepstonegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/stepstone-group-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2025-results&t=StepStone Group Inc. - StepStone Group Reports Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Results \"Facebook\")\n  * [Twitter](http://twitter.com/home?status=StepStone Group Inc. - StepStone Group Reports Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Results+https://shareholders.stepstonegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/stepstone-group-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2025-results \"Twitter\")\n  * [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://shareholders.stepstonegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/stepstone-group-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2025-results&title=StepStone Group Inc. - StepStone Group Reports Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Results \"LinkedIn\")\n  * [Google+](https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://shareholders.stepstonegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/stepstone-group-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2025-results?&t=StepStone Group Inc. - StepStone Group Reports Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Results \"GooglePlus\")\n\n\n"

Berta Aldrich has been named Managing Director and Global Head of Private Wealth Marketing and David Robbins has been named Director of Enterprise RIA Relationship Management. Both joined SPW earlier this month.\n\n“We are excited to welcome these two accomplished executives with exceptional track records of success in growing asset management franchises the right way,” said Bob Long, Partner and CEO of StepStone Private Wealth. “With our platform now managing over $5 billion for individual investors and small institutions, Berta and David will play critical roles in our continued expansion and global brand recognition.”\n\nIn her newly created position, Ms. Aldrich will be responsible for marketing and brand strategy of the SPW platform globally. In 2023, she was named to the InvestmentNews Hot List, which recognizes the industry’s top financial professionals. Ms. Aldrich brings to SPW over three decades of experience with leading financial services companies. Prior to joining SPW, she was President of an executive training and coaching consultancy, working with Fortune 100 executives in multiple industries across the globe. Prior to that, she served in C-suite and senior marketing executive roles at Vanguard, Principal, FS Investments and Private Advisor Group. Ms. Aldrich holds an MBA from St. Joseph’s University and earned her bachelor’s degree from Iowa State University.\n\nMr. Robbins will lead the education, onboarding and servicing of the U.S.’s largest RIA firms. Prior to joining SPW, he was a Senior Vice President and National Sales Manager at Neuberger Berman covering RIAs and Multi-Family Offices. While there, he was responsible for distribution of the firm’s private equity, private credit, SMA, ETF, directing indexing, and mutual fund products, facilitating hundreds of new accounts and billions of dollars in new asset flows. Prior to Neuberger he held distribution roles of increasing responsibility at Lord Abbett & Co and began his career as a wholesaler at John Hancock. He holds a bachelor’s degree from Babson College.\n\n“At SPW, we have built a reputation for delivering private solutions designed with the end investor in mind,” said Neil Menard, Partner and President of Distribution, StepStone Private Wealth. “Adding Berta and David to the team will expand our efforts to share this message with new advisors and their clients while providing exceptional service.”\n\n**About StepStone**\n\nStepStone Group Inc.
