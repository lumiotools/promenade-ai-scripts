Upon completion of the merger, shareholders of Flag Ship will receive American Depositary Shares (\"ADSs\") of GRT and Flag Ship will be merged into the Merger Sub, a wholly-owned subsidiary of GRT. Completion of the merger will be subject to customary closing conditions, including that GRT ADSs will be approved to be listed and tradable on Nasdaq.\n\nGRT, a Hong Kong entity, has been in the business of developing and mass producing various optoelectronic products for more than a decade. It is publicly listed in South Korea, and has been pursuing expansion with multiple new factories and production line projects in China in recent years.\n\nMr. Matthew Chen, Chief Executive Officer of Flag Ship remarked, \"We are truly excited about the merger with the GRT Companies. Our team explored a broad range of industries, and determined that the transaction with the GRT Companies would provide the greatest value to our shareholders. GRT is a strong player in the field of optoelectronic products in China and globally. We are impressed by the GRT management team's track record in optoelectronic industry. We are very excited about the future prospects of the combined company.\"\n\nMr. Yongnan Zhou, the Chairman of GRT, stated, \"the merger with Flag Ship is another major step that GRT has taken in its growth history. GRT aims to become one of the leading companies in the field of optoelectronics globally and achieving this milestone will empower GRT to continue our great efforts to achieve our goals.\" \n\n**Transaction Details**\n\nUpon closing, Flag Ship will merge with and into the Merger Sub. By virtue of the merger and without any action of the part of Flag Ship, the Merger Sub, or any other person, each ordinary share of Flag Ship (each a \"Flag Ship Share\") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (the \"Effective Time\"), excluding Flag Ship Shares held by GRT and dissenting Flag Ship Shares, if any, will be automatically cancelled, extinguished and exchanged for the right to receive, immediately upon consummation the merger, one (1) ordinary share of GRT (such shares of GRT, collectively, \"GRT Ordinary Shares\") payable in American Depositary Shares of GRT (\"GRT ADSs\") for each such Flag Ship Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the \"Per Share Merger Consideration\"); and each right to receive one-tenth (1/10th) of a Flag Ship Share at the consummation of a business combination of Flag Ship (a \"Flag Ship Right\") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled, extinguished and exchanged for the right to receive, immediately upon the consummation of the merger, GRT Ordinary Shares, payable in GRT ADSs in an amount equal to (in each case, as rounded down to the nearest whole number) the product of (a) the Per Share Merger Consideration, multiplied by (b) the number of Flag Ship Shares that the holder of the cancelled Flag Ship Right (the \"Flag Ship Rights Holder\") would have been entitled to receive assuming satisfaction of the terms and conditions of such Flag Ship Right, multiplied by (c) the ADS exchange rate of rate of one (1) GRT Ordinary Share per one (1) GRT ADS (the \"ADS Exchange Rate\") (the \"Rights Merger Consideration\").\n\nThe aggregate consideration payable to pursuant to the Merger Agreement to the shareholders of Flag Ship entitled thereto shall consist of that number of GRT Ordinary Shares payable in GRT ADSs that is equal to (i) the Per Share Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of Flag Ship Shares registered in the name of those shareholders of Flag Ship immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by the ADS Exchange Rate, plus (ii) the Rights Merger Consideration, as described above.\n\nThe closing conditions of the merger include, among others, the approval of the merger by Flag Ship's existing shareholders and approvals from GRT shareholders, and the approval for listing of GRT's ADSs on the Nasdaq Stock Market.\n\nFrom the date of execution of the merger agreement through the closing, Flag Ship shall use all reasonable efforts to remain as a public company on, and for its securities to be tradable over the Nasdaq Global Market. GRT shall use all reasonable efforts to apply for a listing of GRT ADSs on, and for GRT ADSs to be tradable over, the Nasdaq stock market. \n\nBecker & Poliakoff P.A. and Ogier are acting as legal counsel to Flag Ship. Miller Canfield Paddock and Stone P.L.C. and Appleby are acting as legal counsel to the GRT Companies.\n\nThe description of the transaction contained herein is only a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the definitive agreements relating to the transaction, a copy of which will be filed by Flag Ship with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") as exhibits to a Current Report on Form 8-K.\n\n**About Flag Ship Acquisition Corporation**\n\nFlag Ship is a blank check company, also commonly referred to as a Special Purpose Acquisition Company, or SPAC, formed for the purpose of acquiring, engaging in a share exchange, share reconstruction and amalgamation, purchasing all or substantially all of the assets of, entering into contractual arrangements, or engaging in any other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities.

Any actual results may differ from expectations, estimates and projections presented or implied and, consequently, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Words such as \"expect,\" \"estimate,\" \"project,\" \"budget,\" \"forecast,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"could,\" \"should,\" \"believes,\" \"predicts,\" \"potential,\" \"continue,\" and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements.

Most of these factors are outside the parties' control and are difficult to predict. A number of factors could cause actual events, performance or results to differ materially from the events, performance and results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include, among other things: (a) the possibility that the business combination does not close or that the closing may be delayed because conditions to the closing may not be satisfied, including the receipt of requisite shareholder and other approvals, the performances of Flag Ship and GRT, and the ability of Flag Ship or, after the closing of the transactions, the combined company, to continue to meet the Nasdaq Stock Market's listing standards; (b) the reaction of GRT's licensors, collaborators, service providers or suppliers to the business combination; (c) unexpected costs, liabilities or delays in the business combination transaction; (d) the outcome of any legal proceedings related to the transaction; (e) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the business combination transaction agreement; (f) general economic conditions; (g) changes to the proposed structure of the business combination that may be required or appropriate as a result of applicable laws or regulations or as a condition to obtaining regulatory approval of the business combination; (h) the risk that the business combination disrupts current plans and operations of GRT as a result of the announcement and consummation of the transactions described herein; (i) the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the business combination, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability of GRT to grow and manage growth profitably, maintain relationships with customers and suppliers and retain its management and key employees; (j) changes in applicable laws or regulations, including legal or regulatory developments (including, without limitation, accounting considerations) which could result in unforeseen delays in the timing of the business combination and negatively impact the attractiveness of the business combination to investors; and (k) other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in the final prospectus of Flag Ship relating to its initial public offering filed with the SEC, including those under \"Risk Factors\" therein, and other documents filed or to be filed with the SEC by Flag Ship. Copies are available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.\n\nThe foregoing list of factors is not exclusive. Additional information concerning these and other risk factors are contained in Flag Ship's most recent filings with the SEC. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements concerning Flag Ship and GRT, the business combination transactions described herein or other matters and attributable to Flag Ship, GRT, or their respective shareholders or any person acting on behalf of any of them are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements above. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Except as required by law, neither Flag Ship, GRT, nor their respective shareholders undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement to reflect any change in their expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\n\nContact:Matthew ChenPhone: (212) 884-2667Email: **mchen@flagshipac.com** Flag Ship Acquisition Corporation\n\nRelated Links<http://en.tonglioptech.com/>\n\nSOURCE Flag Ship Acquisition Corporation\n\n![](https://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=CN36787&Transmission_Id=202410220800PR_NEWS_USPR_____CN36787&DateId=20241022)\n\n## WANT YOUR COMPANY'S NEWS FEATURED ON PRNEWSWIRE.COM?\n\n![icon3](/content/dam/newsfeatured/icon3.png)\n\n440k+ Newsrooms & Influencers \n\n![icon1](/content/dam/newsfeatured/icon1.png)\n\n9k+ Digital Media Outlets \n\n![icon2](/content/dam/newsfeatured/icon2.png)\n\n270k+ Journalists Opted In \n\n[GET STARTED](https://www.prnewswire.com/account/online-membership-form/)\n\n×\n\n### Modal title\n\n## Also from this source\n\n### [Flag Ship Acquisition Corporation Announces the Separate Trading of its Ordinary Shares and Rights  Flag Ship Acquisition Corporation (Nasdaq: FSHPU) (the \"Company\") announced today that, commencing Thursday, August 15, 2024, holders of the units... ](flag-ship-acquisition-corporation-announces-the-separate-trading-of-its-ordinary-shares-and-rights-302219362.html)\n\n### [FLAG SHIP ACQUISITION CORPORATION ANNOUNCES PRICING OF $60 MILLION INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING  Flag Ship Acquisition Corporation, a Cayman Islands exempt company announced today that it priced its initial public offering of 6,000,000 units at... ](flag-ship-acquisition-corporation-announces-pricing-of-60-million-initial-public-offering-302175412.html)\n\n[ More Releases From This Source ](/news/flag-ship-acquisition-corporation/)\n\n## Explore\n\n[ ![Banking & Financial Services](/content/dam/prnewswire/subject-and-industry-code-images/FIN.jpg) ](/news-releases/financial-services-latest-news/banking-financial-services-list/)\n\n[](/news-releases/financial-services-latest-news/banking-financial-services-list/)[Banking & Financial Services](/news-releases/financial-services-latest-news/banking-financial-services-list/)\n\n[ ![Computer & Electronics](/content/dam/prnewswire/subject-and-industry-code-images/CPR.jpg) ](/news-releases/business-technology-latest-news/computer-electronics-list/)\n\n[](/news-releases/business-technology-latest-news/computer-electronics-list/)[Computer & Electronics](/news-releases/business-technology-latest-news/computer-electronics-list/)\n\n[ ![Acquisitions, Mergers and Takeovers](/content/dam/prnewswire/subject-and-industry-code-images/TNM.jpg) ](/news-releases/financial-services-latest-news/acquisitions-mergers-and-takeovers-list/)\n\n[](/news-releases/financial-services-latest-news/acquisitions-mergers-and-takeovers-list/)[Acquisitions, Mergers and Takeovers](/news-releases/financial-services-latest-news/acquisitions-mergers-and-takeovers-list/)\n\n[ News Releases in Similar Topics ](/news-releases/)\n\n[](javascript://Chat)\n"
