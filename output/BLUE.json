(NASDAQ: BLUE) (“bluebird bio” or the “Company”) today reported third quarter results and business highlights for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, including recent commercial and operational progress. \n\n“Patient starts more than doubled from our second to third quarter update, providing clear evidence that our commercial launches continued to accelerate,” said Andrew Obenshain, chief executive officer. “This momentum, coupled with steps we took in the third quarter to increase manufacturing capacity for ZYNTEGLO and optimize our cost structure, is propelling bluebird forward on our path to becoming a sustainable commercial gene therapy company. We remain focused on securing additional cash resources to extend our runway, which we believe would enable us to achieve this vision and reach cash flow break-even in the second half of 2025.” \n\n**COMMERCIAL LAUNCH UPDATES**\n\n**_Continued commercial momentum across the portfolio_**\n\n  * 57 patient starts completed to date in 2024 (35 ZYNTEGLO, 17 LYFGENIA, 5 SKYSONA). \n  * 17 additional starts scheduled through the remainder of 2024. \n  * Evidence of strong commercial demand, with 30 patient starts already scheduled in 2025, supporting the potential for cash flow breakeven in the second half of 2025. \n  * More than 70 activated QTCs, with 40% having initiated or completed treatment for at least one patient. \n\n\n\n**_Validated access and reimbursement strategy is driving favorable coverage landscape_**\n\n  * To date, more than half of all states have affirmed coverage for LYFGENIA through a preferred drug list or published coverage criteria. \n  * Nearly 50% of Medicaid-insured individuals with sickle cell disease in the U.S. live in a state that has already completed prior authorization approval for the use of LYFGENIA for at least one patient. \n  * Multiple outcomes-based agreements are published and in place for LYFGENIA with national commercial payer organizations, representing more than 200 million U.S. lives. \n\n\n\n**DATA PRESENTATIONS AT ASH 2024**\n\nUpdated data from the Company’s lentiviral vector (LVV) gene addition programs in patients with sickle cell disease who have a history of vaso-occlusive events and patients with beta-thalassemia who require regular blood transfusions will be presented at the 66th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition. The meeting will take place December 7-10, 2024 at the San Diego Convention Center and online. \n\n**SICKLE CELL DISEASE DATA**\n\n  * **Oral Presentation [#511]:** An Update on Lovotibeglogene Autotemcel (lovo-cel) Clinical Trials for Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) and Analysis of Early Predictors of Response to Lovo-cel \n  * Presenting Author: Dr. Stacey Rifkin-Zenenberg (Hackensack) \n  * Date/Time: Sunday, December 8, 2024, 9:30 a.m. – 11:00 a.m. PT\n\n\n  * **Poster Presentation [#3576]:** Participants with a History of Stroke in Lovotibeglogene Autotemcel (lovo-cel) Clinical Trials \n  * Presenting Author: Dr. Jen Jaroscak (The Medical University of South Carolina) \n  * Date/Time: Sunday, December 8, 2024, 6:00 p.m. – 8:00 p.m. PT\n\n\n\n**BETA-THALASSEMIA DATA**\n\n  * **Poster Presentation [#2194]:** Betibeglogene Autotemcel (beti-cel) Gene Addition Therapy results in durable Hemoglobin A (HbA) Production with up to 10 Years of Follow-Up in Participants with Transfusion-Dependent β-Thalassemia \n  * Presenting Author: Dr. Alexis A Thompson (Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia) \n  * Date/Time: Saturday, December 7, 2024, 5:30 p.m. – 7:30 p.m. PT\n\n\n\nAbstracts outlining bluebird bio’s accepted data at ASH 2024 are available on the ASH conference website. \n\n**THIRD QUARTER FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n  * **Cash Position:** The Company’s cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balance was approximately $118.7 million, including restricted cash of approximately $48.0 million, as of September 30, 2024. bluebird and Hercules are engaging collaboratively as bluebird works to secure adequate cash runway to obtain additional financing and reach cash flow break-even. Based on current forecasts, which assume continued cost-saving initiatives, successfully renegotiating key contracts, and continued collaborative engagement from Hercules, we expect our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operations into the first quarter of 2025. The Company anticipates quarterly cash flow break-even in the second half of 2025, assuming it scales to approximately 40 drug product deliveries per quarter and obtains additional cash resources to extend its runway. \n\n\n  * **Revenue, net:** Total revenue, net was $10.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $12.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by quarter-to-quarter variability in drug product infusions. Revenue for the third quarter includes revenue from LYFGENIA, following the completion of the first infusion for sickle cell disease. bluebird previously guided to an anticipated reduction of net revenue in the third quarter; the Company now anticipates net revenue of at least $25 million in the fourth quarter 2024, as previously reported patient starts are infused. \n\n\n  * **Cost of Product Revenue:** Cost of product revenue was $11.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $9.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. \n\n\n  * **SG &A Expenses:** Selling, general and administrative expenses were $39.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $40.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of $1.0 million was primarily driven by decrease in employee compensation, benefit, and other headcount related expenses, commercial expenses, and facility fees, partially offset by increased professional services fees. \n\n\n  * **R &D Expenses:** Research and development expenses were $23.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $58.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of $35.3 million was primarily driven by material production shift to inventory and cost of product revenue as well as decreased employee compensation, benefit, and other headcount related expenses, consulting fees, and facility and information technology fees. \n\n\n  * **Net income (loss):** Net loss was $60.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $87.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. \n\n\n\n**CONFERENCE CALL DETAILS**\n\nbluebird will hold a conference call to discuss its third quarter 2024 results and business updates today, Wednesday, November 14, 2024, at 8:00 am ET. \n\nTo access the live conference call via telephone, please register at this [link](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fregister.vevent.com%2Fregister%2FBI9577e4e9b1a24a738d885fbd8352ea59&esheet=54152789&newsitemid=20241114895294&lan=en-US&anchor=link&index=1&md5=eb368fcfe9147ea51b6267d2c88e9346) to receive a dial in number and unique PIN. \n\nTo access the live webcast, please visit the “Events & Presentations” page within the Investors & Media section of the bluebird bio website at [http://investor.bluebirdbio.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Finvestor.bluebirdbio.com&esheet=54152789&newsitemid=20241114895294&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Finvestor.bluebirdbio.com&index=2&md5=12b0421fa7df48a725692843339d7c87).

All statements that are not statements of historical facts are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements, such as statements regarding future results of operations and financial position, including anticipated revenue for the fourth quarter; the number of anticipated patient starts across bluebird’s portfolio of therapies; the Company’s anticipated cash runway and path to cash flow breakeven in the second half of 2025, including the impact of_ c _ontinued cost-saving initiatives, bluebird’s ability to successfully renegotiate key contracts, and continued collaborative engagement from Hercules, and the Company’s ability to obtain additional cash resources; the Company’s expectations with respect to the commercialization of its products, including without limitation, patient demand, the timing and amount of revenue recognition; and the Company’s ability to establish favorable coverage for its therapies. Such forward-looking statements are based on historical performance and current expectations and projections about bluebird’s future goals, plans and objectives and involve inherent risks, assumptions and uncertainties, including internal or external factors that could delay, divert or change any of them in the next several years, that are difficult to predict, may be beyond bluebird’s control and could cause bluebird’s future goals, plans and objectives to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the statements. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. Forward-looking statements in this press release should be evaluated together with the many risks and uncertainties that affect bluebird bio’s business, particularly those identified in the risk factors discussion in bluebird bio’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as updated by its subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and other __filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: delays and challenges in bluebird’s commercialization and manufacturing of its products, including challenges in manufacturing vector for ZYNTEGLO and SKYSONA to meet current demand; the internal and external costs required for bluebird’s ongoing and planned activities, and the resulting impact on expense and use of cash, has been, and may in the future be, higher than expected, which has caused bluebird, and may in the future cause bluebird, to use cash more quickly than it expects or change or curtail some of its plans or both; substantial doubt exists regarding bluebird’s ability to continue as a going concern; bluebird’s expectations as to expenses, cash usage and cash needs may prove not to be correct for other reasons such as changes in plans or actual events being different than bluebird’s assumptions; the risk that additional funding may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all; risks related to bluebird's loan agreement, including the risk that operating restrictions could adversely affect bluebird's ability to conduct its business, the risk that bluebird will not achieve milestones required to access future tranches under the agreement, and the risk that bluebird will fail to comply with covenants under the agreement, including with respect to required cash and revenue levels, which could result in an event of default; the risk that the efficacy and safety results from bluebird’s prior and ongoing clinical trials will not continue or be seen in the commercial context; the risk that the QTCs experience delays in their ability to enroll or treat patients; the risk that bluebird experiences delays in establishing operational readiness across its supply chain ; the risk that there is not sufficient patient demand or payer reimbursement to support continued commercialization of the Company’s therapies; the risk of insertional oncogenic or other safety events associated with lentiviral vector, drug product, or myeloablation, including the risk of hematologic malignancy; the risk that bluebird’s products, including LYFGENIA, will not be successfully commercialized; and risks related to compliance with Nasdaq continued listing requirements. The forward-looking statements included in this document are made only as of the date of this document and except as otherwise required by applicable law, bluebird bio undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise._\n\n**bluebird bio, Inc.** **Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations** **(in thousands, except per share data)** **(unaudited)**  \n---  \n**For the three months ended September 30,** |  **For the nine months ended** **September 30 ,**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**(As Restated)** |  **(As Restated)**  \nRevenue:   \nProduct revenue, net  |  $  |  10,612  |  $  |  12,281  |  $  |  45,274  |  $  |  21,414   \nOther revenue  |  —  |  111  |  12  |  249   \nTotal revenues  |  10,612  |  12,392  |  45,286  |  21,663   \nCost of product revenue  |  11,781  |  9,126  |  66,591  |  21,335   \nGross margin  |  (1,169  |  )  |  3,266  |  (21,305  |  )  |  328   \nOperating expenses:   \nSelling, general and administrative  |  39,765  |  40,771  |  136,479  |  118,700   \nResearch and development  |  23,174  |  58,501  |  73,408  |  131,536   \nRestructuring expenses  |  2,811  |  —  |  2,811  |  —   \nTotal operating expenses  |  65,750  |  99,272  |  212,698  |  250,236   \nGain from sale of priority review voucher, net  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  92,930   \nLoss from operations  |  (66,919  |  )  |  (96,006  |  )  |  (234,003  |  )  |  (156,978  |  )   \nInterest income  |  1,640  |  2,454  |  7,056  |  7,961   \nInterest expense  |  (5,778  |  )  |  (4,311  |  )  |  (16,875  |  )  |  (12,331  |  )   \nOther income, net  |  10,191  |  10,631  |  31,782  |  30,177   \nLoss before income taxes  |  (60,866  |  )  |  (87,232  |  )  |  (212,040  |  )  |  (131,171  |  )   \nIncome tax (expense) benefit  |  58  |  —  |  37  |  80   \nNet loss  |  $  |  (60,808  |  )  |  $  |  (87,232  |  )  |  $  |  (212,003  |  )  |  $  |  (131,091  |  )   \nNet loss per share - basic  |  $  |  (0.31  |  )  |  $  |  (0.80  |  )  |  $  |  (1.10  |  )  |  $  |  (1.23  |  )   \nNet loss per share - diluted  |  $  |  (0.31  |  )  |  $  |  (0.80  |  )  |  $  |  (1.10  |  )  |  $  |  (1.23  |  )   \nWeighted-average number of common shares used in computing net loss per share - basic:  |  193,893  |  109,098  |  193,588  |  106,924   \nWeighted-average number of common shares used in computing net loss per share - diluted:  |  193,893  |  109,098  |  193,588  |  106,924   \nOther comprehensive income (loss):   \nOther comprehensive income (loss), net of tax benefit (expense) of $0.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023  |  611  |  137  |  285  |  1,843   \nTotal other comprehensive income (loss)  |  611  |  137  |  285  |  1,843   \nComprehensive loss  |  $  |  (60,197  |  )  |  $  |  (87,095  |  )  |  $  |  (211,718  |  )  |  $  |  (129,248  |  )   \n  \n**bluebird bio, Inc.** **Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets** **(in thousands, except per share data)** **(unaudited)**  \n---  \n**As of** **September 30 ,** **2024** |  **As of** **December 31 ,** **2023**  \nCash and cash equivalents  |  $  |  70,651  |  $  |  221,755   \nRestricted cash  |  48,001  |  52,842   \nTotal assets  |  465,056  |  619,161   \nTotal liabilities  |  470,842  |  424,624   \nTotal stockholders’ equity  |  (5,786  |  )  |  194,537   \n  \n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241114895294r1&sid=acqr8&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nView source version on [businesswire.com](http://businesswire.com): <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241114895294/en/>\n\n**Investors & Media**\n\n**I****nvestors:** Courtney O’Leary, 978-621-7347 coleary@bluebirdbio.com\n\n**Media:** Jess Rowlands, 857-299-6103 jess.rowlands@bluebirdbio.com\n\nSource: bluebird bio, Inc.\n\n![](https://bat.bing.com/action/0?ti=21014070&tm=gtm002&Ver=2&mid=24d1742a-d32e-4965-91b8-8bce3d8c4314&bo=1&sid=8de15600af1b11efb37f2b344b6f95fb&vid=8de16960af1b11ef8e4dc1467af7f489&vids=1&msclkid=N&uach=pv%3D10.0&pi=918639831&lg=en-US&sw=1920&sh=1080&sc=24&nwd=1&tl=bluebird%20bio%20Reports%20Third%20Quarter%202024%20Results%20and%20Highlights%20Operational%20Progress%20and%202024%20Guidance%20-%20bluebird%20bio,%20Inc.&p=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.bluebirdbio.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fbluebird-bio-reports-third-quarter-2024-results-and-highlights&r=&evt=pageLoad&sv=1&cdb=AQAQ&rn=220864)\n"

(NASDAQ: BLUE) (“bluebird bio” or the “Company”) today announced that it partially adjourned its annual meeting of stockholders (“Annual Meeting”) on Wednesday, November 6, 2024, to allow the Company to solicit additional votes to obtain approval of Proposal 4, a reverse stock split, as described in the Company's definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 26, 2024 (the “proxy statement”). The Company’s stockholders approved Proposals 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7, and did not approve Proposal 3 during the Annual Meeting held earlier today (all proposals as described in the proxy statement). The Annual Meeting will reconvene on December 4, 2024, solely with respect to Proposal 4, beginning at 8:30 AM ET at the Company’s offices at 455 Grand Union Boulevard, Somerville, MA. The record date as of the close of business on September 16, 2024, remains unchanged for the determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to vote at the reconvened Annual Meeting. \n\nProposal 4 seeks stockholder approval to amend bluebird's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to implement a reverse stock split of the Company's common stock at a ratio ranging from any whole number between 1-for-15 and 1-for-20, as determined by the Company's board of directors in its discretion. \n\n“bluebird’s gene therapies provide transformative – and even potentially curative – benefits to patients, but today, due to our current stock price, we are at risk of being de-listed from Nasdaq. In addition, further capital is required to reach our expected cash flow breakeven point in the second half of next year,” said Andrew Obenshain, chief executive officer, bluebird bio. “While bluebird is pursuing multiple sources of capital, those sources are not guaranteed. bluebird’s proposed reverse stock split (Proposal 4) is intended to support efforts to restore stockholder value and would provide the Company with flexibility as it considers financing options. Our priority in the coming weeks is engaging with stockholders to answer their questions and secure the votes to complete this important step.” \n\n**As previously announced, ISS and Glass Lewis, independent proxy advisory firms to thousands of institutional stockholders and pension funds, have both recommended in favor of the reverse stock split in Proposal 4.**\n\n**bluebird bio’s board of directors strongly encourages that stockholders vote “FOR” Proposal 4.**\n\nWhile overall stockholder votes are in favor of Proposal 4 by approximately two to one, approval for the proposed reverse stock split requires a vote of more than 50 percent of the total shares outstanding. \n\nProxies previously submitted in respect of Proposal 4 will be voted at the adjourned Annual Meeting unless properly revoked. Stockholders who have previously submitted their proxy or otherwise voted in respect of Proposal 4 and who do not want to change their vote need not take any action. \n\nPlease follow the instructions shown on your proxy card or voting instruction form to vote your shares today. Stockholders who have questions or need assistance voting your shares, please contact Innisfree, bluebird’s proxy solicitor at 877-750-0854. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Results Call Date**\n\nbluebird bio also announced today that it will host a conference call to discuss third quarter 2024 results and business updates on Thursday, November 14, 2024 at 8:00 a.m. ET. \n\nTo access the live conference call via telephone, please register at this [link](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fregister.vevent.com%2Fregister%2FBI9577e4e9b1a24a738d885fbd8352ea59&esheet=54148292&newsitemid=20241106514558&lan=en-US&anchor=link&index=1&md5=2c520c2ecd9394db1fe85d09fe28e013) to receive a dial in number and unique PIN. \n\nTo access the live webcast, please visit the “Events & Presentations” page within the Investors & Media section of the bluebird bio website at [http://investor.bluebirdbio.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Finvestor.bluebirdbio.com&esheet=54148292&newsitemid=20241106514558&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Finvestor.bluebirdbio.com&index=2&md5=489be2ec053f522be4ada3fe194fb4cd).

(Nasdaq: BLUE) today announced that new and updated data from its lentiviral vector (LVV) gene addition programs in patients with sickle cell disease who have a history of vaso-occlusive events and patients with beta-thalassemia who require regular blood transfusions will be presented at the 66th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition. The meeting will take place December 7-10, 2024 at the San Diego Convention Center and online. \n\n“The data to be presented at ASH 2024 continue to underscore the transformative, long-term potential of bluebird’s gene therapies,” said Richard Colvin, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer, bluebird bio. “Our programs continue to be the most deeply studied in the field, now with up to a decade of follow-up in patients with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia and almost ten years of follow-up in patients with sickle cell disease. We especially look forward to the first ever focused sub-analysis of lovo-cel’s clinical impact on patients with a history of stroke, which is unique among gene therapies for sickle cell disease.” \n\nbluebird bio will present updated follow-up data and analysis of early predictors and response to lovotibeglogene autotemcel (lovo-cel) in patients from HGB-206 and HGB-210 studies, demonstrating consistent clinical outcomes as early as six months post infusion and continued durability of clinical benefit of lovo-cel. \n\nAn integrated analysis of lovo-cel in patients with sickle cell disease with a history of stroke, including overt stroke from the HBG-206 Group A and Group C studies and silent stroke from the HGB-206 and HGB-210 studies, will also be presented. The data demonstrate clinical benefit in patients with a history of stroke and consistent outcomes with the overall lovo-cel treated population. \n\nThe lovo-cel treatment regimen safety profile reflects the known effects of underlying sickle cell disease and myeloablative conditioning and is similar across age groups. \n\nThe company will also present updated long-term analyses of efficacy, safety, and health related quality of life data of betibeglogene autotemcel (beti-cel) in patients with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT). Data from the long term follow up study of up to ten years reveals patients with TDT achieved durable transfusion independence and normal or near-normal hemoglobin, regardless of genotype and age, with a favorable long-term safety profile. \n\n**Sickle Cell Disease Data****Oral Presentation [#511]: An Update on Lovotibeglogene Autotemcel (lovo-cel) Clinical Trials for Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) and Analysis of Early Predictors of Response to Lovo-cel****Presenting Author:** Dr. Stacey Rifkin-Zenenberg (Hackensack) **Date/Time:** Sunday, December 8, 2024, 9:30 a.m. – 11:00 a.m. PT\n\n**Poster Presentation [#3576]:** **Participants with a History of Stroke in Lovotibeglogene Autotemcel (lovo-cel) Clinical Trials****Presenting Author:** Dr. Jen Jaroscak (MUSC) **Date/Time:** Sunday, December 8, 2024, 6:00 p.m. – 8:00 p.m. PT\n\n**Beta-Thalassemia Data****Poster Presentation [#2194****]:** **Betibeglogene Autotemcel (beti-cel) Gene Addition Therapy results in durable Hemoglobin A (HbA) Production with up to 10 Years of Follow-Up in Participants with Transfusion-Dependent β-Thalassemia****Presenting Author:** Dr. Alexis A Thompson (CHOP) **Date/Time:** Saturday, December 7, 2024, 5:30 p.m. – 7:30 p.m. PT\n\nAbstracts outlining bluebird bio’s accepted data at ASH 2024 are available on the ASH conference [**website**](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fash.confex.com%2Fash%2F2024%2Fwebprogram%2Fstart.html&esheet=54147152&newsitemid=20241105481623&lan=en-US&anchor=website&index=1&md5=e03c357afbcb22126551ceb642ae245b). \n\nLovo-cel was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2023 and is commercially available in the United States as LYFGENIA. Beti-cel was approved by the FDA in August 2022 and is commercially available in the United States as ZYNTEGLO. \n\n**About LYFGENIA™ (lovotibeglogene autotemcel) or lovo-cel**\n\nLYFGENIA is a one-time ex-vivo lentiviral vector gene therapy approved for the treatment of patients 12 years of age or older with sickle cell disease and a history of vaso-occlusive events (VOEs). LYFGENIA works by adding a functional β-globin gene to patients’ own hematopoietic (blood) stem cells (HSCs). Durable production of adult hemoglobin with anti-sickling properties (HbAT87Q) is possible following successful engraftment. HbAT87Q has a similar oxygen-binding affinity to wild-type HbA, limits sickling of red blood cells and has the potential to reduce VOEs. \n\nThe Phase 1/2 HGB-206 study of LYFGENIA is complete and the Phase 3 HGB-210 study evaluating LYFGENIA is ongoing. bluebird bio is also conducting a long-term safety and efficacy follow-up study (LTF-307) for patients with sickle cell disease who have been treated with LYFGENIA in bluebird bio-sponsored clinical studies. \n\n**Indication**\n\nLYFGENIA is indicated for the treatment of patients 12 years of age or older with sickle cell disease and a history of vaso-occlusive events (VOEs). \n\n**Limitations of Use**\n\nFollowing treatment with LYFGENIA, patients with α-thalassemia trait (-α3.7/-α3.7) may experience anemia with erythroid dysplasia that may require chronic red blood cell transfusions. LYFGENIA has not been studied in patients with more than two α-globin gene deletions. \n\n**Important Safety Information**\n\n**Boxed WARNING: HEMATOLOGIC MALIGNANCY**\n\n**Hematologic malignancy has occurred in patients treated with LYFGENIA. Monitor patients closely for evidence of malignancy through complete blood counts at least every 6 months and through integration site analysis at Months 6, 12, and as warranted.**\n\n**Hematologic Malignancy**\n\nHematologic malignancy has occurred in patients treated with LYFGENIA (Study 1, Group A). At the time of initial product approval, two patients treated with an earlier version of LYFGENIA using a different manufacturing process and transplant procedure (Study 1, Group A) developed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). One patient with α-thalassemia trait (Study 1, Group C) has been diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). \n\nThe additional hematopoietic stress associated with mobilization, conditioning, and infusion of LYFGENIA, including the need to regenerate the hematopoietic system, may increase the risk of a hematologic malignancy. Patients with sickle cell disease have an increased risk of hematologic malignancy as compared to the general population. \n\nPatients treated with LYFGENIA may develop hematologic malignancies and should have lifelong monitoring. Monitor for hematologic malignancies with a complete blood count (with differential) at least every 6 months for at least 15 years after treatment with LYFGENIA, and integration site analysis at Months 6, 12, and as warranted. \n\nIn the event that a malignancy occurs, contact bluebird bio at 1-833-999-6378 for reporting and to obtain instructions on collection of samples for testing. \n\nPost-Marketing Long Term Follow-Up Study: Patients who intend to receive treatment with LYFGENIA are encouraged to enroll in the study, as available, to assess the long-term safety of LYFGENIA and the risk of malignancies occurring after treatment with LYFGENIA by calling bluebird bio at 1-833-999-6378. The study includes monitoring (at pre-specified intervals) for clonal expansion. \n\n**Delayed Platelet Engraftment**\n\nDelayed platelet engraftment has been observed with LYFGENIA. Bleeding risk is increased prior to platelet engraftment and may continue after engraftment in patients with prolonged thrombocytopenia. Two patients (4%) required more than 100 days post treatment with LYFGENIA to achieve platelet engraftment. \n\nPatients should be made aware of the risk of bleeding until platelet recovery has been achieved. Monitor patients for thrombocytopenia and bleeding according to standard guidelines. Conduct frequent platelet counts until platelet engraftment and platelet recovery are achieved. Perform blood cell count determination and other appropriate testing whenever clinical symptoms suggestive of bleeding arise. \n\n**Neutrophil Engraftment Failure**\n\nThere is a potential risk of neutrophil engraftment failure after treatment with LYFGENIA. Neutrophil engraftment failure is defined as failure to achieve three consecutive absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) ≥ 0.5 × 109 cells/L obtained on different days by Day 43 after infusion of LYFGENIA. Monitor neutrophil counts until engraftment has been achieved. If neutrophil engraftment failure occurs in a patient treated with LYFGENIA, provide rescue treatment with the back-up collection of CD34+ cells. \n\n**Insertional Oncogenesis**\n\nThere is a potential risk of lentiviral vector-mediated insertional oncogenesis after treatment with LYFGENIA. \n\n**Hypersensitivity Reactions**\n\nAllergic reactions may occur with the infusion of LYFGENIA. The dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or dextran 40 in LYFGENIA may cause hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis. \n\n**Anti-retroviral Use**\n\nPatients should not take prophylactic HIV anti-retroviral medications for at least one month prior to mobilization and until all cycles of apheresis are completed. There are some long-acting anti-retroviral medications that may require a longer duration of discontinuation for elimination of the medication. If a patient is taking anti-retrovirals for HIV prophylaxis, confirm a negative test for HIV before beginning mobilization and apheresis of CD34+ cells. \n\n**Hydroxyurea Use**\n\nPatients should not take hydroxyurea for at least 2 months prior to mobilization and until all cycles of apheresis are completed. If hydroxyurea is administered between mobilization and conditioning, discontinue 2 days prior to initiation of conditioning. \n\n**Iron Chelation**\n\nDrug-drug interactions between iron chelators and the mobilization process and myeloablative conditioning agent must be considered. Iron chelators should be discontinued at least 7 days prior to initiation of mobilization or conditioning. Do not administer myelosuppressive iron chelators (e.g., deferiprone) for 6 months post-treatment with LYFGENIA. Non-myelosuppressive iron chelation should be restarted no sooner than 3 months after LYFGENIA infusion. Phlebotomy can be used in lieu of iron chelation, when appropriate. \n\n**Interference with PCR-based Testing**\n\nPatients who have received LYFGENIA are likely to test positive by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for HIV due to integrated BB305 LVV proviral DNA, resulting in a possible false-positive PCR assay test result for HIV. Therefore, patients who have received LYFGENIA should not be screened for HIV infection using a PCR-based assay. \n\n**Adverse Reactions**\n\nThe most common adverse reactions ≥ Grade 3 (incidence ≥ 20%) were stomatitis, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, anemia, and leukopenia. \n\nThree patients died during LYFGENIA clinical trials; one from sudden cardiac death due to underlying disease and two from acute myeloid leukemia who were treated with an earlier version of LYFGENIA using a different manufacturing process and transplant procedure (Study 1, Group A). \n\n**Pregnancy/Lactation**\n\nAdvise patients of the risks associated with myeloablative conditioning agents, including on pregnancy and fertility. \n\nLYFGENIA should not be administered to women who are pregnant, and pregnancy after LYFGENIA infusion should be discussed with the treating physician. \n\nLYFGENIA is not recommended for women who are breastfeeding, and breastfeeding after LYFGENIA infusion should be discussed with the treating physician. \n\n**Females and Males of Reproductive Potential**\n\nA negative serum pregnancy test must be confirmed prior to the start of mobilization and re-confirmed prior to conditioning procedures and before LYFGENIA administration. \n\nWomen of childbearing potential and men capable of fathering a child should use an effective method of contraception (intra-uterine device or combination of hormonal and barrier contraception) from start of mobilization through at least 6 months after administration of LYFGENIA. \n\nAdvise patients of the options for fertility preservation. \n\n**Please see full**[**Prescribing Information**](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bluebirdbio.com%2F-%2Fmedia%2Fbluebirdbio%2FCorporate%2520COM%2FFiles%2FLyfgenia%2FLYFGENIA_Prescribing_Information.pdf&esheet=54147152&newsitemid=20241105481623&lan=en-US&anchor=Prescribing+Information&index=2&md5=3585aaaf69b45c64523d8c1bbabe62a3)for LYFGENIA including**Boxed WARNING** and [**Medication Guide**](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bluebirdbio.com%2F-%2Fmedia%2Fbluebirdbio%2FCorporate%2520COM%2FFiles%2FLyfgenia%2FLYFGENIA_Medication_Guide.pdf&esheet=54147152&newsitemid=20241105481623&lan=en-US&anchor=Medication+Guide&index=3&md5=8a02d28ee56b3d7b4c004810a2c9a24c)**.**\n\n**About ZYNTEGLO™ (betibeglogene autotemcel) or beti-cel**\n\nZYNTEGLO is a first-in-class, one-time ex-vivo LVV gene therapy approved for the treatment of beta-thalassemia in adult and pediatric patients who require regular red blood cell transfusions. ZYNTEGLO works by adding functional copies of a modified form of the beta-globin gene (βA-T87Q-globin gene) into a patient’s own hematopoietic (blood) stem cells to enable the production of a modified functional adult hemoglobin (HbAT87Q). Once a patient has the βA-T87Q-globin gene, they have the potential to increase ZYNTEGLO-derived adult hemoglobin (HbAT87Q) and total hemoglobin to normal or near normal levels that can eliminate the need for regular red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. \n\n**Indication**\n\nZYNTEGLO is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with beta-thalassemia who require regular red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. \n\n**Important Safety Information**\n\n**Delayed Platelet Engraftment**\n\nDelayed platelet engraftment has been observed with ZYNTEGLO treatment. Bleeding risk is increased prior to platelet engraftment and may continue after engraftment in patients with prolonged thrombocytopenia; 15% of patients had ≥ Grade 3 decreased platelets on or after Day 100. \n\nPatients should be made aware of the risk of bleeding until platelet recovery has been achieved. Monitor patients for thrombocytopenia and bleeding according to standard guidelines. Conduct frequent platelet counts until platelet engraftment and platelet recovery are achieved. Perform blood cell count determination and other appropriate testing whenever clinical symptoms suggestive of bleeding arise. \n\n**Risk of Neutrophil Engraftment Failure**\n\nThere is a potential risk of neutrophil engraftment failure after treatment with ZYNTEGLO. Neutrophil engraftment failure is defined as failure to achieve three consecutive absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) ≥ 500 cells/microliter obtained on different days by Day 43 after infusion of ZYNTEGLO. Monitor neutrophil counts until engraftment has been achieved. If neutrophil engraftment failure occurs in a patient treated with ZYNTEGLO, provide rescue treatment with the back-up collection of CD34+ cells. \n\n**Risk of Insertional Oncogenesis**\n\nThere is a potential risk of LVV mediated insertional oncogenesis after treatment with ZYNTEGLO. \n\nPatients treated with ZYNTEGLO may develop hematologic malignancies and should be monitored lifelong. Monitor for hematologic malignancies with a complete blood count (with differential) at Month 6 and Month 12 and then at least annually for at least 15 years after treatment with ZYNTEGLO, and integration site analysis at Months 6, 12, and as warranted. \n\nIn the event that a malignancy occurs, contact bluebird bio at 1 833-999-6378 for reporting and to obtain instructions on collection of samples for testing. \n\n**Hypersensitivity Reactions**\n\nAllergic reactions may occur with the infusion of ZYNTEGLO. The dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in ZYNTEGLO may cause hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis. \n\n**Anti-retroviral and Hydroxyurea Use**\n\nPatients should not take prophylactic HIV anti-retroviral medications or hydroxyurea for at least one month prior to mobilization, or for the expected duration for elimination of the medications, and until all cycles of apheresis are completed. If a patient requires anti-retrovirals for HIV prophylaxis, then confirm a negative test for HIV before beginning mobilization and apheresis of CD34+ cells. \n\n**Interference with Serology Testing**\n\nPatients who have received ZYNTEGLO are likely to test positive by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for HIV due to integrated BB305 LVV proviral DNA, resulting in a false-positive test for HIV. Therefore, patients who have received ZYNTEGLO should not be screened for HIV infection using a PCR-based assay. \n\n**Adverse Reactions**\n\nThe most common non-laboratory adverse reactions (≥20%) were mucositis, febrile neutropenia, vomiting, pyrexia, alopecia, epistaxis, abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, cough, headache, diarrhea, rash, constipation, nausea, decreased appetite, pigmentation disorder, and pruritus. The most common Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities (>50%) include neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, anemia, and lymphopenia. \n\n**Drug Interactions**\n\nDrug-drug interactions between iron chelators and the myeloablative conditioning agent must be considered. Iron chelators should be discontinued at least 7 days prior to initiation of conditioning. The prescribing information for the iron chelator(s) and the myeloablative conditioning agent should be consulted for the recommendations regarding co-administration with CYP3A substrates. \n\nSome iron chelators are myelosuppressive. After ZYNTEGLO infusion, avoid use of these iron chelators for 6 months. If iron chelation is needed, consider administration of non-myelosuppressive iron chelators. Phlebotomy can be used in lieu of iron chelation, when appropriate. \n\n**Pregnancy/Lactation**\n\nAdvise patients of the risks associated with conditioning agents, including on pregnancy and fertility. \n\nZYNTEGLO should not be administered to women who are pregnant, and pregnancy after ZYNTEGLO infusion should be discussed with the treating physician. \n\nZYNTEGLO is not recommended for women who are breastfeeding, and breastfeeding after ZYNTEGLO infusion should be discussed with the treating physician. \n\n**Females and Males of Reproductive Potential**\n\nA negative serum pregnancy test must be confirmed prior to the start of mobilization and re-confirmed prior to conditioning procedures and before ZYNTEGLO administration. \n\nWomen of childbearing potential and men capable of fathering a child should use an effective method of contraception (intra uterine device or combination of hormonal and barrier contraception) from start of mobilization through at least 6 months after administration of ZYNTEGLO. \n\nAdvise patients of the option to cryopreserve semen or ova before treatment if appropriate. \n\nPlease see full [**Prescribing Information**](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bluebirdbio.com%2F-%2Fmedia%2Fbluebirdbio%2FCorporate%2520COM%2FFiles%2FZynteglo%2FZYNTEGLO_prescribing_information.pdf&esheet=54147152&newsitemid=20241105481623&lan=en-US&anchor=Prescribing+Information&index=4&md5=4f232cb65f0ee71567979a6111fd47be)for ZYNTEGLO. \n\n**About bluebird bio, Inc.**\n\nbluebird bio is pursuing curative gene therapies to give patients and their families more bluebird days. \n\nFounded in 2010, bluebird has been setting the standard for gene therapy for more than a decade—first as a scientific pioneer and now as a commercial leader. bluebird has an unrivaled track record in bringing the promise of gene therapy out of clinical studies and into the real-world setting, having secured FDA approvals for three therapies in under two years.
