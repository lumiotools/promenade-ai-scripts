(Nasdaq: \"CLST\") (the \"Company\"), the parent company for Catalyst Bank (the \"Bank\") ([www.catalystbank.com](http://www.catalystbank.com)), announced today that the Board of Directors approved the Company's fifth share repurchase plan. \n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/St. Landry Homestead Federal Savings Bank\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1774086/Catalyst_Bancorp_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1774086/Catalyst_Bancorp_Logo.html)\n\n\"It has been over three years since we embarked on our public company journey. We've set ambitious goals to transform ourselves into a consistently strong performing community bank. High among those goals is focusing our mission on serving as catalysts to help local businesses grow – because when they do, they create jobs in our communities. We rebranded as Catalyst Bank to reinforce our commitment,\" said Joe Zanco, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Bank.\n\n\"We have expanded our branch network into the business center of our region, adding locations in Carencro and Lafayette, Louisiana. Although we increased our branch count by two, or 50%, we have held our employee count steady by focusing on enhancing efficiency throughout the Company. \n\n\"We have upgraded our systems and now offer some of the very best in banking technology. The systems upgrade reduces non-interest expense over $200,000 annually and also facilitates additional efficiency gains. \n\n\"Our collective efforts have resulted in meaningful customer growth, especially in 2024. In fact, loan growth through the third quarter was a record $21 million. As a result of organic customer growth and greater efficiency, our core profitability continues to improve. \n\n\"Not everything has gone according to plan since our IPO. At the outset of our journey, we believed there might be opportunities to acquire one or more banks during the first three years following our IPO, which would have allowed us to expand our footprint and enhance profitability more rapidly. Unfortunately, the right opportunities have not presented themselves to date. However, we still have the capital and management depth and expertise to take advantage of desirable opportunities should they present themselves in the near future. \n\n\"Today, we announced our fifth share repurchase plan (the \"November 2024 Repurchase Plan\"). Under the November 2024 Repurchase Plan, the Company may purchase up to 215,000 shares, or approximately 5%, of the Company's outstanding common stock. Since the announcement of our first share repurchase plan in January 2023 and through November 22, 2024, the Company has repurchased a total of 972,916 shares of its common stock, or approximately 18% of the common shares originally issued, at an average cost per share of $11.93.\n\n\"As we enter the new year, know that we are focused on serving our customers tremendously well, deepening the skills of our employees and enhancing our profitability and shareholder value. What we've achieved since our IPO is the result of the efforts of our dynamic team. Our commitment to growing and further improving our company is stronger than ever.\"\n\n**About Catalyst Bancorp, Inc.**\n\nCatalyst Bancorp, Inc.

The full amount of our public fund deposits in excess of the FDIC's insurance limit are secured by pledging investment securities and portions of a custodial letter of credit from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas.\n\n**Capital and Share Repurchases**\n\nAt September 30 and June 30, 2024, consolidated shareholders' equity totaled $81.7 million, or 29.1% of total assets, and $81.0 million, or 27.4% of total assets, respectively.\n\nThe Company repurchased 79,400 shares of its common stock at an average cost per share of $11.75 during the third quarter of 2024, compared to 79,802 shares at an average cost per share of $11.88 during the second quarter of 2024.

Since the announcement of our first share repurchase plan on January 26, 2023 and through June 30, 2024, the Company has repurchased a total of 811,473 shares of its common stock, or approximately 15% of the common shares originally issued, at an average cost per share of $11.98.\n\n**Net Interest Income**\n\nThe net interest margin for the second quarter of 2024 was 3.72%, up 60 basis points compared to the prior quarter. For the second quarter of 2024, the average yield on interest-earning assets was 5.35%, up 65 basis points from the prior quarter, while the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 2.50%, up five basis points from the first quarter of 2024.\n\nNet interest income for the second quarter of 2024 was $2.4 million, up $355,000, or 17%, compared to the first quarter of 2024.

Construction loan growth was largely driven by multi-family residential development and additional fundings on several existing construction loans.\n\nThe following table summarizes the composition of our construction and land loan balances and commitments, including the related undisbursed amounts for construction projects in process as of March 31, 2024.\n\n**_(Dollars in thousands)_** | **Loan Balance** | **Undisbursed** | **Total Commitment**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**Commercial construction and land loans**  \nMulti-family residential | $ | 4,782 | $ | 3,218 | $ | 8,000  \nRetail | 711 | 4,769 | 5,480  \nHealth service facilities | 2,749 | 2,663 | 5,412  \nHospitality | 2,716 | 700 | 3,416  \nResidential subdivision development | 813 | 9 | 822  \nCommercial land | 297 | - | 297  \nOther commercial construction and development | 3,790 | 289 | 4,079  \nTotal commercial construction and land | $ | 15,858 | $ | 11,648 | $ | 27,506  \n**Consumer construction and land loans**  \nResidential construction | 2,851 | 1,241 | 4,092  \nConsumer land | 660 | - | 660  \nTotal consumer construction and land | 3,511 | 1,241 | 4,752  \nTotal construction and land | $ | 19,369 | $ | 12,889 | $ | 32,258  \n  \nBased on total commitment and contractual maturity date, the weighted average term to maturity of our construction and land loan portfolio is approximately 11 months as of March 31, 2024.\n\n**Credit Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses**\n\nAt March 31, 2024, non-performing assets (\"NPAs\") totaled $1.7 million, down $331,000, or 16.1%, compared to $2.1 million at December 31, 2023.

The provision for credit losses, inclusive of the provision for unfunded commitments, for the first quarter of 2024 totaled $95,000 and was largely attributable to growth in total construction loan commitments.\n\nNet loan charge-offs totaled $98,000 during the first quarter of 2024, compared to net charge-offs of $63,000 for the fourth quarter of 2023. Net loan charge-offs in both periods were primarily attributable to one- to four-family residential loans.\n\n**Investment Securities**\n\nTotal investment securities were $39.0 million, or 13.8% of total assets, at March 31, 2024, down $45.0 million, or 53.6%, compared to December 31, 2023.

During the first quarter of 2024, the Bank increased its borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta through the BTFP.
