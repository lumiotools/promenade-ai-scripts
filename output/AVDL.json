This quarter, we are proud to see that expansion come to fruition and continue to be encouraged by patient uptake and quarter-over-quarter growth of LUMRYZ. In parallel to our launch in adults with narcolepsy, we are expanding into additional patient populations, starting with the recent FDA approval of LUMRYZ for the treatment of cataplexy or EDS in patients 7 years and older with narcolepsy, significantly alleviating the burden on patients and their caregivers of waking up in the middle of the night to administer treatment,” stated Greg Divis, Chief Executive Officer of Avadel Pharmaceuticals. “We are also pleased with the recent court ruling affirming FDA’s determination that LUMRYZ, dosed once at bedtime, demonstrates clinical superiority to twice-nightly oxybates, which mitigates an important legal and business risk for the company. With our Phase 3 pivotal trial in IH ongoing, our continued execution of the LUMRYZ launch including our expansion of LUMRYZ into pediatric narcolepsy, we are closing in our business objectives of being a leader in the sleep field and fulfilling the promise of LUMRYZ for all stakeholders.”\n\n**Third Quarter and Recent Company Highlights**\n\n**LUMRYZ Commercial Updates****:**\n\n  * Generated $50.0 million of net product revenue from sales of LUMRYZ in the third quarter of 2024.\n  * As of September 30, there were 2,300 patients on LUMRYZ compared to 1,900 patients on LUMRYZ at June 30. \n    * In the third quarter, generated consistent patient demand for LUMRYZ with 700 patients initiating therapy.\n    * Observed continuing growth in demand from patients who are new to oxybate – these patients represent the fastest growing patient segment for LUMRYZ.\n\n\n\n**Corporate and Pipeline Updates:**\n\n  * On October 30, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in favor of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in a suit brought by Jazz Pharmaceuticals Inc. under the Administrative Procedure Act regarding the FDA’s approval of LUMRYZ. \n    * With this ruling, the approval of LUMRYZ is upheld based on the FDA’s determination that LUMRYZ is clinically superior to Jazz’s twice-nightly oxybate products.\n  * On October 16, 2024, the FDA approved LUMRYZ for the treatment of cataplexy or excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in patients 7 years or older with narcolepsy. \n    * LUMRYZ was granted Orphan Drug Exclusivity (ODE) for this patient population through October 16, 2031.\n  * Patient enrollment is ongoing in the REVITALYZ pivotal study, a Phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal, multicenter study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LUMRYZ in idiopathic hypersomnia (IH).\n  * During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, announced publication of results of: \n    * A [post-hoc analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138994572400443X?via%3Dihub) showing consistent efficacy in participants currently taking alerting agents, highlighting the benefit of LUMRYZ to augment response, as well as the 37% who responded positively based upon LUMRYZ monotherapy.\n    * [Data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S259014272400020X?via%3Dihub) from the RESTORE open-label study, based upon the largest cohort of switch patients, in which 94% preferred the once-nightly dosing regimen and 93% who would recommend LUMRYZ to a friend or family member with narcolepsy.\n    * A [post-hoc analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149291824002091) demonstrating weight loss associated with LUMRYZ compared to placebo, and shifting from obese category into overweight and overweight into normal BMI categories.\n\n\n\n**Overview of Third Quarter Financial Results**\n\nRecognized $50.0 million in net product revenue for the third quarter 2024 compared to $7.0 million in the same period in 2023.

On October 16, 2024, LUMRYZ was additionally approved as a once-at-bedtime treatment for cataplexy or EDS in patients 7 years and older with narcolepsy.\n\nThe FDA approval of LUMRYZ was supported by results from REST-ON, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pivotal Phase 3 trial in adults with narcolepsy. LUMRYZ demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in the three co-primary endpoints: EDS (MWT), clinicians’ overall assessment of patients’ functioning (CGI-I), and cataplexy attacks, for all three evaluated doses when compared to placebo. \n\nWith its approval in May 2023 and in October 2024, the FDA also granted 7 years of Orphan Drug Exclusivity to LUMRYZ for the treatment of cataplexy or EDS in adults with narcolepsy and pediatric patients 7 years and older with narcolepsy (respectively) due to a finding of clinical superiority of LUMRYZ relative to currently available oxybate treatments. In particular, the FDA found that LUMRYZ makes a major contribution to patient care over currently available, twice-nightly oxybate products by providing a once-nightly dosing regimen that avoids nocturnal arousal to take a second dose.\n\n**About Avadel Pharmaceuticals plc**\n\nAvadel Pharmaceuticals plc (Nasdaq: AVDL) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on transforming medicines to transform lives.
