          "content": "ASX: **INR**\n\nNASDAQ: **IONR**\n\n[![Ioneer](https://www.ioneer.com/wp-content/themes/ioneer/assets/img/logo.jpg)](https://www.ioneer.com)\n\n[](https://www.linkedin.com/company/18265941/) [](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLno8sD9WZCPOFoY_gin07A)\n\n# DFS Summary\n\n![](https://www.ioneer.com/wp-content/themes/ioneer/assets/img/hero_default.jpg)\n\n## Rhyolite Ridge Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS)\n\n**Cautionary Note: Economics and schedule shown on this page is per the DFS in April 2020 and has been subject to change.**\n\nThe Rhyolite Ridge Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS) was completed in April 2020. The DFS places the Project as the single most attractive project for the economic production of lithium carbonate, lithium hydroxide and boric acid globally. In addition, the analysis confirms Ioneer’s position as the lowest cost lithium producer globally with an estimated all in sustaining cash cost to produce battery grade lithium hydroxide of $2,5101 per metric tonne net of boric acid revenue.\n\n  * [Executive Summary of Comprehensive DFS](https://www.ioneer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/300420-dfs-executive-summary-metric_final.pdf)\n\n\n\n![](https://ioneer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/cost-curve-chart.jpeg)\n\nThe DFS confirms that the Project has a stable overall operating cost structure for the production of lithium carbonate and battery-grade lithium hydroxide due to the scale and reliability of its boric acid credit. The extensive bench and pilot scale tests conducted by Fluor, Kemetco Research and Kappes Cassiday, with support from Veolia and FLSmidth, has proven highly successful with excellent recoveries, the innovative use of proven processing technologies, and the production of high purity lithium and boric acid products.\n\nThe Company’s engineering partner, Fluor, has further developed and refined Project plans in the DFS to a 30% engineering complete level. The refinement of the DFS as compared to the PFS is substantial, and helps ensure predictable, sustainable, and low operating costs over the life of the Project. An important addition to the prior scope is the upfront inclusion of a steam turbine for power generation, which will provide the entire operation enough energy to be fully self-sufficient.\n\nThe DFS estimates that the total capital expenditure to complete the Project will be U.S.$785 million including an 8% contingency. This represents an increase of U.S.$186 million from the PFS, with nearly half of the increase in scope being driven by the inclusion of an on-site steam turbine, the purchase versus lease of the mining fleet, and the purchase of sulphur tankers to materially lower sulphur transportation costs. All of these decisions were made following detailed analysis of the options (trade-off studies) and have positive impacts to the overall Project economics.\n\nThe lithium and boron Mineral Resource is estimated at 146.5 million metric tons, including an Ore Reserve of 60.0 million metric tons, an increase in the Reserve from the previous estimate of 280% over the 26-year mine life. The mine plan is made up almost entirely of Reserve material and of that, nearly 50% is proven Ore Reserve. The resource remains open in three directions allowing for a potential extension to the life of the mine. Future exploration drilling will initially target the extensions of high-grade ore to the south, where it is expected to be increasingly shallow with positive impact on the mine plan.\n\n### Compelling Project Economics Confirmed by DFS\n\n  * After-tax NPV (8% real) of U.S.$1.265 billion, with unlevered IRR of 20.8%\n  * Average Annual Life of Mine (LOM) EBITDA of U.S.$288 million\n  * Average Annual Life of Mine (LOM) after-tax cashflow of U.S.$193 million\n  * Average Annual Life of Mine (LOM) revenue of U.S.$422 million\n  * LOM EBITDA margin of 68.1% based on average production\n  * Rapid payback of capital: 5.2 years from first production\n\n\n\n### All-in Sustained Cash Cost at the Bottom of the Global Cost Curve\n\n  * The lowest cost producer globally of lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide, with an all-in sustaining cash cost at U.S.$2,510 per metric ton2\n  * Boron credit ensures industry-leading margins\n\n\n\n### Well Defined and Reliable Operating Cost and Capital Cost Estimates\n\n  * Capital estimate of U.S.$785 – AACE Class 3 capital cost estimate with an accuracy range of ¬±15%, including an 8% cost contingency\n  * Capital to construct the lithium hydroxide unit in year three is U.S.$74 million to be funded from free cash flow from operations and is included in the Company’s sustaining capital plan\n  * Conventional processing using proven commercial technology\n  * Low operating costs – AACE Class 3 estimate supported by an extensive test program including pilot plant and 30% of engineering complete\n\n\n\n### Long-Life Resource with Verified Expansion Potential\n\n  * Production to commence by the middle of 2023 with a 26-year mine life and the opportunity to extend and expand\n  * Producing ~20,600 metric tons of lithium carbonate or ~22,000 of lithium hydroxide 3 and 174,400 metric tons of boric acid per year, on average, for LOM\n  * Large resource, comprising a Mineral Resource of 146.5 million metric tons including an Ore Reserve of 60.0 million metric tons\n  * Highly prospective project area with further potential to increase total resource and reserves\n\n\n\n### U.S. Advantage and Low-Risk, Mining-Friendly Jurisdiction\n\n  * Nevada – first-rate, mining friendly jurisdiction\n  * Project is strategically located proximal to Tesla Gigafactory and California export ports\n  * Limited alternative supply of both lithium and boric acid within North America, which enhances the Project’s attractiveness to strategic partners\n  * Increasing electric vehicle manufacturing base in addition to Tesla in North America\n\n\n\n### Clear Path to Completion\n\n  * Detailed construction timeline developed in DFS\n  * Clearly defined permitting process\n  * Sustainable mining practices\n  * Current cash on hand sufficient to advance the Project through Final Investment Decision\n  * Robust, ongoing strategic partner and marketing discussions, as evidenced by recently executed long-term offtake agreement with a large boron customer\n\n\n\n#### Footnotes\n\n  1. _All-in sustaining cash costs of U.S.$2,510 is the average cost per tonne to produce battery grade lithium hydroxide.

It has been described as the new oil as it is a key component for batteries fuelling the electric vehicle revolution.**\n\nLithium (chemical symbol: Li) is the lightest of all metals and the third element in the periodic table. The element lithium does not exist by itself in nature.\n\nLithium is very likely to remain a core component of batteries due to its key characteristics:\n\n  * lightest metal\n  * highest energy density by weight\n  * high conductivity and ability to store electrons\n\n\n\nUtilising lithium for batteries has allowed electric vehicles and other weight-sensitive applications such as mobile electronics, power tools and drones to become ubiquitous.\n\n### Sources of Lithium\n\nEconomically accessible sources of lithium are relatively rare and commercial production is currently sourced from two types of deposits:\n\n  * Brines: lithium-rich brines from salt lakes (primarily in Argentina and Chile); and\n  * Minerals: pegmatite rock deposits containing lithium-bearing minerals such as spodumene (primarily in Australia).\n\n\n\nThe only operating lithium mine in the U.S. is Albemarle’s Silver Peak Mine, which is currently producing less than 4,000 tonnes p.a. of lithium carbonate production from brines.\n\n### Key Implications for Rhyolite Ridge\n\nWith minimal lithium production currently in the U.S., Rhyolite Ridge is ideally placed to become a significant domestic producer of this critical mineral.\n\nImportantly, it is likely to produce lithium at a lower cost than the current brine and spodumene lithium mines.\n\nThe DFS projects Rhyolite Ridge to be a very low-cost lithium producer at U.S.$2,510/tonne of LCE (with boric acid credit) – placing it at the bottom of the industry cost curve.\n\n### Lithium Supply and Demand\n\nThe global lithium market is expanding rapidly due to an increase in the use of lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicle and energy storage applications. In recent years, the compound annual growth rate of lithium for battery applications was over 22% and is projected by Roskill to be more than 20% per year to 2028.\n\nAccording to analyst Benchmark, the demand for electric vehicles is expected to push demand for lithium-ion batteries above 400 GWh by 2025. In China, the government is pushing for all-electric battery cars and plug-in hybrids to account for at least 20% of its vehicle sales by 2025, and Benchmark predicts that electric vehicles will reach 10% of total sales globally by 2025. China already produces 55% of lithium-ion batteries globally, and its share is forecast to grow to 65%, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe graph below from Roskill shows the forecast for electric vehicle sales to escalate to over 25 million units by 2028, with China dominating production. Benchmark has published similar figures.\n\n![](https://ioneer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/electric-sales-by-region.jpeg)\n\nElectric Vehicle Sales by Region, 2015-2028 (millions of units)\n\n##### Countries with the largest lithium reserves worldwide include:\n\n  * Chile, who have the largest lithium reserves with an estimated 7.5 million metric tons\n  * China with reserves estimated at 3.2 million metric tons\n  * Australia with more than 2.7 million metric tons\n  * Argentina with more than 2 million metric tons.\n\n\n\nIn the United States, there is a single, small lithium mine operated by Albemarle at Silver Peak in Nevada.\n\nIn 2019, 45% of global lithium consumption was in ceramics, glass, polymers, and alloys; however, growth in the technology and energy sectors in recent years has seen consumption in lithium-ion batteries grow at over 20% per year.\n\nIn mid-2019, Roskill published its prediction for lithium supply and demand, as did Benchmark in late 2019.\n\n![](https://ioneer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/refined-lithium-forecast.jpeg)\n\nRefined Lithium Forecast Output and Demand Scenarios (000t LCE)\n\n![](https://ioneer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lithium-balance-chart.jpeg)\n\nLithium Market Balance (metric tonnes)\n\nIn the U.S. and Europe, there is large demand growth forecasted in key auto markets yet very little domestic supply is in the pipeline. Rhyolite Ridge will be a politically secure Western source of this critical raw material, ready to be sold directly into these global battery supply chains.\n\n**Boron is an important industrial mineral that is only produced in a few locations globally but plays an important role in the modern world. It is one of the most versatile elements in the world, used in everything from computer screens to fertilisers to creating powerful magnets for wind turbines.**\n\nBoron (chemical symbol B) is a rare light metal and the fifth element in the periodic table. The element boron does not exist by itself in nature. Rather, boron combines with oxygen and other elements to form boric acid, or inorganic salts called borates.\n\nBorates are an important mineral group for modern society with demand expected to continue to grow at or above global GDP rates. There are few substitutes for borates especially in high-end applications and agriculture. These markets are expected to grow as global population grows and becomes more affluent.\n\n### Key Implications for Rhyolite Ridge\n\nRhyolite Ridge will produce boric acid which is the primary feedstock chemical for industry.\n\nEssential for our modern society, demand for boron is increasing and consumers are expected to welcome additional suppliers to reduce the risks associated with being dependent on the two dominant suppliers (Rio Tinto and Eti Maden).\n\n### Further Information on Boron\n\nFor an interesting summary of boron, see the infographic on the Visual Capitalist website “[Boron: Making Modern Life Possible](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/boron-making-modern-life-possible/)“.\n\nOr you can listen to a very informative [short (23 minute) podcast](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0380gs4) or [longer (42 minute) podcast](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02tfc07) on boron produced by the BBC World Service.\n\n### Boric Acid Supply and Demand\n\nBoric acid is a critical raw material used in more than 100 specialist applications globally. The global distribution of boric acid use is shown in the chart below:\n\n![](https://ioneer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/boric-acid-end-uses.jpeg)\n\nBoric Acid End Uses (2019)\n\nThe distribution of boric acid applications is set out below:\n\n![](https://ioneer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/global-borates-demand.jpeg)\n\nGlobal Borates Demand by Use\n\nBorosilicate glass is the main end use due to its high chemical resistance and resistance to thermal shock. Other major uses include fiberglass, liquid crystal display panels (LCD used in televisions, computers, mobile phones, computer tablets, smart watches, etc.), domestic ovenware, and laboratory glassware. Some strategic end uses are use in permanent magnets for electric motors, specialty alloys, and ceramics including armour and armour plating.\n\nLarge-scale borate resources are very rare. There are only two major suppliers of borates and they currently have over 80% of total borate sales. One is in Turkey operated by a government company and the other in the Mojave Desert in California owned by Rio Tinto. Rio Tinto’s open cut mine was started in 1957 after pursuing underground operations for many years and the Reserves are diminishing.\n\nThere are no other major mines in the U.S. or elsewhere other than Turkey. Currently, there are no announcements of any large expansions of existing producers and no new large-scale mines have been announced. Rio Tinto does have an underground project in Jadar, Serbia but this project has been in the prefeasibility study stage since 2012. No recent announcements have been made on this project.\n\nThe global demand for boric acid has been consistently growing at more than 4% and is projected to continue at this growth rate to 2024. Based on the supply and demand modelling, it is believed that the market will start to tighten in 2021 at >85% utilization rate of installed capacity. This is due to maintenance shutdown requirements, non-scheduled breakdowns, inefficient global distribution of supply, and other inefficiencies.\n\nDemand is expected to exceed supply by 2024 without ioneer boric acid supply. This supports the assumption that the market needs additional capacity.\n\nChina will continue to be the biggest market over the forecast period, growing the fastest of the four major end use regions (over 4% annually), after growing at 5.3% annually over the past 4 years. North America is the second biggest borates market.\n\n![](https://ioneer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/boric-acid-supply-demand.jpeg)\n\nBoric Acid Supply and Demand (2014-2030).

In addition, leading global mining firm, Sibanye-Stillwater, will become our 50% JV partner in Rhyolite Ridge, having committed US$490m.\n\n![](https://www.ioneer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Updated-Partner-Slide-Jun24-3.png)\n\n### Investors\n\n  * [DFS Summary](https://www.ioneer.com/investors/dfs-summary/)\n  * [Lithium and Boron](https://www.ioneer.com/investors/lithium-and-boron/)\n  * [Major Suppliers & Offtake Partners](https://www.ioneer.com/investors/major-suppliers-offtake-partners/)\n  * [Reserves & Resources](https://www.ioneer.com/investors/reserves-resources/)\n  * [ADR Program FAQs](https://www.ioneer.com/investors/adr-program-faqs/)\n  * [News Releases & Filings](https://www.ioneer.com/investors/asx-and-nasdaq-announcements/)\n  * [Broker Research](https://www.ioneer.com/investors/broker-research/)\n  * [Media](https://www.ioneer.com/investors/media/)\n  * [Presentations](https://www.ioneer.com/investors/presentations/)\n  * [Reports](https://www.ioneer.com/investors/reports/)\n  * [Share Price and Charts](https://www.ioneer.com/investors/share-price-and-charts/)\n\n\n\n## Our Partner\n\n![](https://www.ioneer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/logo-sibanye-stillwater.png)\n\nIoneer is extremely pleased to have Sibanye-Stillwater, a leading international mining company, as a strategic partner in our Rhyolite Ridge Project. Sibanye-Stillwater is one of the world’s largest primary producers of platinum, palladium and rhodium, and is also a top tier gold producer, ranking third globally on a gold equivalent basis.\n\nSibanye-Stillwater is an excellent partner for Ioneer to jointly realize the promise of Rhyolite Ridge because of the Company’s:\n\n  * Proven track record of developing and operating major mining projects including three integrated facilities in Montana;\n  * Commitment to developing and maintaining an inclusive and sustainable culture; and\n  * Determination to become a major force in the electric battery materials supply chain.\n\n\n\nSibanye-Stillwater is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Johannesburg Stock Exchange.\n\n![](https://ioneer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lithium-offtake.png)\n\n### Lithium offtakers\n\nIoneer will produce an average of 20,600 tonnes annually of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) over the projected 26-year life of mine. We have announced that South Korean chemicals company, EcoPro, the world’s second largest cathode producer, has signed offtake agreements with Ioneer for 7,000 tonnes annually. Additionally, in 2022, offtake agreements have been signed with the Ford Motor Company and Prime Planet Energy Solutions – a joint venture between Toyota Motor Corporation and Panasonic Corporation.\n\n### Boron offtakers\n\nBoron is a very significant co-product, accounting approximately 30% of revenue at Rhyolite Ridge. Its reliable and steady revenue contribution helps secure Rhyolite Ridge at the bottom of the global lithium cost curve.\n\nIoneer has three offtake agreements in place for its boric acid production, which were announced in FY 2020 and together account for 100% of Ioneer’s first year of boric acid production and over 80% of years two and three boric acid production.\n\nThe contracts include:\n\n  1. A binding offtake agreement with Dalian Jinma Boron Technology Group Co. Ltd for 105,000 tonnes per annum of boric acid for five years and includes a distribution agreement for the territories of China and Taiwan.\n  2. A three-year sales and distribution agreement with Kintamani Resources Pte Limited for the territories of Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines.\n\n\n\n![](https://ioneer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/boron-offtakes.png)\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO NEWS UPDATES\n\n  * Name(Required)\n  * Email(Required)\n  * Phone\n\nThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n\n\n\n\nNotifications\n"

Note that Mineral Resources are reported inclusive of the Ore Reserve.\n\n##### April 2024 Mineral Resource Estimate for Rhyolite Ridge South Basin\n\n[![](https://www.ioneer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Resources-April-2024.png)](https://www.ioneer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Resources-April-2024.png)\n\n#### notes\n\n  1. Kt = thousand tonnes; Li = lithium; B = boron; ppm = parts per million; Li2CO3 = lithium carbonate; H3BO3 = boric acid; mt = million tonnes.\n  2. Totals may differ due to rounding, Mineral Resources reported on a dry in-situ basis. Lithium is converted to Equivalent Contained Tonnes of Lithium Carbonate (Li2CO3) using a stochiometric conversion factor of 5.322, and boron is converted to Equivalent Contained Tonnes of Boric Acid (H3BO3) using a stochiometric conversion factor of 5.718. Equivalent stochiometric conversion factors are derived from the molecular weights of the individual elements which make up Lithium Carbonate (Li2CO3) and Boric Acid (H3BO3).\n  3. The statement of estimates of Mineral Resources has been compiled by Mr. Herbert E. Welhener, a Competent Person who is a Registered Member of the SME (Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration), and is a QP Member of MMSA (the Mining and Metallurgical Society of America). Mr Welhener is a full-time employee of Independent Mining Consultants, Inc. and is independent of Ioneer and its affiliates. Mr Welhener has sufficient experience that is relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of deposit under consideration and to the activity being undertaken to qualify as a Competent Person as defined in the 2012 Edition of the ‘Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves’ (JORC Code 2012).\n  4. All Mineral Resource figures reported in the table above represent estimates at April 19, 2024. Mineral Resource estimates are not precise calculations, being dependent on the interpretation of limited information on the location, shape and continuity of the occurrence and on the available sampling results. The totals contained in the above table have been rounded to reflect the relative uncertainty of the estimate.\n  5. Mineral Resources are reported in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (The Joint Ore Reserves Committee Code – JORC 2012 Edition).\n  6. The Mineral Resource estimate is the result of determining the mineralized material that has a reasonable prospect of economic extraction. In making this determination, constraints were applied to the geological model based upon a pit optimization analysis that defined a conceptual pit shell limit. The conceptual pit shell was based upon a net value per tonne calculation including a 5,000ppm boron cut-off grade for high boron – high lithium (HiB-Li) mineralization (Stream 1) and 1,090ppm lithium cut-off grade for low boron (LoB-Li) mineralization below 5,000ppm boron broke in to two material types low clay and high clay material respectfully (Stream 2 and Stream 3). The pit shell was constrained by a conceptual Mineral Resource optimized pit shell for the purpose of establishing reasonable prospects of eventual economic extraction based on potential mining, metallurgical and processing grade parameters identified by mining, metallurgical and processing studies performed to date on the Project. Key inputs in developing the Mineral Resource pit shell included a 5,000ppm boron cut-off grade for HiB-Li mineralization, 1,090ppm lithium cut-off grade for LoB-Li low clay mineralization and 1,090 ppm lithium cut-off grade for LoB-Li high clay mineralization; mining cost of US$1.54 /tonne; plant feed processing and grade control costs which range between US$52.34/tonne and US$87.43/tonne of plant feed (based on the acid consumption per seam based on the mineral resource average grades); boron and lithium recovery for Stream 1 of 80.2% and 85.7%; Stream 2 and 3: M5 65% and 78%, B5 80% and 86%, S5 50% and 88%, L6 37% and 85%, respectively; boric acid sales price of US$1,016.67/tonne; lithium carbonate sales price of US$17,868.50/tonne.\n\n\n\nIn December 2022, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) listed Tiehm’s buckwheat as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and has designated critical habitat by way of applying a 500 m radius around several distinct plant populations that occur on the Project site. Ioneer is committed to the protection and conservation of the Tiehm’s buckwheat. The Project’s Mine Plan of Operations submitted to the BLM in July 2022 and currently under NEPA review has no direct impact on Tiehm’s buckwheat and includes measures to minimise and mitigate for indirect impacts within the designated critical habitat areas identified.\n\nThe mineral resource pit shell used to constrain the April 2024 mineral resource estimate was not adjusted to account for any impacts from avoidance of Tiehm’s buckwheat or minimisation of disturbance within the designated critical habitat. Environmental and permitting assumptions and factors have not been taken into consideration during modifying factors studies for the Project. The tonnes and grade within the avoidance polygons have not been removed from the Mineral Resources for the April 2024 estimate. Environmental and permitting assumptions and factors may be taken into consideration during future modifying factors studies for the Project.

          "content": "ASX: **INR**\n\nNASDAQ: **IONR**\n\n[![Ioneer](https://www.ioneer.com/wp-content/themes/ioneer/assets/img/logo.jpg)](https://www.ioneer.com)\n\n[](https://www.linkedin.com/company/18265941/) [](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLno8sD9WZCPOFoY_gin07A)\n\n# ADR Program FAQs\n\n![](https://www.ioneer.com/wp-content/themes/ioneer/assets/img/hero_default.jpg)\n\nIoneer has commenced trading on the Nasdaq under an American Depositary Receipt (ADR) listing.\n\n### Where are Ioneer’s ADRs traded and under what ticker?\n\nIoneer’s listed ADRs are traded on [Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ionr/real-time) with ticker IONR.\n\n### What is an American Depositary Receipt (ADR)?\n\nAmerican Depositary Receipts (ADRs) are negotiable U.S. securities issued by a U.S. bank, referred to as a “depositary bank,” that typically represent a non-U.S. company’s equity. ADRs trade freely in global markets and facilitate cross-border trading.\n\nADRs allow non-U.S. companies to make their shares available outside their home markets and allow investors in the U.S. and elsewhere to easily invest in companies on a more global basis.\n\n### What is an ADR ratio & how is the ADR price determined?\n\nAn ADR program often uses a ratio to reflect a USD price which will differ to its primary home market. One reason being, it ensures the ADR price is relevant to the wider market, including institutional shareholders who have investment mandate considerations.\n\nAn ADR ratio provides the number of underlying shares represented by one ADR. One (1) Ioneer ADR represents forty (40) ordinary INR shares on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). The two securities trade very close to parity once the ADR ratio and foreign exchange aspects are accounted for.\n\n### What are the benefits of ADRs to United States investors?\n\nInvestors in the United States can benefit from holding ADRs rather than ordinary shares in the issuer’s home market, because ADRs trade, clear and settle according to United States market conventions.\n\nADRs allow U.S. investors to buy non-U.S. securities and hold these in their U.S. brokerage accounts. ADRs also allow access to price and trading information, U.S. dollar dividend payments and corporate action notifications.\n\n### How can I purchase Ioneer ADRs?\n\nIoneer ADRs can be purchased through a typical broker, just as you would to buy other U.S. securities. You cannot buy ADRs directly from Ioneer.\n\n### Who is the depositary bank for Ioneer’s ADRs?\n\nBNY Mellon is the depositary bank and plays a key role in the process of issuance and cancellation of ADRs.\n\nAn overview of the INR ADR program can be found [here](https://www.adrbnymellon.com/?cusip=46211L101).\n\nFor more information on BNY Mellon and ADRs, please visit: [www.adrbnymellon.com](http://www.adrbnymellon.com/) [www.adrbnymellon.com/resources/dr-basics](https://ir.novonixgroup.com/www.adrbnymellon.com/resources/dr-basics)\n\n### Is there a cost to hold ADRs?\n\nThe Bank of New York Mellon may charge an annual Depositary Service Fee of up to U.S.$0.05 per ADR. This is typically collected from the broker or other intermediary that holds the ADRs on your behalf. Your broker may pass this fee on to you directly or it may be part of the annual fee that you pay to maintain your brokerage account.\n\nSection 5.9 of the ADR Deposit Agreement discloses all applicable fees. A copy can be found by visiting [here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1201935/000101915522000127/ioneerda.htm).\n\n### What does it cost to exchange ASX-listed ordinary shares or OTC-listed foreign ordinary shares into ADRs?\n\nThere will be an issuance fee of up to US$5.00 per 100 ADRs (or portion thereof) charged by The Bank of New York Mellon for the issuance of the ADRs. The exchange of your dematerialised ordinary shares will need to be managed by your broker as ordinary shares need to be transferred electronically to The Bank of New York Mellon prior to the issuance of ADRs. Your selected broker may also levy an administrative charge for managing the exchange process.\n\nUntil July 29 2022, BNY Mellon will waive the ADR issuance fee. Your brokers back office will be able to arrange for this when settling an ADR issuance on your behalf.\n\n### I am a current holder of Ioneer’s foreign ordinary shares that trade on the OTC Market (OTC: GSCCF). What happens to my shares with the establishment of this ADR program?\n\nAt the present time, Ioneer’s over-the-counter foreign ordinary shares will continue to trade on OTC. There is no requirement to convert your F shares to ADRs. Each share will continue to represent one (1) ASX-listed ordinary share of Ioneer.\n\n### How do I convert my ASX-listed ordinary shares into ADRs?\n\nConverting ASX-listed ordinary shares into ADRs can be done through your broker.\n\nTo convert your ordinary shares into ADRs:\n\n  1. You need to transfer your ordinary INR shares to BNY Mellon’s local custodian, HSBC Bank Australia Limited (SWIFT BIC: HKBAAU2SSYD, CHESS PID: 20057, Safekeeping Account: 011-552130-068). This process is usually completed by your broker via an electronic CHESS transfer, or broker transfer form. Your broker should be able to assist with this.\n  2. HSBC also require the U.S. ADR delivery instructions to accompany any deposit of ordinary shares. This information is usually completed by your broker, and should be sent via email to adrconversions.hbau@hsbc.com.au and should include details of the institution where the ADRs will be delivered to in the U.S. market (i.e., institution / broker name & DTC acct. info).\n  3. Once BNY Mellon receives confirmation from HSBC that your underlying ordinary shares have been deposited, new ADRs are issued and delivered to your nominated U.S. broker, in accordance with the ADR programs “Deposit Agreement”.\n\n\n\nYour brokers back office will be familiar with the ordinary share to ADR conversion process. Should your broker have a settlement enquiry, they can contact drsettlements@bnymellon.com.\n\n### How can I convert my OTC-listed Ioneer foreign ordinary shares to ADRs?\n\nTo convert your Ioneer F shares to ADRs, please contact your broker. They should be familiar with the process and would need to arrange for the delivery of the underlying ordinary shares which represent your GSCCF to HSBC in Australia as outlined in the response to “How do I convert my ASX-listed ordinary shares or OTC-listed foreign ordinary shares into ADRs?” (above).\n\n### What is the difference between a registered holder and a beneficial ADR holder?\n\nA registered holder is one whose name appears on the books of the depositary. The registered holder is considered the owner of the record. A beneficial holder is one whose holdings are registered in a name other than his or her own, such as the name of the broker, bank, or nominee.\n\n### I did not receive a certificate with the purchase of my ADRs. How can I obtain a traditional certificate?\n\nFor registered owners, ownership is registered by the depositary bank and is evidenced by an account statement provided by the depositary.\n\nRegistered owners can hold physical ADR certificates. Please contact BNY Mellon for more information.\n\n### For additional questions about ADRs please contact:\n\n**BNY Mellon Shareowner Services** P. O.
