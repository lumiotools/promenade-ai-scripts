We show that a centralized evaluation system can be designed for consistent and effective assessment of esophageal and gastric varices, which is critical for advancing clinical research in this population with high unmet need. We also provide an in depth look at baseline characteristics of the patient enrolled in our NAVIGATE trial,” said Khurram Jamil, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Galectin Therapeutics. “In another key finding, our research reveals that among patients with compensated MASH cirrhosis with reduced platelet counts and radiologic signs of portal hypertension, approximately one-third have detectable esophageal varices upon screening. These findings underscore the need for reliable screening and targeted therapies in this vulnerable patient population. These clinical data are of great importance as we look forward to sharing the readout of our NAVIGATE trial before the end of the year.”\n\nThe following posters highlighting clinical data will be presented at the “Portal Hypertension and Other Complications of Cirrhosis” session taking place 8:00 am – 5:00 pm on November 18, 2024:\n\n**Poster #4118:** Evaluation of esophageal and gastric varices in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension: a central evaluation system for clinical research.**Presenter:** Naim Alkhouri, M.D., Arizona Liver Health, Chandler, AZ.\n\n**Poster #4063:** Baseline patients’ characteristics from NAVIGATE, a seamless adaptive Phase 2b/3 trial of Belapectin in MASH cirrhosis and portal hypertension.**Presenter:** Khurram Jamil, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Galectin Therapeutics.\n\n**Poster #4125:** In patients with compensated MASH cirrhosis with platelet count < 150,000/µL and radiologic findings of portal hypertension, a third are identified with esophageal varices on screening Esophago-Gastroduodenoscopy.**Presenter:** Laura Ladron deGuevar, M.D., CIAID - Centro de Investigacion y Atencion Integral Durango, S.C.\n\nThe three abstracts are available for viewing by attendees on the AASLD website and will also be featured in the October supplement to the AASLD journal, _Hepatology_.\n\n**About Galectin Therapeutics** Galectin Therapeutics is dedicated to developing novel therapies to improve the lives of patients with chronic liver disease and cancer.

Joel Lewis, Chief Executive Officer and President of Galectin Therapeutics, said “This past quarter, we remained laser-focus on advancing the NAVIGATE trial of belapectin in patients with MASH cirrhosis. As we eagerly await the topline results next month, we remain hopeful that belapectin may be a potential new treatment for the large number of patients in the U.S. with compensated cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and which have not developed esophageal varices. These patients represent a large unmet medical need.”\n\nKhurram Jamil, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, added, “We are pleased to share that Galectin will present three posters highlighting important data from our belapectin program at the upcoming American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) 2024 meeting. Our presentations will discuss the central evaluation process of upper endoscopies for our novel primary endpoint, as well as the unique characteristics of the patient population enrolled in the NAVIGATE trial utilizing the latest clinical guidelines for portal hypertension.”\n\n**Belapectin Program Q3 2024 and Recent Highlights**\n\nBelapectin is a complex carbohydrate drug that targets galectin-3, a critical protein in the pathogenesis of MASH and fibrosis.\n\n_MASH Cirrhosis_\n\n  * The [NAVIGATE](http://www.NAVIGATEnash.com) trial ([NCT04365868](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04365868)) evaluating the efficacy and safety of belapectin for the prevention of esophageal varices in MASH in 357 patients across 14 countries on five continents is progressing as planned. Based on feedback from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Company has decided to analyze stage 1 of the NAVIGATE clinical trial results as a stand-alone trial. Therefore, full top-line efficacy and safety results, following last patient last visit and database lock which both have occurred recently, are expected to be presented in December 2024. At this point, the Company remains blinded to any data until after the Data Safety Monitoring Board meeting, which is expected in December 2024.\n  * Three abstracts on clinical data from the NAVIGATE trial in patients with MASH cirrhosis and portal hypertension have been accepted for poster presentation at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)’s 2024 annual Liver Meeting, being held November 15-19, 2024, in San Diego, California. These posters cover the primary endpoint evaluation and patient population of the NAVIGATE trial.\n\n\n\n_2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders_ As previously announced, due to the expected top-line results of the NAVIGATE trial in December 2024, the Board of Directors established January 23, 2025, as the date of the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\n**Q3 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * As of September 30, 2024, the Company had $27.1 million of cash and cash equivalents. Additionally, the Company has $6 million available under a new line of credit provided by its chairman of the board to fund operations. The Company believes it has sufficient cash to fund currently planned operations and research and development activities through May 2025.\n  * Research and development expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 were $7.6 million compared with $7.7 million for the same period in 2023. Overall, there was a moderate increase in expenditures related to our NAVIGATE clinical trial offset by lower preclinical and nonclinical costs. \n  * General and administrative expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $1.5 million, compared to $1.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. \n  * For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported a net loss applicable to common stockholders of $11.2 million, or ($0.18) per share, compared to a net loss applicable to common stockholders of $14.0 million, or ($0.24) per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. \n  * These results are included in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as of and for the period ended September 30, 2024, which has been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and is available at [** _www.sec.gov_**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=-GrrxcJlHxzCHCorZUG6_r09208ISoVMyKMvf2uyIuaABbBy7xP7zKNMQ5J4jbteR-nT_TfMHSG7SMsQeO1nfx4n8OUCkzoqxK2sSd-GhgiG3Lb7e_bIgK2aPd3zcOp9AER972u-CZmy3S6IRnWjcQok15rlQgzWs4VvmeELWyYdvL79hOwrbe9zc8NkoPW14ehC3TD6i1qVWKSZrQ_PnofRBiSiKw3OOtaY11SXqLk=).\n\n\n\n**About Galectin Therapeutics** Galectin Therapeutics is dedicated to developing novel therapies to improve the lives of patients with chronic liver disease and cancer.
