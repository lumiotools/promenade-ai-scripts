This marks the second full quarter following the closing of the business combination with MiX Telematics Ltd. with the prior year comparison numbers adjusted to reflect the pro forma financial performance of the combined businesses.\n\n[ ![Powerfleet \\(PRNewsfoto/Powerfleet\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2242648/Powerfleet_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2242648/Powerfleet_Logo.html \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n**SECOND QUARTER 2025 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n  * Total revenue was $77.0 million, up 7% year-over-year, driven by the continued strength of our Unity safety solutions.\n  * Product revenue rose by 13% year-over-year to $20.3 million, with adjusted gross margins expanding by 3% sequentially to 35%, exceeding current guidance of +30%.\n  * Service revenue growth of 5% was in line with annual revenue guidance, reaching $56.7 million, with adjusted gross margins expanding by 1.0% to 63.7% versus the prior year.\n  * Realized $13.5 million in annual cost synergies within the first six months of the MiX combination, achieving 50% of the two-year $27 million target. Cost synergies are the major driver of reduction in adjusted operating expenses, which declined by over 5% to $36.9 million versus the prior year.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP metric, increased by 41% to $14.5 million versus the prior year, benefiting from the flow through of expanded gross profit and the realization of cost synergies.\n\n\n\n**FIRST HALF 2025 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n  * Total revenue was $152.4 million, up 9% year-over-year, running ahead of annual guidance and reflecting strong execution in the first six months following the close of the MiX combination.\n  * Gross profit, after adjusting for the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and other integration expenses, increased by $6.4 million, or 8% versus the prior year.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP metric, increased by $8.9 million, or 46%, to $28.2 million versus the prior year, driven by increased gross margin from higher sales and the benefits of cost synergies.\n\n\n\n**MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY**\n\n\"Just six months into the MiX combination, we're already seeing the integration gain strong momentum, setting the foundation for us to fully capitalize on the additional strategic opportunities offered by the Fleet Complete acquisition,\" said CEO Steve Towe.\n\n\"In the first half of fiscal 2025, we reported revenue of $152 million—up 9% from last year—and a 46% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $28.2 million. We have already secured $13.5 million in annual run-rate cost synergies, achieving 50% of our two-year $27 million target from the MiX combination within 6 months.\"\n\n\"We are energized by the expanded opportunities gained through the Fleet Complete acquisition. Our strategic direction is sharply focused on three key priorities: maximizing efficiency to accelerate adjusted EBITDA growth, driving towards accelerated top-line revenue expansion, and enhancing customer retention. These priorities serve as the foundation for how we align our resources, empower our teams, and execute initiatives for maximum impact.\"\n\n\"On the revenue front, we're driving the adoption of our Unity platform, in-warehouse solutions, and AI camera offerings to meet growing demand across North America, Europe, and beyond. Leveraging the Fleet Complete North American channel relationships, we expect accelerated growth beginning in FY2026, as well as global traction for their mid-market products and differentiated AI camera solutions. These initiatives underscore our strategy to capture high-demand markets while deepening customer engagement and expanding wallet share with highly sticky integrated solutions.\"\n\n**SECOND QUARTER 2025 FINANCIAL RESULTS**\n\nTotal revenue for the quarter increased by 7% year-over-year to $77.0 million, up from $72.0 million in the same period of the prior year. This growth was largely driven by the continued success of our differentiated safety-centric product solutions, with product revenue, a leading indicator, increasing 13% to $20.3 million.\n\nService revenue grew by 5% year-over-year to $56.7 million, aligning with our annual guidance and demonstrating the resilience of our broad offerings and global portfolio, which more than offset the previously disclosed expected churn in the legacy MiX customer base.\n\nCombined gross margin of 53.7% reflects a $1.2 million non-cash amortization expense related to acquisition-related intangibles from the MiX combination, along with $0.7 million in inventory write-offs due to integration efforts to streamline product offerings. Excluding these expenses, adjusted gross margin was 56.1%, in both the current and prior year.\n\nOperating expenses for the quarter totaled $40.8 million, including $3.9 million in one-time transaction and restructuring costs, versus the prior year of $41.0 million, which included $2.0 million in one-time costs. On an adjusted basis, total operating expenses were down by 5% annually, reflecting the success of our cost synergy program, which secured $13.5 million in annual savings through the end of September.\n\nWe reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $1.9 million, or $(0.02) per share, compared to $(0.06) in the prior year. However, after adjusting for one-time expenses and the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, adjusted earnings per basic share was $0.02 for the current year versus a loss of $(0.01) in the prior period.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by 41% to $14.5 million from $10.3 million in the previous year. This growth was driven by strong top-line performance, resulting in a $2.9 million increase in gross margin after accounting for the impact of the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles plus the flow through benefits of cost synergies.\n\nExcluding $62 million in proceeds from the private placement related to the Fleet Complete acquisition, we ended the quarter with net debt of $119 million. Adjusting for $1.9 million in unsettled transaction costs, pro forma net debt stood at $121 million, versus $110 million at the close of the MiX combination. The $11 million increase in pro forma net debt was primarily driven by an increase in net working capital of $8.2 million that is directly attributable to higher net receivables following strong top-line performance.\n\n**FULL-YEAR 2025 FINANCIAL OUTLOOK**\n\nWe are reaffirming our guidance from the October 2nd fireside chat. Capturing six months of Fleet Complete's financial performance, full-year 2025 revenue is expected to exceed $352.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated to exceed $72.5 million, inclusive of an incremental $5 million in secured exit run-rate cost synergies. This guidance reflects Fleet Complete's pre-acquisition accounting treatment, which remains subject to review as we work to conform to US GAAP standards.\n\n**INVESTOR CONFERENCE CALL**\n\nAs previously announced, Powerfleet will hold a conference call on Tuesday, November 12, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time (5:30 a.m. Pacific time) to discuss results for the second quarter fiscal 2025 ended September 30, 2024.\n\nManagement will make prepared remarks followed by a question-and-answer session.\n\n**Date** : Tuesday, November 12, 2024**Time** : 8:30 a.m. Eastern time (5:30 a.m. Pacific time)**Toll Free** : 888-506-0062**International** : 973-528-0011**Participant Access Code** : 216765The conference call will be broadcast simultaneously and available for replay [here ](https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/2467/51506 \"Opens in a new window\")and via the investor section of the company's website at [ir.powerfleet.com](https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fir.powerfleet.com%2F&data=05%7C02%7Cdwilson%40powerfleet.com%7C9ddf46f46586432fdcc008dcb57a2216%7C71c5becded1a40b7967da56d0d63cd26%7C0%7C0%7C638584783375588586%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=9DSlDBKazjkqVjopBalb%2FtFwjviOMo2%2FlJBA7VwLRKs%3D&reserved=0 \"Opens in a new window\").\n\n**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**\n\nTo supplement its financial statements presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), Powerfleet provides certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include adjusted EBITDA, adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating expenses, adjusted earnings per share, net debt and net working capital. Reference to these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared under current accounting standards, but are not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of Powerfleet's current financial performance. Specifically, Powerfleet believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses and fluctuations in currency rates that may not be indicative of its core operating results and business outlook. These non-GAAP measures are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as an alternative to net income, gross margin, cash flow from operating activities or earnings per share as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity. Because Powerfleet's method for calculating the non-GAAP measures may differ from other companies' methods, the non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Reconciliation of all non-GAAP measures included in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the financial tables included in this press release.\n\n**ABOUT POWERFLEET**\n\nPowerfleet (Nasdaq: AIOT; JSE: PWR) is a global leader in the artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) software-as-a-service (SaaS) mobile asset industry.

This marks the second full quarter following the closing of the business combination with MiX Telematics Ltd. with the prior year comparison numbers adjusted to reflect the pro forma financial performance of the combined businesses.\n\n[ ![Powerfleet \\(PRNewsfoto/Powerfleet\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2242648/Powerfleet_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2242648/Powerfleet_Logo.html \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n**SECOND QUARTER 2025 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n  * Total revenue was $77.0 million, up 7% year-over-year, driven by the continued strength of our Unity safety solutions.\n  * Product revenue rose by 13% year-over-year to $20.3 million, with adjusted gross margins expanding by 3% sequentially to 35%, exceeding current guidance of +30%.\n  * Service revenue growth of 5% was in line with annual revenue guidance, reaching $56.7 million, with adjusted gross margins expanding by 1.0% to 63.7% versus the prior year.\n  * Realized $13.5 million in annual cost synergies within the first six months of the MiX combination, achieving 50% of the two-year $27 million target. Cost synergies are the major driver of reduction in adjusted operating expenses, which declined by over 5% to $36.9 million versus the prior year.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP metric, increased by 41% to $14.5 million versus the prior year, benefiting from the flow through of expanded gross profit and the realization of cost synergies.\n\n\n\n**FIRST HALF 2025 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n  * Total revenue was $152.4 million, up 9% year-over-year, running ahead of annual guidance and reflecting strong execution in the first six months following the close of the MiX combination.\n  * Gross profit, after adjusting for the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and other integration expenses, increased by $6.4 million, or 8% versus the prior year.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP metric, increased by $8.9 million, or 46%, to $28.2 million versus the prior year, driven by increased gross margin from higher sales and the benefits of cost synergies.\n\n\n\n**MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY**\n\n\"Just six months into the MiX combination, we're already seeing the integration gain strong momentum, setting the foundation for us to fully capitalize on the additional strategic opportunities offered by the Fleet Complete acquisition,\" said CEO Steve Towe.\n\n\"In the first half of fiscal 2025, we reported revenue of $152 million—up 9% from last year—and a 46% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $28.2 million. We have already secured $13.5 million in annual run-rate cost synergies, achieving 50% of our two-year $27 million target from the MiX combination within 6 months.\"\n\n\"We are energized by the expanded opportunities gained through the Fleet Complete acquisition. Our strategic direction is sharply focused on three key priorities: maximizing efficiency to accelerate adjusted EBITDA growth, driving towards accelerated top-line revenue expansion, and enhancing customer retention. These priorities serve as the foundation for how we align our resources, empower our teams, and execute initiatives for maximum impact.\"\n\n\"On the revenue front, we're driving the adoption of our Unity platform, in-warehouse solutions, and AI camera offerings to meet growing demand across North America, Europe, and beyond. Leveraging the Fleet Complete North American channel relationships, we expect accelerated growth beginning in FY2026, as well as global traction for their mid-market products and differentiated AI camera solutions. These initiatives underscore our strategy to capture high-demand markets while deepening customer engagement and expanding wallet share with highly sticky integrated solutions.\"\n\n**SECOND QUARTER 2025 FINANCIAL RESULTS**\n\nTotal revenue for the quarter increased by 7% year-over-year to $77.0 million, up from $72.0 million in the same period of the prior year. This growth was largely driven by the continued success of our differentiated safety-centric product solutions, with product revenue, a leading indicator, increasing 13% to $20.3 million.\n\nService revenue grew by 5% year-over-year to $56.7 million, aligning with our annual guidance and demonstrating the resilience of our broad offerings and global portfolio, which more than offset the previously disclosed expected churn in the legacy MiX customer base.\n\nCombined gross margin of 53.7% reflects a $1.2 million non-cash amortization expense related to acquisition-related intangibles from the MiX combination, along with $0.7 million in inventory write-offs due to integration efforts to streamline product offerings. Excluding these expenses, adjusted gross margin was 56.1%, in both the current and prior year.\n\nOperating expenses for the quarter totaled $40.8 million, including $3.9 million in one-time transaction and restructuring costs, versus the prior year of $41.0 million, which included $2.0 million in one-time costs. On an adjusted basis, total operating expenses were down by 5% annually, reflecting the success of our cost synergy program, which secured $13.5 million in annual savings through the end of September.\n\nWe reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $1.9 million, or $(0.02) per share, compared to $(0.06) in the prior year. However, after adjusting for one-time expenses and the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, adjusted earnings per basic share was $0.02 for the current year versus a loss of $(0.01) in the prior period.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by 41% to $14.5 million from $10.3 million in the previous year. This growth was driven by strong top-line performance, resulting in a $2.9 million increase in gross margin after accounting for the impact of the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles plus the flow through benefits of cost synergies.\n\nExcluding $62 million in proceeds from the private placement related to the Fleet Complete acquisition, we ended the quarter with net debt of $119 million. Adjusting for $1.9 million in unsettled transaction costs, pro forma net debt stood at $121 million, versus $110 million at the close of the MiX combination. The $11 million increase in pro forma net debt was primarily driven by an increase in net working capital of $8.2 million that is directly attributable to higher net receivables following strong top-line performance.\n\n**FULL-YEAR 2025 FINANCIAL OUTLOOK**\n\nWe are reaffirming our guidance from the October 2nd fireside chat. Capturing six months of Fleet Complete's financial performance, full-year 2025 revenue is expected to exceed $352.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated to exceed $72.5 million, inclusive of an incremental $5 million in secured exit run-rate cost synergies. This guidance reflects Fleet Complete's pre-acquisition accounting treatment, which remains subject to review as we work to conform to US GAAP standards.\n\n**INVESTOR CONFERENCE CALL**\n\nAs previously announced, Powerfleet will hold a conference call on Tuesday, November 12, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time (5:30 a.m. Pacific time) to discuss results for the second quarter fiscal 2025 ended September 30, 2024.\n\nManagement will make prepared remarks followed by a question-and-answer session.\n\n**Date** : Tuesday, November 12, 2024**Time** : 8:30 a.m. Eastern time (5:30 a.m. Pacific time)**Toll Free** : 888-506-0062**International** : 973-528-0011**Participant Access Code** : 216765The conference call will be broadcast simultaneously and available for replay [here ](https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/2467/51506 \"Opens in a new window\")and via the investor section of the company's website at [ir.powerfleet.com](https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fir.powerfleet.com%2F&data=05%7C02%7Cdwilson%40powerfleet.com%7C9ddf46f46586432fdcc008dcb57a2216%7C71c5becded1a40b7967da56d0d63cd26%7C0%7C0%7C638584783375588586%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=9DSlDBKazjkqVjopBalb%2FtFwjviOMo2%2FlJBA7VwLRKs%3D&reserved=0 \"Opens in a new window\").\n\n**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**\n\nTo supplement its financial statements presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), Powerfleet provides certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include adjusted EBITDA, adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating expenses, adjusted earnings per share, net debt and net working capital. Reference to these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared under current accounting standards, but are not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of Powerfleet's current financial performance. Specifically, Powerfleet believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses and fluctuations in currency rates that may not be indicative of its core operating results and business outlook. These non-GAAP measures are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as an alternative to net income, gross margin, cash flow from operating activities or earnings per share as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity. Because Powerfleet's method for calculating the non-GAAP measures may differ from other companies' methods, the non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Reconciliation of all non-GAAP measures included in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the financial tables included in this press release.\n\n**ABOUT POWERFLEET**\n\nPowerfleet (Nasdaq: AIOT; JSE: PWR) is a global leader in the artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) software-as-a-service (SaaS) mobile asset industry.

          "content": "November 12, 2024\nPowerfleet Reports Second Quarter 2025\nFinancial Results\nQ2 FY25 revenue up 7%, to $77.0 million, and Adjusted EBITDA up 41%, to $14.5 million\nyear-over-year, demonstrating continued strong execution of the immediate business\nobjectives post-MiX combination.\nFirst half FY25 results exceeded expectations with revenue up 9%, to $152.4 million and\nAdjusted EBITDA up 46% year-over -year, to $28.2 million.\n50% of the planned two-year annualized cost synergy target of $27 million secured within 6\nmonths of the close of the MiX combination.\nWOODCLIFF LAKE, N.J., Nov. 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Powerfleet, Inc. (Nasdaq:\nAIOT) reported its financial results for the second quarter ended September 30, 2024. This\nmarks the second full quarter following the closing of the business combination with MiX\nTelematics Ltd. with the prior year comparison numbers adjusted to reflect the pro forma\nfinancial performance of the combined businesses.\nSECOND QUARTER 2025 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nTotal revenue was $77.0 million, up 7% year-over-year, driven by the continued\nstrength of our Unity safety solutions.\nProduct revenue rose by 13% year-over-year to $20.3 million, with adjusted gross\nmargins expanding by 3% sequentially to 35%, exceeding current guidance of +30%.\nService revenue growth of 5% was in line with annual revenue guidance, reaching\n$56.7 million, with adjusted gross margins expanding by 1.0% to 63.7% versus the\nprior year.\nRealized $13.5 million in annual cost synergies within the first six months of the MiX\ncombination, achieving 50% of the two-year $27 million target. Cost synergies are the\nmajor driver of reduction in adjusted operating expenses, which declined by over 5% to\n$36.9 million versus the prior year.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP metric, increased by 41% to $14.5 million versus the\nprior year, benefiting from the flow through of expanded gross profit and the realization\nof cost synergies.\nFIRST HALF 2025 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nTotal revenue was $152.4 million, up 9% year-over-year, running ahead of annual\nguidance and reflecting strong execution in the first six months following the close of\nthe MiX combination.\nGross profit, after adjusting for the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and\nother integration expenses, increased by $6.4 million, or 8% versus the prior year.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP metric, increased by $8.9 million, or 46%, to $28.2\nmillion versus the prior year, driven by increased gross margin from higher sales and\nthe benefits of cost synergies.\nMANAGEMENT COMMENTARY\n\"Just six months into the MiX combination, we're already seeing the integration gain strong\nmomentum, setting the foundation for us to fully capitalize on the additional strategic\nopportunities offered by the Fleet Complete acquisition,\" said CEO Steve Towe.\n\"In the first half of fiscal 2025, we reported revenue of $152 million—up 9% from last year—\nand a 46% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $28.2 million. We have already secured $13.5\nmillion in annual run-rate cost synergies, achieving 50% of our two-year $27 million target\nfrom the MiX combination within 6 months.\"\n\"We are energized by the expanded opportunities gained through the Fleet Complete\nacquisition. Our strategic direction is sharply focused on three key priorities: maximizing\nefficiency to accelerate adjusted EBITDA growth, driving towards accelerated top-line\nrevenue expansion, and enhancing customer retention. These priorities serve as the\nfoundation for how we align our resources, empower our teams, and execute initiatives for\nmaximum impact.\"\n\"On the revenue front, we're driving the adoption of our Unity platform, in-warehouse\nsolutions, and AI camera offerings to meet growing demand across North America, Europe,\nand beyond. Leveraging the Fleet Complete North American channel relationships, we\nexpect accelerated growth beginning in FY2026, as well as global traction for their mid-\nmarket products and differentiated AI camera solutions. These initiatives underscore our\nstrategy to capture high-demand markets while deepening customer engagement and\nexpanding wallet share with highly sticky integrated solutions.\"\nSECOND QUARTER 2025 FINANCIAL RESULTS\nTotal revenue for the quarter increased by 7% year-over-year to $77.0 million, up from $72.0\nmillion in the same period of the prior year. This growth was largely driven by the continued\nsuccess of our differentiated safety-centric product solutions, with product revenue, a\nleading indicator, increasing 13% to $20.3 million.\nService revenue grew by 5% year-over-year to $56.7 million, aligning with our annual\nguidance and demonstrating the resilience of our broad offerings and global portfolio, which\nmore than offset the previously disclosed expected churn in the legacy MiX customer base.\nCombined gross margin of 53.7% reflects a $1.2 million non-cash amortization expense\nrelated to acquisition-related intangibles from the MiX combination, along with $0.7 million in\ninventory write-offs due to integration efforts to streamline product offerings. Excluding these\nexpenses, adjusted gross margin was 56.1%, in both the current and prior year.\nOperating expenses for the quarter totaled $40.8 million, including $3.9 million in one-time\ntransaction and restructuring costs, versus the prior year of $41.0 million, which included\n$2.0 million in one-time costs. On an adjusted basis, total operating expenses were down by\n5% annually, reflecting the success of our cost synergy program, which secured $13.5\nmillion in annual savings through the end of September.\nWe reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $1.9 million, or $(0.02) per\nshare, compared to $(0.06) in the prior year. However, after adjusting for one-time expenses\nand the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, adjusted earnings per basic share\nwas $0.02 for the current year versus a loss of $(0.01) in the prior period.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by 41% to $14.5 million from $10.3 million in the previous year.\nThis growth was driven by strong top-line performance, resulting in a $2.9 million increase in\ngross margin after accounting for the impact of the amortization of acquisition-related\nintangibles plus the flow through benefits of cost synergies.\nExcluding $62 million in proceeds from the private placement related to the Fleet Complete\nacquisition, we ended the quarter with net debt of $119 million. Adjusting for $1.9 million in\nunsettled transaction costs, pro forma net debt stood at $121 million, versus $110 million at\nthe close of the MiX combination. The $11 million increase in pro forma net debt was\nprimarily driven by an increase in net working capital of $8.2 million that is directly\nattributable to higher net receivables following strong top-line performance.\nFULL-YEAR 2025 FINANCIAL OUTLOOK\nWe are reaffirming our guidance from the October 2nd fireside chat. Capturing six months of\nFleet Complete's financial performance, full-year 2025 revenue is expected to exceed\n$352.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated to exceed $72.5 million, inclusive of an\nincremental $5 million in secured exit run-rate cost synergies. This guidance reflects Fleet\nComplete's pre-acquisition accounting treatment, which remains subject to review as we\nwork to conform to US GAAP standards.\nINVESTOR CONFERENCE CALL\nAs previously announced, Powerfleet will hold a conference call on Tuesday, November 12,\n2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time (5:30 a.m. Pacific time) to discuss results for the second\nquarter fiscal 2025 ended September 30, 2024.\nManagement will make prepared remarks followed by a question-and-answer session.\nDate: Tuesday, November 12, 2024\nTime: 8:30 a.m. Eastern time (5:30 a.m. Pacific time)\nToll Free: 888-506-0062\nInternational: 973-528-0011\nParticipant Access Code: 216765\nThe conference call will be broadcast simultaneously and available for replay here and via\nthe investor section of the company's website at ir.powerfleet.com.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nTo supplement its financial statements presented in accordance with Generally Accepted\nAccounting Principles (GAAP), Powerfleet provides certain non-GAAP measures of financial\nperformance. These non-GAAP measures include adjusted EBITDA, adjusted gross margin,\nadjusted operating expenses, adjusted earnings per share, net debt and net working capital.\nReference to these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results\nprepared under current accounting standards, but are not a substitute for, or superior to,\nGAAP results. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall\nunderstanding of Powerfleet's current financial performance. Specifically, Powerfleet\nbelieves the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and\ninvestors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses and fluctuations in currency rates\nthat may not be indicative of its core operating results and business outlook. These non-\nGAAP measures are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and,\naccordingly, should not be considered as an alternative to net income, gross margin, cash\nflow from operating activities or earnings per share as an indicator of operating performance\nor liquidity. Because Powerfleet's method for calculating the non-GAAP measures may differ\nfrom other companies' methods, the non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to\nsimilarly titled measures reported by other companies. Reconciliation of all non-GAAP\nmeasures included in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP measures\ncan be found in the financial tables included in this press release.\nABOUT POWERFLEET\nPowerfleet (Nasdaq: AIOT; JSE: PWR) is a global leader in the artificial intelligence of things\n(AIoT) software-as-a-service (SaaS) mobile asset industry.
