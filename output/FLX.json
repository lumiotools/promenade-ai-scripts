When viewed in conjunction with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, we believe\nthat our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and a greater\nunderstanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than GAAP measures alone.\nIn addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparison\nof results because the items described below as adjustments to GAAP are not reflective of our core business\nperformance. These financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP financial\nmeasures and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We use these adjusted\nresults because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent\nwhen relying solely on GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific\nfinancial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance. We strongly recommend that investors\nreview the GAAP financial measures and additional non-GAAP information included in our Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q, including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.\nAdjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income\nattributable to ICE common stockholders, adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow for the\nperiods presented below are calculated by adding or subtracting the adjustments described below, which are not\nreflective of our cash

Description of Business\nNature of Business and Organization\nIntercontinental Exchange, Inc. is a leading global provider of technology and data to a broad range of customers including financial institutions,\ncorporations and government entities. Our products, which span major asset classes including futures, equities, fixed income and United States,\nor U.S., residential mortgages, provide our customers with access to mission critical tools that are designed to increase asset class transparency\nand workflow efficiency. Our business is conducted through three reportable business segments:\n• Exchanges: We operate regulated marketplace technology for the listing, trading and clearing of a broad array of derivatives contracts\nand financial securities as well as data and connectivity services related to our exchanges and clearing houses.\n• Fixed Income and Data Services: We provide fixed income pricing, reference data, indices, analytics and execution services as well as\nglobal credit default swap, or CDS, clearing and multi-asset class data delivery technology.\n• Mortgage Technology: We provide a technology platform that offers customers comprehensive, digital workflow tools that aim to\naddress inefficiencies and mitigate risks that exist in the U.S. residential mortgage market life cycle from application through closing,\nservicing and the secondary market.\nWe operate marketplaces, technology and provide data services in the U.S., United Kingdom, or U.K., European Union, or EU, Canada, Asia\nPacific and the Middle East.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S.\nGAAP, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, regarding interim financial reporting.\nAccordingly, the unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for complete\nfinancial statements and should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto for the year\nended December 31, 2023. The unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments that are, in our opinion, necessary for a fair\npresentation of results for the interim periods presented. We believe that these adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.\nPreparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts that\nare reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates. The results of\noperations for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future\nperiod or the full fiscal year.\nThese statements include the accounts of our wholly-owned and controlled subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions between us\nand our wholly-owned and controlled subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. For consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is\nless than 100% and for which we have control over the assets and liabilities and the management of the entity, the outside stockholders’\ninterests are shown as non-controlling interests.\nWe have considered the impacts of macroeconomic conditions during the quarter, including interest rates, inflation rates, election uncertainty\nand outcomes, geopolitical events and military conflicts, including repercussions from the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East and the\nimpacts that any of the foregoing may have on the global economy and on our business. As of September 30, 2024, our businesses and\noperations, including our exchanges, clearing houses, listings venues, data services businesses and mortgage platforms, have not suffered a\nmaterial negative impact as a result of these events. There continues to be uncertainty surrounding the current macroeconomic environment and\nthe impact that it may have on the global economy and on our business.\n9\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to the new and recently adopted accounting\npronouncements applicable to us from those disclosed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report\non Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, or the 2023 Form 10-K.\n3. Acquisitions and Divestitures\nBlack Knight, Inc.\nOn September 5, 2023, we acquired 100% of the equity interests in Black Knight, Inc., or Black Knight, for aggregate transaction consideration\nof approximately $11.8 billion. The aggregate cash component of the transaction consideration was $10.5 billion. We issued 10.9 million shares\nof ICE common stock to Black Knight stockholders, which was based on the market price of our common stock and the average of the volume\nweighted averages of the trading prices of our common stock on each of the ten consecutive trading days ending three trading days prior to the\nclosing of the merger. We expect that this transaction will build on our position as a provider of end-to-end electronic workflow solutions for the\nrapidly evolving U.S. residential mortgage industry. We believe the Black Knight ecosystem adds value for clients of all sizes across the\nmortgage and real estate lifecycles by helping organizations lower costs, increase efficiencies, grow their businesses, and reduce risk.\nOn September 14, 2023, or the Divestiture Date, in connection with the merger agreement, we sold Black Knight's Optimal Blue and Empower\nloan origination system, or LOS, businesses, or the Divestitures, to subsidiaries of Constellation Software, Inc. The cash proceeds from the\nDivestitures were $241 million. The structure of the Optimal Blue transaction also included a promissory note with a face value of $500 million, or\nthe Promissory Note, issued by the purchaser to Black Knight, as a subsidiary of ICE, at the closing of the transaction. The Promissory Note had\na 40-year term with a maturity date of September 5, 2063, and a coupon interest rate of 7.0% per year. The Promissory Note was valued at\n$235 million on the Divestiture Date. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 805, Business Combinations, or ASC 805,\nas well as ASC 360, Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, we are required to measure an acquired long-lived asset or disposal group\nthat is classified as held for sale at the acquisition date at fair value less cost to sell. Accordingly, there was no gain or loss recognized on the\nDivestitures.\nFor the period between the acquisition date of September 5, 2023 through the Divestiture Date, the discontinued operations of Empower and\nOptimal Blue were immaterial.\nPursuant to the Agreement Containing Consent Orders entered into between the Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, and ICE and Black\nKnight, the Promissory Note was required to be sold within six months of the Divestiture Date. We elected the fair value option for the right to\nreceive the net proceeds of the sale of the Promissory Note. As of December 31, 2023, we wrote down the value of the Promissory Note to\n$75 million based on Level 3 inputs (Note 14), resulting in a fair value loss of $160 million. In February 2024, the FTC approved the buyer of the\nPromissory Note, and we completed the sale of the Promissory Note and received the $75 million of proceeds thereafter.\nThe net fair value of the consideration transferred for Black Knight was approximately $11.4 billion as of the acquisition date, which consisted of\nthe following (in millions):\nTransaction\nConsideration\nCash $ 10,542\nICE common stock* 1,274\nConverted vested Black Knight awards 22\nTotal purchase price $ 11,838\nLess: Divestitures (476)\nTotal net purchase price $ 11,362\n*Fair value of the ICE common stock was based on the ICE closing stock price on September 1, 2023, the last business day prior to the acquisition close.\nThe purchase price has been allocated to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities based on the respective estimated fair\nvalues on the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets has been recorded as\ngoodwill, of which $186 million is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill represents potential revenue synergies related to new\nproduct development, various expense synergies and opportunities to enter new markets, and is assigned to our Mortgage Technology business\nsegment. The net purchase price allocation is as follows (in millions):\n10\nNet Purchase Price\nAllocation\nCash and cash equivalents $ 108\nProperty and equipment 120\nGoodwill 9,441\nIdentifiable intangibles 4,948\nDebt acquired (2,397)\nOther assets and liabilities, net 25\nDeferred tax liabilities on identifiable intangibles (1,270)\nOther deferred tax assets 387\nNet purchase price $ 11,362\nIn performing the net purchase price allocation, we considered, among other factors, the intended future use of acquired assets, analysis of\nhistorical financial performance and estimates of future performance of the Black Knight business. For the identified intangible assets, the fair\nvalues have been determined using the income and cost approaches and are partially based on inputs that are unobservable including\nforecasted future cash flows, revenue and margin growth rates, customer attrition rates and discount rates that require judgement.\nThe following table sets forth the components of the intangible assets associated with the acquisition as of September 30, 2024 (in millions,\nexcept years):\nAcquisition-Date Fair Weighted average\nValue life (Years)\nDeveloped Technology $ 1,176 10\nTrademarks/Tradenames 159 19\nCustomer Relationships 3,034 13\nData and Databases 579 10\nTotal $ 4,948 12\nBlack Knight revenues of $800 million and $264 million and operating expenses of $850 million and $287 million were recorded in our\nconsolidated statement of income for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Black Knight revenues are included in\nour mortgage technology revenues.\nThe financial information in the table below combines the historical results for us and Black Knight for the nine and three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, on a pro forma basis, as though the companies had been combined as of the beginning of the prior periods presented (in\nmillions). The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and is not indicative of the results of\noperations that would have been achieved if the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the periods presented. Such unaudited pro\nforma financial information is based on the historical financial statements of ICE and Black Knight. This unaudited pro forma financial information\nis based on estimates and assumptions that have been made solely for purposes of developing such unaudited pro forma information, including,\nwithout limitation, purchase accounting adjustments, interest expense on debt incurred to finance the purchase price, acquisition-related\ntransaction costs, the removal of historical Black Knight intangible asset amortization and the addition of intangible asset amortization related to\nthis acquisition. The unaudited pro forma financial information does not reflect any synergies or operating cost reductions that have been and\nmay be achieved from the combined operations.\nNine Months Ended Three Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 September 30, 2023\nTotal revenues, less transaction-based expenses $ 6,534 $ 2,190\nNet income attributable to ICE $ 1,755 $ 474\nTransaction-based expenses included within revenues, less transaction-based expenses in the table above were not impacted by pro forma\nadjustments and agree to the amounts presented historically in our consolidated statements of income as they relate solely to ICE and not to\nBlack Knight.\n11\n4. Investments\nEquity Method Investments\nOur equity method investments include the Options Clearing Corporation, or OCC, and Bakkt Holdings, Inc. and Bakkt Opco Holdings, LLC, or\ncollectively, Bakkt, among others. Our equity method investments are included in other non-current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe initially record our equity method investments at cost. At the end of each reporting period, we record our share of profits or losses of our\nequity method investments as equity earnings included in other income and adjust the carrying value of our equity method investments\naccordingly. In addition, if and when our equity method investments issue cash dividends to us, we deduct the amount of these dividends from\nthe carrying amount of that investment. We assess the carrying value periodically if impairment indicators are present.\nWe recognized $63 million and $91 million as our share of estimated losses, net, from our equity method investments during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $18 million and $26 million as our share of estimated losses, net, from our equity\nmethod investments during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The estimated losses are primarily related to\nour investment in Bakkt, partially offset by our share of OCC profits. Both periods include adjustments to reflect the difference between reported\nprior period actual results from our original estimates.\nWhen performing our assessment of the carrying value of our investments, we consider, among other things, the length of time and the extent to\nwhich the market value has been less than our cost basis, if applicable, the investee's financial condition and near-term prospects, the economic\nor technological environment in which our investees operate, weakening of the general market condition of the related industry, whether an\ninvestee can continue as a going concern, any impairment charges recorded by an investee on goodwill, intangible or long-lived assets, and our\nintent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.\nOCC\nWe own a 40% interest in OCC through a direct investment by the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE. OCC is regulated by the SEC as a\nregistered clearing agency and by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, as a derivatives clearing organization. OCC serves as\na clearing house for securities options, securities futures, commodity futures and options on futures traded on various independent exchanges.\nOCC clears securities options traded on NYSE Arca and NYSE Amex Options, along with other non-affiliated exchanges.\nBakkt\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we held an approximate 55% and 64% economic interest in Bakkt, respectively. As a result\nof limitations on ICE from the Bakkt voting agreement entered into in connection with Bakkt's merger with Victory Park Capital Impact Acquisition\nHoldings, or VIH, we hold a minority voting interest in Bakkt and treat it as an equity method investment. The decrease in ownership during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 is related to Bakkt's offering of shares of its Class A common stock and warrants to purchase shares of\nits Class A common stock, which diluted our ownership. As part of the offering, on February 29, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase\nagreement to purchase shares of Bakkt's Class A common stock and warrants to purchase additional shares of Bakkt's Class A common stock\nfor a total of $10 million.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we do not have any value assigned to the equity method investment carrying value for Bakkt primarily due to our\ncontinued recording of our share of losses. As Bakkt is a public company with a readily available market price, the fair value of our investment\nwas $71 million as of September 30, 2024, which was based on the quoted market price of Bakkt Class A common stock as of September 30,\n2024.\nOn August 12, 2024, we entered into a revolving credit agreement with Bakkt pursuant to which we have agreed to provide Bakkt with a\n$40 million secured revolving line of credit that matures on December 31, 2026. The $40 million is available in defined commitment amounts for\nspecified time periods in the future. No amounts are permitted to be borrowed without our consent prior to December 31, 2024, after which date\nthe amount Bakkt may borrow increases over time until Bakkt may borrow up to $40 million on or after September 30, 2025. As an equity method\ninvestee, Bakkt is a related party of ICE. There were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement as of September 30, 2024.\n5. Revenue Recognition\nSubstantially all of our revenues are considered to be revenues from contracts with customers. The related accounts receivable balances are\nrecorded in our consolidated balance sheets as customer accounts receivable. We do not have obligations for warranties, returns or refunds to\ncustomers, other than rebates, which are settled each period and therefore do not result in variable consideration. We do not have significant\nrevenue recognized from performance obligations that\n12\nwere satisfied in prior periods. Certain judgments and estimates are used in the identification and timing of satisfaction of performance\nobligations and the related allocation of transaction price. We believe that these represent a faithful depiction of the transfer of services to our\ncustomers.\nDeferred revenue represents our contract liabilities related to our annual, original and other listings revenues, certain data services, clearing\nservices, mortgage technology services and other revenues. See Note 7 for our discussion of deferred revenue balances, activity, and expected\ntiming of recognition.\nFor all of our contracts with customers, except for listings and certain data, clearing and mortgage services, our performance obligations are\nshort term in nature and there is no significant variable consideration. In addition, we have elected the practical expedient of excluding sales\ntaxes from transaction prices.\nRefer to Notes 2 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of our 2023 Form 10-K where we describe our revenue\nrecognition accounting policies and our primary revenue contract classifications in detail.\nDisaggregation of Revenues\nThe following table depicts the disaggregation of our revenues according to business line and segment (in millions). Amounts here have been\naggregated as they follow consistent revenue recognition patterns, and are consistent with the segment information in Note 15:\nFixed Income and Mortgage\nExchanges Data Services Technology\nSegment Segment Segment Total Consolidated\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024:\nTotal revenues (1) $ 5,498 $ 1,719 $ 1,514 $ 8,731\nTransaction-based expenses 1,775 — — 1,775\nTotal revenues, less transaction-based expenses $ 3,723 $ 1,719 $ 1,514 $ 6,956\nTiming of Revenue Recognition\nServices transferred at a point in time $ 2,261 $ 326 $ 338 $ 2,925\nServices transferred over time 1,462 1,393 1,176 4,031\nTotal revenues, less transaction-based expenses $ 3,723 $ 1,719 $ 1,514 $ 6,956\n(1) Included in total revenues is revenue related to net interest income earned on cash margin received from clearing members at certain ICE clearing houses.

These amounts\nwere $20 million and $40 million recorded in Exchanges and Fixed Income and Data Services segments, respectively.\nThe Exchanges segment and the Fixed Income and Data Services segment revenues above include data services revenues. Our data services\nrevenues are transferred over time, and a majority of those revenues are performed over a short period of time of one month or less and relate\nto subscription-based data services billed monthly, quarterly or annually in advance. These revenues are recognized ratably over time as our\ndata delivery performance obligations are met consistently throughout the period.\nThe Exchanges segment revenues transferred over time in the tables above include services related to listings, risk management of open\ninterest performance obligations and regulatory fees, trading permits, and software licenses.\nThe Fixed Income and Data Services segment revenues transferred over time in the tables above include services related to risk management\nof open interest performance obligations, primarily in our CDS business.\nThe Mortgage Technology segment revenues transferred over time in the tables above primarily relate to our origination and servicing\ntechnology revenue where performance obligations consist of a series of distinct services and are recognized over the contract terms as\nsubscription performance obligations are satisfied and, to a lesser extent, professional services revenues and revenues from certain of our data\nand analytics offerings.\n14\nThe components of services transferred over time for each of our segments are as follows:\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Three Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nExchanges Segment:\nData services revenues $ 717 $ 699 $ 242 $ 236\nServices transferred over time related to risk management of open\ninterest performance obligations 281 229 94 78\nServices transferred over time related to listings 366 376 122 124\nServices transferred over time related to regulatory fees, trading permits,\nand software licenses 98 98 34 37\nTotal $ 1,462 $ 1,402 $ 492 $ 475\nFixed Income Data Services Segment:\nData services revenues $ 1,367 $ 1,300 $ 461 $ 436\nServices transferred over time related to risk management of open\ninterest performance obligations in our CDS business 26 25 11 9\nTotal $ 1,393 $ 1,325 $ 472 $ 445\nMortgage Technology Segment:\nRecurring revenues $ 1,164 $ 564 $ 387 $ 235\nOther 12 11 4 3\nTotal $ 1,176 $ 575 $ 391 $ 238\nTotal consolidated revenues transferred over time $ 4,031 $ 3,302 $ 1,355 $ 1,158\nTransaction Price Allocated to Future Performance Obligations\nOur disclosure of transaction price allocated to future performance obligations excludes the following:\n• Volume-based fees in excess of contractual minimums and other usage-based fees to the extent they are part of a single performance\nobligation and meet certain variable consideration allocation criteria;\n• Performance obligations that are part of a contract with an original expected duration of one year or less; and\n• Transactional fees based on a fixed fee per transaction when we have the right to invoice once we have completed the performance\nobligation.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the aggregate amount of the transaction price that is allocated to our future performance obligations was\napproximately $3.7 billion and was primarily related to contracts with customers in the Mortgage Technology segment. We expect this amount to\nbe recognized as revenue as follows: 10% by December 31, 2024, 69% by December 31, 2026, 93% by December 31, 2028 and the rest\nthereafter.\nContract Assets\nA contract asset represents our expectation of receiving consideration in exchange for products or services that we have provided to our\ncustomers, but invoicing is contingent on our completion of other performance obligations or contractual milestones. Substantially all of our\ncontract assets are related to contracts with customers in our Mortgage Technology segment. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, the balance of our contract assets was $86 million and $80 million, respectively.\n15\n6. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nThe following is a summary of the activity in our goodwill balance by segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (in millions):\nFixed Income\nand Data Mortgage\nExchanges Services Technology Total\nSegment Segment Segment Consolidated\nGoodwill balance at December 31, 2023 $ 8,155 $ 4,854 $ 17,544 $ 30,553\nAcquisition — — 4 4\nForeign currency translation 15 2 — 17\nOther activity, net — — 24 24\nGoodwill balance at September 30, 2024 $ 8,170 $ 4,856 $ 17,572 $ 30,598\nThe following is a summary of the activity in our other intangible assets balance for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (in millions):\nOther intangible assets balance at December 31, 2023 $ 17,317\nAcquisition 3\nForeign currency translation 12\nAmortization of other intangible assets (759)\nOther intangible assets balance at September 30, 2024 $ 16,573\nForeign currency translation adjustments result from a portion of our goodwill and other intangible assets being held at our U.K., EU and\nCanadian subsidiaries, whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. The changes in other activity, net, in the table above primarily relate\nto adjustments to the fair value of the net tangible assets made within one year of acquisitions, with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we considered potential indicators of impairment to goodwill and other intangible assets for\neach of our reporting units, which included continued global inflation concerns and changing interest rates, including their effect on our forecasts,\namong other things. As such, we performed this assessment to determine whether it was more-likely-than-not that goodwill and indefinite lived\nintangibles within each of our reporting units were impaired. Additionally, we evaluated whether the carrying value of the finite lived intangible\nassets within our reporting units may not be recoverable. After evaluating events, circumstances and factors which could affect the significant\ninputs used in our evaluation of cash flows and related fair value, we determined it was not more-likely-than-not that an impairment existed in our\ngoodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. With the exception of a $3 million impairment of developed technology within our Exchanges\nSegment that we recorded in the first quarter of 2024, we determined it was not more-likely-than not that the carrying amount of our finite lived\nintangible assets was not recoverable. We plan to perform our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2024. The $3 million impairment\nis included in depreciation and amortization expense within the consolidated statement of income for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024.\n7. Deferred Revenue\nOur contract liabilities, or deferred revenue, represent consideration received that is yet to be recognized as revenue. Total deferred revenue\nwas $475 million as of September 30, 2024, including $375 million in current deferred revenue and $100 million in other non-current liabilities in\nour consolidated balance sheets. The changes in our deferred revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are as follows (in\nmillions):\nData Services and Mortgage\nListings Revenues Other Revenues Technology Total\nDeferred revenue balance at January 1, 2024 $ 108 $ 93 $ 106 $ 307\nAdditions 487 335 106 928\nAmortization (366) (270) (124) (760)\nDeferred revenue balance at September 30, 2024 $ 229 $ 158 $ 88 $ 475\n16\nThe changes in our deferred revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 are as follows (in millions):\nData Services and Mortgage\nListings Revenues Other Revenues Technology Total\nDeferred revenue balance at January 1, 2023 $ 115 $ 88 $ 51 $ 254\nAdditions (1) 485 311 144 940\nAmortization (376) (281) (88) (745)\nDeferred revenue balance at September 30, 2023 $ 224 $ 118 $ 107 $ 449\n(1) Additions in our Mortgage Technology segment in the table above include $68 million of deferred revenue acquired on the date of the Black Knight acquisition\n(Note 3) and $28 million of Black Knight related deferred revenue added in the period after the date of the Black Knight acquisition through September 30, 2023.\nIncluded in the amortization recognized during the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024 is $169 million and $39 million,\nrespectively, related to the deferred revenue balance as of January 1, 2024. Included in the amortization recognized for the nine and three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 is $127 million and $24 million, respectively, related to the deferred revenue balance as of January 1, 2023.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the remaining deferred revenue balance will be recognized over the period of time we satisfy our performance\nobligations as described in Note 5.\n8. Debt\nThe carrying value of our total debt, including short-term and long-term debt, consisted of the following (in millions):\nAs of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023\nShort-term debt:\nCommercial Paper $ 1,371 $ 1,954\n2025 Senior Notes (3.65%; unsecured due May 23, 2025) 1,248 —\nTotal short-term debt 2,619 1,954\nLong-term debt:\n2025 Term Loan due August 31, 2025 — 1,600\n2025 Senior Notes (3.65%; unsecured due May 23, 2025) — 1,246\n2025 Senior Notes (3.75%; unsecured due December 1, 2025) 1,249 1,248\n2027 Senior Notes (4.00%; unsecured due September 15, 2027) 1,491 1,489\n2027 Senior Notes (3.10%; unsecured due September 15, 2027) 498 498\n2028 Senior Notes (3.625%; unsecured due September 1, 2028) 933 920\n2028 Senior Notes (3.75%; unsecured due September 21, 2028) 596 596\n2029 Senior Notes (4.35%; unsecured due June 15, 2029) 1,243 1,241\n2030 Senior Notes (2.10%; unsecured due June 15, 2030) 1,239 1,238\n2031 Senior Notes (5.25%; unsecured due June 15, 2031) 743 —\n2032 Senior Notes (1.85%; unsecured due September 15, 2032) 1,487 1,486\n2033 Senior Notes (4.60%; unsecured due March 15, 2033) 1,490 1,489\n2040 Senior Notes (2.65%; unsecured due September 15, 2040) 1,233 1,232\n2048 Senior Notes (4.25%; unsecured due September 21, 2048) 1,233 1,232\n2050 Senior Notes (3.00%; unsecured due June 15, 2050) 1,223 1,222\n2052 Senior Notes (4.95%; unsecured due June 15, 2052) 1,466 1,466\n2060 Senior Notes (3.00%; unsecured due September 15, 2060) 1,472 1,472\n2062 Senior Notes (5.20%; unsecured due June 15, 2062) 985 984\nTotal long-term debt 18,581 20,659\nTotal debt $ 21,200 $ 22,613\nAs of September 30, 2024, our senior notes of $19.8 billion had a weighted average maturity of 14 years and a weighted average cost of 3.7%\nper annum.\n17\nCredit Facilities\nWe have a $3.9 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the Credit Facility, with future capacity to increase our borrowings under the\nCredit Facility by an additional $1.0 billion, subject to the consent of the lenders funding the increase and certain other conditions. On May 31,\n2024, we agreed with the lenders to extend the maturity date of the Credit Facility from May 25, 2027, to May 31, 2029, among other items. We\nincurred new debt issuance costs of $4 million relating to the Credit Facility and these costs are represented in the accompanying consolidated\nbalance sheet as other non-current assets and will be amortized over the remaining life of the Credit Facility. No amounts were outstanding\nunder the Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024.\nAs of September 30, 2024, of the $3.9 billion that was available for borrowing under the Credit Facility, $1.4 billion was required to back-stop the\nnotes outstanding under our U.S. dollar commercial paper program, or the Commercial Paper Program, and $172 million was required to support\ncertain broker-dealer and other subsidiary commitments. Amounts required to back-stop notes outstanding under the Commercial Paper\nProgram will fluctuate as we increase or decrease our commercial paper borrowings. The remaining $2.4 billion is available for working capital\nand general corporate purposes including, but not limited to, acting as a back-stop to future amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper\nProgram.\nWe previously had a $2.4 billion two-year senior unsecured delayed draw term loan facility, or the Term Loan, with a maturity date of August 31,\n2025. Draws under the Term Loan bore interest on the principal amount outstanding at either (a) Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or\nTerm SOFR, plus an applicable margin of 87.5 basis points plus a credit spread adjustment of 10 basis points or (b) a \"base rate\" plus an\napplicable margin. The applicable margin ranged from 0.625% to 1.125% for Term SOFR loans and from 0.000% to 0.125% for base rate loans,\nin each case, based on a ratings-based pricing grid. During the second quarter of 2024, we fully repaid our outstanding obligations under the\nTerm Loan and debt issuance costs incurred in relation to the Term Loan were fully amortized at the time of repayment.\nOur India subsidiaries maintain $14 million of credit lines for their general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2024, there were no\namounts outstanding under these credit lines.\nCommercial Paper Program\nOur Commercial Paper Program is currently backed by the borrowing capacity available under the Credit Facility, as described above. The\neffective interest rate of commercial paper issuances does not materially differ from short-term interest rates, which fluctuate due to market\nconditions and as a result may impact our interest expense. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net repayments of $583\nmillion under the Commercial Paper Program.\nCommercial paper notes of $1.4 billion with original maturities ranging from 1 to 28 days were outstanding as of September 30, 2024, with a\nweighted average interest rate of 5.2% per annum, and a weighted average remaining maturity of 19 days.\nNew Senior Notes\nOn May 13, 2024, we issued $750 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due 2031, or the 2031 Notes. We intend to use\n$500 million of the net proceeds from the offering of the 2031 Notes to repay a portion of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes\nmaturing in May 2025, or the 2025 Notes. The net proceeds intended to repay the 2025 Notes have been invested and recorded as short-term\nrestricted investments in our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. We used the remaining net proceeds to assist with the\nrepayments of the outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan.\nWe incurred debt issuance costs of $6 million relating to the issuance of the 2031 Notes and these costs are presented in the accompanying\nconsolidated balance sheet as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability and will be amortized over the remaining term of\nthe 2031 Notes.\nExchange Offers\nOn June 5, 2024, we completed a private offer to exchange the $1 billion aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 3.625% senior notes\ndue 2028 issued by Black Knight InfoServ, LLC, or the Black Knight Notes, for new senior notes issued by ICE. As a result of the settlement of\nthe private exchange offer, approximately $998 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding Black Knight Notes were cancelled, and ICE\nissued approximately $998 million in aggregate principal amount of new senior notes, or the ICE Original Exchange Notes, with the same\ninterest payment, maturity dates and interest rate as the Black Knight Notes.\nOn September 10, 2024, we completed a registered exchange offer in which virtually all previously outstanding ICE Original Exchange Notes\nwere exchanged for identical new senior notes that were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, or the ICE Registered Exchange Notes,\nand thereby became freely transferable, subject to certain restrictions applicable to affiliates and broker dealers.\n18\nThe approximately $998 million aggregate principal amount of the ICE Original Exchange Notes and the ICE Registered Exchange Notes and\nthe remaining approximately $2 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding Black Knight Notes are referred to together as the “2028\nSenior Notes (3.625%; unsecured due September 1, 2028)”, which, in the chart above, includes the unamortized fair value adjustment recorded\nat the time of acquisition.\n9. Share-Based Compensation\nWe currently have employee and non-employee director incentive plans from which we grant stock options, restricted shares, and restricted\nstock units with various service, performance, and/or market conditions. We also have an employee stock purchase plan available to our\nemployees. Stock options and restricted stock are granted at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors, or Board,\nbased on the estimated fair value on the date of grant. The fair value of the stock options and restricted stock on the date of grant is recognized\nas expense over the vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures. The non-cash compensation expenses recognized in our consolidated\nstatements of income for stock options, restricted stock and under our employee stock purchase plan, net of amounts classified as capitalized\nsoftware, were $171 million and $164 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $57 million and\n$79 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine and three months ended September 30,\n2024, $14 million and $4 million, respectively, of the total non-cash compensation expense was recorded within acquisition-related transaction\nand integration costs in the consolidated statement of income.\nStock Options\nWe use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value our stock option awards. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nwe used the assumptions in the table below to compute the value:\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nAssumptions: 2024 2023\nRisk-free interest rate\n4.14% 3.47%\nExpected life in years\n6.0 6.1\nExpected volatility\n24% 24%\nExpected dividend yield\n1.33% 1.56%\nEstimated weighted-average fair value of options granted per share\n$37.56 $27.39\nThe risk-free interest rate is based on the zero-coupon U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the date of grant. The expected life is derived from\nhistorical and anticipated future exercise patterns. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility data of our stock.\nRestricted Stock\nRestricted shares are used as an incentive to attract and retain qualified employees and to align our and our stockholders' interests by linking\nactual performance to both short and long-term stockholder return. We issue awards that may contain a combination of time, performance and/or\nmarket conditions. The grant date fair value of each award is based on the closing stock price of our stock at the date of grant. The grant date\nfair value of time-based restricted stock is recognized as expense ratably over the vesting period, which is typically three or four years, net of\nforfeitures.\nIn February 2024, we reserved a maximum of 0.7 million restricted shares for potential issuance as performance-based restricted shares to\ncertain of our employees. The number of shares ultimately granted under this award will be based on our actual financial performance as\ncompared to financial performance targets set by our Board and the Compensation Committee for the year ending December 31, 2024. The\nmaximum compensation expense to be recognized under these performance-based restricted shares is $95 million, net of estimated forfeitures,\nif the maximum financial performance target is met and all 0.7 million shares vest. The compensation expense to be recognized under these\nperformance-based restricted shares will be $48 million, net of estimated forfeitures, if the target financial performance is met, which would result\nin 0.4 million shares vesting. For these awards with performance conditions, we recognize expense on an accelerated basis over the three-year\nvesting period based on our quarterly assessment of the probable 2024 actual financial performance as compared to the 2024 financial\nperformance targets. As of September 30, 2024, our best estimate is that the financial performance level will be above target for 2024. Based on\nthis assessment, we recorded non-cash compensation expense of $22 million and $8 million for the nine and three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, related to these awards and the remaining $37 million in non-cash compensation expense will be recorded on\nan accelerated basis over the remaining vesting period, including $9 million which will be recorded over the remainder of 2024.\n19\nWe also issue awards with a market condition but no performance condition. The fair value of these awards is estimated based on a simulation\nof various outcomes and includes inputs such as our stock price on the grant date and the valuation of historical awards with market conditions.\n10. Equity\nStock Repurchase Program\nIn December 2021, our Board approved an aggregate of $3.15 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date\nthat became effective on January 1, 2022. The approval of our Board for the stock repurchases does not obligate us to acquire any particular\namount of our common stock. In addition, our Board may increase or decrease the amount available for repurchases from time to time. We fund\nrepurchases from our operating cash flow or borrowings under our debt facilities or our Commercial Paper Program. Repurchases may be made\nfrom time to time on the open market, through established trading plans, in privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with all\napplicable securities laws, rules and regulations.\nIn connection with our acquisition of Black Knight, on May 4, 2022 we terminated our Rule 10b5-1 trading plan and suspended share\nrepurchases. Therefore, we did not have any share repurchases during the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the remaining balance of Board approved funds for future repurchases was $2.5 billion.\nWe may begin or discontinue stock repurchases at any time and may enter into, amend or terminate a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan at any time or\nenter into additional plans, subject to applicable rules.\nDividends\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we declared and paid cash dividends per share of $1.35 and $1.26, respectively,\nfor an aggregate payout of $780 million and $713 million, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we\ndeclared and paid cash dividends per share of $0.45 and $0.42, respectively, for an aggregate payout of $261 million and $241 million,\nrespectively. Our Board has adopted a quarterly dividend declaration policy providing that the declaration of any dividends will be approved\nquarterly by the Board or the Audit Committee, taking into account such factors as our evolving business model, prevailing business conditions,\nour current and future planned strategic growth initiatives, our financial results and capital requirements and other considerations which our\nBoard deems relevant, without a predetermined annual net income payout ratio.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss)\nThe following tables present changes in the accumulated balances for each component of other comprehensive income/ (loss) (in millions):\nChanges in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss) by Component\nComprehensive income\nForeign currency from equity method Employee benefit\ntranslation adjustments investment plans adjustments Total\nBalance, as of December 31, 2023 $ (230) $ 2 $ (66) $ (294)\nOther comprehensive income 36 9 — 45\nIncome tax expense — (2) — (2)\nNet current period other comprehensive income 36 7 — 43\nBalance, as of September 30, 2024 $ (194) $ 9 $ (66) $ (251)\nChanges in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss) by Component\nComprehensive income\nForeign currency from equity method Employee benefit\ntranslation adjustments investment plans adjustments Total\nBalance, as of June 30, 2024 $ (252) $ 9 $ (66) $ (309)\nOther comprehensive income 58 — — 58\nIncome tax expense — — — —\nNet current period other comprehensive income 58 — — 58\nBalance, as of September 30, 2024 $ (194) $ 9 $ (66) $ (251)\n20\nChanges in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss) by Component\nComprehensive income\nForeign currency from equity method Employee benefit\ntranslation adjustments investment plans adjustments Total\nBalance, as of December 31, 2022 $ (278) $ 2 $ (55) $ (331)\nOther comprehensive income/(loss) — — — —\nIncome tax benefit/(expense) — — — —\nNet current period other comprehensive income/(loss) — — — —\nBalance, as of September 30, 2023 $ (278) $ 2 $ (55) $ (331)\nChanges in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss) by Component\nComprehensive income\nForeign currency from equity method Employee benefit\ntranslation adjustments investment plans adjustments Total\nBalance, as of June 30, 2023 $ (231) $ 2 $ (55) $ (284)\nOther comprehensive loss (47) — — (47)\nIncome tax benefit/(expense) — — — —\nNet current period other comprehensive loss (47) — — (47)\nBalance, as of September 30, 2023 $ (278) $ 2 $ (55) $ (331)\n11. Income Taxes\nOur effective tax rate was 23% and 14% during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 25% and 18% during\nthe three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rates for the nine and three months ended September 30,\n2024 were higher than the effective tax rates for the comparable periods in 2023 primarily due to tax benefits resulting from favorable audit\nsettlements and state apportionment changes in the prior periods and the U.K. corporate income tax rate increase to 25% effective for the full\nyear in 2024.\nThe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, Global Anti-Base Erosion Pillar Two minimum tax rules, or Pillar Two,\nwhich generally provide for a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, are intended to apply to tax years beginning in 2024. The EU member states\nand many other countries, including the U.K., our most significant non-U.S. jurisdiction, have committed to implement or have already enacted\nlegislation adopting the Pillar Two rules. In July 2023, the U.K. enacted the U.K. Finance Act 2023, effective as of January 1, 2024, which\nincludes provisions to implement certain portions of the Pillar Two minimum tax rules and includes an election to apply a transitional safe harbor\nto extend certain effective dates to accounting periods ending on or before June 30, 2028. These new U.K. Pillar Two rules did not have a\nmaterial impact on our income tax provision as of September 30, 2024.\n12. Clearing Operations\nWe operate six clearing houses, each of which acts as a central counterparty that becomes the buyer to every seller and the seller to every\nbuyer for its clearing members or participants, or Members. Through this central counterparty function, the clearing houses provide financial\nsecurity for each transaction for the duration of the position by limiting counterparty credit risk.\nOur clearing houses are responsible for providing clearing services to each of our futures exchanges, and in some cases to third-party execution\nvenues, and are as follows, referred to herein collectively as \"the ICE Clearing Houses\":\n21\nClearing House Products Cleared Exchange where Executed Location\nEnergy, agricultural, interest rates and equity index futures and ICE Futures Europe, ICE Futures U.S., ICE\nICE Clear Europe U.K.\noptions contracts Endex, and ICE Futures Abu Dhabi\nAgricultural, metals, foreign exchange, or FX, interest rate and\nICE Clear U.S. ICE Futures U.S. U.S.\nequity index futures and/or options contracts\nOTC North American, European, Asian-Pacific and Emerging\nICE Clear Credit Creditex and third-party venues U.S.\nMarket CDS instruments\nDerivatives on equities and equity indices traded on regulated\nICE Clear Netherlands ICE Endex The Netherlands\nmarkets\nICE Clear Singapore Energy, metals and financial futures products ICE Futures Singapore Singapore\nPhysical North American natural gas, environmental\nICE NGX ICE NGX Canada\ncommodities and physical and financial electricity\nOriginal and Variation Margin\nEach of the ICE Clearing Houses generally requires all Members to deposit collateral in cash or certain pledged assets. The collateral deposits\nare known as “original margin.” In addition, the ICE Clearing Houses may make intraday original margin calls in circumstances where market\nconditions require additional protection. The daily profits and losses to and from the ICE Clearing Houses due to the marking-to-market of open\ncontracts is known as “variation margin.” The ICE Clearing Houses mark all outstanding contracts to market, and, with the exception of ICE\nNGX’s physical natural gas, physical environmental and physical power products discussed separately below, pay and collect variation margin at\nleast once daily.\nThe amounts that Members are required to maintain are determined by proprietary risk models established by each ICE Clearing House and\nreviewed by the relevant regulators, independent model validators, risk committees and the boards of directors of the respective ICE Clearing\nHouse. The amounts required may fluctuate over time. Each of the ICE Clearing Houses is a separate legal entity and is not subject to the\nliabilities of the others, or the obligations of Members of the other ICE Clearing Houses.\nShould a particular Member fail to deposit its original margin or fail to make a variation margin payment, when and as required, the relevant ICE\nClearing House may liquidate or hedge the defaulting Member's open positions and use their original margin and guaranty fund deposits to pay\nany amount owed. In the event that the defaulting Member's deposits are not sufficient to pay the amount owed in full, the ICE Clearing Houses\nwill first use their respective contributions to the guaranty fund, often referred to as Skin In The Game, or SITG, to pay any remaining amount\nowed. In the event that the SITG is not sufficient, the ICE Clearing Houses may utilize the respective guaranty fund deposits and default\ninsurance or collect limited additional funds from their respective non-defaulting Members on a pro-rata basis, to pay any remaining amount\nowed.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the ICE Clearing Houses had received or had been pledged $178.6 billion and $175.9\nbillion, respectively, in cash and non-cash collateral in original margin and guaranty fund deposits to cover price movements of underlying\ncontracts for both periods.\nGuaranty Funds and ICE Contribution\nAs described above, mechanisms have been created, called guaranty funds, to provide partial protection in the event of a Member default. With\nthe exception of ICE NGX, each of the ICE Clearing Houses requires that each Member make deposits into a guaranty fund.\nIn addition, we have contributed our own capital that could be used if a defaulting Member’s original margin and guaranty fund deposits are\ninsufficient. Such amounts are recorded as long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents in our balance sheets and are as follows (in millions):\n22\nICE Portion of Guaranty Fund Contribution Default insurance\nClearing House As of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023 As of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023\nICE Clear Europe $197 $197 $100 $100\nICE Clear U.S. 75 75 25 25\nICE Clear Credit 50 50 75 75\nICE Clear Netherlands 2 2 N/A N/A\nICE Clear Singapore 1 1 N/A N/A\nICE NGX 45 15 200 200\nTotal $370 $340 $400 $400\nWe also maintain default insurance at ICE Clear Europe, ICE Clear U.S. and ICE Clear Credit as an additional layer of clearing member default\nprotection, which is reflected in the table above. The default insurance was renewed in September 2022 and has a three-year term. The default\ninsurance layer resides after and in addition to the ICE Clear Europe, ICE Clear U.S. and ICE Clear Credit SITG contributions and before the\nguaranty fund contributions of the non-defaulting Members.\nSimilar to SITG, the default insurance layer is not intended to replace or reduce the position risk-based amount of the guaranty fund. As a result,\nthe default insurance layer is not a factor that is included in the calculation of the Members' guaranty fund contribution requirement. Instead, it\nserves as an additional, distinct, and separate default resource that should serve to further protect the non-defaulting Members’ guaranty fund\ncontributions from being mutualized in the event of a default.\nAs of September 30, 2024, ICE NGX maintained a guaranty fund of $215 million, comprised of $15 million in cash and a $200 million letter of\ncredit backed by a default insurance policy of the same amount, discussed below. Separately, ICE NGX has also set aside $30 million of its own\ncapital that could be used for liquidity purposes if a direct participant of the ICE NGX clearinghouse, or Contracting Party, defaulted.\nBelow is a depiction of our Default Waterfall which summarizes the lines of defense and layers of protection we maintain for our mutualized\nclearing houses.\nICE Clearing House Default Waterfall\n23\nCash and Invested Margin Deposits\nWe have recorded cash and invested margin and guaranty fund deposits and amounts due in our balance sheets as current assets with\ncorresponding current liabilities to the Members. As of September 30, 2024, our cash and invested margin deposits were as follows (in millions):\nOther ICE\nICE Clear ICE Clear Clearing\nEurope Credit ICE Clear U.S. ICE NGX Houses Total\nOriginal margin $ 42,632 $ 22,020 $ 7,533 $ — $ 4 $ 72,189\nUnsettled variation margin, net — — — 788 — 788\nGuaranty fund 2,441 3,513 626 — 5 6,585\nDelivery contracts receivable/payable, net — — — 331 — 331\nTotal $ 45,073 $ 25,533 $ 8,159 $ 1,119 $ 9 $ 79,893\nAs of December 31, 2023, our cash and invested margin deposits were as follows (in millions):\nOther ICE\nICE Clear ICE Clear Clearing\nEurope Credit ICE Clear U.S. ICE NGX Houses Total\nOriginal margin $ 40,170 $ 28,353 $ 4,693 $ — $ 5 $ 73,221\nUnsettled variation margin, net — — — 984 — 984\nGuaranty fund 2,358 3,017 609 — 5 5,989\nDelivery contracts receivable/payable, net — — — 600 — 600\nTotal $ 42,528 $ 31,370 $ 5,302 $ 1,584 $ 10 $ 80,794\nOur cash and invested margin and guaranty fund deposits are maintained in accounts with national banks and highly-rated financial institutions\nor secured through direct investments, primarily in U.S. Treasury and other highly-rated foreign government securities, or reverse repurchase\nagreements with primarily overnight maturities. Reverse repos are valued daily and are subject to collateral maintenance provisions pursuant to\nwhich the counterparty must provide additional collateral if the underlying securities lose value, in an amount sufficient to maintain\ncollateralization of at least 102%. We primarily use Level 1 inputs when evaluating the fair value of the non-cash equivalent direct investments,\nas highly-rated government securities are quoted in active markets. The carrying value of these deposits is deemed to approximate fair value.\nTo provide a tool to address the liquidity needs of our clearing houses and manage the liquidation of margin and guaranty fund deposits held in\nthe form of cash and high quality sovereign debt, ICE Clear Europe, ICE Clear Credit and ICE Clear U.S. have entered into Committed\nRepurchase Agreement Facilities, or Committed Repo. Additionally, ICE Clear Credit and ICE Clear Netherlands have entered into Committed\nFX Facilities to support these liquidity needs. As of September 30, 2024, the following facilities were in place:\n• ICE Clear Europe: $1.0 billion in Committed Repo to have the ability to convert securities held as collateral into U.S. dollar, euro and\npound sterling deposits with same day liquidity.\n• ICE Clear Credit: $300 million in Committed Repo (U.S. dollar based) to have the ability to convert U.S. dollar\\euro denominated\nsovereign debt held as collateral into U.S. dollar\\euro deposits with same day liquidity, €250 million in Committed Repo (euro based) to\nhave the ability to convert euro\\U.S. dollar denominated sovereign debt deposits held as collateral into euro\\U.S. dollar denominated\ndeposits with same day liquidity, and €1.9 billion in Committed FX Facilities to have the ability to convert available U.S. dollar\ndenominated cash into euro denominated cash to meet a euro denominated payment obligation with same day liquidity.\n• ICE Clear U.S.: $250 million in Committed Repo to have the ability to convert U.S. dollar denominated sovereign debt deposits held as\ncollateral into U.S. dollar deposits with same day liquidity.\n• ICE Clear Netherlands: €10 million in Committed FX Facilities to have the ability to convert available non-euro denominated cash into\neuro denominated cash to meet euro denominated payment obligations with same day liquidity.\n24\nDetails of our deposits are as follows (in millions):\nCash and Cash Equivalent Margin Deposits and Guaranty Funds\nClearing House Investment Type As of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023\nICE Clear Europe National bank account (1) $ 6,079 $ 5,819\nICE Clear Europe Reverse repo 36,177 32,695\nICE Clear Europe Sovereign debt 2,753 3,745\nICE Clear Europe Demand deposits 64 40\nICE Clear Credit National bank account 18,083 22,754\nICE Clear Credit Reverse repo 4,593 5,381\nICE Clear Credit Demand deposits 2,857 3,235\nICE Clear U.S. Reverse repo 7,811 4,955\nICE Clear U.S. Sovereign Debt 348 347\nOther ICE Clearing Houses Demand deposits 9 9\nTotal cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty funds $ 78,774 $ 78,980\nInvested Deposits, Delivery Contracts Receivable and Unsettled Variation Margin\nAs of September 30,\nClearing House Investment Type 2024 As of December 31, 2023\nUnsettled variation margin and delivery contracts\nICE NGX\nreceivable $ 1,119 $ 1,584\nICE Clear Europe Invested deposits - sovereign debt — 230\nTotal invested deposits, delivery contracts receivable and unsettled variation margin $ 1,119 $ 1,814\n(1) As of September 30, 2024, ICE Clear Europe held £4.5 billion ($6.1 billion based on the pound sterling/U.S. dollar exchange rate of 1.3375 as of September 30, 2024) at the\nBank of England, or BOE. As of December 31, 2023, ICE Clear Europe held €11 million ($12 million based on the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate of 1.1037 as of December 31,\n2023) at the ECB, £4.6 billion ($5.8 billion based on the pound sterling/U.S. dollar exchange rate of 1.2732 as of December 31, 2023) at the BOE and €10 million ($11 million\nbased on the above exchange rate) at the BOE.\nOther Deposits\nIn addition to the cash and invested deposits above, the ICE Clearing Houses have also received other assets from Members, which include\ngovernment obligations, and may include other non-cash collateral such as letters of credit at ICE NGX, European emission allowance\ncertificates or gold on rare occasions at ICE Clear Europe, to mitigate credit risk. For certain deposits, we may impose discount or “haircut” rates\nto ensure adequate collateral if market values fluctuate. These other deposits are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as the risks\nand rewards of these assets remain with the Members unless the clearing houses have sold or re-pledged the assets or in the event of a\nclearing member default, where the Member is no longer entitled to redeem the assets. Any income, gain or loss accrues to the Members. The\nICE Clearing Houses do not, in the ordinary course, rehypothecate or re-pledge these assets. These pledged assets are not reflected in our\nbalance sheets, and are as follows (in millions):\nAs of September 30, 2024\nICE Clear ICE Clear\nEurope Credit ICE Clear U.S. ICE NGX Total\nOriginal margin:\nGovernment securities at face value $ 41,739 $ 33,440 $ 15,613 $ — $ 90,792\nLetters of credit and other — — — 3,849 3,849\nEmissions certificates at fair value 1,109 — — — 1,109\nICE NGX cash deposits — — — 737 737\nTotal $ 42,848 $ 33,440 $ 15,613 $ 4,586 $ 96,487\nGuaranty fund:\nGovernment securities at face value $ 580 $ 1,336 $ 291 $ — $ 2,207\n25\nAs of December 31, 2023\nICE Clear ICE Clear\nEurope Credit ICE Clear U.S. ICE NGX Total\nOriginal margin:\nGovernment securities at face value $ 45,698 $ 26,992 $ 13,062 $ — $ 85,752\nLetters of credit and other — — — 5,006 5,006\nEmissions certificates at fair value 904 — — — 904\nICE NGX cash deposits — — — 1,219 1,219\nTotal $ 46,602 $ 26,992 $ 13,062 $ 6,225 $ 92,881\nGuaranty fund:\nGovernment securities at face value $ 765 $ 1,119 $ 345 $ — $ 2,229\nICE NGX\nICE NGX owns a clearing house which administers the physical delivery of energy and environmental trading contracts. ICE NGX is the central\ncounterparty to Members on opposite sides of its physically-settled contracts, and the balance related to delivered but unpaid contracts is\nrecorded as a delivery contract net receivable, with an offsetting delivery contract net payable in our balance sheets. Unsettled variation margin\nequal to the fair value of open contracts is recorded as of each balance sheet date. There is no impact on our consolidated statements of income\nas an equal amount is recognized as both an asset and a liability. ICE NGX marks all of its outstanding physical natural gas, physical\nenvironmental and physical power contracts to market daily, and requires full collateralization of net accrued variation losses. Due to the highly\nliquid nature and the short period of time to maturity, the fair values of our delivery contract net payable and net receivable are determined to\napproximate carrying value.\nICE NGX requires Members to maintain cash or letters of credit to serve as collateral in the event of default. The cash is maintained in a\nsegregated bank account for the benefit of the Member, and remains the property of the Member and, therefore, it is not included in our\nconsolidated balance sheets. ICE NGX maintains a committed daylight-overnight liquidity facility in the amount of $100 million with an additional\n$200 million uncommitted with a third-party Canadian chartered bank which provides liquidity in the event of a settlement shortfall, subject to\ncertain conditions.\nAs of September 30, 2024, ICE NGX maintains a guaranty fund of $215 million funded by a $200 million letter of credit issued by a major\nCanadian chartered bank and backed by default insurance underwritten by Export Development Canada, or EDC, a Crown corporation operated\nat arm’s length from the Canadian government, plus $15 million held as restricted cash to fund the first loss amount that ICE NGX is responsible\nfor under the default insurance policy. In the event of a participant default where the Member’s collateral is depleted, the shortfall would be\ncovered by a draw down on the letter of credit following which ICE NGX would file a claim under the default insurance to recover additional\nlosses up to $200 million beyond the $15 million first-loss amount that ICE NGX is responsible for under the default insurance policy. ICE NGX\nhas also set aside $30 million of its own capital that could be used for liquidity purposes in the event of a Contracting Party default.\nClearing House Exposure\nThe net notional value of unsettled contracts was $2.4 trillion as of September 30, 2024. Each ICE Clearing House bears financial counterparty\ncredit risk and provides a central counterparty guarantee, or performance guarantee, to its Members. In its guarantor role, each ICE Clearing\nHouse has equal and offsetting claims to and from Members on opposite sides of each contract, standing as an intermediary on every contract\ncleared. To reduce their exposure, the ICE Clearing Houses have a risk management program with both initial and ongoing membership\nstandards. With the exception of ICE NGX, the ICE Clearing Houses mark all outstanding contracts to market and pay and collect variation\nmargin at least once daily.\nExcluding the effects of original and variation margin, guaranty fund and collateral requirements and default insurance, the ICE Clearing Houses’\nmaximum estimated exposure for this guarantee would be the intra-day or full day change in fair value if all Members who have open positions\nwith unrealized losses simultaneously defaulted, which is an extremely unlikely scenario. The levels of original margin are calibrated such that a\nportfolio the ICE Clearing House may be required to liquidate post Member default can be closed or auctioned without recourse to resources\nother than those deposited by the defaulting Member, assuming an appropriate risk confidence level and liquidation period. In addition to the\nbase margin model, each ICE Clearing House, depending on its products, employs a number of margin add-ons related to position\nconcentration, clearing member capital, volatility, spread responses, recovery rate sensitivity, jump-to-default, and wrong way risk.\n26\nWe also performed calculations to determine the fair value of our counterparty performance guarantee taking into consideration factors such as\ndaily settlement of contracts, margining and collateral requirements, other elements of our risk management program, historical evidence of\ndefault payments, and estimated probability of potential default payouts by the ICE Clearing Houses. Based on these analyses, the estimated\ncounterparty performance guarantee liability was determined to be nominal, and no liability was recorded as of September 30, 2024. The ICE\nClearing Houses have never experienced an incident of a clearing member default which has required the use of the guaranty funds of non-\ndefaulting clearing members or the assets of the ICE Clearing Houses.\n13. Legal Proceedings\nIn the ordinary course of our business, from time to time we are subject to legal proceedings, lawsuits, government investigations and other\nclaims with respect to a variety of matters. In addition, we are subject to periodic reviews, inspections, examinations and investigations by\nregulators in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, any of which may result in claims, legal proceedings, assessments, fines, penalties, restrictions on\nour business or other sanctions. We record estimated expenses and reserves for legal or regulatory matters or other claims when these matters\npresent loss contingencies that are probable and the related amount is reasonably estimable. Any such accruals may be adjusted as\ncircumstances change. Assessments of losses are inherently subjective and involve unpredictable factors. While the outcome of legal and\nregulatory matters is inherently difficult to predict and/or the range of loss often cannot be reasonably estimable, we do not believe that the\nliabilities, if any, which may ultimately result from the resolution of the various legal and regulatory matters that arise in the ordinary course of our\nbusiness, including the PennyMac Arbitration matter described below and those described in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in\nPart II, Item 8 of our 2023 Form 10-K, are likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or\nliquidity. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially and adversely\naffected by any developments relating to these legal and regulatory matters. A range of possible losses related to certain cases cannot be\nreasonably estimated at this time, except for a $10 million accrual related to a regulatory matter and as otherwise disclosed below and in Note\n16 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of our 2023 Form 10-K. Individual matter disclosures in this Form 10-Q are limited to\nnew significant matters or significant updates on existing matters since the 2023 Form 10-K.\nPennyMac Arbitration\nIn this matter, an American Arbitration Association arbitrator found, among other things, that PennyMac, in developing its Servicing Systems\nEnvironment, or SSE, software, engaged in the unauthorized use of Black Knight’s confidential information and granted Black Knight’s breach of\ncontract claim on this basis. The arbitrator entered a final award of $157 million in favor of Black Knight on January 12, 2024. On February 14,\n2024, PennyMac paid Black Knight $160 million in satisfaction of the final award (inclusive of applicable interest). In the same arbitration,\nPennyMac also brought claims under the Sherman and Clayton Acts, seeking $65 million in damages, subject to trebling. The arbitrator awarded\nPennyMac zero dollars in damages on its claims. The arbitrator also found unenforceable a legacy provision in Black Knight contracts preventing\nclients from servicing loans on multiple systems simultaneously. Black Knight never enforced that provision against any customer and has\nalerted current customers that this provision will not be enforced in the future.\nFor further information on our legal and regulatory matters, please see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of our\n2023 Form 10-K.\n14. Fair Value Measurements\nFair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most\nadvantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Our financial\ninstruments consist primarily of certain short-term and long-term assets and liabilities, customer accounts receivable, margin deposits and\nguaranty funds, equity and equity method investments, and short-term and long-term debt.\nThe fair value of our financial instruments is measured based on a three-level hierarchy:\n• Level 1 inputs — quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\n• Level 2 inputs — observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or\ninputs other than quoted prices that are directly observable.\n• Level 3 inputs — unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or\nliabilities.\n27\nFinancial assets and liabilities recorded or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023 were classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the asset or liability’s fair value\nmeasurement.\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\nOur mutual funds are equity and fixed income mutual funds held for the purpose of providing future payments for our supplemental executive\nsavings plan and our supplemental executive retirement plan. These mutual funds are classified as equity investments and measured at fair\nvalue using Level 1 inputs with adjustments recorded in net income.\nExcluding our equity investments without a readily determinable fair value, all other financial instruments are determined to approximate carrying\nvalue due to the short period of time to their maturities.\nAs described in Note 3, we measured the right to receive the net proceeds of the sale of the Promissory Note obtained in connection with the\nOptimal Blue sale using Level 3 inputs. In February 2024, the FTC approved the buyer of the Promissory Note, and we completed the sale of the\nPromissory Note and received the $75 million of proceeds thereafter. Subsequent to the sale and as of September 30, 2024, we did not use\nLevel 3 inputs to determine the fair value of assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\nSee Note 12 for the fair value considerations related to our margin deposits, guaranty funds and delivery contracts receivable.\nNon-Recurring Fair Value Measurements\nWe measure certain assets, such as intangible assets and equity investments, including equity method investments, at fair value on a non-\nrecurring basis. These assets are recognized at fair value if they are deemed to be impaired. As of September 30, 2024, with the exception of a\n$3 million impairment of a developed technology intangible asset recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2024 within the Exchanges\nsegment, none of our intangible assets or equity method investments were required to be recorded at fair value since no impairments were\nrecorded.\nWe measure certain equity investments at fair value on a non-recurring basis using our policy election under ASC 321, Investments - Equity\nSecurities. During the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a $1 million fair value loss and a $2 million fair value\ngain, respectively, on our investments related to an impairment and separately identifying an observable price change in one of our investments.\nThese were recorded within other income/(expense), net, in the consolidated statement of income. With the exception of the items noted above,\nno other adjustments were necessary. As of September 30, 2024, the carrying amount of our investments without readily determinable fair\nvalues was $99 million.\nFinancial Instruments Not Measured at Fair Value\nThe table below displays the fair value of our debt as of September 30, 2024. The fair values of our fixed rate notes were estimated using Level\n2 inputs including quoted market prices for these instruments. The fair value of other short-term debt approximates par value since the interest\nrates on this short-term debt approximate market rates as of September 30, 2024.\n28\nAs of September 30, 2024\n(in millions)\nDebt: Carrying Amount Fair value\nCommercial Paper $ 1,371 $ 1,371\n2025 Senior Notes (3.65%; unsecured due May 23, 2025) 1,248 1,242\n2025 Senior Notes (3.75%; unsecured due December 1, 2025) 1,249 1,243\n2027 Senior Notes (4.00%; unsecured due September 15, 2027) 1,491 1,503\n2027 Senior Notes (3.10%; unsecured due September 15, 2027) 498 487\n2028 Senior Notes (3.625%; unsecured due September 1, 2028) 933 979\n2028 Senior Notes (3.75%; unsecured due September 21, 2028) 596 592\n2029 Senior Notes (4.35%; unsecured due June 15, 2029) 1,243 1,261\n2030 Senior Notes (2.10%; unsecured due June 15, 2030) 1,239 1,115\n2031 Senior Notes (5.25%; unsecured due June 15, 2031) 743 790\n2032 Senior Notes (1.85%; unsecured due September 15, 2032) 1,487 1,244\n2033 Senior Notes (4.60%; unsecured due March 15, 2033) 1,490 1,517\n2040 Senior Notes (2.65%; unsecured due September 15, 2040) 1,233 944\n2048 Senior Notes (4.25%; unsecured due September 21, 2048) 1,233 1,111\n2050 Senior Notes (3.00%; unsecured due June 15, 2050) 1,223 895\n2052 Senior Notes (4.95%; unsecured due June 15, 2052) 1,466 1,497\n2060 Senior Notes (3.00%; unsecured due September 15, 2060) 1,472 1,003\n2062 Senior Notes (5.20%; unsecured due June 15, 2062) 985 1,022\nTotal debt $ 21,200 $ 19,816\n15. Segment Reporting\nOur business is conducted through three reportable business segments:\n• Exchanges: We operate regulated marketplace technology for the listing, trading and clearing of a broad array of derivatives contracts\nand financial securities as well as data and connectivity services related to our exchanges and clearing houses;\n• Fixed Income and Data Services: We provide fixed income pricing, reference data, indices, analytics and execution services as well as\nglobal CDS clearing and multi-asset class data delivery technology; and\n• Mortgage Technology: We provide a technology platform that offers customers comprehensive, digital workflow tools that aim to\naddress inefficiencies and mitigate risks that exist in the U.S. residential mortgage market life cycle from application through closing,\nservicing and the secondary market.\nWhile revenues are recorded specifically in the segment in which they are earned or to which they relate, a significant portion of our operating\nexpenses are not solely related to a specific segment because the expenses serve functions that are necessary for the operation of more than\none segment. We directly allocate expenses when reasonably possible to do so. Otherwise, we use a pro-rata revenue approach as the\nallocation method for the expenses that do not relate solely to one segment and serve functions that are necessary for the operation of all\nsegments.\nOur chief operating decision maker does not review total assets or statements of income below operating income by segments; therefore, such\ninformation is not presented below. Our three segments do not engage in intersegment transactions.\nFinancial data for our business segments is as follows for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in millions):\n29\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nFixed Income\nand Data Mortgage\nExchanges Services Technology Consolidated\nRevenues:\nEnergy futures and options $ 1,399 $ — $ — $ 1,399\nAgricultural and metals futures and options 203 — — 203\nFinancial futures and options 408 — — 408\nCash equities and equity options 2,092 — — 2,092\nOTC and other 313 — — 313\nData and connectivity services 717 — — 717\nListings 366 — — 366\nFixed income execution — 84 — 84\nCDS clearing — 268 — 268\nFixed income data and analytics — 876 — 876\nOther data and network services — 491 — 491\nOrigination technology — — 536 536\nClosing solutions — — 150 150\nServicing software — — 635 635\nData and analytics — — 193 193\nRevenues 5,498 1,719 1,514 8,731\nTransaction-based expenses 1,775 — — 1,775\nRevenues, less transaction-based expenses 3,723 1,719 1,514 6,956\nOperating expenses 989 1,087 1,648 3,724\nOperating income/(loss) $ 2,734 $ 632 $ (134) $ 3,232\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\nFixed Income\nand Data Mortgage\nExchanges Services Technology Consolidated\nRevenues:\nEnergy futures and options $ 473 $ — $ — $ 473\nAgricultural and metals futures and options 60 — — 60\nFinancial futures and options 141 — — 141\nCash equities and equity options 791 — — 791\nOTC and other 109 — — 109\nData and connectivity services 242 — — 242\nListings 122 — — 122\nFixed income execution — 28 — 28\nCDS clearing — 97 — 97\nFixed income data and analytics — 295 — 295\nOther data and network services — 166 — 166\nOrigination technology — — 182 182\nClosing solutions — — 54 54\nServicing software — — 209 209\nData and analytics — — 64 64\nRevenues 1,938 586 509 3,033\nTransaction-based expenses 684 — — 684\nRevenues, less transaction-based expenses 1,254 586 509 2,349\nOperating expenses 307 376 563 1,246\nOperating income/(loss) $ 947 $ 210 $ (54) $ 1,103\n30\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nFixed Income\nand Data Mortgage\nExchanges Services Technology Consolidated\nRevenues:\nEnergy futures and options $ 1,084 $ — $ — $ 1,084\nAgricultural and metals futures and options 208 — — 208\nFinancial futures and options 344 — — 344\nCash equities and equity options 1,734 — — 1,734\nOTC and other 309 — — 309\nData and connectivity services 699 — — 699\nListings 376 — — 376\nFixed income execution — 89 — 89\nCDS clearing — 279 — 279\nFixed income data and analytics — 832 — 832\nOther data and network services — 468 — 468\nOrigination technology — — 524 524\nClosing solutions — — 136 136\nServicing software — — 69 69\nData and analytics — — 86 86\nRevenues 4,754 1,668 815 7,237\nTransaction-based expenses 1,450 — — 1,450\nRevenues, less transaction-based expenses 3,304 1,668 815 5,787\nOperating expenses 944 1,057 1,017 3,018\nOperating income/(loss) $ 2,360 $ 611 $ (202) $ 2,769\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2023\nFixed Income\nand Data Mortgage\nExchanges Services Technology Consolidated\nRevenues:\nEnergy futures and options $ 384 $ — $ — $ 384\nAgricultural and metals futures and options 61 — — 61\nFinancial futures and options 112 — — 112\nCash equities and equity options 519 — — 519\nOTC and other 104 — — 104\nData and connectivity services 236 — — 236\nListings 124 — — 124\nFixed income execution — 29 — 29\nCDS clearing — 94 — 94\nFixed income data and analytics — 279 — 279\nOther data and network services — 157 — 157\nOrigination technology — — 172 172\nClosing solutions — — 48 48\nServicing software — — 69 69\nData and analytics — — 41 41\nRevenues 1,540 559 330 2,429\nTransaction-based expenses 426 — — 426\nRevenues, less transaction-based expenses 1,114 559 330 2,003\nOperating expenses 313 358 487 1,158\nOperating income/(loss) $ 801 $ 201 $ (157) $ 845\n31\nRevenues from one member of the Exchanges segment comprised $386 million, or 10%, and $112 million, or 9%, of our Exchange revenues,\nless transaction-based expenses for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Revenues from one member of the\nExchanges segment comprised $394 million, or 12%, and $140 million, or 13%, of our Exchange revenues, less transaction-based expenses for\nthe nine and three months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Clearing members are primarily intermediaries and represent a broad range\nof principal trading firms. If a clearing member ceased its operations, we believe that the trading firms would continue to conduct transactions\nand would clear those transactions through another clearing member firm. No additional customers or clearing members accounted for more\nthan 10% of our segment revenues or consolidated revenues during the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023.\n16. Earnings Per Common Share\nThe following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted earnings per common share computations for the\nnine and three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in millions, except per share amounts):\nNine Months Ended September 30, Three Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nBasic:\nNet income attributable to Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. $ 2,056 $ 1,995 $ 657 $ 541\nWeighted average common shares outstanding 573 561 574 563\nBasic earnings per common share $ 3.59 $ 3.56 $ 1.15 $ 0.96\nDiluted:\nWeighted average common shares outstanding 573 561 574 563\nEffect of dilutive securities - stock options and restricted stock 3 1 3 2\nDiluted weighted average common shares outstanding 576 562 577 565\nDiluted earnings per common share $ 3.57 $ 3.55 $ 1.14 $ 0.96\nBasic earnings per common share is calculated using the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period.\nCommon equivalent shares from stock options and restricted stock awards, calculated using the treasury stock method, are included in the\ndiluted per share calculations unless the effect of their inclusion would be antidilutive. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, 0.2 million and 0.8 million outstanding stock options and restricted stock awards, respectively, were not included in the computation of\ndiluted earnings per common share because to do so would have had an antidilutive effect.\n17. Subsequent Events\nWe have evaluated subsequent events and determined that no events or transactions met the definition of a subsequent event for purposes of\nrecognition or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements.\n32\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, or this Quarterly Report, and unless otherwise indicated, the terms “Intercontinental Exchange,” “ICE,”\n“we,” “us,” “our,” “our company” and “our business” refer to Intercontinental Exchange, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries. All\nreferences to “options” or “options contracts” in the context of our futures products refer to options on futures contracts. Solely for convenience,\nreferences in this Quarterly Report to any trademarks, service marks and trade names owned by ICE are listed without the ®, ™ and © symbols,\nbut we will assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights to these trademarks, service marks and trade names.\nWe also include references to third-party trademarks, trade names and service marks in this Quarterly Report. Except as otherwise expressly\nnoted, our use or display of any such trademarks, trade names or service marks is not an endorsement or sponsorship and does not indicate\nany relationship between us and the parties that own such marks and names.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this\nQuarterly Report. Figures in the tables may not recalculate or sum exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on\nunrounded numbers.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Quarterly Report, including the sections entitled “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” “Legal Proceedings” and “Management’s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” contains “forward-looking statements” as defined in the Private\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be forward-looking\nstatements.\nThese forward-looking statements relate to future events or our future financial performance and are based on our present beliefs and\nassumptions as well as the information currently available to us. They involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may\ncause our results, levels of activity, performance, cash flows, financial position or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or\nimplied by these statements.\nForward-looking statements may be introduced by or contain terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “targets,” “goal,”\n“expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “continue,” or the antonyms of these terms or other comparable\nterminology. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future\nresults, levels of activity, performance, cash flows, financial position or achievements. Accordingly, we caution you not to place undue reliance on\nany forward-looking statements we may make.\nFactors that may affect our performance and the accuracy of any forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those listed below:\n• conditions in global financial markets and domestic and international economic and social conditions, including inflation, risk of\nrecession, political uncertainty and discord, geopolitical events or conflicts (including the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East),\ninternational trade policies and sanctions laws;\n• global political conditions including the presidential election in the United States, or U.S., and general elections in many jurisdictions in\nthe U.S.;\n• the impact of the introduction of, or any changes to, laws, regulations, rules or government policies with respect to, among other things,\nfinancial markets and climate change, as well as increased regulatory scrutiny or enforcement actions;\n• volatility in commodity prices and equity prices, and price volatility of financial benchmarks and instruments such as interest rates, credit\nspreads, equity indices, foreign exchange rates, and mortgage industry trends;\n• the impact of climate change and the transition to renewable energy;\n• the business environment in which we operate and trends in our industries, including trading volumes, prevalence of clearing, demand\nfor data services, mortgage lending and servicing activity, mortgage delinquencies, fees, changing regulations, competition and\nconsolidation;\n• our ability to minimize the risks associated with operating clearing houses in multiple jurisdictions;\n• our exchanges’ and clearing houses' compliance with their respective regulatory and oversight responsibilities;\n• the resilience of our electronic platforms and soundness of our business continuity and disaster recovery plans;\n• our ability to realize the expected benefits of our acquisitions and our investments, including our acquisition of Black Knight, Inc., or\nBlack Knight, and our ability to remain in compliance with the Federal Trade Commission consent order to resolve antitrust concerns\nregarding our acquisition of Black Knight;\n33\n• our ability to execute our growth strategy, identify and effectively pursue, implement and integrate acquisitions, including that of Black\nKnight, and strategic alliances and realize the synergies and benefits of such transactions within the expected time frame;\n• the impacts of computer and communications systems failures and delays, inclusive of the performance and reliability of our trading,\nclearing, data services and mortgage technologies and those of third-party service providers;\n• our ability to keep pace with technological developments and client preferences;\n• our ability to ensure that the technology we utilize is not vulnerable to cyberattacks, hacking and other cybersecurity risks or other\ndisruptive events or to minimize the impact of any such events;\n• our ability to keep information and data relating to the customers of the users of the software and services provided by our Mortgage\nTechnology business confidential;\n• the impacts of a public health emergency or pandemic, including a re-emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, on our business, results of\noperations and financial condition as well as the broader business environment;\n• our ability to identify trends and adjust our business to benefit from such trends, including trends in the U.S. mortgage industry such as\ninflation rates, interest rates, new home purchases, refinancing activity, servicing activity, delinquencies and home builder and buyer\nsentiment, among others;\n• our ability to evolve our benchmarks and indices in a manner that maintains or enhances their reliability and relevance;\n• the accuracy of our cost and other financial estimates and our belief that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to service our debt\nand to fund our operational and capital expenditure needs;\n• our ability to incur additional debt and pay off our existing debt in a timely manner;\n• our ability to maintain existing market participants and data and mortgage technology customers, and to attract new ones;\n• our ability to offer additional products and services, leverage our risk management capabilities and enhance our technology in a timely\nand cost-effective fashion;\n• our ability to attract, develop and retain key talent;\n• our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and to operate our business without violating the intellectual property rights of others;\nand\n• potential adverse results of threatened or pending litigation and regulatory actions and proceedings.\nThese risks and other factors include, among others, those set forth in Part 1, Item 1(A) under the caption “Risk Factors” in our 2023 Form 10-K,\nas filed with the SEC on February 8, 2024. Due to the uncertain nature of these factors, management cannot assess the impact of each factor on\nthe business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any\nforward-looking statements.\nAny forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any of\nthese statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this Quarterly Report. New factors may emerge, and it is not\npossible to predict all factors that may affect our business and prospects.\nOverview\nWe are a leading global provider of technology and data to a broad range of customers including financial institutions, corporations and\ngovernment entities. These products, which span major asset classes including futures, equities, fixed income and U.S. residential mortgages,\nprovide our customers with access to mission critical tools that are designed to increase asset class transparency and workflow efficiency.\nAlthough we report our results in three reportable business segments, we operate as one business, leveraging the collective expertise,\nparticularly in data services and technology, that exists across our platforms to inform and enhance our operations. Our segments are as follows:\n• Exchanges: We operate regulated marketplace technology for the listing, trading and clearing of a broad array of derivatives contracts\nand financial securities as well as data and connectivity services related to our exchanges and clearing houses.\n• Fixed Income and Data Services: We provide fixed income pricing, reference data, indices, analytics and execution services as well as\nglobal CDS clearing and multi-asset class data delivery technology.\n• Mortgage Technology: We provide a technology platform that offers customers comprehensive, digital workflow tools that aim to\naddress inefficiencies and mitigate risks that exist in the U.S. residential mortgage market life cycle from application through closing,\nservicing and the secondary market.\n34\nRecent Developments\nGlobal Market Conditions\nOur results of operations are affected by global economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical events and conflicts.\nSince 2022, macroeconomic conditions, including changes in interest rates, inflation and significant market volatility, along with geopolitical\nconcerns, have created ongoing uncertainty and volatility in the global economy and resulted in a dynamic operating environment.\nOur business has been impacted positively and negatively by these global economic conditions. For instance, due to market and interest rate\nvolatility, we have seen increased trading across a number of our products, such as interest rate and equity futures, credit default swaps and\nbonds. Conversely, increases in mortgage interest rates in 2022, 2023 and, to a lesser extent, during the nine months ended September 30,\n2024, have resulted in reduced consumer and investor demand for mortgages and adversely impacted the transaction-based revenues in our\nMortgage Technology segment. If mortgage rates remain high or further increase, or if mortgage lending practices change, our Mortgage\nTechnology segment revenues may be further impacted. In addition, higher interest rates have resulted, and may continue to result, in higher\ninterest rates for our debt instruments as we refinance our existing indebtedness.\nFrom an operational perspective, our businesses, including our exchanges, clearing houses, listings venues, data services businesses and\nmortgage platforms, have not suffered a material negative impact as a result of the events in Ukraine and the Middle East and surrounding\nregions.\nWe expect the macroeconomic environment to remain dynamic in the near-term, and we continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions,\nincluding interest rates, inflation rates, geopolitical events and military conflicts, including election uncertainty and outcomes and repercussions\nfrom the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East and the impact that any of the foregoing may have on the global economy and on our business.\nWe also continue to closely monitor credit worthiness of our counterparties, clearing members and our financial service providers and take risk\nmanagement measures in line with established risk management frameworks.\nRegulation\nOur activities and the markets in which we operate are subject to regulations that impact us as well as our customers, and, in turn, meaningfully\ninfluence our activities, the manner in which we operate and our strategy. We are primarily subject to the jurisdiction of regulatory agencies in the\nU.S., United Kingdom, or U.K., EU, Canada, Singapore and Abu Dhabi. Failure to satisfy regulatory requirements can or may give rise to\nsanctions by the applicable regulator.\nGlobal policy makers have undertaken reviews of their existing legal framework governing financial markets in connection with regulatory reform,\nand have either passed new laws and regulations, or are in the process of debating and/or enacting new laws and regulations that apply to our\nbusiness and to our customers’ businesses. Legislative and regulatory actions may impact the way in which we or our customers conduct\nbusiness and may create uncertainty, which could affect trading volumes or demand for market data. See Part 1, Item 1 “Business —\nRegulation” and Part 1, Item 1(A) \"Risk Factors\" included in our 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of the primary regulations applicable to our\nbusiness and certain risks associated with those regulations.\nDomestic and foreign policy makers continue to review their legal frameworks governing financial markets, and periodically change the laws and\nregulations that apply to our business and to our customers’ businesses. Our key areas of focus on these evolving efforts are:\n• Increased Bank Capital Requirements. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, or the Federal Reserve, the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation proposed to implement various Basel Committee standards\nwhich would increase U.S. bank capital requirements (Basel III Endgame). The Basel III Endgame would apply credit valuation adjustment\nrisk capital requirements to bank-affiliated clearing members' exposures to their clearing clients. The Federal Reserve also proposes to\nrevise the risk-based capital surcharge for global systemically important bank holding companies to include bank-affiliated clearing members'\nexposures to their clearing clients in additional aspects of the surcharge calculation, or G-SIB Surcharge. Both proposals would increase\ncapital requirements for client clearing activities, which could increase costs for clearing services, decrease clearing members' clearing\ncapacity, and result in a reduction of cleared volumes at ICE clearing houses. The Basel III Endgame proposal could also discourage\nparticipation in mortgage lending and servicing, resulting in a reduction of mortgage volumes at ICE Mortgage Technology, negatively impact\nU.S. capital markets, end users' ability to hedge and raise financing through public markets and degrade liquidity. In September 2024,\nMichael Barr, Vice Chairman for Supervision of the Federal Reserve, indicated that he intends to recommend that both the Basel III\nEndgame and G-SIB Surcharge be re-proposed.\n35\n• EMIR 3.0. In February 2024, the European Commission, European Parliament, and Council of the EU reached agreement on the final text of\nthe European Market Infrastructure Regulation, or EMIR, known as EMIR 3.0. EMIR 3.0 contains provisions requiring EU market participants\nto establish accounts for euro-denominated short-term interest rate derivatives, or STIRs, at an EU central counterparty, or CCP, and a\nrequirement to clear a certain number of trades in an EU account. At this time, the number of trades required to be cleared in an EU account\nis not finalized; however, these requirements could result in a reduction of traded and cleared contracts at ICE Futures Europe and ICE\nClear Europe.\n• Policy Intervention to Address High Energy Prices. Various legislative proposals in the EU have been adopted to address high energy\nprices and impact ICE Endex, the primary European exchange for the benchmark European gas contract, and ICE Clear Europe, which\nclears ICE Endex contracts. These policy interventions include price limiting mechanisms for exchange-traded gas products and a new\nliquefied natural gas, or LNG, import benchmark. In December 2022, a coalition of G7 and other nations set the price of certain Russian\ncrude oil at or below $60 a barrel, which remains in place and impacts the services we offer to clients. In December 2023, the EU extended\nuntil January 31, 2025, the price cap on certain Dutch Title Transfer Facility, or TTF, derivatives traded on ICE Endex. Former Prime Minister\nof Italy and economist Mario Draghi's September 2024 report, titled \"The Future of European Competitiveness, Part A: A Competitiveness\nStrategy for Europe,\" recommends further legislative changes to address high energy prices.\n• Benchmarks Regulation. All London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, settings have ceased to be published. The last remaining\n\"synthetic\" LIBOR settings ceased publication in September 2024.\nIn addition, certain benchmarks provided by our index businesses may continue to be used by supervised entities in the EU under\ntransitional provisions of the EU Benchmarks Regulation until December 31, 2025, after which supervised entities will rely on the\nmechanisms provided under the regulation for the use of third-country benchmarks.\n• EU Deforestation Regulation. In October 2024, the European Commission proposed to postpone the effective date of the EU Deforestation\nRegulation, or EUDR, from December 30, 2024 to December 30, 2025 for large companies and to June 30, 2026 for small companies. The\nEUDR requires that certain commodities (including cocoa and coffee) and their products be from deforestation-free land and meet other\nrequirements before they can be placed or made available on the EU market, or exported from it. The EUDR requirements may decelerate\nthe physical trade of cocoa and coffee, impact the usability of EU coffee and cocoa physical inventories, and reduce trading volumes on ICE\nFutures Europe of the Robusta Coffee Contract and London Cocoa Contract and on ICE Futures U.S. of the Coffee C Contract (Arabica).\nThe proposal to postpone the implementation date needs approval by both the EU Parliament and EU Member States. It is uncertain\nwhether the approval will be granted before the end of 2024. We are monitoring these developments and any impact on ICE Futures Europe,\nICE Futures U.S. and ICE Benchmark Administration.\n• U.K. Deforestation Regulation. In December 2023, the U.K. Government announced its intent to implement a regulation which would\nrequire that certain commodities (including cocoa) and their products be from deforestation-free land and meet other requirements. We are\nmonitoring the impact of these developments and any impact on ICE Futures Europe.\n• U.K. Commodity Derivatives Reform. In December 2023, the Financial Conduct Authority, or FCA, published a consultation proposing to\nrevise the U.K. commodity derivatives framework. The Financial Services and Markets Act 2023, or FSMA 2023, reformed the U.K.’s\ncommodity derivatives regulatory regime including revoking the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, or MIFID II, requirement to set\nposition limits on all exchange traded and over-the-counter contracts and transferring the powers to set position limits from the FCA to\ntrading venue operators. The FCA's current proposals would require that trading venues set position limits for critical and related contracts\nincluding ICE's softs, agricultural and energy contracts such as Brent, WTI, gasoil and natural gas, to establish accountability thresholds and\nto report enhanced position data. These requirements could make trading on ICE Futures Europe more difficult and could result in a\nreduction in volumes and liquidity.\n• EU DORA Regulation. The Digital Operational Resilience Act, or DORA, is an EU regulation that establishes an information and\ncommunication technology, or ICT, risk management framework for the EU financial sector. DORA establishes technical standards that\nfinancial entities and their critical third-party technology service providers must implement by January 2025 and imposes requirements\nrelating to risk management, reporting, and information and communications technology service provider oversight. Some of our businesses\nare likely to be impacted by DORA as EU financial entities or critical ICT third-party service providers to EU financial entities.\n• Regulation of ESG Data and Ratings. Many jurisdictions have adopted or are proposing or considering proposals to regulate\nenvironmental, social or governance, or ESG, data providers, as well as ESG ratings. In April 2024, the EU adopted a regulation on the\ntransparency and integrity of ESG rating activities which aims to enhance the integrity, transparency, governance, and independence of ESG\nratings provided in the EU and is expected to be published in\n36\nthe Official Journal of the EU by the end of 2024. The regulation will impact certain ICE Data Service offerings and may require authorization\nand supervision by the European Securities and Markets Authority.\n• Equity Market Structure Rules. In September 2024, the SEC adopted new rules regarding equity market structure which will take effect in\nNovember 2025. The rules amend the minimum pricing increments, or tick sizes, for the quoting of certain stocks to allow these stocks to be\npriced with tighter spreads. The rules also reduce existing fee caps exchanges can charge market participants for access to protected\nquotations and accelerate the availability of information for smaller-sized orders. These rules could affect market and competitive dynamics\nfor venues that facilitate trading of equity securities, including the NYSE.\n• Recognition of our Businesses in Foreign Jurisdictions and Continued Access by Market Participants. In February 2022, the\nEuropean Commission extended until June 2025 the temporary equivalence of U.K. CCPs, which allows EU firms to clear trades at ICE\nClear Europe. In the absence of an extension of the temporary equivalence or permanent equivalence of U.K. CCPs by the European\nCommission, EU persons would be restricted in accessing clearing services at ICE Clear Europe, which could impact clearing revenues, and\ncould also cause us to change our business practices, restructure our businesses or move certain of our businesses and employees.\nTax Policy Changes\nThe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, Pillar Two minimum tax rules, which generally provide for a minimum\neffective tax rate of 15%, are intended to apply to tax years beginning in 2024. In 2023, the OECD issued administrative guidance providing\ntransitional safe harbor rules concerning the implementation of the Pillar Two framework, which will apply to fiscal years ending on or before\nDecember 31, 2026. The EU member states and many other countries, including the U.K., have committed to implement or have already\nenacted legislation adopting the Pillar Two rules. We are monitoring developments and evaluating the impacts of these new rules on our tax rate,\nincluding our ability to qualify for the safe harbor rules as implemented by each jurisdiction; however, we do not expect a material impact to our\neffective tax rate given our current tax profile.\n37\nConsolidated Financial Highlights\nThe following summarizes our results and significant changes in our consolidated financial performance for the periods presented (dollars in\nmillions, except per share amounts).\n(1) Operating loss from our Mortgage Technology segment was $134 million and $202 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n(2) The adjusted figures exclude items that are not reflective of our ongoing core operations and business performance.

We define transaction revenues as those associated with a more specific point-in-time service, such as a trade execution.\n(2) The adjusted figures exclude items that are not reflective of our ongoing core operations and business performance. Adjusted net income attributable to ICE and adjusted diluted\nearnings per share attributable to ICE common stockholders are presented net of taxes. These adjusted figures are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. See “—Non-\nGAAP Financial Measures” below.\n(3) We believe these non-GAAP liquidity measures provide useful information to management and investors to analyze cash resources generated from our operations. We believe\nthat free cash flow is useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors and demonstrates our ability to convert the reinvestment of capital\nexpenditures and capitalized software development costs required to maintain and grow our business. We believe that adjusted free cash flow eliminates the impact of timing\ndifferences related to the payment of section 31 fees. These figures are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. See “—Non-GAAP Liquidity Measures” below.\n• Revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $1.2 billion and $346 million for the nine and three months ended September 30,\n2024, respectively, from the comparable periods in 2023. See \"—Exchanges Segment\", \"—Fixed Income and Data Services Segment\"\nand \"—Mortgage Technology Segment\" below for a discussion of the significant changes in our revenues. The change in revenues during\nthe nine and three months ended September 30, 2024 includes $14 million and $6 million, respectively, in favorable foreign exchange\neffects arising from fluctuations in the U.S. dollar from the comparable periods in 2023.\n• Operating expenses increased $706 million and $88 million for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from\nthe comparable periods in 2023. See \"—Consolidated Operating Expenses\" below for a discussion of the significant changes in our\noperating expenses. The increase in operating expenses during the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024 includes $6\nmillion and $2 million, respectively, in unfavorable foreign exchange effects arising from fluctuations in the U.S. dollar from the\ncomparable periods in 2023.\nVariability in Quarterly Comparisons\nOur business environment has been characterized by:\n• globalization of marketplaces, customers and competitors;\n• growing customer demand for workflow efficiency and automation;\n• commodity, interest rate, inflation rate and financial markets volatility and uncertainty;\n• growing demand for data to inform customers' risk management and investment decisions;\n39\n• evolving, increasing and disparate regulation across multiple jurisdictions;\n• price volatility increasing customers' demand for risk management services;\n• increasing focus on capital and cost efficiencies;\n• customers' preference to manage risk in markets demonstrating the greatest depth of liquidity and product diversity;\n• the evolution of existing products and new product innovation to serve emerging customer needs and changing industry agreements;\n• rising demand for speed, data, data capacity and connectivity by market participants, necessitating increased investment in technology;\nand\n• consolidation and increasing competition among global markets for trading, clearing and listings.\nFor additional information regarding the factors that affect our results of operations, see Item 1(A) “Risk Factors” included in our 2023 Form 10-\nK.\nSegment Results\nOur business is conducted through three reportable business segments:\n• Exchanges: We operate regulated marketplace technology for the listing, trading and clearing of a broad array of derivatives contracts\nand financial securities as well as data and connectivity services related to our exchanges and clearing houses;\n• Fixed Income and Data Services: We provide fixed income pricing, reference data, indices, analytics and execution services as well as\nglobal CDS clearing and multi-asset class data delivery technology; and\n• Mortgage Technology: We provide a technology platform that offers customers comprehensive, digital workflow tools that aim to\naddress inefficiencies and mitigate risks that exist in the U.S. residential mortgage market life cycle, from application through closing,\nservicing and the secondary market.\nWhile revenues are recorded specifically in the segment in which they are earned or to which they relate, a significant portion of our operating\nexpenses are not solely related to a specific segment because the expenses serve functions that are necessary for the operation of more than\none segment. We directly allocate expenses when reasonably possible to do so. Otherwise, we use a pro-rata revenue approach as the\nallocation method for the expenses that do not relate solely to one segment and serve functions that are necessary for the operation of all\nsegments. Our segments do not engage in intersegment transactions.\n40\nExchanges Segment\nThe following presents selected statements of income data for our Exchanges segment (dollars in millions):\n(1) The adjusted figures in the charts above are calculated by excluding items that are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. As a result, these\nadjusted figures are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. See “ —Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.\n41\nNine Months Ended Three Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nRevenues:\nEnergy futures and options $ 1,399 $ 1,084 29 % $ 473 $ 384 23 %\nAgricultural and metals futures and options 203 208 (3) 60 61 (3)\nFinancial futures and options 408 344 19 141 112 26\nFutures and options 2,010 1,636 23 674 557 21\nCash equities and equity options 2,092 1,734 21 791 519 52\nOTC and other 313 309 1 109 104 5\nTransaction and clearing, net 4,415 3,679 20 1,574 1,180 33\nData and connectivity services 717 699 3 242 236 3\nListings 366 376 (3) 122 124 (1)\nRevenues 5,498 4,754 16 1,938 1,540 26\nTransaction-based expenses(1) 1,775 1,450 22 684 426 60\nRevenues, less transaction-based expenses 3,723 3,304 13 1,254 1,114 13\nOther operating expenses 792 760 4 242 252 (4)\nDepreciation and amortization 197 184 7 65 61 4\nOperating expenses 989 944 5 307 313 (2)\nOperating income $ 2,734 $ 2,360 16 % $ 947 $ 801 18 %\nRecurring revenues $ 1,083 $ 1,075 1 % $ 364 $ 360 1 %\nTransaction revenues, net $ 2,640 $ 2,229 18 % $ 890 $ 754 18 %\n(1) Transaction-based expenses are largely attributable to our cash equities and options business.\nExchanges Revenues\nOur Exchanges segment includes transaction and clearing revenues from our futures and NYSE exchanges, related data and connectivity\nservices, and our listings business. Transaction and clearing revenues consist of fees collected from derivatives, cash equities and equity\noptions trading and derivatives clearing, and are reported on a net basis, except for the NYSE transaction-based expenses discussed below.\nRates per-contract, or RPC, are driven by the number of contracts or securities traded and the fees charged per contract, net of certain rebates.\nOur per-contract transaction and clearing revenues will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, transaction\nand clearing volume, product mix, pricing, applicable revenue sharing and market making agreements, and new product introductions.\nTransaction and clearing revenues are generally assessed on a per-contract basis and revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in\ncontract volume and product mix. We consider data and connectivity services revenues and listings revenues to be recurring revenues. Our data\nand connectivity services revenues are recurring subscription fees related to the various data and connectivity services that we provide which\nare directly attributable to our exchange venues. Our listings revenues are also recurring subscription fees that we earn for the provision of\nNYSE listings services for public companies and exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, and related corporate actions for listed companies.\nFor both the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, 22% of our Exchanges segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses,\nwere billed in pounds sterling or euros, and for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2023, 19% and 20% of our Exchanges segment\nrevenues, less transaction-based expenses, were billed in pounds sterling or euros, respectively. Due to the fluctuations of the pound sterling\nand euro compared to the U.S. dollar, our Exchanges segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were higher by $11 million and $4\nmillion for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from the comparable periods in 2023.\nOur exchange transaction and clearing revenues are presented net of rebates. We recorded rebates of $936 million and $729 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $320 million and $241 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, respectively. We offer rebates in certain of our markets primarily to support market liquidity and trading volume by providing qualified\nparticipants in those markets a discount to the applicable commission rate. Such rebates are calculated based on volumes traded. The increase\nin rebates for the nine\n42\nand three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to higher volumes traded as compared to the comparable periods in 2023.\n• Energy Futures and Options: Total energy volume increased 28% and revenues increased 29% for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 from the comparable period in 2023 and volume increased 25% and revenues increased 23% for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 from the comparable period in 2023.\n– Total oil futures and options volume increased 23% and 19% for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,\nfrom the comparable periods in 2023, in part due to ongoing geopolitical issues in the Middle East as well as supply/demand\ndynamics.\n– Our global natural gas futures and options volume increased 35% for both the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024\nfrom the comparable periods in 2023, due to continued growth in our TTF and Asian JKM gas complexes, as well as strength in our\nNorth American natural gas products driven by increased volatility related to shifting weather and fundamentals.\n– Our environmentals and other futures and options volume increased 41% and 56% for the nine and three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, from the comparable periods in 2023, due to ongoing geopolitical issues in the Middle East as\nwell as supply/demand dynamics.\n• Agricultural and Metals Futures and Options: Total volumes in our agricultural and metals futures and options markets increased 1% and\nwere flat for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from the comparable periods in 2023 and revenues\ndecreased 3% for both the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024 from the comparable periods in 2023. In the third quarter of\n2024, increased sugar, coffee and cotton volumes were offset by lower cocoa volumes.\n– Sugar futures and options volumes decreased 8% and increased 17% for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, from the comparable periods in 2023.\n– Other agricultural and metal futures and options volume increased 8% and decreased 11% for the nine and three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, from the comparable periods in 2023.\n• Financial Futures and Options: Total volumes in our financial futures and options markets increased 28% and 43% for the nine and three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from the comparable periods in 2023 and revenues increased 19% and 26% for the nine\nand three months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from the comparable periods in 2023, including the impacts of foreign exchange\neffects. The nine and three months ended September 30, 2024 benefited from interest rate volatility related to central bank activity\nspeculation.\n– Interest rate futures and options volume increased 36% and 52% for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, from the comparable periods in 2023 and revenue increased 30% and 37% for the nine and three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, from the comparable periods in 2023. The nine and three months ended September 30, 2024\nbenefited from interest rate volatility related to increased central bank activity speculation.\n– Other financial futures and options volume, which includes our MSCI®, FTSE® and NYSE FANG+ equity index products, decreased\n9% and 2% for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from the comparable periods in 2023. Revenue\ndecreased 3% and increased 4% for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from the comparable\nperiods in 2023. The decrease in other financial futures and options volume was primarily due to lower equity market volatility than\nduring the comparable period in 2023.\n• Cash Equities and Equity Options: Cash equities volume increased 9% and 11% for the nine and three months ended September 30,\n2024, respectively, from the comparable periods in 2023, driven by increased participation and higher market share. Cash equities revenues,\nnet of transaction-based expenses, were $228 million and $198 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, and $77 million and $64 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Equity options volume\nincreased 20% and 32% for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from the comparable periods in 2023,\ndriven by increased participation and higher market share. Equity options revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $89 million\nand $86 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $30 million and $29 million for the three months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n43\n• OTC and Other: OTC and other transactions include revenues from our OTC energy business and other trade confirmation services, as well\nas net interest income and fees on certain clearing margin deposits, regulatory penalties and fines, fees for use of our facilities, regulatory\nfees charged to member organizations of our U.S. securities exchanges, designated market maker service fees, exchange membership fees\nand agricultural grading and certification fees. Our OTC and other revenues increased 1% and 5% for the nine and three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, from the comparable periods in 2023.\n• Data and Connectivity Services: Our data and connectivity services revenues increased 3% for both the nine and three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 from the comparable periods in 2023. The increase in revenue was driven by the strong retention rate of existing\ncustomers, the addition of new customers and increased purchases by existing customers.\n• Listings Revenues: Through NYSE, NYSE American and NYSE Arca, we generate listings revenue related to the provision of listings\nservices for public companies and ETFs, and related corporate actions for listed companies. Listings revenues decreased 3% and 1% for\nthe nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from the comparable periods in 2023 due to the roll off of initial listing\nfees from the strong initial public offering, or IPO, market in 2021. All listings fees are billed upfront, and revenues are recognized over time\nas the identified performance obligations are satisfied.\nSelected Operating Data\nVolume of contracts traded, futures and options rate per contract and open interest are measures that we use in analyzing the performance of\nour futures and options contracts. Handled volume, matched volume and cash equities and equity options rate per contract are measures that\nwe use in analyzing our NYSE cash equities and equity options performance. We believe each of these measures provides useful information for\nmanagement and investors in understanding our performance. Management considers these metrics when making financial and operating\ndecisions. Our calculation of these metrics may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nThe following charts and tables present trading activity in our futures and options markets by commodity type based on the total number of\ncontracts traded, as well as futures and options rate per contract (in millions, except for percentages and rate per contract amounts):\nVolume and Rate per Contract\n44\nNine Months Ended Three Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nNumber of contracts traded (in millions):\nEnergy futures and options 817 640 28 % 276 221 25 %\nAgricultural and metals futures and options 90 90 1 26 27 —\nFinancial futures and options 615 479 28 215 149 43\nTotal 1,522 1,209 26 % 517 397 30 %\nAverage daily volume of contracts traded (in\nthousands):\nEnergy futures and options 4,344 3,422 27 % 4,310 3,510 23 %\nAgricultural and metals futures and options 481 480 — 413 419 (1)\nFinancial futures and options 3,194 2,507 27 3,264 2,316 41\nTotal 8,019 6,409 25 % 7,987 6,245 28 %\nRate per contract:\nEnergy futures and options $ 1.71 $ 1.69 1 % $ 1.71 $ 1.74 (1)%\nAgricultural and metals futures and options $ 2.24 $ 2.32 (4)% $ 2.25 $ 2.31 (3)%\nFinancial futures and options $ 0.66 $ 0.71 (7)% $ 0.65 $ 0.74 (12)%\nOpen interest is the aggregate number of contracts (long or short) that clearing members hold either for their own account or on behalf of their\nclients. Open interest refers to the total number of contracts that are currently “open,” in other words, contracts that have been entered into but\nnot yet liquidated by either an offsetting trade, exercise, expiration or assignment. Open interest represents a measure that we believe is useful\nfor management and investors in understanding future activity remaining to be closed out in terms of the number of contracts that members and\ntheir clients continue to hold in the particular contract and by the number of contracts held for each contract month listed by the exchange.

These Section 31 fees are assessed to recover the government’s costs of\nsupervising and regulating the securities markets and professionals and are subject to change. We, in turn, collect corresponding activity\nassessment fees from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the equities and options exchanges, and recognize these amounts in\nour transaction and clearing revenues when invoiced. The activity assessment fees are designed to equal the Section 31 fees. As a result,\nactivity assessment fees and the corresponding Section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income, although the timing of\n46\npayment by us will vary from collections. Section 31 fees were $437 million and $231 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively, and $232 million and $56 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in\nSection 31 fees during the nine and three months ended months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in rates and\nvolume during the period. The fees we collect are included in cash at the time of receipt and we remit the amounts to the SEC twice a year as\nrequired. The total amount of Section 31 fees payable is included in current liabilities and was $76 million as of September 30, 2024.\nWe make liquidity payments to cash and options trading customers, as well as routing charges made to other exchanges which are included in\ntransaction-based expenses. We incur routing charges when we do not have the best bid or offer in the market for a security that a customer is\ntrying to buy or sell on one of our securities exchanges. In that case, we route the customer’s order to the external market center that displays\nthe best bid or offer. The external market center charges us a fee per share (denominated in tenths of a cent per share) for routing to its system.\nWe record routing charges on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. Cash liquidity payments, routing and\nclearing fees were $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $452 million and $370\nmillion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOperating Expenses, Operating Income and Operating Margin\nThe following chart summarizes our Exchanges segment's operating expenses, operating income and operating margin (dollars in millions). See\n“—Consolidated Operating Expenses” below for a discussion of the significant changes in our operating expenses.\nExchanges Segment: Nine Months Ended September 30, Three Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nOperating expenses $ 989 $ 944 5 % $ 307 $ 313 (2)%\nAdjusted operating expenses(1) $ 927 $ 878 6 % $ 309 $ 297 4 %\nOperating income $ 2,734 $ 2,360 16 % $ 947 $ 801 18 %\nAdjusted operating income(1) $ 2,796 $ 2,426 15 % $ 945 $ 817 16 %\nOperating margin 73 % 71 % 2 pts 76 % 72 % 4 pts\nAdjusted operating margin(1) 75 % 73 % 2 pts 75 % 73 % 2 pts\n(1) The adjusted figures exclude items that are not reflective of our ongoing core operations and business performance.

As the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the U.S.\nequivalent of revenues denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. Due to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro compared\nto the U.S. dollar, our Fixed Income and Data Services revenues were higher by $3 million and $2 million for the nine and three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, than the comparable periods in 2023.\nFixed Income and Data Services Revenues\nOur Fixed Income and Data Services revenues increased 3% and 5% for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,\nfrom the comparable periods in 2023, primarily due to strength in our fixed income data and analytics products and our other data and network\nservices.\n• Fixed Income Execution: Fixed income execution includes revenues from ICE Bonds. Execution fees are reported net of rebates, which\nwere nominal for both the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. Our fixed income execution revenues decreased\n5% and 2% for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from the comparable periods in 2023 as higher\nrevenues from corporate and municipal bond trading were more than offset by lower levels of U.S. treasury activity.\n• CDS Clearing: CDS clearing revenues decreased 4% and increased 3% for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, from the comparable periods in 2023. The notional value of CDS cleared was $15.7 trillion and $15.3 trillion for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $6.6 trillion and $5.0 trillion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively. The overall decrease in revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to lower net interest\nincome on collateral balances.\n• Fixed Income Data and Analytics: Our fixed income data and analytics revenues increased 5% and 6% for the nine and three months\nended September 30, 2024, respectively, from the comparable periods in 2023 due to growth in our pricing and reference data business and\nstrength in our index business.\n• Other Data and Network Services: Our other data and network services revenues increased 5% and 6% for the nine and three months\nended September 30, 2024, respectively, from the comparable periods in 2023, driven by growth in our ICE Global Network offering, coupled\nwith strength in our consolidated feeds and desktop revenues.\nAnnual Subscription Value, or ASV, represents, at a point in time, data services revenues, which include Fixed Income Data and Analytics as well\nas Other Data and Network Services, subscribed for the succeeding 12 months. ASV does not\n49\ninclude new sales, contract terminations or price changes that may occur during that 12-month period. However, while it is an indicative forward-\nlooking metric, it does not provide a precise growth forecast of the next 12 months of data services revenues. Management considers ASV\nmetrics when making financial and operating decisions and believes ASV is useful for management and investors in understanding our data\nservices business performance.\nAs of September 30, 2024, ASV was $1.831 billion, which increased 6.3% compared to the ASV as of September 30, 2023. ASV represents\nnearly 100% of total data services revenues for this segment. This does not adjust for year-over-year foreign exchange fluctuations.\nOperating Expenses, Operating Income and Operating Margin\nThe following chart summarizes our Fixed Income and Data Services segment's operating expenses, operating income and operating margin\n(dollars in millions).

Each revenue classification above contains a mix of recurring and\ntransaction revenues based on the various service offerings described in more detail below.\nMortgage Technology Revenues\nOur mortgage technology revenues are derived from our comprehensive, end-to-end U.S. residential mortgage platform. Our mortgage\ntechnology business is intended to enable greater workflow efficiency and mitigate risks for customers throughout the mortgage life cycle.\nMortgage technology revenues increased $699 million and $179 million for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,\nfrom the comparable periods in 2023, primarily due the Black Knight acquisition.\n• Origination technology: Our origination technology revenues increased 2% and 6% for the nine and three months ended September 30,\n2024, respectively, from the comparable periods in 2023. Our origination technology acts as a system of record for the mortgage transaction,\nautomating the gathering, reviewing, and verifying of mortgage-related information and enabling automated enforcement of rules and\nbusiness practices designed to help ensure that each completed loan transaction is of high quality and adheres to secondary market\nstandards. These revenues are based on recurring Software as a Service, or SaaS, subscription fees, with an additive transaction-based or\nsuccess-based pricing fee as lenders exceed the number of loans closed that are included with their monthly base subscription, as well as\nprofessional services.\nIn addition, the ICE Mortgage Technology network provides originators connectivity to the mortgage supply chain and facilitates the secure\nexchange of information between our customers and a broad ecosystem of third-party service providers, as well as lenders and investors\nthat are critical to consummating the millions of loan transactions that occur on our origination network each year. Revenue from the ICE\nMortgage Technology network is largely transaction-based.\n• Closing solutions: Our closing solutions revenues increased 10% and 12% during the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, from the comparable periods in 2023, driven by increased market share and continued adoption of digital solutions. Our closing\nsolutions connect key participants, such as lenders, title and settlement agents and individual county recorders, to digitize the closing and\nrecording process. Closing solutions also include revenues from our MERSCORP Holdings, Inc., or MERS, database, which provides a\nsystem of record for recording and tracking changes, servicing rights and beneficial ownership interests in loans secured by U.S. residential\nreal estate. Revenues from closing solutions are largely transaction-based and are based on the volume of loans closed.\n• Servicing software: Our servicing software revenues increased $566 million and $140 million during the nine and three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, from the comparable periods in 2023, due to the full period impact of Black Knight. Our servicing software\nrevenues include integrated mortgage servicing solutions, which help automate all areas of the servicing process, from loan boarding to final\npayment or default, to help lower costs, reduce\n52\nrisk and improve financial performance. Our servicing solutions support first lien mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit on a single\nplatform to manage all servicing processes, including loan setup and maintenance, escrow administration, investor reporting, and regulatory\nrequirements. We also provide solutions that provide consumers with access to customized, timely information about their mortgages and\nallow our clients’ customer service representatives to access the same customer information, which is key to increasing borrower retention.\nAnother servicing solution provides clients, third-party providers and their developers access to our growing catalog of application\nprogramming interfaces, or APIs, across the mortgage life cycle.\nOur default servicing solutions help simplify the complex process for loans that move into default, while supporting servicers with their\ncompliance requirements and to facilitate more efficient loss mitigation processes.\nWe also offer advanced technology to support the bankruptcy and foreclosure process, and more efficiently manage claims related to\nproperties in foreclosure, as well as tools to support loss analysis, to help servicers make the right decisions at the right time.\n• Data and analytics: Our Data and Analytics revenues increased 124% and 55% during the nine and three months ended September 30,\n2024, respectively, from the comparable periods in 2023, primarily due to the incremental revenue contribution from owning Black Knight\nduring the full nine and three months ended September 30, 2024. Revenues include those related to ICE Mortgage Technology’s Data &\nDocument Automation and Mortgage Analyzer solutions, or Analyzer, which offers customers greater efficiency by streamlining data\ncollection and validation through our automated document recognition and data extraction capabilities. Analyzer revenues can be both\nrecurring and transaction-based in nature. In addition, our data offerings include real-time industry and peer benchmarking tools, which\nprovide originators a granular view into the real-time trends of the U.S. residential mortgage market, as well as credit and prepayment\nmodels, custom and proprietary analytics, valuation, and MLS solutions. We also provide a Data as a Service, or DaaS, for lenders and\nindustry participants to access industry data and origination information. Revenues related to our data products are largely subscription-\nbased and recurring in nature. The data and insights from these solutions inform, support and enhance our other solutions to help lenders\nand servicers make more informed decisions, improve performance, identify and predict risk and generate more qualified leads. Revenues\nrelated to our data products are largely subscription-based and recurring in nature.\nOperating Expenses, Operating Income/(Loss) and Operating Margin\nThe following chart summarizes our Mortgage Technology segment's operating expenses, operating loss and operating margin (dollars in\nmillions).

Included in the total consolidated operating expenses for both the nine and three months\nended September 30, 2023 was $139 million related to Black Knight.\nOperating expenses of 7% and 8% for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 9% and 7% for the nine and\nthree months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, were billed in pounds sterling or euros. Due to fluctuations in the U.S. dollar compared to\nthe pound sterling and euro, our consolidated operating expenses were higher by $6 million and $2 million, respectively, for the nine and three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, than in the comparable periods in 2023.\nCompensation and Benefits Expenses\nCompensation and benefits expense is our most significant operating expense and includes non-capitalized employee wages, bonuses, non-\ncash or stock compensation, certain severance costs, benefits and employer taxes. The bonus and stock compensation components of our\ncompensation and benefits expense are based on both our financial performance and individual employee performance. Therefore, our\ncompensation and benefits expense will vary year-to-year based on our financial performance and fluctuations in our number of employees. The\nbelow chart summarizes the significant drivers of our compensation and benefits expense results for the periods presented (dollars in millions,\nexcept employee headcount).\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended September 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nEmployee headcount 12,900 13,107 (2)%\nStock-based compensation expenses $ 157 $ 133 18 % $ 53 $ 50 4 %\nEmployee headcount decreased from the comparable period in 2023 primarily due to headcount reductions at Black Knight in conjunction with\nrealizing synergies from the acquisition. Compensation and benefits expense increased $319 million and $87 million for the nine and three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from the comparable periods in 2023, primarily due to $279 million and $69 million incremental\nexpense attributable to owning Black Knight for the full nine and three months ended September 30, 2024 periods, respectively, and higher\npayroll and bonus from the impact of merit increases, partially offset by higher capitalized labor. The stock-based compensation expenses in the\ntable above relate to employee stock option and restricted stock awards and exclude stock-based compensation related to acquisition-related\ntransaction and integration costs.\nProfessional Services Expenses\nProfessional services expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives, temporary labor, as well as\nregulatory, legal and accounting fees, and may fluctuate as a result of changes in our use of these services in our business.\nProfessional services expenses increased $26 million and $9 million for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,\nfrom the comparable periods in 2023, primarily due to the incremental expense from owning Black Knight for the full nine and three months\nended September 30, 2024 combined with increases in NYSE regulatory consulting and general legal matter expenses.\nAcquisition-Related Transaction and Integration Costs\nWe incurred $88 million and $37 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs during the nine and three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, primarily due to integration expenses related to Black Knight. We incurred $201 million and $155 million in\nacquisition-related transaction and integration costs during the nine and three months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, primarily due to\nlegal, banker, consulting and integration expenses related to our acquisition and integration of Black Knight and our integration of Ellie Mae.\nWe expect to continue to explore and pursue various potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive\nposition and support our growth. As a result, we may incur acquisition-related transaction costs in future periods.\nTechnology and Communication Expenses\nTechnology support services consist of costs for running our wholly-owned data centers, hosting costs paid to third-party data centers and\nmaintenance of our computer hardware and software required to support our technology and\n55\ncybersecurity. These costs are driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. Communication expenses consist of costs\nor network connections for our electronic platforms and telecommunications costs.\nTechnology and communications expense also includes fees paid for access to external market data, licensing and other fee agreement\nexpenses. Technology and communications expenses may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume, our capacity requirements,\nchanges in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections with customers to access our electronic platforms directly.\nTechnology and communications expenses increased $102 million and $28 million for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, from the comparable periods in 2023 primarily due to hardware and software support costs and data services expenses mainly at\nBlack Knight, combined with rising revenues on certain products causing an increase in our revenue share license expenses.\nRent and Occupancy Expenses\nRent and occupancy expense relates to leased and owned property and includes rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related\ncosts. We have significant operations located in the U.S., U.K., and India, with smaller offices located throughout the world.\nRent and occupancy expenses increased $24 million and $10 million for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,\nfrom the comparable periods in 2023 primarily due to duplicate rent expenses related to our new London and New York leased offices incurred\nduring the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024 and increases attributable to Black Knight locations.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include marketing, advertising, public relations, insurance, bank service charges, dues and\nsubscriptions, travel and entertainment, non-income taxes and other general and administrative costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $36 million and decreased $5 million for the nine and three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, from the comparable periods in 2023.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase was primarily due to $20 million attributable to incremental expense from owning\nBlack Knight for the full nine-month period and increases in other underlying costs, including customer acquisition costs from higher IPO activity,\nmarketing, travel and entertainment. The year-to-date period also included $10 million of expense for valid claims made following an equity\ntrading issue at NYSE that occurred in June 2024, which is net of insurance proceeds, and a $10 million accrual related to a regulatory matter.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we also recorded $6 million of expense for claims made following a NYSE system outage in\nJanuary 2023 and an $11 million regulatory matter expense, as well as higher credit loss expense.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease was primarily due to lower underlying costs, including marketing costs, and $20\nmillion of insurance proceeds received in the quarter related to the valid claims made following an equity trading issue at NYSE. This was\npartially offset by a $10 million accrual related to a regulatory matter and $7 million attributable to owning Black Knight for the full three-month\nperiod.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nDepreciation and amortization expense results from depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, aircraft,\nhardware and networking equipment, purchased software, internally-developed software, furniture, fixtures and equipment over their estimated\nuseful lives. This expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of businesses over their estimated useful lives.\nIntangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships, technology, data & databases and trademarks & trade\nnames.\nWe recorded amortization expenses on intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisitions, as well as on other intangible assets of\n$759 million, inclusive of a $3 million impairment of a developed technology intangible asset, and $492 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $253 million and $191 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. During the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, $319 million and $107 million, respectively, of amortization expense\nwas related to intangible assets acquired in connection with the Black Knight acquisition, as compared to $34 million during the nine and three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023.\nWe recorded depreciation expenses on our fixed assets of $389 million and $344 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively, and $133 million and $118 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This increase was\nprimarily due to $26 million and $10 million related to Black Knight for the\n56\nnine and three months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to $2 million during the nine and three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, and increases in internally developed software assets and leasehold improvements.\nConsolidated Non-Operating Income/(Expense)\nIncome and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating. The following tables present our\nnon-operating income/(expenses) (dollars in millions):\nNine Months Ended Three Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 Change* 2024 2023 Change\nOther income/(expense):\nInterest income $ 105 $ 287 (63)% $ 39 $ 94 (58)%\nInterest expense (697) (557) 25 (223) (206) 8\nOther income/(expense), net 83 (121) n/a (21) (51) (58)\nTotal other income/(expense), net $ (509) $ (391) 30 % $ (205) $ (163) 26 %\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest $ (37) $ (53) (30)% $ (14) $ (18) (23)%\n*Percentage changes in the table above deemed \"n/a\" are not meaningful.\nInterest Income\nDuring the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, we earned interest income of $105 million and $39 million respectively. During the\nnine and three months ended September 30, 2023, we earned interest income of $287 million and $94 million, respectively. Interest income\ndecreased during the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, from the same periods in 2023 primarily due to decreased investment\nbalances following the Black Knight acquisition. During the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, we earned $11 million and $7\nmillion, respectively, in interest income on short term investments related to $500 million of the net proceeds from the 2031 Notes which we\nintend to use to repay a portion of the aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes at their maturity. For the nine and three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, we earned $213 million and $66 million, respectively, in interest income on the short term investments related to the\n$5.0 billion of senior notes issued in connection with, and the operating cash accumulated for, the Black Knight acquisition. In addition, our\nclearing houses earned interest income of $72 million and $25 million during the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, and $63 million and $25 million during the nine and three months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The remainder primarily\nrelates to interest earned on various unrestricted and restricted cash balances held within our group entities.\nInterest Expense\nDuring the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred interest expense of $697 million and $223 million, respectively.\nDuring the nine and three months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred interest expense of $557 million and $206 million, respectively. The\nincrease in interest expense during the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, from the comparable periods in 2023 primarily relates\nto increased borrowings raised to fund the Black Knight acquisition. Interest expense incurred on our senior notes was $569 million and $194\nmillion during the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and $532 million and $189 million during the nine and three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Interest expense incurred on borrowings under our Commercial Paper program and Term Loan\n(each as defined in “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Debt”) during the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, was $117 million\nand $26 million, respectively, and $14 million during the nine and three months ended September 30, 2023. The remainder primarily relates to\nthe interest incurred on maintaining the revolving credit facility and other facilities within our group entities.\nOther Income/(Expense), net\nOur equity method investments include OCC and Bakkt, among others. We recognized $63 million and $91 million during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $18 million and $26 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, of our share of estimated equity method investment losses, net, which are included in other income/(expense), net. The estimated\nlosses for both the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are primarily related to our investment in Bakkt, partially offset\nby our share of net profits of OCC. Both the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 include adjustments to reflect the\ndifference between reported prior period actual results from our original estimates.\n57\nFor our equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values, during the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, we\nrecorded a $1 million fair value loss and a $2 million fair value gain, respectively, on our investments related to an impairment and identifying an\nobservable price change in one of our investments.\nIn connection with our acquisition of Black Knight, we acquired an investment in Dun & Bradstreet. During the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, we sold 51% of our investment for $97 million and recorded a loss on the sale of $1 million, a fair value loss of $7 million\nand a $1 million dividend, all of which are included as other expense, net.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a gain of $160 million related to the PennyMac arbitration final award payment.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded an impairment related to our Consolidated Audit Trail, or CAT, loan receivable\nof $16 million.\nWe incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $12 million and $8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, and $5 million and $3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily attributable to the\nfluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in other\nincome/(expense), net, when the settlement of foreign currency assets, liabilities and payables occur in non-functional currencies and there is an\nincrease or decrease in the period-end foreign currency exchange rates between periods.\nNon-controlling Interest\nFor consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100%, and for which we have control over the assets, liabilities and\nmanagement of the entity, the outside stockholders’ interests are shown as non-controlling interests. As of September 30, 2024, our non-\ncontrolling interests included those related to the non-ICE limited partners' interest in our CDS clearing subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\nin ICE Futures Abu Dhabi.\nConsolidated Income Tax Provision\nConsolidated income tax expense was $630 million and $330 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and\n$227 million and $123 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in consolidated income tax\nexpense between periods was primarily due to the tax impact of changes in our pre-tax income and the changes in our effective tax rate each\nperiod.\nOur effective tax rate was 23% and 14% during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 25% and 18% during\nthe three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rates for the nine and three months ended September 30,\n2024 were higher than the effective tax rates for the comparable periods in 2023 primarily due to tax benefits resulting from favorable audit\nsettlements and state apportionment changes in the prior periods and the U.K. corporate income tax rate increase to 25% effective for the full\nyear in 2024.\nThe OECD Pillar Two minimum tax rules, which generally provide for a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, are intended to apply to tax years\nbeginning in 2024. The European Union member states and many other countries, including the U.K., our most significant non-U.S. jurisdiction,\nhave committed to implement or have already enacted legislation adopting the Pillar Two rules. In July 2023, the U.K. enacted the U.K. Finance\nAct 2023, effective as of January 1, 2024, which included provisions to implement certain portions of the Pillar Two minimum tax rules and\nincluded an election to apply a transitional safe harbor to extend certain effective dates to accounting periods ending on or before June 30, 2028.\nThese new U.K. Pillar Two rules did not have a material impact on our income tax provision as of September 30, 2024.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Impact\nAs an international business, our financial statements are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our exposure to foreign\ndenominated earnings for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024 is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table\n(dollars in millions, except exchange rates):\n58\nNine Months Ended September Three Months Ended September\n30, 2024 30, 2024\nPound Sterling Euro Pound Sterling Euro\nAverage exchange rate to the U.S. dollar in the current year period 1.2771 1.0872 1.3007 1.0991\nAverage exchange rate to the U.S. dollar in the same period in the prior year 1.2444 1.0835 1.2660 1.0881\nAverage exchange rate increase/(decrease) 3 % — % 3 % 1 %\nForeign denominated percentage of:\nRevenues, less transaction-based expenses 7 % 8 % 7 % 7 %\nOperating expenses 6 % 1 % 7 % 1 %\nOperating income 8 % 15 % 7 % 14 %\nImpact of the currency fluctuations(1) on:\nRevenues, less transaction-based expenses $ 12 $ 2 $ 4 $ 2\nOperating expenses $ 6 $ — $ 2 $ —\nOperating income $ 6 $ 2 $ 2 $ 2\n(1) Represents the impact of currency fluctuation for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in the prior year.\nDuring the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 15% and 14% of our consolidated revenues, less transaction-based\nexpenses, respectively, were denominated in pounds sterling or euros. During the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\n7% and 8% of our consolidated operating expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros. As the pound sterling or euro exchange rate\nchanges, the U.S. equivalent of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly.\n59\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nBelow are charts that reflect our outstanding debt and capital allocation. The acquisition and integration costs in the chart below include cash\npaid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired and cash received for divestitures, cash paid for equity and equity method investments and\nacquisition-related transaction and integration costs in each period.\n(1) YTD 2023 acquisition and integration costs, net of divestitures, excludes $90 million from the sale of our investment in Dun & Bradstreet.\nWe have financed our operations, growth and cash needs primarily through income from operations and borrowings under our various debt\nfacilities. Our principal capital requirements have been to fund capital expenditures, working capital, strategic acquisitions and investments, stock\nrepurchases, dividends and the development of our technology platforms. We believe that our cash on hand and cash flows from operations will\nbe sufficient to repay our outstanding debt, but we may also need to incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities in the future. See “-\nFuture Capital Requirements” below.\nSee “– Cash Flow” below for a discussion of our capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs.\nConsolidated cash and cash equivalents were $755 million and $899 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nWe had $1.6 billion and $871 million in short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively. We had $500 million and $680 million in short-term restricted investments as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively. We had $78.8 billion and $79.0 billion of cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty funds as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the amount of unrestricted cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries was $364 million. Due to the application of Global\nIntangible Low-Taxed Income as of January 1, 2018, the majority of our foreign earnings as of December 31, 2022 have been subject to\nimmediate U.S. income taxation and can be distributed to the U.S. in the future with no material additional U.S. income tax consequences. We\nintend to apply the high tax exception to Global Intangible\n60\nLow-Taxed Income in 2023 and 2024, thus the majority of our foreign earnings in 2023 and 2024 are not expected to be subject to immediate\nU.S. income taxation. These foreign earnings can also generally be distributed to the U.S. with no additional material U.S. income tax\nconsequences, primarily due to the availability of dividend received deductions.\nOur cash and cash equivalents and financial investments are managed as a global treasury portfolio of non-speculative financial instruments that\nare readily convertible into cash, such as overnight deposits, term deposits, money market funds, mutual funds for treasury investments, short\nduration fixed income investments and other money market instruments, thus ensuring high liquidity of financial assets. We may invest a portion\nof our cash in excess of short-term operating needs in investment-grade marketable debt securities, including government or government-\nsponsored agencies and corporate debt securities.\nCash Flow\nThe following table presents the major components of net changes in cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents (in\nmillions):\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nNet cash provided by/(used in):\nOperating activities $ 3,103 $ 2,573\nInvesting activities (1) (9,403)\nFinancing activities (2,717) (62,711)\nEffect of exchange rate changes 7 (7)\nNet increase/(decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, and cash and\ncash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty funds $ 392 $ (69,548)\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities primarily consists of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and\namortization, deferred taxes, stock-based compensation and the effects of changes in working capital.\nThe $530 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the comparable\nperiod in 2023 was primarily driven by the following:\n• An increase in net income, excluding depreciation and amortization, of $357 million which is primarily related to the full period impact of\nthe Black Knight acquisition.\n• An increase in changes in working capital accounts of $159 million, including the following:\n◦ A change of $201 million related to the timing of the Section 31 fee rate changes and payments; and\n◦ A net decrease of $42 million related to changes in other underlying working capital accounts, primarily due to timing of\npayments and cash receipts.\nInvesting Activities\nThe $9.4 billion decrease in cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the comparable period in\n2023 was primarily driven by the following:\n• A decrease in cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $10.2 billion primarily related to the Black Knight acquisition in\nSeptember 2023;\n• We had net proceeds from our restricted investments of $202 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to\nnet purchases of $956 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net purchases of $956 million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2023 primarily consisted of short-term restricted investments purchased by ICE Clear Europe for regulatory capital\nrequirements of which $680 million matured during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This was offset by the $500 million of\nnet proceeds from the offering of the 2031 Notes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that have been invested and will be\nused to pay the senior notes maturing in May 2025;\n• We received $75 million from the sale of the Promissory Note during the nine months ended September 30, 2024;\n• Capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs increased $150 million driven by full period Black Knight activity\ncombined with leasehold improvements and build out of our new offices and one of our existing data centers;\n61\n• During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had purchases of equity and equity method investments of $24 million as\ncompared to net proceeds of $90 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net proceeds were due to the sale of\nour Dun & Bradstreet investment for $97 million partially offset by equity investment purchases; and\n• During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net proceeds of $230 million from the invested margin deposit activity\ncompared to net proceeds of $2.0 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These amounts fluctuate based on\nclearinghouse treasury investment activity related to collateral and liquidity management.\nFinancing Activities\nThe $60.0 billion decrease in cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the comparable period in\n2023 was primarily driven by the following:\n• The change in cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty fund liability decreased $64.3 billion due to reduced volatility\nfrom 2022 to 2023 which impacted the prior year change;\n• During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net repayments of debt of $861 million, primarily due to the repayment of\nthe Term Loan, partially offset by the issuance of the 2031 Notes. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had net\nproceeds from debt issuance of $514 million, primarily due to funding of the Black Knight acquisition;\n• During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net redemptions of commercial paper of $583 million as compared to net\nproceeds of $1.9 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our commercial paper issuances and subsequent\nredemptions were related to financing the Black Knight acquisition; and\n• Dividends paid to stockholders increased $67 million primarily due to the increase in the dividend per share for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nDebt\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $21.2 billion in outstanding debt, consisting of $19.8 billion of unsecured senior notes and $1.4 billion under\nour Commercial Paper Program. Our senior notes of $19.8 billion have a weighted average to maturity of 14 years and a weighted average cost\nof 3.7% per annum. Our commercial paper notes had original maturities ranging from 1 to 28 days as of September 30, 2024, with a weighted\naverage interest rate of 5.2% per annum and a weighted average remaining maturity of 19 days.\nWe have a $3.9 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the Credit Facility, with a maturity date of May 31, 2029. As of September 30,\n2024, of the $3.9 billion that was available for borrowing under the Credit Facility, $1.4 billion was required to back-stop the amount outstanding\nunder our U.S. dollar commercial paper program, or the Commercial Paper Program, and $172 million was required to support certain broker-\ndealer and other subsidiary commitments. The remaining $2.4 billion is available for working capital and general corporate purposes including,\nbut not limited to, acting as a backstop to future increases in the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program.\nWe previously had a $2.4 billion two-year senior unsecured delayed draw term loan facility, or the Term Loan, with a maturity date of August 31,\n2025. We borrowed the Term Loan in full on August 31, 2023 in connection with the Black Knight acquisition, and during the three months ended\nJune 30, 2024, we fully repaid the amounts borrowed under the Term Loan.\nOur Commercial Paper Program enables us to borrow efficiently at reasonable short-term interest rates and provides us with the flexibility to de-\nlever using our strong annual cash flows from operating activities whenever our leverage becomes elevated as a result of investment or\nacquisition activities.\nUpon maturity of our commercial paper and to the extent old issuances are not repaid by cash on hand, we are exposed to the rollover risk of not\nbeing able to issue new commercial paper. To mitigate this risk, we maintain the Credit Facility for an aggregate amount which meets or exceeds\nthe amount issued under our Commercial Paper Program at any time. If we were not able to issue new commercial paper, we have the option of\ndrawing on the backstop revolving facility. However, electing to do so would result in higher interest expense.\n62\nOn February 20, 2024, we commenced a consent solicitation with respect to the outstanding notes of a subsidiary of Black Knight, or the Black\nKnight Notes, pursuant to which we solicited consents from eligible holders to amend the Black Knight Notes and the related indenture, under\nwhich they were issued to eliminate certain of the covenants, restrictive provisions and events of default from such indenture. The consent\nsolicitation expired February 28, 2024, at which time the requisite majority of consents had been received. On February 29, 2024, we paid the\nconsenting holders aggregate cash consideration of $2.5 million and the amendment to eliminate the covenant to furnish certain reports,\ndocuments and information to holders of the Black Knight notes and the trustee under the indenture governing the Black Knight Notes took\neffect. On June 5, 2024, we completed a private offer to exchange 99.75% of the $1 billion aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Black\nKnight Notes for new senior notes issued by ICE, or the ICE Original Exchange Notes, and the remaining amendments took effect at that time.\nOn September 10, 2024, we completed a registered exchange offer in which virtually all previously outstanding ICE Original Exchange Notes\nwere exchanged for identical new senior notes that were registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and thereby became freely transferable,\nsubject to certain restrictions applicable to affiliates and broker dealers.\nOn May 13, 2024, we issued $750 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due 2031, or the 2031 Notes. We intend to use\n$500 million of the net proceeds from the offering of the 2031 Notes to repay a portion of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes\nmaturing in May 2025, or the 2025 Notes. The net proceeds intended to repay the 2025 Notes have been invested and recorded as short-term\nrestricted investments in our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. We used the remaining net proceeds to assist with the\nrepayments of the outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan.\nFor additional details of our debt instruments, refer to Note 8 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements, included in this Quarterly\nReport, and Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2023 Form 10-K.\nCapital Return\nIn December 2021, our Board approved an aggregate of $3.15 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date\nthat became effective January 1, 2022. The approval of our Board for stock repurchases does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of\nour common stock. In addition, our Board may increase or decrease the amount available for repurchases from time to time. Shares\nrepurchased are held in treasury stock.\nIn December 2021, we entered into a Rule 10b5-1trading plan that became effective in February 2022. In connection with our acquisition of\nBlack Knight, on May 4, 2022, we terminated our Rule 10b5-1 trading plan and suspended share repurchases. Therefore, we did not have any\nshare repurchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. The remaining balance of Board approved funds for future\nrepurchases as of September 30, 2024 was $2.5 billion.\nWe may begin or discontinue stock repurchases at any time and may enter into, amend or terminate a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan at any time,\nsubject to applicable rules. From time to time, we have entered, and in the future may enter, into Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, as authorized by our\nBoard, to govern some or all of the repurchases of our shares of common stock. We expect funding for any stock repurchases to come from our\noperating cash flow or borrowings under our Commercial Paper Program or our debt facilities. The timing and extent of future repurchases that\nare not made pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan will be at our discretion and will depend upon many conditions. In making a determination\nregarding any stock repurchases, management considers multiple factors, including overall stock market conditions, our common stock price\nperformance, the remaining amount authorized for repurchases by our Board, the potential impact of a stock repurchase program on our\ncorporate debt ratings, our expected free cash flow and working capital needs, our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives, and\nother potential uses of our cash and capital resources.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.45 per share of our common stock for an aggregate\npayout of $261 million, which includes the payment of dividend equivalents on unvested employee restricted stock units.\nFuture Capital Requirements\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of growth across our segments, strategic plans and acquisitions,\navailable sources for financing activities, required and discretionary technology and clearing initiatives, regulatory requirements, the timing and\nintroduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, the geographic mix of our business and potential stock repurchases.\nWe currently expect to incur capital expenditures (including operational and real estate capital expenditures) and to incur software development\ncosts that are eligible for capitalization ranging in the aggregate between $700 million and $740 million in 2024, which we believe will support the\nenhancement of our technology, business integration and the continued growth of our businesses.\n63\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $2.5 billion authorized for future repurchases of our common stock. We may resume repurchases of our\ncommon stock, subject to achieving certain debt leverage ratio targets. Refer to Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this\nQuarterly Report for additional details on our stock repurchase program.\nOur Board has adopted a quarterly dividend policy providing that dividends will be approved quarterly by the Board or the Audit Committee\ntaking into account factors such as our evolving business model, prevailing business conditions, our current and future planned strategic growth\ninitiatives and our financial results and capital requirements, without a predetermined net income payout ratio. On October 31, 2024, we\nannounced a $0.45 per share dividend for the fourth quarter of 2024 with the dividend payable on December 31, 2024 to stockholders of record\nas of December 16, 2024.\nOther than the facilities for the ICE Clearing Houses, our Credit Facility and our Commercial Paper Program are currently the only significant\nagreements or arrangements that we have for liquidity and capital resources with third parties. See Notes 8 and 12 to our consolidated financial\nstatements included in this Quarterly Report for further discussion. In the event of any strategic acquisitions, mergers or investments, or if we are\nrequired to raise capital for any reason or desire to return capital to our stockholders, we may incur additional debt, issue additional equity to\nraise necessary funds, repurchase additional shares of our common stock or pay a dividend. However, we cannot provide assurance that such\nfinancing or transactions will be favorable to us. See “—Debt\" above.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use certain financial measures internally to evaluate our performance and make financial and operational decisions that are presented in a\nmanner that adjusts from their equivalent GAAP measures or that supplement the information provided by our GAAP measures. We use these\nadjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely\non GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core\noperating performance.\nWe use these measures in communicating certain aspects of our results and performance, including in this Quarterly Report, and believe that\nthese measures, when viewed in conjunction with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, can provide investors with greater\ntransparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than GAAP measures alone. In\naddition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for making period-to-period comparisons of results because the\nadjustments to GAAP are not reflective of our core business performance.\nThese financial measures are not presented in accordance with, or as an alternative to, GAAP financial measures and may be different from\nnon-GAAP measures used by other companies. We encourage investors to review the GAAP financial measures included in this Quarterly\nReport, including our consolidated financial statements, to aid in their analysis and understanding of our performance and in making\ncomparisons.\nThe tables below outline our adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income\nattributable to ICE common stockholders, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which are non-GAAP measures that are calculated by making\nadjustments for items we view as not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. These measures, including the\nadjustments and their related income tax effect and other tax adjustments (in millions, except for percentages and per share amounts), are as\nfollows:\n64\nFixed Income and Data Mortgage Technology\nExchanges Segment Services Segment Segment Consolidated\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nOperating income adjustments: 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023\nTotal revenues, less transaction-based expenses $ 3,723 $ 3,304 $ 1,719 $ 1,668 $ 1,514 $ 815 $ 6,956 $ 5,787\nOperating expenses 989 944 1,087 1,057 1,648 1,017 3,724 3,018\nLess: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 51 49 114 127 593 316 758 492\nLess: Transaction and integration costs — — — — 88 201 88 201\nLess: Regulatory matter — 11 10 — — — 10 11\nLess: Other 11 6 20 — — — 31 6\nAdjusted operating expenses $ 927 $ 878 $ 943 $ 930 $ 967 $ 500 $ 2,837 $ 2,308\nOperating income/(loss) $ 2,734 $ 2,360 $ 632 $ 611 $ (134) $ (202) $ 3,232 $ 2,769\nAdjusted operating income $ 2,796 $ 2,426 $ 776 $ 738 $ 547 $ 315 $ 4,119 $ 3,479\nOperating margin 73 % 71 % 37 % 37 % (9)% (25)% 46 % 48 %\nAdjusted operating margin 75 % 73 % 45 % 44 % 36 % 39 % 59 % 60 %\nNon-operating income adjustments:\nNet income attributable to ICE common stockholders $ 2,056 $ 1,995\nAdd: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 758 492\nAdd: Transaction and integration costs 88 201\n(Less)/Add: Litigation and regulatory matters (150) 11\nAdd: Net losses from unconsolidated investees 63 91\nAdd: Loss on sale and fair value adjustments of equity investments and 1 7\ndividends received\nLess: Net interest income on pre-acquisition-related debt — (12)\nAdd: Other 31 22\nLess: Income tax effect for the above items (199) (178)\nLess: Deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles (26) (131)\nLess: Other tax adjustments — (81)\nAdjusted net income attributable to ICE common stockholders $ 2,622 $ 2,417\nDiluted earnings per share attributable to ICE common stockholders $ 3.57 $ 3.55\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE common stockholders $ 4.55 $ 4.30\nDiluted weighted average common shares outstanding 576 562\n65\nFixed Income and Data Mortgage Technology\nExchanges Segment Services Segment Segment Consolidated\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nOperating income adjustments: 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023\nTotal revenues, less transaction-based expenses $ 1,254 $ 1,114 $ 586 $ 559 $ 509 $ 330 $ 2,349 $ 2,003\nOperating expenses 307 313 376 358 563 487 1,246 1,158\nLess: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 17 16 37 42 198 133 252 191\nLess: Transaction and integration costs — — — — 37 155 37 155\nLess: Regulatory matter — — 10 — — — 10 —\nLess/(Add): Other (19) — 6 — — — (13) —\nAdjusted operating expenses $ 309 $ 297 $ 323 $ 316 $ 328 $ 199 $ 960 $ 812\nOperating income/(loss) $ 947 $ 801 $ 210 $ 201 $ (54) $ (157) $ 1,103 $ 845\nAdjusted operating income $ 945 $ 817 $ 263 $ 243 $ 181 $ 131 $ 1,389 $ 1,191\nOperating margin 76 % 72 % 36 % 36 % (11)% (48)% 47 % 42 %\nAdjusted operating margin 75 % 73 % 45 % 44 % 35 % 39 % 59 % 59 %\nNon-operating income adjustments:\nNet income attributable to ICE common stockholders $ 657 $ 541\nAdd: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 252 191\nAdd: Transaction and integration costs 37 155\nAdd: Regulatory matter 10 —\nAdd: Net losses from unconsolidated investees 18 26\n(Less)/Add: Loss on sale and fair value adjustments of equity investments and (2) 7\ndividends received\n(Less)/Add: Other (13) 16\nLess: Income tax effect for the above items (74) (66)\nAdd/(Less): Deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles 9 (46)\nAdjusted net income attributable to ICE common stockholders $ 894 $ 824\nDiluted earnings per share attributable to ICE common stockholders $ 1.14 $ 0.96\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE common stockholders $ 1.55 $ 1.46\nDiluted weighted average common shares outstanding 577 565\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangibles are included in non-GAAP adjustments as excluding these non-cash expenses provides greater\nclarity regarding our financial strength and stability of cash operating results. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, included in\namortization of acquisition-related intangibles is $3 million of impairment related to developed technology within our Exchanges Segment.\nTransaction and integration costs are included as part of our core business expenses, except for those that are directly related to the\nannouncement, closing, financing, or termination of a transaction. However, we adjust for the acquisition-related transaction and integration\ncosts for acquisitions such as Black Knight and Ellie Mae given the magnitude of the $11.8 billion and $11.4 billion, respectively, purchase prices\nof the acquisitions.\nLitigation and regulatory matters during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 include the $160 million gain related to the PennyMac\narbitration award resolution and payment received and a regulatory accrual of $10 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nLitigation and regulatory matters during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 include an accrual related to a regulatory settlement of $11\nmillion. We do not consider events of this type to be reflective of our core business.\nWe adjust for our share of net gains/(losses) related to our equity method investments, which primarily include OCC and Bakkt. In addition,\nduring the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, we excluded a $1 million fair value loss and a $2 million fair value gain,\nrespectively, on our equity investments without readily determinable fair values related to an impairment and identifying an observable price\nchange in one of our investments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we excluded the combined loss of $7 million related to\nour fair value adjustment and sale of our investment in Dun & Bradstreet, net of dividends. We believe these adjustments provide greater clarity\nof our performance, given that equity and equity method investments are non-cash and not a part of our core operations.\n66\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we excluded $12 million of net interest income on interest earned on investments from the\npre-acquisition debt proceeds, net of interest expense on pre-acquisition-related debt from our May 2022 debt refinancing related to the Black\nKnight acquisition.\nOther adjustments not considered to be a part of our core business operations include:\n• Duplicate rent expense of $21 million and $7 million incurred during the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,\nrelated to our new London and New York leased offices. We took possession of the new London and New York leases during the fourth\nquarter of 2023 and first quarter 2024, respectively. The London office transition is complete, and we expect the transition to our new\nNew York space to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2024. We view these duplicate non-cash rent expenses of the new offices\nduring the transition to be incremental, non-recurring, and not related to our normal operations.\n• During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net $10 million of expense for valid claims made following an equity trading issue at\nNYSE that occurred in June 2024. This includes $30 million of expense for valid claims accrued as of June 30, 2024, net of $20 million\nin insurance proceeds received during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n• During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, $6 million of expense for claims made following a NYSE system outage that\noccurred in January 2023 and an impairment related to our consolidated audit trail, or CAT, loan receivable of $16 million.\nNon-GAAP tax adjustments include the tax impacts of the pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments, deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related\nintangibles, and other tax adjustments. The deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles include a benefit of $26 million and an\nexpense of $9 million for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and a benefit of $131 million and $46 million for\nthe nine and three months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, are primarily related to U.S. state apportionment changes. Other tax\nadjustments include a net benefit of $81 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily related to audit settlements for pre-\nacquisition tax matters as well as state apportionment changes in prior years.\nNon-GAAP Liquidity Measures\nWe consider free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow to be non-GAAP liquidity measures that provide useful information to management and\ninvestors to analyze cash resources generated from our operations. We believe that free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow are also useful\nwhen comparing our performance to that of our competitors, and demonstrates our ability to convert the reinvestment of capital expenditures and\ncapitalized software development costs required to maintain and grow our business, as well as adjust for timing differences related to the\npayment of section 31 fees. These non-GAAP liquidity measures are not presented in accordance with, or as an alternative to, GAAP liquidity\nmeasures and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow, including the\nrelated adjustments are as follows (in millions):\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 3,103 $ 2,573\nLess: Capital expenditures (212) (104)\nLess: Capitalized software development costs (264) (222)\nFree cash flow 2,627 2,247\nAdd: Section 31 fees 4 205\nAdjusted free cash flow $ 2,631 $ 2,452\nFor additional information on these items, refer to our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report and “—Consolidated\nOperating Expenses” above.\n67\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs described in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, certain clearing house\ncollateral is reported off-balance sheet. We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to\nas structured finance or special purpose entities.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into a 15 year lease in New York City resulting in an initial net lease liability of\n$71 million. Other than this lease, there were no significant changes to our contractual obligations and commercial commitments from those\ndisclosed in the section “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2023 Form 10-K.\nNew and Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to the new and recently adopted accounting\npronouncements applicable to us from those disclosed in Note 2 of our 2023 Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from\nthose disclosed in the section “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2023 Form 10-K.\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nAs a result of our operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate\nrisk and credit risk. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are\nregularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies. There have been no material changes to the Company’s exposure\nto market risks from those disclosed in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2023 Form 10-K.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out by our\nmanagement, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer\nand Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this\nreport.\n(b) Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred\nduring our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial\nreporting.\nPART II. Other Information\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nSee Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements and related notes, which is incorporated by reference herein.\nITEM 1(A). RISK FACTORS\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant new risk factors from those disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk\nFactors\" in our 2023 Form 10-K. In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, including the information in the \"—\nRegulation\" section of Item 2 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, you should carefully\nconsider the factors discussed under “Risk Factors” and the regulation discussion under “Business—Regulation” in our 2023 Form 10-K. These\nrisks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The risks and uncertainties in our 2023\nForm 10-K are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently believe to be\nimmaterial, may also adversely affect our business.\n68\nITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\nStock Repurchases\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no purchases made by or on behalf of ICE or any “affiliated purchaser” (as\ndefined in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Exchange Act) of our common stock.\nRefer to Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, for details on\nour stock repurchase program.\nITEM 3.

Statements regarding ICE’s business that are not historical facts are forward-\nlooking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Although we believe the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, these statements are not guarantees of\nfuture results, performance, levels of activity or achievements, and actual results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement. The factors that might affect our performance include, but are not\nlimited to: conditions in global financial markets, domestic and international economic and social conditions, inflation, risk of recession, interest rate changes, political uncertainty and discord, geopolitical events or conflicts and international\ntrade policies and sanctions laws; global political conditions, including elections in the United States; introduction of or any changes in domestic and foreign laws, regulations, rules or government policy with respect to financial markets,\nclimate change or our businesses generally, including increased regulatory scrutiny or enforcement actions and our ability to comply with these requirements; volatility in commodity markets, equity prices and price volatility of financial\nbenchmarks and instruments such as interest rates, credit spreads, equity indices, foreign exchange rates, and mortgage industry trends; impact of climate change and the transition to renewable energy; our business environment and\nindustry trends, including trading volumes, prevalence of clearing, demand for data services, mortgage lending and servicing activity, mortgage delinquencies, fees, changing regulations, competition and consolidation; the success of our\nclearing houses and our ability to minimize the risks associated with operating multiple clearing houses in multiple jurisdictions; our ability to minimize risks related to owning and operating cash equity and options exchanges, the success\nof our exchanges and clearing houses and their compliance with regulatory and oversight responsibilities; the impacts of computer and communication systems failures and delays, inclusive of the performance and reliability of our trading,\nclearing, data services and mortgage technologies and those of third-party service providers; the resilience of our electronic platforms and soundness of our business continuity and disaster recovery plans; our ability to execute our growth\nstrategy and maintain our growth effectively; our ability to realize the anticipated cost savings, growth opportunities, synergies and other benefits anticipated from our acquisitions, including our acquisition of Black Knight, Inc.; our ability to\nremain in compliance with the Federal Trade Commission consent order to resolve antitrust concerns regarding our acquisition of Black Knight, Inc.; our ability to realize anticipated growth opportunities or expected benefits of our strategic\ninvestments, including our majority investment in Bakkt and the additional risk that its evolving business model may pose to our business; requirements to recognize impairments of our goodwill, other intangible assets or investments; our\nability to minimize the impacts of an interruption or cessation of an important service, data or content supplied by a third party; our ability to keep pace with technological developments and client preferences; our ability to successfully offer\nnew products and technologies and identify opportunities to leverage our risk management capabilities and enhance our technology in a timely and cost-effective manner; our ability to ensure that the technology we utilize is not vulnerable\nto cyber-attacks, hacking and other cybersecurity risks; our ability to keep information and data relating to the customers of the users of the software and services provided by our ICE Mortgage Technology business confidential; impacts of\npandemics or other public health emergencies, including the emergence of new COVID-19 variants, on our business as well as on the broader business environment; our ability to identify trends and adjust our business to respond to such\ntrends, especially trends in the U.S. mortgage industry, such as inflation rates, interest rates, new home purchases, refinancing activity, servicing activity, delinquencies and home builder and buyer sentiment; our ability to evolve our\nbenchmarks and indices in a manner that maintains or enhances their reliability and relevance; the accuracy of our estimates and expectations; our belief that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to service our current levels of debt\nand fund our working capital needs and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future; our ability to secure additional debt and pay off our existing debt in a timely manner; our ability to maintain existing market participants and data and\ntechnology customers and attract new ones; our ability to attract, retain and develop key talent, including our senior management; our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, including the costs associated with such protection, and\nour ability to operate our business without violating the intellectual property rights of others; and potential adverse results of litigation and regulatory actions and proceedings. For a discussion of such risks and uncertainties, which could\ncause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements, see ICE’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, including, but not limited to ICE’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 8, 2024 and ICE's most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as filed with the SEC on October 31, 2024. Any forward-looking\nstatement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement or statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is\nmade or to reflect the occurrence of an unanticipated event. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all factors that may affect our business and prospects. Further, management cannot\nassess the impact of each factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.\nGAAP AND NON-GAAP RESULTS\nThis presentation includes non-GAAP measures that exclude certain items we do not consider reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides investors with\ngreater transparency and supplemental data relating to our financial condition and results of operations. These adjusted non-GAAP measures should be considered in context with our GAAP results. A reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income Attributable\nto ICE, Adjusted Earnings Per Share, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Operating Expenses, and Adjusted Free Cash Flow to the equivalent GAAP measure and an explanation of why we deem these non-GAAP\nmeasures meaningful appears in our Form 10-Q and in the appendix to this presentation. The reconciliation of Adjusted Non-Operating Income/Expense Reconciliation, Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, and Adjusted Debt-to-EBITDA to the equivalent GAAP\nresults appear in the appendix to this presentation. Our Form 10-Q, earnings press release, and this presentation are available in the Investors and Media section of our website at www.ice.com.\nEXPLANATORY NOTES\nThroughout this supplement:\n• All net revenue figures represent revenues less transaction-based expenses for periods shown.\n• All earnings per share figures represent diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.\n• Constant currency (CC) amounts are calculated holding both the pound sterling and euro at the average exchange rate from 3Q23, 1.2660 and 1.0881, respectively.\n• References to pro forma amounts or results include the combined results of Black Knight and ICE as if we owned Black Knight since January 1, 2023.\n• References to Return on Invested Capital, or ROIC, are equal to TTM (Operating Income x (1-Adjusted Tax Rate)) / (Avg Debt (Net of the pre-acquisition debt proceeds) + Avg Shareholders Equity + Avg Non-Controlling Interest - Avg Cash,\nCash Equiv, & ST Investments). References to Weighted Average Cost of Capital, or WACC, are equal to (Cost of Equity * % of Equity) + {(Cost of Debt * (1- Adjusted Tax Rate)) * % of Debt}. Percent of Debt assumes a capital structure\nof 3x Debt to Adjusted EBITDA.\n• References to Adjusted Cash Return on Invested Capital, or Adj. Cash ROIC, are equal to TTM Adjusted Free Cash Flow Before Interest Expense, net of Interest Income, and Adjusted for Certain Non-GAAP Cash items /\n(Avg Debt (Net of the pre-acquisition debt proceeds) + Avg Shareholders Equity + Avg Non-Controlling Interest - Avg Cash, Cash Equiv, & ST Investments). These Non-GAAP Cash items include Acquisition and Integration Costs,\n2 Duplicate Rent and Other Occupancy, Litigation and Regulatory settlements, and certain trading claims, adjusted for taxes.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on slide 4 with a summary of\nour record third quarter results.\nThird quarter net revenues totaled a record $2.3 billion, including record transaction revenues of $1.1 billion, and\nrecord recurring revenues of $1.2 billion. Pro forma for the acquisition of Black Knight, total revenue increased by\n7% versus last year and is up 6% through the first three quarters of 2024.\nThird quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $960 million, up 1% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. As a\nresult of this strong performance, adjusted pro forma operating income increased by 12% versus the prior year,\nreaching a record $1.4 billion with adjusted earnings per share totaling a record $1.55.\nMoving to the balance sheet. We reduced debt outstanding by approximately $600 million during the quarter,\nending the period with adjusted leverage of approximately 3.5 times EBITDA. Before I move to our segment\nresults, I will note a few guidance items.\nAs we look to the fourth quarter, we expect OTC and other revenue to be in the range of $75 million to $80\nmillion, as the third quarter benefited from several items we do not anticipate will repeat.\nIn addition, and similar to last year, in light of the strong performance in our cash equities business, where\nrevenues are up 15% year-to-date, we are providing customers with a regulatory fee holiday, which we expect will\nreduce OTC and other revenues by $15 million to $20 million in the fourth quarter.\nShifting to expenses. We expect fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $977 million to\n$987 million, including approximately $10 million to $15 million of items that we also do not expect will repeat.\nLastly, full year CapEx is now expected to be in the range of $700 million to $740 million, largely driven by key\ndata center investments originally planned for 2025. We expect these investments will yield expense efficiencies\nupon project completion in 2026.\nNow let's move to slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Third\nquarter net revenues totaled a record $1.3 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Record transaction revenues of $890\nmillion were up 17% driven by a 34% increase in our interest rate business and record energy revenues, which\ngrew 23% year-over-year.\nThis strong energy performance was on top of 42% growth in last year's third quarter and included a 16%\nincrease in our oil complex, 24% growth in global natural gas revenues and 60% growth in our environmental\nbusiness. In addition, towards the end of October, open interest is up 23% year-over-year, including 32% growth\nin global interest rates and 26% growth in our energy markets.\nShifting to recurring revenues, which include our Exchange Data Services and our NYSE listings business,\nrevenue totaled $364 million, which included a few million dollars related to auto recoveries. Underpinning growth\nin our recurring revenues was our broader Exchange Data Services, which was once again led by the continued\nexpansion of our global energy and environmental network.\nIn our listings business, while less than half of global IPOs have met the standards to list so far in 2024, the NYSE\nhas helped to raise $14 billion in new proceeds, welcoming 43 new operating companies, representing seven of\nthe top 10 IPOs and eight of the top 10 performing IPOs year-to-date. In addition, NYSE continued its leadership\non transfers welcoming 10 operating companies year-to-date.\n4\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nIntercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n(ICE) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 31-Oct-2024\nTurning now to slide 6. I'll discuss our Fixed Income & Data Services segment. Third quarter revenues totaled a\nrecord $586 million, including transaction revenues of $125 million. On a year-over-year basis, growth in munis,\ncorporates, as well as CDS clearing activity was offset by lower treasury trading at ICE bonds and slightly lower\nmember interest revenues. Record recurring revenues totaled $461 million and grew by 6% year-over-year.\nIn our Fixed Income, Data & Analytics business, revenues also increased by 6% year-over-year to a record $295\nmillion driven by growth in pricing and reference data and nearly 30% growth in our Index business, which\nbenefited from both rising markets and fund flows into ETFs that track ICE indices. Importantly, ETF AUM tracking\nICE indices ended the third quarter at a record [ph] $674 billion (00:07:22).\nOther data and network services revenues increased by 5% in the third quarter. Growth was driven by our ICE\nGlobal Network as recent data center investments have come online, growth in our consolidated feeds business\nand continued strength in our desktop solutions, driven in part by adoption of our energy desktop by both\ncommercial customers and traders. These are just a few examples of investments we have made following our\n2015 acquisition of IDC to continuously increase and enhance the content on our network as well as our\nunderlying technology to drive growth.\nPlease flip to slide 7, where I'll discuss our Mortgage Technology results. Third quarter revenues totaled $509\nmillion. Recurring revenues totaled $387 million. While recurring revenues declined year-over-year, as expected,\nthey stabilized relative to the second quarter driven by an improvement in Data & Analytics and offset by the\nsemiannual removal of retired loans on our servicing platform as well as lower minimums on Encompass.\nSimilar to last several quarters, while the majority of Encompass customers renewed at higher minimums, we also\nhad customers renew at lower minimums. Importantly, lower minimums at renewal are also paired with a higher\nprice per closed loan or transaction fee, a dynamic that will provide a more material tailwind to revenues as the\norigination market normalizes.\nTransaction revenues totaled $122 million, up slightly year-over-year and relative to the second quarter driven by\nrevenue related to Encompass closed loans and applications as well as an increase in MERS registrations.\nLooking at the fourth quarter, we expect total IMT revenues to be between $495 million and $505 million with the\ndelta relative to the third quarter, largely driven by purchase market seasonality and related traction revenue.\nWhile mortgage origination volumes appear to have stabilized and seem likely to trend around these levels in the\nnear-term, we will continue to invest in developing new products, enhancing our technology and our existing\nproduct suite as well as expanding our network, all of which will further position our end-to-end platform to\ngenerate growth when market conditions normalize.\nIn summary, we delivered record third quarter results, including record revenues, operating income and adjusted\nEPS, building upon our record first half results and representing the best year-to-date performance in our\ncompany's history. As we look to the balance of the year, we remain focused on meeting the needs of our\ncustomers, continue to drive growth and creating value for our shareholders.\nI'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll hand it over to Stuart.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nStuart Glen Williams\nChief Operating Officer, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n5\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nIntercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n(ICE) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 31-Oct-2024\nThank you, Warren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to slide 8. For over two decades,\nwe've worked closely with our customers to develop a network of diverse liquid and globally interconnected\nenergy markets. This network provides the critical feedback loop required to solve near-term supply and demand\nimbalances and the long-term price signals needed to efficiently allocate capital investment to meet forward-\nlooking demand.\nToday, our customers across the globe leverage our markets to help balance the demands of energy security,\naffordability and sustainability while allocating the capital necessary to meet rising energy demands critical to\neconomic growth and managing the risks associated with a complex geopolitical environment.\nThe breadth and depth of our global platform not only drove another record quarter across our energy complex,\nbut importantly, it positions us to capture secular tailwinds, including the globalization of natural gas and the clean\nenergy transition, trends we began investing in over a decade ago.\nThrough constant reinvention and innovation, Brent has firmly established itself as the global benchmark for crude\noil, pricing roughly three quarters of the world's internationally traded crude and from which prices are discovered\nin the US Gulf Coast via ICE's Midland WTI futures markets and in the Middle East and Asia via ICE's Murban\nand Dubai futures markets.\nReflecting this dynamic, volume in our global oil complex increased 17% year-over-year. This strong performance\nincludes records across Brent, WTI, Midland WTI and Murban and contributed to record oil revenues, which grew\n16% in the quarter. These strong trends have continued into October with record total oil open interest up 28%\nand Brent options up 86% year-over-year.\nThese critical pricing relationships extend to refined oil products, where ICE's low sulfur gas oil markets similarly\nanchors price discovery for refined products globally with markets such as ICE's Heating Oil futures and ICE\nSingapore Gasoil, reflecting regional dynamics in the US and Asia, respectively.\nWe continue to see strong growth across refined products with Gasoil open interest up 63% year-over-year,\nsupporting double-digit growth across the refined products complex, including growth in cleaner fuels such as\nICE's global marine fuel and biofuel markets.\nToday, cleaner energy sources, including global natural gas and environmental markets account for roughly 45%\nof our energy revenues, up from one-third a decade ago, and have grown 21% on average over the past five\nyears, including 34% growth year-to-date. This strong performance has been a key contributor to the 13%\naverage growth rate in our energy platform over that timeframe, including 29% growth year-to-date.\nThe globalization of natural gas through liquefied natural gas, or LNG has created virtual pipelines across oceans,\nremoving the dependency on fixed pipeline infrastructure and storage. This, together with the ongoing\nliberalization of the natural gas market, and buyers increasingly favoring short-term contracts and spot market\nprocurement, has put the more natural gas in motion over longer distances with a greater number of touch points\nalong the value chain from production to consumption, creating a truly global commodity. Furthermore, given its\nabundance, lower emissions and lower switching costs, we expect natural gas to continue to benefit from\nincreasing energy demands particularly in the developing world and the ongoing focus on decarbonization.\nSince the year 2000, energy consumption in non-OECD countries has more than doubled with much of this\ngrowth coming in the form of coal. Last year, global coal consumption hit an all-time high, primarily supported by\nAsia, where coal still accounts for nearly 50% of the region's energy supply. According to statistics published by\n6\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nIntercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n(ICE) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 31-Oct-2024\nthe Energy Institute, the coal switching opportunity in Asia alone represents more energy than the total energy\nconsumption in North America across all primary energy sources.\nIn addition, the power demands of accelerating innovation, including artificial intelligence, are expected to require\nsignificant new generation capacity boosting demand for natural gas. These factors have caused markets across\nEurope, Asia and North America to become increasingly interconnected, accelerating demand for deep, liquid and\nglobal risk management tools.\nThis evolution has driven the development of new trading relationships as illustrated by record participation in our\nnatural gas portfolio in the third quarter. This has been accompanied by volume and revenue growth with each\ngrowing double-digits on average over the past five years, including 34% and 32% growth year-to-date,\nrespectively.\nIn addition, open interest trends remained strong through October, up 27% year-over-year, including a 51%\nincrease in our TTF complex, a 53% increase in our Asian JKM market and a 24% increase in our North\nAmerican gas business.\nAs the Brents of natural gas, our Title Transfer Facility benchmark, or TTF, continues to be relied upon by an\nincreasing number of market participants with market participation growing 15% on average over the past five\nyears. In the third quarter, volumes in our TTF complex increased 16% year-over-year driving revenue growth of\n19% versus 2023.\nIn Asia, underpinned by surging economic growth and a focus towards cleaner forms of energy, our Japan and\nKorea market, or JKM, continues to reach important milestones, setting records across key liquidity indicators in\nthe third quarter, including participation, volume and open interest. Importantly, the extent to which global gas\nmarkets are interconnected was once again reinforced by JKM execution patterns with over 60% of JKM volumes\nexecuted via the JKM TTF spread.\nIn North America, market participants seeking to manage exposure to US natural gas pricing dynamics continue\nto gravitate towards ICE's Henry Hub contracts for the liquidity ICE offers in longer-dated tenants, along with the\nlinkage to our exclusive regional basis markets which spans 70 trading hubs across North America. In the third\nquarter, volume in our North American gas complex increased 39% year-over-year.\nFinally, with Canada expected to significantly ramp up its LNG export capacity from 2025, increased exports from\nthe West Coast of North America to Asia should add a further dimension to the supply equation. ICE's Calgary-\nbased Natural Gas Exchange, or ICE NGX, has operated in the Alberta natural gas and electricity futures market\nfor 30 years, developing the AECO Hub into one of North America's most liquid spot and forward energy markets.\nICE offers liquid markets in TTF, JKM, Henry Hub and the North American basis markets such as AECO, offering\na broad range of natural gas benchmarks with trading hubs across Europe, Asia and North America. As the global\nlandscape of LNG exports, geopolitical forces and shifts towards cleaner energy, all continue to evolve, we see\nthese dynamics continuing to favor our growing global gas complex well into the future.\nAs policy discussions on how best to deliver global sustainability objectives continue to evolve, our liquid and\ntransparent environmental markets, first launched almost two decades ago, continue to see growth, providing\ntransparent, market-based pricing for both positive and negative externalities.\n7\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nIntercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n(ICE) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 31-Oct-2024\nHere, we have seen the number of active market participants grow double-digits on average over the past five\nyears, including record participation in the third quarter, up 14% year-over-year. At the same time, our North\nAmerican environmental complex reached record volumes in the quarter, increasing 70% versus prior year.\nWhile volumes in our European emission allowance futures and options increased 45%, this strong performance\nhas contributed to the 49% growth in our environmental revenues year-to-date including 60% growth in the third\nquarter.\nIn summary, as the confluence of increasing energy demand, evolving supply chains and the energy transition\ncontinues to introduce new complexities, uncertainties and volatility into energy markets, our global environmental\nmarkets, alongside our global gas, oil, coal and power markets, provide the critical price transparency and risk\nmanagement tools that will enable participants to navigate this multilayered and non-linear transition.\nBefore I hand over to Jeff, I wanted to briefly touch on our interest rate markets, which hit record volume during\nthe quarter, increasing 50% year-over-year. A mixed inflation picture, low unemployment, weaker economic data\nand ongoing geopolitical uncertainty continue to drive demand for interest rate risk management. ICE's liquid\nmulticurrency, short-term interest rate complex includes the key benchmark Euribor, SONIA and SARON markets\nused to manage short-term interest rate risk in euros, pound sterling and Swiss francs, respectively.\nAs the benchmark for managing short-term euro interest rate risk, ICE's Euribor volume increased 47% year-over-\nyear in the third quarter with open interest up 15% in October. The latest addition to ICE's multicurrency STIR\ncomplex, the euro short-term rate, or ESTR, continues to break records across all liquidity metrics, including open\ninterest hitting a record 681,000 contracts during October.\nICE's SONIA market, the benchmark for managing UK interest rate risk traded a record 14 million contracts in\nSeptember, contributing to a 53% growth year-to-date. Trends towards the end of October remained robust with\nopen interest up 71%.\nICE also hosts the Gilts futures market, the benchmark for the UK government bond yield curve, where volume is\nup 30% year-to-date, including 42% growth in the third quarter with open interest up 92% year-over-year. The\ndisparity between the expected relative parts for the Central Banks has been a consistency over the last year.\nThis has been beneficial for our rates franchise, both in terms of volume and open interest and looks set to\ncontinue as our customers rely on the deep liquidity and capital efficiencies at ICE.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Jeff.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJeffrey Craig Sprecher\nFounder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\nThank you, Stuart. Please now turn to slide 9. Operating marketplaces with strong network effects is a core\nexpertise at ICE. Today, we do so across an array of asset classes, geographies and customer types.\nIn the US home mortgage market, we're following the proven playbook that we've applied across other asset\nclasses. We're leveraging leading technology, mission-critical data and our network expertise to build innovative\nsolutions that improve workflow efficiencies and connect market participants to one another. With a touchpoint in\nnearly every market participant in the US mortgage space, we have connectivity to a customer base in need of\nthe automation that our digital network provides for.\n8\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nIntercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n(ICE) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 31-Oct-2024\nSeptember marked our one-year anniversary since we closed on the acquisition of Black Knight. So, I thought it\nwould be appropriate to give you an update on how this company and its technologies have been integrated into\nour network. By adding Black Knight's servicing technology, with its over 100 servicing clients and robust data and\nanalytics to our network, ICE assembled a true life-of-loan offering that spans from the point of consumer\nacquisition all the way through to the secondary capital markets. We organized once disparate assets into a\nunified network that communicates seamlessly from end to end.\nThe construction of a mortgage can begin with our industry-leading customer engagement suite. We brought\ntogether Ellie Mae's Velocify and Consumer Connect platforms, and married them to Black Knight's marketing\nautomation solution called Surefire, tying together the pieces required for a complete customer engagement suite.\nSurefire leverages data to create effective marketing campaigns, nurtures them to the mortgage application and\neducates and informs borrowers throughout the funding process. Additionally, this platform provides direct\nchannel outreach after the loan closing to help capture repeat business.\nVelocify is a sales automation solution that enables loan officers to capture missed opportunities and\ncommunicate with borrowers to close loans faster.\nAnd Consumer Connect provides a state-of-the-art digital mortgage experience to the consumer for the home\nbuying process. We've unified these systems, which now seamlessly operate as one to feed the Encompass loan\nunderwriting platform.\nWith Encompass, we successfully added a browser-based run-in or loan underwriting and integrated new\nautomation tools. And we added more ways to partner and extend the platform by increasing network APIs.\nLenders can take advantage of products that are integrated via our partner network, while partners are able to\nbuild and release distributed products just one time. And once released, lenders can use a partner product across\nall of ICE Mortgage Technology, lender-facing applications.\nIn addition, we connected data assets from Black Knight, including property tax, flood and closing fee information\ninto Encompass.\nWe also moved AllRegs, our market-leading tool for compliance-related information into the ICE Cloud, and we\ndeeply integrated it into Encompass. We enhanced this offering by incorporating a generative AI model so that\nnatural language inquiries generate loan program information and guideline summaries from the most\ncomprehensive compliance library available in the industry, covering nearly 1 million pages.\nWe previously mentioned that we took a product formally called AIQ, extended its capabilities to further automate\ndata extraction and integrated it into Encompass. This product, now known as ICE Data & Document Automation,\nor DDA, captures the information provided by a borrower. Whether a document was shared via portal, e-mail, fax\nor scan, DDA normalizes it, standardizes its naming and puts everything in the correct order. This creates\nconsistency, uniformity and efficiency.\nA team of about 200 of our technologists have further expanded the capabilities of DDA by building sophisticated\nincome and credit analyzers to deploy one of the most important new technologies to be offered in the US\nmortgage space. These sophisticated analyzers transform formerly manual operations into automated exception-\nbased workflows.\n9\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nIntercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n(ICE) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 31-Oct-2024\nKey steps in the underwriting process are accelerated, including investigation to determine the creditworthiness of\na wide range of borrowers for GSE guaranteed loan eligibility or for HUD's affordable loan program for a given\nmetropolitan statistical area. This comes at a time when prospective homebuyers are facing the most daunting\naffordability challenges in four decades and at a time when many borrowers have non-traditional income streams\nthat don't neatly fit on a Form W-2. These new analyzers drive greater operational efficiency to help lower\nmortgage origination cost for lenders and ultimately, borrowers.\nWe continue to invest in our product and pricing engine by providing additional options to lenders, servicers and\ntheir funding partners. We've connected our network directly to Fannie, Freddie and Ginnie Mae for seamless\npricing inquiries. As a result, we went live with 32 new price engine clients this year accompanied by a strong\npipeline of 19 others that are currently in the implementation phase.\nWe also deployed our team to bring Black Knight's loan servicing onto our network, recently announcing the\nintegration of Encompass underwriting system with the MSP servicing system with documents now moving\nstraight from origination through to servicing. Taking it a step further, we also incorporated DDA into MSP so that\nservicers can quickly identify any critical information that may be missing from a loan file as the documents\nprogressed. And we cemented this integration milestone with the signing of JPMorgan Chase to also utilize this\nplatform for their servicing business.\nWe continue to enhance the MSP loan servicing technology since our acquisition of Black Knight by investing in a\nnew user interface called MSP DX. This interface [ph] recognizes (00:29:25) access and control of the legacy loan\nservicing platforms and streamlines key tasks across loan onboarding, investor reporting and customer service. It\nallows users to seamlessly retrieve data and invoke servicing actions through a conversational user interface. And\nits expanded capability facilitates loan triage providing users with an efficient view of relevant information when\nworking on loan exceptions. We've also further automated the credit dispute processes to help mortgage\nservicers meet their 30-day reporting obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.\nOur expertise at digitization has led to continued innovation for the secondary market for home mortgages. In the\nthird quarter, we went live with our MBS mortality indicator, which leverages data sets across ICE Mortgage\nTechnology and ICE Data Services to produce daily trading signals for agency, residential MBS pools. We believe\nthese signals are significantly more accurate at predicting near-term prepayments than the legacy products in the\nmarket.\nIn summary, we've assembled and expanded a leading customer engagement suite, underwriting tools, pricing\nsystems, closing tools, registration tools, servicing systems and the resulting data and integrated them into ICE's\nnetwork for the US mortgage industry. ICE brings together the key industry stakeholders from origination to final\nsettlement in a single network ecosystem.\nThat's roughly 85% of all US home mortgages connected to more than 3,000 lenders, 48,000 settlement agents\nand closing attorneys, 2,500 county governments, the GSEs, 80,000 notaries, 100 loan servicing companies,\n1,000 mortgage-backed security investment firms and thousands of third-party data and service providers who\ncan now communicate with one another via a common data standard on a robust network operated under ICE's\ncyber overlay.\nWe believe that we've created a platform where every new participant who joins this network makes the platform\nincreasingly more valuable to its other users. Essentially, we've moved ICE from selling software to offering a\ngrowing network for the management of the home mortgage life cycle. Throughout this journey, and consistent\nwith our approach across other asset classes, we remain focused on executing on our strategy of relieving pain\n10\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nIntercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n(ICE) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 31-Oct-2024\npoints across the mortgage workflow while investing ahead of secular growth to enhance the value proposition of\nour network.\nTurning now to slide 10. Since our founding, ICE has operated with a strategy to build tools and markets for\ninstitutions and consumers which operate in the white space of the inefficiencies of legacy markets. We seek to\ndo so in a manner that enables us to grow our earnings in all economic conditions so that ICE is truly an all-\nweather growth story.\nOur record third quarter following up on our unsurpassed first half results are a testament for the execution of this\nstrategy, the business model that we've intentionally built and the value of our strategic capital allocation. It's how\nwe've grown our adjusted earnings per share every year that we've been a public company.\nAnd finally, I'd like to retell you that a decade ago, ICE sought to expand in the global financial markets by\nmerging LIFFE, the London International Financial Futures Exchange, with our London-based commodity\nexchange and clearinghouse in order to create a global risk management powerhouse.\nWith great respect, I'd like to end my prepared remarks by acknowledging the contributions of Sir Brian\nWilliamson and Hugh Freedberg, who built, saved and nurtured that LIFFE exchange. This world recently lost\nboth gentlemen. And I hope that as they look down upon us, they regard my colleagues and I as worthy stewards\nof their vision. And I hope they smile along with us at our record interest rate derivative activity in the third quarter,\nup 50% year-over-year.\nLet me now turn the call back to our moderator, Lydia, and we'll conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30\nEastern Time.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nQUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Please\ngo ahead.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nAlex Kramm Q\nAnalyst, UBS Securities LLC\nYes. Hey. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with an unanswerable question, I think, as I think about the\nenergy business, as we think about the end of the year and into 2025. Obviously, a lot of detail here in terms of\nthe structural opportunities and clearly, that's reflected in the open interest growth that we see and obviously\nvolumes this year, too.\nBut look, clearly, it's been a solid environment as well from a trading perspective, in particular, in the fourth\nquarter with some of the volatility we've seen from the Middle East. So clearly, there's been some beta help here\nas well. So, I'm just wondering, I know it's very difficult, if you can separate the alpha and the beta a little bit. And\nhow you think about that heading into 2025, what's repeatable and where are you a little bit worried that the\ntrading environment may not be as good? Thank you. I know it's a lengthy question.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJeffrey Craig Sprecher A\nFounder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n11\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nIntercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n(ICE) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 31-Oct-2024\nAlex, this is Jeff. And since that's an unanswerable question, let's put the new guy on it and ask Stuart, if he can\nhandle it.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nStuart Glen Williams A\nChief Operating Officer, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\nThanks, Jeff, and thanks, Alex, for the question. It is a great question. Best way to think about this, I think you\npicked up on a really important point there, Alex, when you referenced open interest. So as unanswerable as it\nmight be, open interest is always a good indicator of future volume because this is – these are positions being\nplaced by real market participants. And those positions will need to be managed in the future as markets evolve.\nBut the other way we think about this is that there is a linkage between the geopolitical events, which you\nreferenced in your question. which do create short-term volatility, but which also creates often new supply chains,\nwhich then will leverage other parts of that matrix product setup that we've got, which spans energy types and\ngeography and the environmental markets.\nSo just giving you an example of that. One of the things we saw after Europe's efforts to remove Russian\nhydrocarbons from its supply chain, we saw new supply routes coming from the Middle East up into Europe,\nwhich we've never foreseen when we first set up ICE Futures Abu Dhabi, but that's what happened. And so, what\nwe find is a lot of these geopolitical events create different supply chain opportunities, which continue to drive\ngrowth in different parts of our energy markets.\nThe focus that we've had over the last 20 years though has been to create that network of markets that provides a\npricing point at each geography, energy type and environmental touchpoints, so that whatever happens, whether\nit's geopolitical, whether it's supply chain changes, however the market evolves, we have the opportunity to\nprovide that tool to our customers and can benefit off the back of that.\nThe other point I would make, just in closing the answer, is we're very clearly at an inflection point where the\ngrowth we've seen over the last 20 years in absolute energy consumption is set to continue. About 80% of the\nworld's population lives in non-OECD countries which, on average, on a per capita basis, only uses one-third of\nthe energy of the equivalent people living in OECD countries.\nPut differently, energy consumption could well double over the next 25 years according to many economists. And\na lot of that is going to be in places – in the developing world where contracts like JKM and TTF and Brent and\nDubai and Murban are critical in managing price risk around those areas. So, we feel pretty good about the\nopportunity ahead of us. But as you say, it's pretty difficult to quantify that.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nCraig Siegenthaler Q\nAnalyst, BofA Securities, Inc.\nHey. Good morning, everyone. We had a question on the new partnership between ICE Bonds and MarketAxess.\nSo how will this partnership enhance your liquidity pool and client value proposition? And will we see it translate\ninto stronger market share trends? If I could just squeeze one more in. Could this lead down the road to a closer\nrelationship with MarketAxess ranging from a full acquisition or a strategic minority equity investment?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nChristopher S. Edmonds A\nPresident, Fixed Income & Data Services, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n12\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nIntercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n(ICE) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 31-Oct-2024\nCraig, it's Chris Edmonds. Thanks for the question. Probably will avoid the second one you asked. But look, the\npartnership with MarketAxess, it really gives us an opportunity where we have a very unique client base that is\ndifferent than the MarketAxess traditional client base. But there are different pools of liquidity because of what\nthey represent. And so, this gives – this combination gives us the ability for all of our clients to make sure they\nhave access to the liquidity they're looking for.\nIt's still early days, but it has gone very well for both of us. We're both happy with it. I spoke with him yesterday.\nThings continue to progress in a positive way there. And we will look to add other instruments along the way as\nthe market continues to evolve into the future. But like I said, I'll probably avoid the last question you asked there.\nThanks.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Budish with Barclays. Your line is open.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBenjamin Budish Q\nAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.\nHi. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to dig in a little deeper to the fourth quarter\nIMT guidance. It looks like, at least I know you tend to be a little bit more conservative than the MBA forecast, but\nthey show sort of an expected pick up between refis and purchases together. So just curious if you could kind of\ncomment on that.\nAnd then maybe could you perhaps remind us, how should we be thinking about your overall sensitivity to pick-up\nin transactions given there's a minimum component? Like how would you describe the current level of activity?\nAre most of your customers below that minimum level such that incremental transactions don't add as much? Like\nhow should we sort of be thinking about that in Q4 and into next year? Thank you very much.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nWarren Gardiner A\nChief Financial Officer, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\nYeah, Ben, it's a good question. Thanks for – and thank you for it. So in terms of the first part of that question. So\nthe fourth quarter guidance, as I said, it does assume some – a slower purchase market. And when we see that in\nevery fourth quarter, generally speaking, that trends off and that generally happens in the first quarter as well for\nwhat it's worth just the weather, frankly, at the end of the day and to people looking at houses and buying houses.\nSo that's a typical pattern that we see.\nI think in terms of how that compares to what the MBA may be expecting, I don't know that that has really\ncaptured the sharper move, higher in interest rates and mortgage rates over the last few weeks. So there may be\na little bit more of a aggressive assumption on what refinancing may be looking like in that particular period. And\nso we base – what we're looking at is really what we're seeing on the application front and what we're seeing on\nthe closed loan front in terms of what we can see in the next quarter or so.\nSo I think it's a pretty good guide in terms of what one would expect for the quarter given where we're a month\nthrough here and it generally takes sort of 30, 60 days to close a loan. So those application volumes can be pretty\nindicative of what this quarter will look like.\nOn your second question, yeah, look, we still have a significant portion of the customers that are under their\nminimums today. But each quarter, that's getting better. And in fact, the third quarter was the best in two years or\nso, over two years, and that's been steadily improving throughout this year. So not only does an improving loan\n13\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nIntercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n(ICE) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 31-Oct-2024\nmarket help that, but so does the fact that we have actually been renewing some of these customers towards\nlower minimums as well and so the bar, if you will, is a little bit lower.\nAnd so we've seen that transaction getting better the last few quarters, albeit still small and customers are\ncrossing over their minimums with that being a big reason why it's improving. But we are – that is a big reason\nwhy we are actually outperforming in terms of our transaction revenue relative to the market is some of those\ncustomers crossing over that minimum, not paying transaction fees in the prior period and now paying transaction\nfees. And I think as that market normalizes, you're going to see that continue.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nDaniel T. Fannon Q\nAnalyst, Jefferies LLC\nThanks. Good morning. So Warren, another question for you, just on expenses. Curious about the step-up into\n4Q, kind of what's driving that. And then I know it's early, but thinking about the building blocks for 2025, if you\ncan kind of give us the framework, I think about maybe versus previous years.\nAnd also in the context of the mortgage business, if we do see a pickup in activity, the incremental margin of that\nbusiness as we think about volume is starting to pick up more materially with rates changing as we go into next\nyear.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nWarren Gardiner A\nChief Financial Officer, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\nThanks, Dan. Good question. So as I noted, in terms of the fourth quarter, there's about $10 million to $15 million\nof onetime expenses that you'll want to take out of that in terms of thinking about a core run rate. Those one-times\nwere several items really across different areas of the business unrelated that kind of [ph] hit all towards\n(00:43:18) – we incurred, if you will, we realize we were going to incur towards the end of this quarter.\nSo, I think if you take that, you're probably down to $970 million or so versus the $960 million we had this quarter.\nAnd the difference there is going to be on the SG&A side. To a degree, we did have a little bit lower marketing\nand consumer acquisition costs in the third quarter that should pick up a bit in the fourth quarter, a little bit higher\nprofessional services fees as well that will come in next quarter – or in the fourth quarter, I should say.\nSo I think as you're thinking about next year, the $970 million, that's probably a good jumping off point. And to\nannualize that, of course, and then think about a similar framework that we've used in the past. We're going to\ninvest in our people, we'll invest in the business, the technology and continue to do that as you've seen us do in\nthe last number of years. So I think it's – that will be a fair way to be thinking about it as we move into next year.\nWe'll, of course, give you more granular guidance when we get there.\nOn your second question on the incremental margins, you're 100% right. As the transaction backdrop improves\nand the market backdrop improves for loan originations, those are somewhat similar, if not entirely similar to what\nyou would expect and see in our futures business or the New York Stock Exchange, where the transaction\nrevenues have pretty high incremental margins on them. So that will certainly be a benefit to the segment margin\nand to the overall margin as that loan market normalizes.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Allen with Citi. Your line is open.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n14\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nIntercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n(ICE) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 31-Oct-2024\nChris Allen Q\nAnalyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.\nGood morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to circle back a little bit on energy. Kind of\ncurious where you see pockets of opportunity from a customer perspective, whether it's customers overseas for\nthe US benchmarks or natural gas moving into the crude markets?\nAnd then I also wanted to ask about the sustainable aviation fuel market. There's been reports about energy\nmajors investing in Brazil. And just given ICE's position in sugar and energy, it seems like a great opportunity. So\nwondering how you think about that from a market development opportunity set?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nStuart Glen Williams A\nChief Operating Officer, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\nHi, Chris. This is Stuart here. Thank you for the question. Starting with your question on the customer base, we're\nseeing – as you heard in my prepared remarks, we're seeing a significant increase and continued growth in our\ncustomer base. The participation in our markets, that's really two factors. We're seeing net new participants\ncoming into our marketplace, particularly out in Asia as hedging strategies continue to mature out there.\nBut we're also seeing participants pivot from markets they've been active in historically into new markets. So for\nexample, people that have historically been trading a lot of Henry Hub on our very regular, in our TTF market and\ngetting involved there.\nIn terms of how that mix evolves, more and more customers are having global exposures. One of the side effects\nof the globalization of gas is that gas players globally and particularly in the US now that the US is a major export\nof LNG, need to be cognizant of and have risks to manage in respect of prices, not just in the US, but globally.\nSo we've got a lot of global producers in the US that are now looking at both TTF numbers as well as Henry Hub\nnumbers. And indeed some of our basis numbers to figure out whether it's best to pipe that gas internally to –\nwhether it's for a data center usage or other power usage in the US or to export that in the form of LNG to whether\nit's Europe or Asia. So we're seeing a lot of our US participants now actively trading and holding positions in\nmarkets like TTF and JKM.\nI think the other trend, just pivoting quickly to oil, which has been very interesting. You'll recall that a few years\nago, we set up a new market in the US Gulf Coast to better reflect the export price of Permian WTI coming out of\nthe US Gulf Coast. And again, as the US continues to export more and more Permian grade WTI, and as that\ngrade is now linked into Brent, we're seeing a lot more physical participants in the US Permian producers using\nour numbers to price their exports out of the US Gulf Coast.\nYou might have seen just this last week, the shale producer Continental Resources announced that it was\nswitching its Permian pricing to ICE's HOU contract, which is replacing a differential to WTI Cushing. So that's all\npointing in a good direction at the increased participation.\nJust pivoting then to your second question around sustainable aviation fuel or SAF, it is definitely a market we're\nlooking at. What I referenced in my prepared remarks around our biofuels markets, which ICE is very active in,\nwe're seeing strong growth there. So that will be the area that SAF plays into. And as again, you alluded to, we're\nseeing increasing correlation between the sugar markets and the energy markets as a decent chunk of that sugar\nsupply ends up in energy.\n15\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nIntercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n(ICE) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 31-Oct-2024\nSo, you're quite right. This is an opportunity. It's early days in the SAF market. The market structure is still\nevolving in that space. But we continue to monitor that as time goes on.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go\nahead.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nAlexander Blostein Q\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\nHi. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for the question. Jeff, a little bit of a maybe bigger picture mortgage\nquestion for you guys. Obviously, you talked a lot about the progress you're making in sort of integrating various\nparts of the mortgage network. It's always been an important part of the thesis for you guys. Lots of work behind\nthe themes, sorry, despite the fact that the environment obviously hasn't been particularly helpful here.\nSo when do you expect all these efforts to show up in better revenue growth? So in other words, do we need to\nsee a much better, broader industry volumes to sort of kind of like beta help? Or do you think some of these\nthings could actually show up in better revenue trajectory into 2025 regardless of what industry volumes look like?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJeffrey Craig Sprecher A\nFounder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\nThat's a good question. I tried to make a point in my prepared remarks that we really have moved to operating a\nnetwork. And I made the point that every new market participant that joins the network makes the network more\nvaluable to all the existing participants. And so that phenomenon is not really volume related. It's really helping\nothers take costs out. And our expectation is that as we help reduce the cost of underwriting and placing a\nmortgage into the capital markets that we'll participate in some of that benefit.\nSeparately, Warren talks a lot about normalizing transaction volumes. And when we look at that, you can simply\nlook over a decade before the COVID crisis or even back to year 2022, and you can see volumes that had they\nrun through our platform, would have contributed substantially to both the top and bottom line. So we do feel like\nthere will be a mean reversion that we'll get to transactions. Obviously, it's hard to predict. But in the meantime,\nwe're going to just keep driving that efficiency through the network.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: The next question comes from Simon Clinch with Redburn Atlantic. Your line is open.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nSimon Aistair Vaughan Clinch Q\nAnalyst, Redburn (Europe) Ltd.\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to actually ask a longer-term question just about the environmental\nmarkets, please. Perhaps you could – could you frame the growth that we're seeing in terms of the stages we're\nin, in terms of the emissions coverage of the schemes such as the European ETFs? And then ultimately, how to\nthink about the cadence of that growth as we move through the next five years? And then very long – in the very\nlong term, what – how do we think about that market opportunity or that market existing and the point that we\neventually get to net zero? Thanks.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nStuart Glen Williams A\nChief Operating Officer, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\nThanks, Simon. Good question. The – I think the way we're thinking about this from a macro perspective, and I'll\ndrill down into your specific question on the European ETFs. Carbon pricing, our view, as market operators, is that\n16\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nIntercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n(ICE) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 31-Oct-2024\ncarbon pricing is going to be the most effective way to help channel investments that are needed in order to drive\nthe complete reduction of carbon. And we've seen this very effectively play out in the UK as the UK drove coal out\nof its merit order using carbon pricing. The European Union on a similar kind of trajectory.\nSo, what we're seeing over the last couple of years is the dialogue around the importance of pricing carbon and\nthen more broadly environmental externalities is evolving. More governments, more policymakers are engaging\nwith the subject and seeing the benefits of cap-and-trade systems, which have been so successful in Europe and\nthe UK and also in certain areas of the US. And so we are seeing more discussions around more coverage of\ncarbon markets.\nAnd then within existing carbon markets, touching on your question on the European ETFs, we're seeing the\nbroadening of the coverage of those carbon markets. So only about 40% of the European emissions was covered\nunder the EU ETFs. That is now being extended to 80% as the ETFs extends to other parts of the industry like\nshipping and that sort of thing. So the underlying market, if you like, is expanding, which is also driving additional\nvolume there.\nAnd then, of course, the other nascent market in the space, if you think of the compliance markets as the one end\nof the spectrum, on the other end, the so-called voluntary carbon markets, or the carbon credit markets is another\narea where we continue to see discussions. Market structure there, again, is still very nascent. But what we've\nbeen working on in the meantime is putting in place a number of the building blocks that will be required for that\nmarkets to scale if it is ever going to scale, things like reference data.\nSo we've got a product called ICE CRED, which normalizes and standardizes all of the reference data that's\navailable across the carbon credit landscape. That reference data is now available in ICE [ph] Chats (00:54:24)\nwhere we're seeing a lot of the transaction activity, really OTC bilateral trading activity of carbon credits,\nreferencing that reference data. And we've also got a futures – a number of futures contracts including the\nCORSIA futures contract, which we launched recently, which is really the credit market used by the aviation\nindustry.\nSo again, that's the second part of the market, which is much less mature, but we are seeing increasing interest\nas participants start to engage with our reference data and the ICE Chat transactions on that front.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nKenneth B. Worthington Q\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC\nHi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Stuart, more for you, trial by fire. If we think about the\nglobalization of gas driving your TTF and JKM contracts, we're seeing the growth of TTF far exceed the LNG\ncapacity that has come online in recent years. There's some sort of multiplier or maybe it's speculators following\nhedgers.\nSo how do you think about this relationship between molecules in motion, the need to hedge and what ends up\nultimately is, I guess, I'll call it, normalized volume? And if LNG capacity is going to double over the next three\nyears, what is reasonable to expect for this LNG relationship with TTF and JKM, which you called out as sort of a\nnonlinear relationship?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n17\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nIntercontinental Exchange, Inc.\n(ICE) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 31-Oct-2024\nStuart Glen Williams A\nChief Operating Officer, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\nYeah. Thanks for the question, Ken. I think the other dynamic to keep in mind when you're thinking about the\nvolume on a futures contract versus the underlying market is the length of the curve. So, we've got liquid pricing in\nTTF now going out 10 years. And so that's 10 years' worth of supply is the thing you need to be thinking about as\nyou think about the hedging volumes on the exchange.\nBut look, it's – the thing that we – the dynamic we're seeing is, as you said in your question, the demand for LNG\nis growing significantly, and we see that as being a significant part of both the Asian growth story, but also the\nAsian move to cleaner energies. So there's no question in our mind that LNG supply is going to need to increase\nsignificantly.\nThe other dynamic here is because there is more liquid pricing in the marketplace, looking at the likes of TTF and\nJKM, more and more buyers and sellers are referencing TTF and JKM in the physical contracts. And so what that\nmeans is you're seeing less fixed price and more indexed transactions in the physical market, which provides the\noptionality not just of taking LNG from point of production to point of demand, but also you can, as you see in the\noil market, have shifts on routes changing direction because arbs have opened up.\nSo what we're seeing in the gas market as part of this globalization story is a real modernization of the market\nstructure where physical molecules are going to the best price. And as those prices evolve with greater\ntransparency, those physical movements move with them. So net-net, what that means is there are more\nparticipants needing to hedge more molecules along more supply chain routes and we see that's overall growing.\nAnd then again, to my earlier comments, liquidity down the curve is getting really strong. So we're seeing longer-\ndated hedging coming into the TTF contract as well.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Thank you. We're out of time for further questions. So I'll now hand you back to Jeff Sprecher, Chair\nand CEO, for any closing comments.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJeffrey Craig Sprecher\nFounder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.\nWell, thank you, Lydia, and thank you all for joining us this morning.
