The Agreement, effective December 1, 2024, establishes a pathway for international students from five Southeast Asian and South American colleges and universities to complete associate and bachelor’s degrees in business at Davis University. \n\n“We believe that this Agreement can lead to a 20-25% increase in international student enrollment since it provides an excellent pathway for students from Southeast Asian countries to study in the US at Davis University,” commented Diane Brunner, President of Davis University. “The Agreement also enables us to more easily enter countries in the Southeast Asian and South American markets and develop new relationships. It will also give us the opportunity to establish our foundational programs that exports our academic programming and that creates a sizeable international student recruiting pool.”\n\nThe Agreement between Davis University (“Davis”) and The Center for Advanced Studies (“CAS”) establishes a transfer pathway by facilitating the transfer of credits for students from colleges and universities where CAS operates its International Studies Program to enroll in Davis’ associate and bachelor’s degree programs for business. International students from the CAS International Studies Program may start coming to Davis as soon as the Spring 2025 semester.\n\nCAS offers its International Studies Program at multiple campuses including at Kanda Institute of Foreign Languages (Tokyo, Japan), The American University of Yangon (Yangon, Myanmar), Nawaloka College of Higher Studies (Colombo, Sri Lanka) and SISINTEL, S.A., (Guayaquil, Ecuador), and the Advanced University Programs International Institute (Cuenca and Guayaquil, Ecuador). Other sites are under development for CAS’ International Studies Program with partner colleges in other countries.\n\n**EpicQuest Education’s Strategy of Internationalization**\n\nEpicQuest Education believes that its collaborative programs for Davis University and EduGlobal College, its two owned and operated institutions of higher learning, are a key element of its internationalization strategy to expand its student enrollment and academic programming. The Company’s strategy provides enhanced globalized learning and enriched multicultural experiences that can help students reach their full potential and better prepare them for careers in the global economy. Further, EpicQuest Education’s strategic growth plan has increased its international student enrollment in recent periods which can lead to strong and sustainable financial results.\n\n**About Davis University**\n\nDavis University (“Davis”) was founded in 1858 and is a private career-training University located in Toledo, Ohio.
