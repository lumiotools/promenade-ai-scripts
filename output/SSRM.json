Forward-looking information may be contained in this document and our other public filings. Forward-looking information relates to statements concerning our outlook and anticipated events or results and\nin some cases, can be identified by terminology such as “may”, “will”, “could”, “should”, “expect”, “plan”, “anticipate”, “believe”, “intend”, “estimate”, “projects”, “predict”, “potential”, “continue” or other similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts,\nas well as statements written in the future tense. When made, forward-looking statements are based on information known to management at such time and/or management’s good faith belief with respect to future events. Such statements are subject to risks and\nuncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in the Company's forward-looking statements. Many of these factors are beyond the Company's ability to control or predict. Given these uncertainties, readers are\ncautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.\nThe key risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: local and global political and economic conditions; governmental and regulatory requirements and actions by governmental authorities, including changes in government policy, government ownership\nrequirements, changes in environmental, tax and other laws or regulations and the interpretation thereof; developments with respect to global pandemics, including the duration, severity and scope of a pandemic and potential impacts on mining operations; risks and\nuncertainties resulting from the Incident at Çöpler described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter end June 30, 2024, and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter end\nSeptember 30, 2024; and other risk factors detailed from time to time in the Company’s reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on EDGAR at www.sec.gov the Canadian securities regulatory authorities on SEDAR at www.sedarplus.ca and on our\nwebsite at www.ssrmining.com.\nForward-looking information and statements in this presentation include any statements concerning, among other things: all information related to the Company’s Çöpler operations, including timelines, outlook, preliminary costs, remediation plans, and possible\nrestart plans; forecasts and outlook; preliminary cost reporting in this document; timing, production, operating, cost, and capital expenditure guidance; our operational and development targets and catalysts and the impact of any suspensions on operations; the\nresults of any gold reconciliations; the ability to discover additional ore; the generation of free cash flow and payment of dividends; matters relating to proposed exploration; communications with local stakeholders; maintaining community and government relations;\nnegotiations of joint ventures; negotiation and completion of transactions; commodity prices; Mineral Resources, Mineral Reserves, conversion of Mineral Resources, realization of Mineral Reserves, and the existence or realization of Mineral Resource estimates; the\ndevelopment approach; the timing and amount of future production; the timing of studies, announcements, and analysis; the timing of construction and development of proposed mines and process facilities; capital and operating expenditures; economic conditions;\navailability of sufficient financing; exploration plans; receipt of regulatory approvals; timing and impact surrounding suspension or interruption of operations as a result of regulatory requirements or actions by governmental authority; renewal of NCIB program; and any\nand all other timing, exploration, development, operational, financial, budgetary, economic, legal, social, environmental, regulatory, and political matters that may influence or be influenced by future events or conditions.\nSuch forward-looking information and statements are based on a number of material factors and assumptions, including, but not limited in any manner to, those disclosed in any other of our filings on EDGAR and SEDAR, and include: any assumptions made in\nrespect of the Company’s Çöpler operations; the inherent speculative nature of exploration results; the ability to explore; communications with local stakeholders; maintaining community and governmental relations; status of negotiations of joint ventures; weather\nconditions at our operations; commodity prices; the ultimate determination of and realization of Mineral Reserves; existence or realization of Mineral Resources; the development approach; availability and receipt of required approvals, titles, licenses and permits;\nsufficient working capital to develop and operate the mines and implement development plans; access to adequate services and supplies; foreign currency exchange rates; interest rates; access to capital markets and associated cost of funds; availability of a\nqualified work force; ability to negotiate, finalize, and execute relevant agreements; lack of social opposition to our mines or facilities; lack of legal challenges with respect to our properties; the timing and amount of future production; the ability to meet production,\ncost, and capital expenditure targets; timing and ability to produce studies and analyses; capital and operating expenditures; economic conditions; availability of sufficient financing; the ultimate ability to mine, process, and sell mineral products on economically\nfavorable terms; and any and all other timing, exploration, development, operational, financial, budgetary, economic, legal, social, geopolitical, regulatory and political factors that may influence future events or conditions. While we consider these factors and\nassumptions to be reasonable based on information currently available to us, they may prove to be incorrect.\nSuch factors are not exhaustive of the factors that may affect any of the Company’s forward-looking statements and information, and such statements and information will not be updated to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date of such statements or\nto reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. Forward-looking information and statements are only predictions based on our current estimates and assumptions Actual results may vary materially from such forward-looking information. Other than as\nrequired by law, the Company does not intend, and undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking information to reflect, among other things, new information or future events.

All references to “$” in this presentation are to U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated.\nCautionary Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures to assist in understanding the Company’s financial results. The non-GAAP financial measures are employed by us to measure our operating and economic performance and to assist in decision-\nmaking, as well as to provide key performance information to senior management. We believe that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, certain investors and other stakeholders will find this information useful to evaluate our\noperating and financial performance; however, these non-GAAP performance measures – including total cash, total debt, net cash (debt), cash costs, all-in sustaining costs (“AISC”) per ounce sold, adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders, cash\ngenerated by (used in) operating activities before changes in working capital, free cash flow, and free cash flow before changes in working capital– do not have any standardized meaning. These performance measures are intended to provide additional information\nand should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our definition of our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. These\nnon-GAAP measures should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements. Readers should also refer to the endnotes in this presentation for further information regarding how the Company calculates certain of these measures.\nSSRM:NASDAQ / TSX, SSR:ASX PAGE 2\nÇöpler Incident Update\nFour Key Priorities in the Ongoing Efforts at Site\n1 • RECOVERY: All nine individuals have been recovered and returned to their families\n• CONTAINMENT: All planned infrastructure has been successfully installed and is proving effective\n• Public statements from Turkish government officials continue to reiterate that there has been no\nrecordable contamination to local soil, water or air in the sampling locations\n• REMEDIATION: To-date, over 16 million tonnes (~86%) of the displaced heap leach material has\nbeen moved to temporary storage locations, including substantially all displaced material from the\n2\nSabırlı Valley\n• In Q3 2024, $48.3 million was spent on remediation activities at Çöpler, bringing total remediation\nspend since April 1, 2024 to $103.3 million\n• The heap leach pad will be permanently closed & heap leach processing will no longer take place at\nÇöpler; Continuing discussions with Turkish government officials around the final remediation plan\n• INCIDENT REVIEW: Following the Incident, the Company commissioned independent experts to\nreview the design, construction and operation of the heap leach facility\n• To-date this review has not identified any material non-conformance with the construction or\n3\noperation of the heap leach facility relative to the third-party engineered design parameters\n• The initial design of the heap leach facility prepared prior to commencing production in 2010, and each\nsubsequent expansion thereafter, was engineered, reviewed, and approved by independent, third-party\nengineering firms\n• PREPARING FOR RESTART: Continuing to work closely with the relevant authorities to secure the\nrequired permits for the restart\n4\n• Once all necessary regulatory approvals, including the operating permits, are reinstated, it is anticipated that\ninitial operations at Çöpler could restart within 20 days; would consist of processing a combination of stockpiled\nore and ore mined from Çakmaktepe while the remediation work continues\nPAGE 3\nPlease see endnotes and cautionary notes for a discussion on the Çöpler Incident\n2024 Third Quarter Results\nQuarterly Operating Summary\n▪ Consolidated production was 97.4 k GEOs at cost of sales of $1,438/oz and AISC of $2,065/oz(1)\n▪ At Marigold, production was 48.2 koz gold at cost of sales of $1,573/oz and AISC of $1,828/oz\n▪ At Seabee, production was 10.3 koz gold at cost of sales of $1,280/oz and AISC of $2,301/oz\n▪ At Puna, production was 2.9 Moz silver at cost of sales of $16.06/oz silver and AISC of $15.37/oz silver\n▪ At Çöpler, operations remained suspended following February 13, 2024 Incident\n▪ Production and costs at Seabee impacted by the temporarily suspension on August 21, 2024 due to forest fires in\nthe vicinity of the mine;

All values on a 100% basis. The Çöpler remediation and containment work is estimated to cost between $250.0 to $300.0 million and take a total of 24 to 36 months to complete. At this time, we are not able\nto estimate or predict when and under what conditions we will resume operations at Çöpler. Additionally, SSR Mining cannot, at this time, assess the entire scope of the impact of operating under the 2014 EIA. Further updates on the Çöpler Incident, as and\nwhen available will continue to be provided through press releases and updates to the Company’s website. Please refer to our website at www.ssrmining.com, or our filings on SEDAR at www.sedarplus.ca, on EDGAR at www.sec.gov and on the ASX at\nwww.asx.com.au.\n2) The Company reports Non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted attributable net income (loss), adjusted attributable net income (loss) per share, total debt, total cash, net debt (cash), total liquidity, adjusted EBITDA, cash provided by (used in) operating\nactivities before changes in working capital, free cash flow (FCF), free cash flow before changes in working capital, cash costs and AISC per ounce sold to manage and evaluate its operating performance at its mines. These Non-GAAP Measures have no\nstandardized definition under U.S GAAP. For explanations of these measures and reconciliations to the most comparable financial measure calculated under U.S. GAAP, please see “Cautionary Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures“ and “Non-GAAP\nReconciliations” in this presentation for additional details. See also the Company’s 10-K and 10-Q filings, available on our website at www.ssrmining.com, on EDGAR at www.sec.gov, on SEDAR at www.sedarplus.ca, and on the ASX at www.asx.com.au, for\ndetailed definitions of these Non-GAAP measures.\n3) Financial and operations amounts presented in this presentation may not add due to rounding.\n4) The 2019 convertible notes mature on April 1, 2039 and bear interest at 2.50% payable semi-annually and are convertible by holders into the Company’s common shares, based on an initial conversion rate of 56.7931 common shares per $1,000 principal\namount.

These costs had been appropriately capitalized in prior periods, but had been reported as expense rather than capital in the AISC table. The update to the presentation\nfor these costs did not impact the AISC per ounce calculation.\n3) Care and maintenance expense only includes direct costs not associated with environmental reclamation and remediation costs, as depreciation is not included in the calculation of AISC.\n4) Gold equivalent ounces are calculated by multiplying the silver ounces by the ratio of the silver price to the gold price, using the average LBMA prices for the period. The Company does not include by-products in the gold equivalent ounce calculations. Gold equivalent ounces sold may not add based on amounts presented in this table due\nto rounding.

The non-GAAP financial measures are employed by us to measure our operating and economic performance and to assist in decision-\nmaking, as well as to provide key performance information to senior management. We believe that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, certain investors and other stakeholders will find this information useful to evaluate our\noperating and financial performance; however, these non-GAAP performance measures – including total cash, total debt, net cash (debt), cash costs, all-in sustaining costs (“AISC”) per ounce sold, adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders, cash\ngenerated by (used in) operating activities before changes in working capital, free cash flow, and free cash flow before changes in working capital– do not have any standardized meaning. These performance measures are intended to provide additional information\nand should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our definition of our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. These\nnon-GAAP measures should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements. Readers should also refer to the endnotes in this presentation for further information regarding how the Company calculates certain of these measures.\nSSRM:NASDAQ / TSX, SSR:ASX PAGE 2\nÇöpler Incident Update\nAs of July 31, 2024\n• All nine of our colleagues lost as a result of the February 13, 2024 Incident have now been recovered\n• More than 13 million tonnes, or approximately 70%, of the displaced heap leach material at Çöpler\nRECOVERY,\nhave been moved into temporary storage locations, including +9 million tonnes moved from the\nCONTAINMENT &\nSabırlı Valley (1)\nREMEDIATION\n• All containment infrastructure within the Sabırlı Valley successfully in place\nEFFORTS\n• Public statements from the Turkish government have continued to affirm that there has been no\nrecordable contamination to local soil, water or air in the sampling locations\n• All displaced material is expected to be removed from the Sabırlı Valley into temporary storage areas\nby the end of Q3 2024\n• SSR Mining is working closely with the relevant authorities to secure the required permits\nTIMELINE &\n• Once all necessary regulatory approvals, including the EIA and operating permits, are reinstated, it is\nNEXT STEPS\nanticipated that initial production at Çöpler will focus on processingthe +700koz of existing surface\nstockpilesthrough thesulfide plant\n• Çöpler has maintained a full complement of salaried staff since theIncident\n• In Q2 2024, $55 million was spent on remediation activities at Çöpler\n• Total site remediation cost forecast of $250 to $300 million\nFINANCIAL\n• At the end of Q2 2024, SSRM had total cash of $358 million and +$850 million in available liquidity\nCONSIDERATIONS\n• SSR Mining has commissioned independent third parties to review the design, construction and\n& INCIDENT\noperation of the heap leach pad\nREVIEW\n• Çöpler Incident review is ongoing and to-date these reviews have not identified any material non-\nconformance with the construction or operation of the heap leach pad relative to the third-party\nengineered design parameters\nPAGE 3\nNote: Cost estimates are stated on 100% basis;

Forward-looking information may be contained in this document and our other public filings. Forward-looking information relates to statements concerning our outlook and anticipated events or results and in some cases, can be\nidentified by terminology such as “may”, “will”, “could”, “should”, “expect”, “plan”, “anticipate”, “believe”, “intend”, “estimate”, “projects”, “predict”, “potential”, “continue” or other similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts, as well as statements\nwritten in the future tense. When made, forward-looking statements are based on information known to management at such time and/or management’s good faith belief with respect to future events. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could\ncause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in the Company's forward-looking statements. Many of these factors are beyond the Company's ability to control or predict. Given these uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place\nundue reliance on forward-looking statements.\nThe key risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: local and global political and economic conditions; governmental and regulatory requirements and actions by governmental authorities, including changes in government policy, government ownership\nrequirements, changes in environmental, tax and other laws or regulations and the interpretation thereof; developments with respect to global pandemics, including the duration, severity and scope of a pandemic and potential impacts on mining operations; risks and\nuncertainties resulting from the incident at Çöpler described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter end March 31, 2024; and other risk factors detailed from time to time in the\nCompany’s reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on EDGAR at www.sec.gov the Canadian securities regulatory authorities on SEDAR at www.sedarplus.ca and on our website at www.ssrmining.com.\nForward-looking information and statements in this presentation include any statements concerning, among other things: all information related to the Company’s Çöpler operations, including timelines, outlook, preliminary costs, remediation plans, and possible restart\nplans; forecasts and outlook; preliminary cost reporting in this document; timing, production, operating, cost, and capital expenditure guidance; our operational and development targets and catalysts and the impact of any suspensions on operations; the results of any\ngold reconciliations; the ability to discover additional oxide gold ore; the generation of free cash flow and payment of dividends; matters relating to proposed exploration; communications with local stakeholders; maintaining community and government relations;\nnegotiations of joint ventures; negotiation and completion of transactions; commodity prices; Mineral Resources, Mineral Reserves, conversion of Mineral Resources, realization of Mineral Reserves, and the existence or realization of Mineral Resource estimates; the\ndevelopment approach; the timing and amount of future production; the timing of studies, announcements, and analysis; the timing of construction and development of proposed mines and process facilities; capital and operating expenditures; economic conditions;\navailability of sufficient financing; exploration plans; receipt of regulatory approvals; timing and impact surrounding suspension or interruption of operations as a result of regulatory requirements or actions by governmental authority; renewal of NCIB program; and any\nand all other timing, exploration, development, operational, financial, budgetary, economic, legal, social, environmental, regulatory, and political matters that may influence or be influenced by future events or conditions.\nSuch forward-looking information and statements are based on a number of material factors and assumptions, including, but not limited in any manner to, those disclosed in any other of our filings on EDGAR and SEDAR, and include: any assumptions made in respect\nof the Company’s Çöpler operations; the inherent speculative nature of exploration results; the ability to explore; communications with local stakeholders; maintaining community and governmental relations; status of negotiations of joint ventures; weather conditions at\nour operations; commodity prices; the ultimate determination of and realization of Mineral Reserves; existence or realization of Mineral Resources; the development approach; availability and receipt of required approvals, titles, licenses and permits; sufficient working\ncapital to develop and operate the mines and implement development plans; access to adequate services and supplies; foreign currency exchange rates; interest rates; access to capital markets and associated cost of funds; availability of a qualified work force; ability\nto negotiate, finalize, and execute relevant agreements; lack of social opposition to our mines or facilities; lack of legal challenges with respect to our properties; the timing and amount of future production; the ability to meet production, cost, and capital expenditure\ntargets; timing and ability to produce studies and analyses; capital and operating expenditures; economic conditions; availability of sufficient financing; the ultimate ability to mine, process, and sell mineral products on economically favorable terms; and any and all other\ntiming, exploration, development, operational, financial, budgetary, economic, legal, social, geopolitical, regulatory and political factors that may influence future events or conditions. While we consider these factors and assumptions to be reasonable based on\ninformation currently available to us, they may prove to be incorrect.\nSuch factors are not exhaustive of the factors that may affect any of the Company’s forward-looking statements and information, and such statements and information will not be updated to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date of such statements or to\nreflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. Forward-looking information and statements are only predictions based on our current estimates and assumptions Actual results may vary materially from such forward-looking information.

The non-GAAP financial measures are employed by us to measure our operating and economic performance and to assist in decision-making,\nas well as to provide key performance information to senior management. We believe that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, certain investors and other stakeholders will find this information useful to evaluate our operating and\nfinancial performance; however, these non-GAAP performance measures – including total cash, total debt, net cash (debt), cash costs, all-in sustaining costs (“AISC”) per ounce sold, adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders, cash generated by (used in)\noperating activities before changes in working capital, free cash flow, and free cash flow before changes in working capital– do not have any standardized meaning. These performance measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be\nconsidered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our definition of our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. These non-GAAP\nmeasures should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements. Readers should also refer to the endnotes in this presentation for further information regarding how the Company calculates certain of these measures.\nSSRM:NASDAQ / TSX, SSR:ASX PAGE 2\nÇöpler Incident: Situation Update and Next Steps\nUpdate as of May 8, 2024\n▪ Primary focus is on the return of our five missing colleagues to their families\n•\nRecovery ▪ To-date 6.7 million tonnes of heap leach material has been relocated, including 4.2 •\n•\nmillion tonnes from the Sabırlı Valley\n•\n▪ Removal of all displaced heap leach material out of the Sabırlı Valley and into\ntemporary storage locations expected to be completed in Q3 2024\nContainment ▪ Containment efforts have been completed alongside the removal of displaced\nmaterial with the installation of a grout curtain, coffer dam, and buttress, and the\nongoing installation of pumping systems and diversion channels in the Sabırlı Valley\n▪ Remediation plan progressing following consultation and evaluations with various\nTurkish government agencies, ministries, independent experts and external\nconsultants\n▪ Remediation plan to be submitted for approval in Q2 2024 and will include:\n▪ Construction of the East Storage Facility, designed for permanently storing the 18\nRemediation Proposed\nto 20 million tonnes of displaced heap leach material East Storage\nFacility Location\n▪ Permanent closure of heap leach pad\nDiversion\nDisplaced\n▪ Current remediation cost estimated between $250M to $300M, on a 100% basis, in Channel &\nHeap Leach\nPumps\naddition to the $22.5M incurred as of March 31, 2024;

For additional cautionary notes and assumptions regarding the Hod Maden project referenced within this presentation, readers should refer to the Company’s Investor Presentation and news release related to the transaction on May 8,\n2023, filed as a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC and available under the Company’s corporate profile on EDGAR at www.sec.gov or on the Company’s website at www.ssrmining.com. Actual results may vary from such forward-looking information for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to,\nrisks and uncertainties disclosed in the Company’s filings on the Company’s website at www.ssrmining.com, on EDGAR at www.sec.gov, on SEDAR at www.sedarplus.ca, and on the ASX at www.asx.com.au and other unforeseen events or circumstances. Other than as required by law, the Company does\nnot intend, and undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking information to reflect, among other things, new information or future events.\nAll references to “$” in this presentation are to U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated.\nQualified Persons\nThe scientific and technical information concerning our mineral projects in this presentation have been reviewed and approved by a “qualified person” under subpart 1 of Regulation S-K 1300 (“S-K 1300”). For details on the “qualified persons” approving such information, a description of the key assumptions,\nparameters and methods used to estimate mineral reserves and mineral resources included in this presentation, as well as data verification procedures and a general discussion of the extent to which the estimates may be affected by any known environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, sociopolitical,\nmarketing or other relevant factors, please review the Technical Report Summaries for each of the Company’s material properties which are available under the Company’s corporate profile on EDGAR at www.sec.gov. 2022 Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources were determined in accordance with\nRegulation S-K. Reserves and resources for prior periods were determined in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”). Both sets of reporting standards have similar goals in terms of conveying an appropriate level of confidence in the\ndisclosures being reported, but the standards embody slightly different approaches and definitions.\nCautionary Note Regarding Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources Estimates\nThis presentation includes terms that comply with reporting standards in Canada under NI 43-101, including the terms “Mineral Reserves” and “Mineral Resources”, in addition to terms that comply with reporting standards in the United States under S-K 1300. NI 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian\nSecurities Administrators that establishes standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects. The standards of NI 43-101 differ significantly from the requirements of the SEC. Accordingly, information concerning mineral deposits set forth\nherein may not be comparable with information made in accordance with U.S. standards.\nCautionary Note Regarding Non-GAAP Measures\nThis presentation includes certain non-GAAP terms or performance measures commonly used in the mining industry, including free cash flow, cash costs and AISC per ounce of gold and silver sold, adjusted attributable net income, adjusted basic attributable net income per share, consolidated cash and\nconsolidated net cash. Non-GAAP measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed and, therefore, they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies. The Company believe that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, certain\ninvestors use this information to evaluate the Company’s performance. The data presented is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Readers should refer to the endnotes in this\npresentation for further information regarding how the Company calculates certain of these measures. Readers should also refer to the Company’s form 10-K and 10-Q filings available under the Company’s corporate profile on EDGAR at www.sec.gov or on the Company’s website at www.ssrmining.com,\nunder the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a more detailed discussion of how the Company calculates such measures and a reconciliation of certain measures to GAAP terms.
