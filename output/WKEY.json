are pleased to report that WISeKey has remained financially strong during 2022. The divestiture of arago GmbH had a positive impact on our liquidity, as it reduced cash burn by approximately 40% and allowed us to focus on revenue generating investments.\n\nDuring the year, we continued to make progress on our strategic initiatives and invest in our future growth. It is likely that technology foundations of WISeKey will continue to advance and play a significant role in many aspects of daily life in 2023. Some areas that may see significant developments in the next few years include AI, virtual and augmented reality, IoT, NFTs, quantum and cybersecurity. There may also be continued progress in fields such as robotics and space low orbit satellites. WISeKey is well positioned to take advantage of the growing demand for these technologies.\n\n![](https://cdn.wisekey.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2023-05-03-at-14.42.17-1024x895.png)\n\n**$20.7M**|  Cash at 12/31/2022  \n---|---  \n**$10.1M**|  Gross profit  \n**42.4%**|  Gross profit margin  \n  \n## 2022 Key Financial and Operational Highlights: \n\n  * **Revenue growth:** 35% increase in revenue to $23.8 million in the year 2022, compared to $17.6 million in 2021.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.wisekey.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2023-05-03-at-14.45.19-768x459.png)\n\n  * **Cash position remains strong** with $20.7 million cash available at December 31, 2022.\n  * **Increase in semiconductors production capacity** : in 2022, WISeKey initiated a 5-year capital expenditure (“CapEx”) plan to increase its semiconductors volume by up to 80% over the next 5 years. The plan is supported by a $2 million loan from a third party client for the purpose of increasing production capacity.\n  * **Cost structure efficiency improvements** : our operating expenses decreased by $8.1 million and by $5 million when excluding non-cash stock-based compensation in comparison to 2021, showing our successful efforts to streamline our cost base while still being able to grow our revenue.\n  * **Strong investments in Research & Development** (“R&D”): we continue to support our R&D work with $3.9 million invested during the year. In 2022:\n    * we initiated our **QUASARS** project (for QUAntum resistant Secure ARchitectureS), a radical innovative solution paving the way of Post Quantum Cryptography era, and\n    * we launched 13 security-IoT hardened low-orbit picosatellites, **WISeSat** , for our new satellite-based secure IoT connectivity-as-a-service, through which WISeKey provides the satellite platform, launch, integration, ground station services and all the security architecture and components, as part of a turnkey SaaS solution for low-power and secure space-based IoT connectivity, in collaboration with FOSSA Systems S.L. (“FOSSA”).\n  * **M &A activity**: divestiture of our 51% controlling interest in arago GmbH (“arago”) which freed up liquidity for the continuing operations of WISeKey and had a positive impact on its cash flow forecasts.\n  * **Strengthening our Sales and Marketing** (“S&M”) organization: the Group has continued reinforcing its sales and marketing team with a new sales director in the U.S.A. and the onboarding of 7 additional sales representatives in the E.U. region, Israel and South Africa and 2 representatives which will cover the Eastern states of the United States.\n  * **Development of the WISe.ART NFT auction platform** : an innovative platform where WISeKey adds identification to the emerging NFT trade market, therefore ensuring that NFTs sold on its platform are genuine. The WISe.ART platform now includes over 1000 artworks by over 100 artists worldwide ranging from traditional art, video art to 3 dimensional AI productions.\n\n\n\n## 2023 Key Growth Areas\n\nWISeKey International Holding is transitioning into a new strategic direction that will see it operate as a holding company of several distinctive operational companies covering the full spectrum of WISeKey-related technologies:\n\n  * the Root of Trust and PKI at WISeKey SA,\n  * semiconductors and Quantum technology with SEALSQ and WISeKey Semiconductors\n  * Space technology using Picosatellites under WISeSat.Space, and\n  * Trusted Blockchain NFT with WISe.ART Corp.\n\n\n\nAs a holding company giving strategic directions, WISeKey has taken several initiatives to continue growing revenue and strengthen net results. These initiatives include:\n\n  * **New strategic partnerships and investments in sales and marketing** to strengthen its position as IoT cybersecurity provider and to develop new use cases based on our established technologies. Our objective in 2023 is to grow our sales team in Asia with key recruitments in Taiwan, expend our sales force in the U.S., and sign up 5 additional sales representatives and 3 resellers.\n  * **Space** – building a joint constellation with FOSSA of 88 low-orbit satellites by end of 2024 to drive mass adoption of satellite-enabled IoT through secure interoperable and standardized connectivity using LPWAN technologies such as LoRa or NB-IoT. The WISeSat constellation will enable us to support Global Decentralized IoT Communications, a project that is building towards commercial deployment in the second half of 2023 when we believe our partnership agreement with the Swiss Army will become effective.\n  * Continued development of the **ART NFT auction platform** in conjunction with Polygon and CasperLabs, a product for which we have a patent pending, which would potentially add to our extensive patent portfolio. We are starting to bring revenues by charging commissions on the sales that are carried out on the WISe.ART platform which is a percentage of the total sale and depends upon multiple factors. In 2023, WISeKey expects to sign partnerships with Hedera and Italpreziosi for an even wider coverage, allowing for significant community growth, collectors’ transactions and new NFTs business.\n  * **Investment in post-quantum cryptography** that are resistant against quantum cryptanalysis so as to anticipate on future cybersecurity threats, working in collaboration with the American National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA).\n  * Planned investment in **new equipment to increase the production volume of semiconductors** with a 5-year CapEx plan to increase its semiconductors volume by up to 80% over the next 5 years.\n  * **Investment in R &D** to expand its patent portfolio.\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nNotifications\n\n  * [![Secure IoT](https://cdn.wisekey.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/blockchain1.png)Blockchain](https://www.wisekey.com/the-wisekey-blockchain/)\n  * [![Secure IoT](https://cdn.wisekey.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/identity.png)WISeID](https://www.wisekey.com/products-services/digital-identity-pki/wiseid-identity-platform/)\n  * [ ![Root of trust](https://cdn.wisekey.com/uploads/images/wisekey-i-rot.png)Trust Services ](https://www.wisekey.com/products-services/digital-identity-pki/trust-services/)\n  * [![Brand protection](https://cdn.wisekey.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/brand1.png)Brand protection ](https://www.wisekey.com/solutions/brand-protection/)\n  * [ ![Secure Microcontrollers](https://cdn.wisekey.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/semi.png)Secure Microcontrollers ](https://www.wisekey.com/vaultic/secure-microcontrollers/)\n\n\n  * [![](https://cdn.wisekey.com/uploads/images/wisekey-i-press.png)Press](https://www.wisekey.com/press/)\n  * [![](https://cdn.wisekey.com/uploads/images/wisekey-i-ct.png)Contact Us](https://www.wisekey.com/about/contact/)\n\n\n"

Reduction of the Nominal Value of the Shares\nProposal of the Board of Directors: The Board of Directors proposes to approve:\n(A) a reduction of the nominal value of:\n(i) each registered share of the Company with a nominal value of CHF 2.50 (each a Class B\nShare) by an amount of CHF 2.40 to CHF 0.10; and\n(ii) each registered share of the Company with a nominal value of CHF 0.25 (each a Class A\nShare, and together with the Class B Shares, the Shares) by an amount of CHF 0.24 to\nCHF 0.01\n3 / 16\nand an allocation of the aggregate nominal value reduction amount of CHF 8,461,555.201 to the\nCompany's statutory capital reserves from capital contribution; and\n(B) the respective amendments to the Articles of Association of the Company (the Nominal Value\nReduction).\nThe text of the proposed shareholder resolution regarding the Nominal Value Reduction, which specifies\nthe proposed amendments to the Articles of Association, is contained in Annex A to this Invitation.\nExplanation: The Company has successfully secured equity financing post the reverse stock split\napproved by shareholders at the 2023 Annual General Meeting, demonstrating our ability to attract third-\nparty investment and maintain access to capital markets. To further strengthen our financial foundation and\nensure ongoing access to equity capital markets, the Board recommends adjusting the nominal value of\nthe Company's shares. The Board believes this strategic move will further enhance our long-term financing\nflexibility, aligning with the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.\nThe reduction in the nominal value of the shares will not result in the issuance of any new Shares. Further,\nthe aggregate nominal value reduction amount will not be distributed to shareholders, and accordingly, the\nCompany's current equity will not be reduced. Rather, the aggregate nominal value reduction will be\nallocated from the Company's stated share capital to the Company's statutory capital reserves from capital\ncontribution.\nIf the Nominal Value Reduction is approved by shareholders, the existing conditional share capital of the\nCompany will be formally adjusted to reflect the reduction in the nominal value of the Class A Shares and\nthe Class B Shares, as further specified in Annex A to this invitation. The number of Class A Shares and\nClass B Shares authorized for issuance under the existing conditional share capital will remain unchanged.\nTo effect the Nominal Value Reduction, BDO SA, Vernier, Switzerland, the Company’s statutory auditor, will\nbe required to deliver a report in accordance with article 653m para. 1 of the Swiss Code of Obligations (CO)\nconfirming that the receivables of the creditors of the Company will continue to be fully covered after giving\neffect to the Nominal Value Reduction.\n1 The reduction amount of CHF 8,461,555.20 is based on the number of Shares issued as of the date of this Invitation.\nAfter publication of this Invitation, the Company may issue new Shares on the basis of its capital band or conditional\nshare capital, including, but not limited to, to participants under the Company's share-based incentive plans and/or to\nsatisfy obligations under warrants, convertible financial instruments and similar instruments issued by it. If new Shares\nare issued, the reduction amount referred to above would be increased accordingly. Any such newly issued Shares\nwould be registered with the commercial register prior to the registration of the Nominal Value Reduction in the\ncommercial register.\n4 / 16\nIn order to accomplish a share capital reduction through the reduction of nominal value of shares, the Board\nmust inform the Company's creditors by way of a publication in the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce\n(SHAB) that they may request security by submitting their claims within 30 days of publication in the SHAB.\nThe Board plans to publish the notice to the creditors prior to the AGM. If approved by shareholders and all\nfurther requirements for the capital reduction set forth in the CO are fulfilled, the Board will amend the\nArticles of Association to reflect the capital reduction. We expect that the share capital reduction will be\naccomplished by the end of July 2024 at the latest.\nRecommendation: The Board of Directors recommends you vote \"FOR\" this proposal number 4.\n5. Re-affirmation of the Company's Capital Band\nProposal of the Board: Subject to the approval of the Nominal Value Reduction by the shareholders, the\nBoard proposes that shareholders reaffirm the Company's capital band in article 4a of its Articles of\nAssociation. The wording of the proposed reaffirmed article 4a of the Articles of Association regarding the\nCompany's capital band would remain identical, except for changes necessary to implement the change in\nthe nominal value of the Shares resulting from the Nominal Value Reduction, which are highlighted in\nAnnex B to this Invitation.\nExplanation: Under Swiss corporate law, the capital band expires if shareholders approve a capital\nreduction at a general meeting. Although the Nominal Value Reduction proposed under agenda item 4\nconstitutes only a formal change in the Company's share capital and does not affect the Company's freely\navailable equity, it qualifies as a capital reduction that would cause the capital band to expire if approved.\nAs a result, if the Nominal Value Reduction is approved by the shareholders, the Board proposes to\nshareholders to reaffirm the Company's capital band in order to prevent its expiration. The characteristics\nof the reaffirmed capital band would be identical to those pursuant to the current article 4a of the Articles of\nAssociation, except for (i) the nominal value of the Shares, (ii) the lower and upper limits of the capital band,\nwhich will be adjusted relative to the reduced stated share capital, (iii) the maximum admissible nominal\namounts by which the share capital may be increased or reduced, which will be adjusted relative to the\nreduced stated share capital, and (iv) the expiry date of the capital band (which is proposed to be amended\nto correspond to the fifth anniversary date of this AGM). These changes are highlighted in Annex B to this\nInvitation.\nRecommendation: The Board recommends you vote \"FOR\" this proposal number 5.\n6.
