We anticipate capital expenditures in Q4 2024 to exceed the amount spent in the\nfirst nine months of 2024 as we plan to accelerate investments in GPU procurement and data center capacity\nexpansion to support the growth of our businesses.\n• Cash outflow from operations amounted to USD 45.9 million and USD 255.3 million for three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively.\nConsolidated results (1), (2)\nIn USD millions Three mont hs ended Sept ember 30, Nine month s ended Sept ember 30,\n2023 2024 Change 2023 2024 Change\nRevenues 5.0 43.3 766% 14.2 79.6 461%\nAdjusted EBITDA / (loss) (67.6) (51.9) -23% (201.5) (190.9) -5%\nNet loss from continuing operations (96.8) (51.8) -46% (248.3) (259.4) 4%\nAdjusted net loss (86.5) (47.3) -45% (235.6) (200.2) -15%\n(1) The following measures presented in this release are “non-GAAP financial measures”: Adjusted EBITDA / (loss) and Adjusted net income / (loss). Please see the section “Use\nof Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for a discussion of how we define these measures, as well as reconciliations at the end of this release of each of these measures to\nthe most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\n(2) Following the completion of the divestment of the Russia-based businesses, the Group changed the reporting currency from the Russian Ruble to the United States Dollar,\nwhich better reflects the geography of operations and key focus markets of the remaining businesses. Financial statements for the prior periods have been restated as if the\nchange had occurred on January 1, 2022.\n1\nNebius\n• In Q3 2024, Nebius (the Group’s core AI infrastructure business) accounted for approximately two-thirds of the\nGroup's total revenue.\n• Nebius’ cloud revenue surged 2.7 times QoQ (almost 8 times YoY against the low base), with annualized run-rate\n(ARR)(1) surpassing USD 120 million as of September 2024.\n• The customer base expanded to over 40 managed clients in Q3 2024, up from 30 in Q2, with additions from the\nFortune 500.\n• Nebius began executing its plan to invest over USD 1 billion(2) in AI infrastructure across Europe by mid-2025. In\nSeptember 2024, Nebius announced the launch of a GPU cluster in Paris, which will become one of the first in\nEurope to feature NVIDIA H200 Tensor Core GPUs. Shortly afterwards, Nebius announced a major expansion of its\ndata center in Finland to triple capacity to 75 MW by the end of 2025 or early 2026. This will enable Nebius to\naccommodate up to 60,000 GPUs(3) at this location alone, with annual revenue potential of over USD 1 billion at full\ncapacity utilization.(4)\n• To capitalize on growth opportunities, Nebius introduced a number of strategic product developments:\no Introduced Nebius AI Studio, a high-performance, cost-efficient self-service inference platform for foundation\nmodel users and application developers, offering a wide range of state-of-the-art open-source models,\nincluding Llama, Mistral and more.\no Launched a specialized cloud platform for AI built on the NVIDIA accelerated computing framework (in early\nQ4).\no Expanded its cloud services portfolio with offerings such as Soperator and Managed PostgreSQL for IK8S.\n(1) Annualized run-rate revenue by the end of the period (revenue for last month of the period multiplied by twelve).\n(2) Including the investments of approximately USD 400 million during the first nine months of 2024 ending September 30, 2024.\n(3) In H100 equivalent.\n(4) Based on assumed utilization and pricing as per the company’s medium-term financial plan (as of September 2024).\nToloka\n• In Q3 2024, Toloka was the second largest contributor to the Group’s total revenue.\n• In Q3 2024, Toloka demonstrated strong traction in Generative AI projects, which accounted for over 85% of Toloka's\ntotal revenue in Q3 2024 and grew more than fourfold YoY. We believe this underscores growing demand for Toloka’s\nAI solutions in the expanding generative AI market.\n• Gross margins for Generative AI services ranged from the high forties to low fifties percent in Q3, driven by production\nefficiencies, increased automation and the effective use of synthetic data. Toloka plans to build on these efficiency\ngains while investing in further platform enhancements and data production capabilities.\n• In addition to being one of the major data providers for a Big Tech foundational model producer, Toloka strengthened\nits customer portfolio with a number of leading specialized LLM producers, further diversifying its line-up of Generative\nAI customers.\n• Toloka’s research team, in collaboration with top universities, developed the Ultimate Benchmark for AI-Generated\nText Detection and the Math Dataset Benchmark, which will support future efforts to expand client offerings and\nenhance expertise in specialized domains.\n• Toloka reinforced its commitment to strong data security, securing a SOC 2 report after completing an audit and\nconfirming compliance with stringent standards for data security and privacy set by the American Institute of CPAs.\nTripleTen\n• TripleTen’s revenue growth in Q3 2024 was driven by a threefold increase YoY in the number of students enrolled in\nits bootcamp across key markets in the US and Latin America, as well as more than threefold growth YoY in\nbookings.(1)\n• During the nine months ending September 30, 2024, almost 10,000 new students joined TripleTen for reskilling.\n2\n• In Q3 2024, TripleTen’s B2C offering grew to six courses after the launch of a UX/UI Designer program, which is\nexpected to positively impact the number of bookings by growing the student base.\n(1) Represents the total value of anticipated payments based on the amount of students who have made an initial payment for a course.\nAvride\n• In Q3 2024, Avride entered into a multiyear strategic partnership with Uber, bringing Avride’s delivery robots and\nautonomous vehicles to Uber and Uber Eats platforms. The delivery partnership will launch first with sidewalk robots\non Uber Eats in Austin and then expand to Dallas and Jersey City. As part of the partnership, Avride plans to\nintegrate hundreds of robots into Uber Eats in 2025, with mobility partnerships expected to launch for rides in Dallas\nlater that year.\n• During the quarter, Avride continued negotiations with several food- and ridetech companies to expand its commercial\nreach and scale operations within and outside the US market.\n• In Q3 2024, Avride regularly tested autonomous vehicles on public roads, utilizing its new autonomous car platform.\n• Assembly of the next generation delivery robots, offering improved energy efficiency, maneuverability, redundancy,\nand overall cost-effectiveness, began at the Group’s Taiwan manufacturing partner, with tests of the new model\nongoing.\nWebcast information\nNebius Group’s management will hold an earnings webcast on October 31 at 5:00 AM (PDT) / 8:00 AM (EDT) / 1:00 PM\n(CET).\nTo access the webcast, please use the registration link below:\nhttps://goldmansachs.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_YqZyrAQBRDijLCDhmEcSJQ\nCorporate and subsequent events\n• On August 14, 2024, the company held its Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, during which shareholders\napproved, among other things, the renaming of the Company to Nebius Group N.V.; the appointment of five new\ndirectors to the Board, comprising two executive directors, Arkady Volozh (CEO) and Ophir Nave (COO), and three\nnon-executive directors, Elena Bunina, Esther Dyson and Kira Radinsky; amendments to the Company’s Equity\nIncentive Plan; and an authorization for the Board of Directors to repurchase shares for a period of 18 months starting\nfrom the date of the AGM.\n• On October 2, 2024, the Company announced that it has appointed Goldman Sachs as exclusive financial advisor to\nreview certain strategic options to enable the acceleration of planned investments in its core AI infrastructure\nbusiness.\n• On October 21, 2024, trading in the Company’s Class A ordinary shares resumed on Nasdaq, following a notification\nfrom the Nasdaq Hearing Panel on October 8, 2024, that the Company regained compliance with the Listing Rules of\nthe Nasdaq Stock Market, and a notice from the exchange on October 17, 2024, regarding the scheduled resumption.\n• In connection with the settlement of the Company’s $1.25 billion convertible notes in 2022, the Company agreed to\ntransfer an aggregate of approximately 5.7 million Class A shares to former noteholders. Of this total, approximately\n2.5 million shares were delivered in 2022; approximately 344,000 further shares were delivered in Q3 2024, and\napproximately 2.4 million further shares have been delivered to date in Q4. The Company has obligations to deliver\nup to approximately 400,000 additional Class A shares to remaining former noteholders. As of October 30, the\nnumber of Class A shares outstanding is 166,073,181 shares (excluding 160,269,089 shares held in treasury) and the\nnumber of Class B shares outstanding is 35,698,674. The total number of shares outstanding as of October 30 is\n201,771,855.\nGoldman Sachs Bank Europe SE, Amsterdam Branch (“Goldman Sachs”) is acting for Nebius Group N.V. and no one else in\nconnection with Nebius Group N.V.’s review of strategic options and will not be responsible to anyone else for providing the\nprotections afforded to clients of Goldman Sachs, or for giving advice in connection with this review or any other matter\nreferred to herein.\n3\nLoss from operations\nIn USD millions Three mont hs ended Sept ember 30, Nine month s ended Septe mber 30,\n2023 2024 Change 2023 2024 Change\nLoss from operations (77.6) (87.0) 12% (230.0) (291.4) 27%\nLoss from operations amounted to USD 87.0 million in Q3 2024 compared to USD 77.6 million in Q3 2023. This was mainly\ndue to the planned growth of our businesses partially offset by improving operational efficiencies and a positive operating\nleverage on the back of increased revenue especially in the core AI infrastructure business.\nOther income/(loss), net for Q3 2024 amounted to income of USD 6.8 million compared to a loss of USD 7.7 million in Q3\n2023. Other income/(loss), net includes foreign exchange gain of USD 5.5 million in Q3 2024 and a foreign exchange loss of\nUSD 6.4 million in Q3 2023.\nNet loss from continuing operations was USD 51.8 million in Q3 2024, compared with net loss of USD 96.8 million in Q3\n2023. The reduced losses is primarily due to interest income of USD 28.6 million in Q3 2024 compared to USD 0.5 million in\nQ3 2023, which more than offset an increase in operating expenses as a result of the expansion of our businesses.\nA significant portion of the consideration for the divested businesses was received in the form of the Company’s Class A\nShares. The acquisition of such shares by the Company is treated as a repurchase by the Company of its own shares for\nDutch tax purposes, which would be subject to withholding tax at a rate of 15%. However, we anticipate that all or a\nsignificant portion of these shares so acquired will qualify as \"temporary investments\", given our intention to use such shares\nfor our employee equity incentive program and for further financing purposes, and therefore will be exempt from withholding\ntax. The Company has not recognized any tax liability in respect of these shares. The accounting position may change in\nfuture periods, depending on new facts and circumstances, which would result in the recognition of a liability for tax in this\nregard.\nOutstanding Shares; Convertible Note Settlement; Equity Awards\nThe total number of shares issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2024 was 199,340,118, including 163,641,444\nClass A shares and 35,698,674 Class B shares, and excluding 162,700,826 Class A shares held in treasury. The number of\nClass A shares received as a part of consideration for the divestment is 162,485,725 Class A shares, which are held in\ntreasury pending use under the Company’s equity incentive plans and for financing purposes.\nIn connection with the settlement of the Company’s $1.25 billion convertible notes in 2022, the Company agreed to transfer an\naggregate of approximately 5.7 million Class A shares to former noteholders. Of this total, approximately 2.5 million shares\nwere delivered in 2022; approximately 344,000 further shares were delivered in Q3 2024, and approximately 2.4 million\nfurther shares have been delivered to date in Q4. The Company has obligations to deliver up to approximately 400,000\nadditional Class A shares to remaining former noteholders.\nAs of October 30, the number of Class A shares outstanding is 166,073,181 shares (excluding 160,269,089 shares held\nin treasury) and the number of Class B shares outstanding is 35,698,674. The total number of shares outstanding as of\nOctober 30 is 201,771,855.\nAs of September 30, 2024, there were also outstanding employee share options to purchase up to an additional 0.8 million\nshares, at a weighted average exercise price of $40.00 per share, all of which are fully vested; equity-settled share\nappreciation rights (SARs) for 0.1 million shares, at a weighted average measurement price of $32.85, all of which were fully\nvested; restricted share units (RSUs) covering 1.1 million shares, of which RSUs to acquire 1.0 million shares were fully\nvested. In addition, we have outstanding awards in respect of our Avride business for 1.2 million shares (representing 3.6% of\nfully diluted shares in Avride), 1.1 million of which were fully vested.\nIn October 2024, the Company resumed making grants under its recently amended Equity Incentive Plan, after a period of 2.5\nyears in which no grants had been made, and approved restricted share unit awards in respect of an aggregate of 8.9 million\nClass A shares. Of these October 2024 grants, approximately 700,000 shares will vest and become tradeable in January\n2025, approximately 1 million shares will become tradable in October 2025, and the remaining 7.2 million shares will vest over\na four-year period following grant, generally quarterly. Going forward, the Company expects that the aggregate number of\nannual awards and new hire grants to be materially lower. The total pool authorized under the Equity Incentive Plan is 30\nmillion Class A shares, and the plan has a ten year duration.\n4\nMore information about Nebius Group can be found at https://group.nebius.com.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis press release contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Many of these risks and uncertainties depend on the\nactions of third parties and are largely outside of our control. Notwithstanding the completion of the full divestment of our\nRussian businesses, we also continue to be subject to many of the risks and uncertainties included under the captions “Risk\nFactors” and “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects” in our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and “Risk Factors” in a shareholder circular filed as Exhibit 99.2 to a Report on Form 6-K filed with the\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 8, 2024, which are available on our investor relations website\nat https://group.nebius.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. All information in this release is as of October 31, 2024,\nand the Company undertakes no duty to update this information unless required by law.\nIn addition, statements that “we believe” and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These\nstatements are based upon information available to us as of the date of this press release, and while we believe such\ninformation forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements\nshould not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant\ninformation. These statements are inherently uncertain, and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements.\nUSE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nTo supplement the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we present the following\nnon-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA/(loss) and Adjusted net income/(loss). The presentation of these financial\nmeasures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared\nand presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the\ntables captioned “Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest comparable U.S. GAAP measures”,\nincluded following the accompanying financial tables. We define the various non-GAAP financial measures we use as follows:\n• Adjusted EBITDA/(loss) means U.S. GAAP net income/(loss) from continuing operations plus (1) depreciation and\namortization, (2) certain SBC expense, (3) interest expense, (4) income tax expense, (5) one-off restructuring and other\nexpenses, less (1) interest income, (2) other income/(loss), net, and (3) income/(loss) from equity method investments.\n• Adjusted net income / (loss) means U.S. GAAP net income/(loss) from continuing operations plus (1) certain SBC\nexpense, (2) one-off restructuring and other expenses, less (1) foreign exchange gains. Tax effects related to the listed\nadjustments are excluded from adjusted net income.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are used by management for evaluating financial performance as well as decision-\nmaking. Management believes that these metrics reflect the organic, core operating performance of the company, and\ntherefore are useful to analysts and investors in providing supplemental information that helps them understand, model and\nforecast the evolution of our operating business.\nAlthough our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for operational decision-making and considers these\nfinancial measures to be useful for analysts and investors, we recognize that there are a number of limitations related to such\nmeasures. In particular, it should be noted that several of these measures exclude some recurring costs, particularly certain\nshare-based compensation. In addition, the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of the measures\ndescribed above may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of\noperations.\n5\nBelow we describe why we make particular adjustments to certain U.S. GAAP financial measures:\nNet income/(loss) from discontinued operations\nNet income/(loss) from discontinued operations represent the results of the divested business, net of tax, net income from\ndiscontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interests, income/(loss) from revaluation of investment in equity\nsecurities held for sale and the result of divestment.\nFollowing the first closing of the divestment, the Company held a remaining interest of approximately 28% in businesses to be\ndivested. This investment was subject to revaluation due to RUB / USD exchange rate fluctuations. Result of revaluation of\ninvestment in these businesses in Q3 2024 was presented within Net income/(loss) from discontinued operations.\nResult of the divestment is calculated as fair value of consideration received plus fair value of the remaining interest in the\ndivested businesses and accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the sold perimeter less net assets of the disposed\nbusiness as of first closing of the divestment. We present Adjusted net loss exсluding any effects of our discontinued\noperations.\nCertain SBC expense\nSBC (Stock-Based Compensation) is a significant expense item and an important part of our compensation and incentive\nprograms. As it is highly dependent on our share price at the time of equity award grants, we believe that it is useful for\ninvestors and analysts to see certain financial measures excluding the impact of these charges in order to obtain a clearer\npicture of our operating performance. However, because we settled the RSU equity awards of our employees in cash during\n2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we no longer eliminate the relevant SBC expense corresponding to\nthe cash payment from Adjusted EBITDA/(loss) and Adjusted net income / (loss).\nForeign exchange gains/(losses)\nBecause we hold certain assets and liabilities in currencies that differ from the United States Dollar, the Company’s current\nreporting currency, and because foreign exchange fluctuations are outside of our operational control, we believe that it is\nuseful to present Adjusted EBITDA/(loss), adjusted net income/(loss) and related margin measures excluding these effects, in\norder to provide greater clarity regarding our operating performance.\nOne-off restructuring and other expenses\nWe believe that it is useful to present Adjusted net income/(loss), Adjusted EBITDA/(loss) and related margin measures\nexcluding impacts not related to our operating activities.

          "content": "Nebius Group(1) Announces Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nAMSTERDAM, the Netherlands, August 1, 2024 – Yandex N.V. (to be renamed to Nebius Group), a Nasdaq-listed tech\ncompany building AI infrastructure businesses, today announced its unaudited financial results for the second quarter ended\nJune 30, 2024.\nQ2 2024 Financial and Operational Highlights\nNebius Group is a technology company based in Europe that is seeking to build one of the largest commercially available AI\ninfrastructure businesses. The company’s core business is an AI-centric cloud platform built for intensive AI workloads, which\noffers full-stack infrastructure, including large-scale GPU clusters, cloud platforms and tools and services, for AI developers.\nIn addition to our core Nebius AI infrastructure business, we are developing three other businesses that operate under their\nown distinctive individual brands:\n• Toloka AI – a data partner for all stages of AI development from training to evaluation;\n• TripleTen – a leading edtech player in the US and certain other markets, re-skilling people for careers in tech;\n• Avride – one of the most experienced teams developing autonomous driving technology for self-driving cars and\ndelivery robots.\nNebius AI\n• In Q2 2024, Nebius AI remained a key contributor to Nebius Group's total revenue.\n• Nebius AI's cloud revenue grew almost 60% QoQ, with ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) exceeding USD 80 million\nas of July 2024.\n• This growth was driven by the scaling of GPU capacity sales across markets, and the expansion and diversification of\nthe client base, particularly through the introduction of a self-service option in early Q2 2024, allowing customers to\naccess GPU resources without traditional sales channels.\n• Nebius AI now serves over 30 managed clients, including prominent names such as Mistral AI, Luma AI (Luma\nDream Machine), JetBrains (IntelliJ IDEA) and others.\n• In Q2 2024, Nebius AI began to expand its computing capacity at the Group’s Finnish data center to meet growing\ndemand, which is expected to triple the facility's capacity upon completion in the first half of 2026. During Q2 2024,\nwe secured the necessary construction permits and began procuring hardware.\n• In the beginning of July 2024, Nebius AI signed an agreement to rent a colocation data center in Paris. The addition\nof this second facility will allow us to expand the total DC capacity by approximately 25%. We plan to bring this new\ndata center on stream by November 2024.\nToloka AI\n• In Q2 2024, Toloka AI rolled out data production for a large-scale Generative AI project with a global Big Tech\ncustomer, first piloted in Q1 2024. This is an important milestone in establishing Toloka’s presence on the Generative\nAI market.\n• With GenAI projects making up around 80% of revenue in Q2 2024, the expanded data production volumes led to a\nfive-fold revenue increase Q-o-Q and a two-fold increase Y-o-Y.\n• Gross margin for GenAI stood at around mid- to high forties in Q2 2024, and Toloka expects to improve it going\nforward through expanding the capabilities of its technology platform, focusing on production efficiency, automation,\nand the use of synthetic data and auto-labeling.\n(1) Yandex N.V. (the “Company” or the “Group”) is to be renamed to Nebius Group N.V. subject to shareholders approval at the Annual General Meeting on August 15, 2024.\n1\n• Toloka’s operational capacity has significant potential for rapid expansion into new domains and languages. Having\nover 5,000 experts already onboarded to Mindrift, an expert contracting platform launched in April 2024, Toloka is\nable to add approximately 1,500 new experts monthly. Our new Mindrift platform is also instrumental in optimizing\ncosts related to experts onboarding.\nTripleTen\n• In June 2024 TripleTen was named as best overall provider in Fortune magazine’s ranking of software engineering\nbootcamps.\n• TripleTen’s Q2 2024 revenue was driven by a threefold Y-o-Y increase in the number of students enrolled in its\nbootcamp across key markets in the USA and Latin America.\n• Bookings, representing the total value of anticipated payments from students who have made an initial payment for a\ncourse, have grown fourfold Y-o-Y, positioning TripleTen to reach a run-rate bookings value of over USD 60 million by\nyear-end.\n• In Q2 2024, TripleTen expanded its B2C offerings by launching an immersive study track in Cybersecurity, which is\nexpected to drive student base growth and future bookings.\n• Additionally, in its pursuit of quality education balanced with cost optimization, TripleTen integrated an AI Tutor, an AI-\npowered study assistant, into all its study tracks. This feature facilitates learning progress while reducing service\nexpenses associated with on-demand tutoring.\nAvride\n• In Q2 2024, Avride focused on developing new generations of platforms for autonomous cars and delivery robots,\nwith plans to expand its operating fleet based on these platforms and to add new models of cars and robots later in\n2024.\n• The team also began on-road testing of newly redesigned autonomous driving technologies for both types of vehicles.\n• Avride is negotiating with several food- and ridetech companies to broaden its commercial reach, aiming to scale\noperations within and outside the US market. As part of the planned new partnerships, Avride intends to integrate\nover a hundred additional robots into commercial delivery services by the year-end.\nConsolidated Results (2), (3), (4)\nIn USD millions Three m onths ended J une 30, Six mo nths ended Ju ne 30,\n2023 2024 Change 2023 2024 Change\nRevenues 4.7 24.9 430% 9.2 36.3 295%\nAdjusted EBITDA/(loss) (68.6) (68.1) -1% (133.9) (139.0) 4%\nNet loss from continuing operations (74.3) (39.3) -47% (151.5) (118.9) -22%\nAdjusted net loss (77.8) (72.7) -7% (149.1) (150.3) 1%\n(2) The following measures presented in this release are “non-GAAP financial m easures”: adjusted EBITDA/(loss ) and adjusted net loss. Please se e the section “Use of Non-GAAP\nFinancial Measures” below for a discussion of how we define these measures, as well as reconciliations at the end of this release of each of these measures to the most directly\ncomparable U.S. GAAP measures.\n(3) Following the completion of the divestment of the Russia-based businesses, the Group changed the reporting currency from the Russian Ruble to the United States Dollar,\nwhich better reflects the geography of operations and key focus markets of the remaining businesses. Financial statements for the prior periods have been restated as if the change\nhad occurred on January 1, 2022.\n(4) On February 5, 2024, the Group announced the binding agreement with a purchaser consortium to sell all of the Group’s businesses in Russia and certain international markets.\nThe transaction (the “Sale”) was approved by our Shareholders in early March and implemented in two closings (first closing was completed on May 17, 2024, and the final closing\ncompleted on July 15, 2024). In light of this Sale, in this quarter's financial report, we have classified the scope of the Group's businesses that was sold as discontinued operations,\nin line with ASC 205-20, Discontinued Operations criteria. As such, the assets, liabilities, and results of discontinued operations preceding the completion of the Sale are presented\nseparately in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations. For Q2 2024 such results of discontinued operations are presented only till the\ndate of the first closing of the divestment when the Group sold its controlling stake in the businesses to be divested and deconsolidated the disposed businesses.\n2\nAdditional financial information:\n• Cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2024 amounted to USD 2.3 billion on a consolidated basis. Following the\nfinal closing of the divestment occurred on July 15, 2024, the Group has USD 2.5 billion cash and cash equivalents\nand no debt.\n• Capital expenditures amounted to USD 161.6 million and USD 220.6 million for the three and six months ended June\n30, 2024, respectively. We anticipate our capital expenditures to increase significantly in the coming quarters on the\nback of GPU and data center capacity expansion plans to support the planned growth of our businesses.\n• Cash outflow from operations amounted to USD 137.3 million and USD 209.4 million for three and six months ended\nJune 30, 2024, respectively.\nCorporate and Subsequent Events\n• In Q2 2024 the company successfully completed first closing of the divestment of its businesses based in Russia and\ncertain international markets. The first closing took place on May 17, 2024, at which the company reduced its interest\nin businesses to be divested to approximately 28%. Additionally, an amendment to the articles of association,\napproved by shareholders in March 2024, took effect at the first closing. This amendment eliminated legacy\ngovernance mechanisms, including the \"priority share\" previously held by the Public Interest Foundation and its\nrelated rights to appoint two board members. Furthermore, four Russian board members resigned, resulting in a\nboard currently composed of three members: John Boynton (Chairman), Rogier Rijnja, and Charles Ryan.\n• On July 10, 2024, the company completed the delisting of its Class A shares from the Moscow Exchange. The\ncompany remains listed on Nasdaq, where trading of its Class A shares has been halted since the end of February\n2022. The company has notified Nasdaq of its full divestment of its businesses in Russia and certain international\nmarkets and is now awaiting a response from the exchange.\n• On July 15, 2024 the company sold its remaining interest of 28% in businesses based in Russia and certain\ninternational markets, fully severing any ownership interest in Russia. Following the second and final closing, the\naggregate number of Class A and Class B ordinary shares outstanding is 199.0 million.\n• On July 18, 2024 the company published a Notice of the Annual General Meeting to be held on August 15, 2024. The\nagenda includes approval of the change of the company’s name to Nebius Group N.V., appointment of five new\ndirectors to the Board (including two executive directors, Arkady Volozh (CEO) and Ophir Nave (COO), and three\nnon-executive directors, Elena Bunina, Esther Dyson and Kira Radinsky), authorization to repurchase shares, and an\namendment to the company’s Equity Incentive Plan, among other things.\nLoss from operations\nIn USD millions Three m onths ended J une 30, Six mon ths ended Jun e 30,\n2023 2024 Change 2023 2024 Change\nLoss from operations (78.4) (122.4) 56% (152.4) (204.4) 34%\nLoss from operations amounted to USD 122.4 million in Q2 2024 compared to USD 78.4 million in Q2 2023. This dynamic\nwas mainly associated with the growing scale of the operations for the remaining businesses as well as one-off transaction\nexpenses directly related to the divestment of the Russia-based businesses and deal related payments.\nOther income/(loss), net for Q2 2024 amounted to a loss of USD 14.7 million compared to other income of USD 6.4 million\nin Q2 2023. Other income/(loss), net includes foreign exchange losses of USD 13.8 million in Q2 2024 and foreign exchange\ngain of USD 6.8 million in Q2 2023.\nNet loss from continuing operations (includes all businesses that were retained after the completion of the divestment of\nthe Russia-based and certain other international businesses) was USD 39.3 million in Q2 2024, compared with net loss of\nUSD 74.3 million in Q2 2023. The reduction of losses is primarily explained by a gain from revaluation of the remaining\ninterest in the divested businesses between the first closing and June 30, 2024 in amount of USD 88.7 million, which more\nthan offset an increase in operating expenses (as a result of expansion of the remaining businesses) and one-off transaction\nrelated costs.\n3\nA significant portion of the consideration for the divested businesses was received in the form of the Company’s Class A\nShares. The acquisition of such shares by the Company is treated as a repurchase by the Company of its own shares for\nDutch tax purposes, which would be subject to withholding tax at a 15% rate. However, we anticipate that all or substantially\nall of the shares so acquired will qualify as \"temporary investments\", given our intention and plan to use such shares for our\nemployee equity incentive program and for further financial purposes. Qualification of shares as temporary investment\nprovides the Company exemption from withholding tax liability. As of the end of June, the Company requested from the Dutch\ntax authortities the ruling in respect of the “temporary investment” position. In Q2 2024 financial statements the Company did\nnot recognize any tax liability in respect to the shares received in the first closing of the Sale. The accounting position may\nchange leading to the recognition of tax liability in the next periods depending on the new facts and circumstances.\nThe total number of shares issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2024 was 293,850,159, including 258,151,485 Class A\nshares and 35,698,674 Class B shares, and excluding 68,190,785 Class A shares held in treasury. The number of Class A\nshares received in the first closing as a part of consideration for the divestment is 67,632,122 Class A shares, which are held\nin treasury pending use under the Company’s equity incentive plans and for financing purposes. Following the final closing of\nthe divestment on July 15, 2024, the total number of shares issued and outstanding decreased to 198,996,556, including\n163,297,882 Class A shares and 35,698,674 Class B shares, and excluding 163,044,388 Class A shares held in treasury.\nThere were also outstanding employee share options to purchase up to an additional 2.2 million shares, at a weighted\naverage exercise price of $38.39 per share, 1.9 million of which were fully vested; equity-settled share appreciation rights\n(SARs) for 0.1 million shares, at a weighted average measurement price of $32.85, all of which were fully vested; restricted\nshare units (RSUs) covering 1.2 million shares, of which RSUs to acquire 1.0 million shares were fully vested. In addition, we\nhave outstanding awards in respect of our Avride business for 2.0 million shares (representing 5.9% of the fully diluted shares\nin Avride), 1.9 million of which were fully vested.\nMore information on Nebius Group can be found on https://nebius.group.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis press release may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

All information in this release and\nin the attachments is as of August 1, 2024, and the Company undertakes no duty to update this information unless required\nby law.\n4\nUSE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nTo supplement the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we present the following\nnon-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA/(loss) and Adjusted net income/(loss). The presentation of these financial\nmeasures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared\nand presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the\ntables captioned “Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest comparable U.S. GAAP measures”,\nincluded following the accompanying financial tables. We define the various non-GAAP financial measures we use as follows:\n• Adjusted EBITDA/(loss) means U.S. GAAP net income/(loss) from continuing operations plus (1) depreciation and\namortization, (2) certain SBC expense, (3) interest expense, (4) income tax expense, (5) one-off restructuring and other\nexpenses, less (1) interest income, (2) other income/(loss), net, and (3) income/(loss) from equity method investments.\n• Adjusted net income / (loss) means U.S. GAAP net income/(loss) from continuing operations plus (1) certain SBC\nexpense, (2) one-off restructuring and other expenses, less (1) foreign exchange gains and (2) revaluation of investment\nin the divested businesses. Tax effects related to the listed adjustments are excluded from adjusted net income.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are used by management for evaluating financial performance as well as decision-\nmaking. Management believes that these metrics reflect the organic, core operating performance of the company, and\ntherefore are useful to analysts and investors in providing supplemental information that helps them understand, model and\nforecast the evolution of our operating business.\nAlthough our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for operational decision-making and considers these\nfinancial measures to be useful for analysts and investors, we recognize that there are a number of limitations related to such\nmeasures. In particular, it should be noted that several of these measures exclude some recurring costs, particularly certain\nshare-based compensation. In addition, the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of the measures\ndescribed above may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of\noperations.\nBelow we describe why we make particular adjustments to certain U.S. GAAP financial measures:\nNet income from discontinued operations\nNet income from discontinued operations represent the results of the divested business, net of tax, net income from\ndiscontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interests and the result of divestment. Result of the divestment is\ncalculated as fair value of consideration received plus fair value of the remaining interest in the divested businesses and\naccumulated other comprehensive loss related to the sold perimeter less net assets of the disposed business as of first\nclosing of the divestment. We present Adjusted net loss exсluding any effects of our discontinued operations.\nCertain SBC expense\nSBC is a significant expense item and an important part of our compensation and incentive programs. As it is highly\ndependent on our share price at the time of equity award grants, we believe that it is useful for investors and analysts to see\ncertain financial measures excluding the impact of these charges in order to obtain a clearer picture of our operating\nperformance. However, because we settled the RSU equity awards of our employees in cash during 2023 and H1 2024, we\nno longer eliminate the relevant SBC expense corresponding to the cash payment from adjusted EBITDA/(loss) and adjusted\nnet loss.\nForeign exchange gains/(losses)\nBecause we hold certain assets and liabilities in currencies that differ from the United States Dollar, the Company’s current\nreporting currency, and because foreign exchange fluctuations are outside of our operational control, we believe that it is\nuseful to present adjusted EBITDA/(loss), adjusted net income and related margin measures excluding these effects, in order\nto provide greater clarity regarding our operating performance.\n5\nOne-off restructuring and other expenses\nWe believe that it is useful to present adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA/(loss) and related margin measures excluding\nimpacts not related to our operating activities.

(“Nebius Group”, the “Group” or the “Company”; NASDAQ: NBIS), a leading AI infrastructure company, today announced its unaudited financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n‍\n\nNebius Group is a technology company building full-stack infrastructure to service the high-growth global AI industry, including large-scale GPU clusters, cloud platforms, and tools and services for developers. Headquartered in Amsterdam and listed on Nasdaq, the Company has a global footprint with R&D hubs across Europe, North America and Israel. \n\n‍\n\nNebius Group’s core business is an AI-centric cloud platform built for intensive AI workloads. With proprietary cloud software architecture and hardware designed in-house (including servers, racks and data center design), Nebius Group gives AI builders the compute, storage, managed services and tools they need to build, tune and run their models.\n\n‍\n\nThe group also operates three additional businesses under their own distinctive brands:\n\n‍\n\n  * Toloka – a data partner for all stages of AI development from training to evaluation;\n  * TripleTen – a leading edtech player in the US and certain other markets, re-skilling people for careers in tech;\n  * Avride – one of the most experienced teams developing autonomous driving technology for self-driving cars and delivery robots.\n\n\n\n‍\n\n### Q3 2024 financial and operational highlights\n\n‍\n\n#### Nebius Group\n\n‍\n\n  * The Group’s Q3 2024 revenue increased 1.7 times compared to the previous quarter and totaled USD 43.3 million driven primarily by the rapid growth of the Company’s core AI infrastructure business, which grew 2.7 times compared to the previous quarter and 6.5 times on year-on-year basis. \n  * Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, stood at USD 2,288.2 million on a consolidated basis.\n  * Capital expenditures totaled USD 167.0 million and USD 387.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. We anticipate capital expenditures in Q4 2024 to exceed the amount spent in the first nine months of 2024 as we plan to accelerate investments in GPU procurement and data center capacity expansion to support the growth of our businesses.\n  * Cash outflow from operations amounted to USD 45.9 million and USD 255.3 million for three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\n\n\n\n‍\n\n####  Nebius \n\n‍\n\n  * In Q3 2024, Nebius (the Group’s core AI infrastructure business) accounted for approximately two-thirds of the Group's total revenue.\n  * Nebius’ cloud revenue surged 2.7 times QoQ (almost 8 times YoY against the low base), with annualized run-rate (ARR)(1) surpassing USD 120 million as of September 2024. \n  * The customer base expanded to over 40 managed clients in Q3 2024, up from 30 in Q2, with additions from the Fortune 500.\n  * Nebius began executing its plan to invest over USD 1 billion(2) in AI infrastructure across Europe by mid-2025. In September 2024, Nebius announced the launch of a GPU cluster in Paris, which will become one of the first in Europe to feature NVIDIA H200 Tensor Core GPUs. Shortly afterwards, Nebius announced a major expansion of its data center in Finland to triple capacity to 75 MW by the end of 2025 or early 2026. This will enable Nebius to accommodate up to 60,000 GPUs(3) at this location alone, with annual revenue potential of over USD 1 billion at full capacity utilization.(4)\n  * To capitalize on growth opportunities, Nebius introduced a number of strategic product developments: \n    * Introduced Nebius AI Studio, a high-performance, cost-efficient self-service inference platform for foundation model users and application developers, offering a wide range of state-of-the-art open-source models, including Llama, Mistral and more. \n    * Launched a specialized cloud platform for AI built on the NVIDIA accelerated computing framework (in early Q4). \n    * Expanded its cloud services portfolio with offerings such as Soperator and Managed PostgreSQL for IK8S.\n\n\n\n‍\n\n_(1) Annualized run-rate revenue by the end of the period (revenue for last month of the period multiplied by twelve)._\n\n_(2) Including the investments of approximately USD 400 million during the first nine months of 2024 ending September 30, 2024._\n\n_(3) In H100 equivalent._\n\n_(4) Based on assumed utilization and pricing as per the company’s medium-term financial plan (as of September 2024)._\n\n‍\n\n#### Toloka\n\n‍\n\n  * In Q3 2024, Toloka was the second largest contributor to the Group’s total revenue.\n  * In Q3 2024, Toloka demonstrated strong traction in Generative AI projects, which accounted for over 85% of Toloka's total revenue in Q3 2024 and grew more than fourfold YoY. We believe this underscores growing demand for Toloka’s AI solutions in the expanding generative AI market.\n  * Gross margins for Generative AI services ranged from the high forties to low fifties percent in Q3, driven by production efficiencies, increased automation and the effective use of synthetic data.
