Given the FAA's recent release of the necessary guidelines for future operations as well as the incoming administration’s stated agenda of achieving adoption ahead of other countries, we believe the timeline for this transition has greater clarity.\"\n\n\"We're pleased to see great conversion of Adjusted EBITDA to Free Cash Flow, Before Aircraft Acquisitions, which improved to $3.7 million in Q3 2024, approximately three times the prior year period, demonstrating the cash benefits of our drive to Passenger profitability and the growth in Medical,\" said Will Heyburn, Chief Financial Officer. \"Medical Segment Adjusted EBITDA improved 15.1% with margins expanding 70 basis points in Q3 2024 versus the prior year, despite a softer than expected Q3 for US organ transplant volumes. Regardless, October was one of the highest revenue months for Medical in company history and we continue to take market share, including two recent customer wins for high-volume transplant centers that we expect to begin flying in the coming months.\"\n\nHeyburn added, \"We are also excited to announce a strategic alliance with OrganOx to broaden access to their _metra_ perfusion device. We know from speaking with our customers that demand for _metra_ currently exceeds the supply of available machines. This partnership will enable higher utilization of available _metra_ devices through rapid distribution, utilizing Blade's air and ground logistics, to transplant centers who need them on a case-by-case basis.\"\n\n\"During the quarter, we acquired two additional aircraft which we expect to enter service by early 2025, bringing our owned fleet to ten,\" said Melissa Tomkiel, President. \"Our aircraft ownership strategy is already bearing fruit, enabling us to win new medical contracts in recent months that required asset ownership. However, lower medical flight volumes in Q3 led to negative operating leverage while above average expenses on our owned aircraft fleet, including entry into service delays, did lead to lower Medical Segment Adjusted EBITDA margins in Q3 2024 versus Q2 2024. Though quarter to quarter lumpiness in volumes and maintenance expenses may happen from time to time, we have already seen a normalization in the performance of our owned fleet Q4 to date.\"\n\n**Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Total revenue increased 4.8% to $74.9 million in the current quarter versus $71.4 million in the prior year period, driven primarily by growth in Medical and Short Distance partially offset by Jet and Other.\n  * Flight Profit _(_ 1) increased 27.3% to $19.8 million in the current quarter versus $15.6 million in the prior year period, driven by strong growth in both the Medical and Passenger segments.\n  * Flight Margin _(_ 1) improved to 26.5% in the current quarter from 21.8% in the prior year period, driven primarily by a strong summer season in the Northeast, improved profitability in New York Airport and benefits from restructuring actions taken in Europe and Canada in Passenger.\n  * Medical revenue increased 7.8% to $36.1 million in the current quarter versus $33.4 million in the prior year period. Medical revenue decreased (5.9)% sequentially versus Q2 2024 driven primarily by air trip volume that declined in line with industry transplant volumes, and a reduction in block hours per air trip as we increased the size of our dedicated fleet and positioned these aircraft closer to our largest hospital clients. This strategy reduces empty leg repositioning, improving outcomes and increasing economic efficiency for our customers while fortifying our value proposition to hospitals and making many other operators uncompetitive in these regions.\n  * Short Distance revenue increased 6.5% to $32.4 million in the current quarter versus $30.4 million in the prior year period. Excluding Canada, which was discontinued, Short Distance revenue increased 9.8% versus the prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by Northeast Leisure, Other Short Distance and New York Airport.\n  * Jet and Other revenue decreased 15.0% to $6.5 million in the current quarter versus $7.6 million in the prior year period driven by a decline in revenue per flight as charter industry pricing normalized.\n  * Net loss increased by $2.2 million versus the prior year to $(2.0) million in Q3 2024 driven primarily by a $6.0 million decrease in non-cash income from change in fair value of warrant liability, partially offset by a $3.9 million reduced loss from operations.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA _(_ 1) improved by $3.4 million year-over-year to $4.2 million in the current quarter versus $0.8 million in the prior year period, primarily due to a $2.8 million improvement in Passenger Segment Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. Medical Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $0.5 million year-over-year and Adjusted Unallocated Corporate Expenses and Software Development decreased (1.3)% versus the prior year period.\n  * Operating Cash Flow increased by $4.3 million to $6.4 million in Q3 2024. Capital expenditures of $9.9 million were driven primarily by the $7.3 million purchase of aircraft in the Medical segment. Free Cash Flow, Before Aircraft Acquisitions, which is net of all capital expenditures, including aircraft maintenance expenses, but excludes the impact of aircraft acquisitions, increased by $2.4 million to $3.7 million in Q3 2024.\n  * Ended Q3 2024 with $136.3 million in cash and short term investments.\n\n\n\n**Business Highlights and Recent Updates**\n\n  * Announced strategic alliance with OrganOx to broaden access to OrganOx's _metra_ normothermic machine perfusion device. The _metra_ device extends liver preservation times, aiding the identification of viable donor livers, enabling longer-distance transportation and increasing the utilization of donor organs. OrganOx will preposition _metra_ devices at strategic locations across the United States, utilizing air and ground logistics from Blade's wholly-owned subsidiary, Trinity Medical, to enable rapid deployment to transplant centers.\n  * Seven of the eight previously announced aircraft acquisitions operated in Q3 2024, with the eighth aircraft entering service in October. We signed agreements to acquire two additional aircraft during Q3 2024 that are expected to enter service by early 2025. With a fleet size of ten, our owned fleet will only represent approximately one third of our Medical flying hours with the majority remaining on third-party aircraft.\n  * Medical's organ placement service offering (\"TOPS\") continues to gain market share with five contracted customers today and a strong sales pipeline.\n  * Completed an acquisition in Medical that expands our captive ground network and fleet of vehicles that will enable us to better serve our New York area customers.\n  * Restructured our European operations which is expected to improve profitability and enable stronger organizational and commercial alignment with our local partner.\n  * Completed exit from Canada in our Passenger business.\n\n\n\n(1) See \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and \"Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Information\" sections attached to this release for an explanation of Non-GAAP measures used and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\n\n**Financial Outlook****(****1****)**\n\nFor the full year 2024, we expect:\n\n  * Revenue of $240 million to $250 million\n  * Positive Adjusted EBITDA\n\n\n\nFor the full year 2025, we expect:\n\n  * Double-digit Medical revenue growth\n  * Passenger revenue of $85 million to $95 million\n  * Double-digit millions of Adjusted EBITDA\n\n\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will conduct a conference call starting at 8:00 a.m. ET on Tuesday, November 12, 2024 to discuss the results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nA live audio-only webcast of the call may be accessed from the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at https://ir.blade.com/. An archived replay of the call will be available on the Investor Relations section of the Company's website for one year.\n\n(1) We have not reconciled the forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA guidance included above to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because this cannot be done without unreasonable effort due to the variability and low visibility with respect to certain costs, the most significant of which are incentive compensation (including stock-based compensation), transaction-related expenses, certain fair value measurements, which are potential adjustments to future earnings. We expect the variability of these items to have a potentially unpredictable, and a potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information**\n\nBlade believes that the non-GAAP measures discussed below, viewed in addition to and not in lieu of our reported U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") results, provide useful information to investors by providing a more focused measure of operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP measures presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Unallocated Corporate Expenses, SG&A, Adjusted SG&A, Flight Profit, Flight Margin, Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow, before Aircraft Acquisitions have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in the tables within this press release.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA – Blade reports Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Blade defines Adjusted EBITDA as net loss adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, change in fair value of warrant liabilities, interest income and expense, income tax, realized gains and losses on short-term investments, impairment of intangible assets and certain other non-recurring items that management does not believe are indicative of ongoing Company operating performance and would impact the comparability of results between periods.\n\nAdjusted Unallocated Corporate Expenses – Blade defines Adjusted Unallocated Corporate Expenses as expenses that cannot be allocated to either of our reporting segments (Passenger and Medical) and therefore attributable to our Corporate expenses and software development, less non-cash items and certain other non-recurring items that management does not believe are indicative of ongoing Company operating performance and would impact the comparability of results between periods.\n\nSG&A and Adjusted SG&A – Blade defines SG&A as total operating expenses excluding cost of revenue. Blade defines Adjusted SG&A as total operating expenses excluding cost of revenue and excluding non-cash items and certain other non-recurring items that management does not believe are indicative of ongoing Company operating performance and would impact the comparability of results between periods.\n\nFlight Profit and Flight Margin – Blade defines Flight Profit as revenue less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists of flight costs paid to operators of aircraft and vehicles, landing fees, depreciation of aircraft and vehicles, right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset amortization, internal costs incurred in generating organ ground transportation revenue using the Company’s owned vehicles and costs of operating our owned aircraft including fuel, management fees paid to the operator, maintenance costs and pilot salaries. Blade defines Flight Margin for a period as Flight Profit for the period divided by revenue for the same period. Blade believes that Flight Profit and Flight Margin provide an important measure of the profitability of the Company's flight and ground operations, as they focus solely on the non discretionary direct costs associated with those operations such as third party variable costs and costs of owning and operating Blade's owned aircraft.\n\nFree Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow, before Aircraft Acquisitions – Blade defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by / (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Blade also reports Free Cash Flow, before Aircraft Acquisitions, which is Free Cash Flow excluding cash outflows for aircraft acquisitions. Blade believes that Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow, before Aircraft Acquisitions provide important insights into the cash-generating capability of the business, with Free Cash Flow, before Aircraft Acquisition specifically highlighting the cash generated by our core operations before the impact of discretionary strategic investments in new aircraft.\n\n**Financial Results**\n\n**BLADE AIR

Based in New York City, Blade's asset-light model, coupled with its exclusive passenger terminal infrastructure and proprietary technologies, is designed to facilitate a seamless transition from helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft to Electric Vertical Aircraft (“EVA” or “eVTOL”), enabling lower cost air mobility that is both quiet and emission-free. \n\nFor more information, visit www.blade.com.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and may be identified by the use of words such as \"will\", “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “continue,” “expect,” “estimate,” “may,” “plan,” “outlook,” “future,” \"target,\" and “project” and other similar expressions and the negatives of those terms. These statements, which involve risks and uncertainties, relate to analyses and other information that are based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable and may also relate to Blade’s future prospects, developments and business strategies. In particular, such forward-looking statements include statements concerning Blade’s future financial and operating performance (including the discussion of 2024 and 2025 financial outlook and guidance), the composition and performance of its fleet, results of operations, industry environment and growth opportunities, new product lines and partnerships, and the development and adoption of EVA technology. These statements are based on management’s current expectations and beliefs, as well as a number of assumptions concerning future events. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance.\n\nSuch forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors, many of which are outside Blade’s control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements include: our continued incurrence of significant losses; failure of the markets for our offerings to grow as expected, or at all; our ability to effectively market and sell air transportation as a substitute for conventional methods of transportation; reliance on certain customers in our Passenger segment revenue; the inability or unavailability to use or take advantage of the shift, or lack thereof, to EVA technology; our ability to successfully enter new markets and launch new routes and services; any adverse publicity stemming from accidents involving small aircraft, helicopters or charter flights and, in particular, any accidents involving our third-party operators; any change to the ownership of our aircraft and the challenges related thereto; the effects of competition; harm to our reputation and brand; our ability to provide high-quality customer support; our ability to maintain a high daily aircraft usage rate; changes in consumer preferences, discretionary spending and other economic conditions; impact of natural disasters, outbreaks and pandemics, economic, social, weather, geopolitical, growth constraints, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances on metropolitan areas and airports where we have geographic concentration; the effects of climate change, including potential increased impacts of severe weather and regulatory activity; the availability of aircraft fuel; our ability to address system failures, defects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our website, applications, backend systems or other technology systems or those of third-party technology providers; interruptions or security breaches of our information technology systems; our placements within mobile applications; our ability to protect our intellectual property rights; our use of open source software; our ability to expand and maintain our infrastructure network; our ability to access additional funding; the increase of costs and risks associated with international expansion; our ability to identify, complete and successfully integrate future acquisitions; our ability to manage our growth; increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage; the loss of key members of our management team; our ability to maintain our company culture; our reliance on contractual relationships with certain transplant centers and Organ Procurement Organizations; effects of fluctuating financial results; our reliance on third-party operators; the availability of third-party operators; disruptions to third-party operators; increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage for our third-party aircraft operators; the possibility that our third-party aircraft operators may illegally, improperly or otherwise inappropriately operate our branded aircraft; our reliance on third-party web service providers; changes in our regulatory environment; risks and impact of any litigation we may be subject to; regulatory obstacles in local governments; the expansion of domestic and foreign privacy and security laws; the expansion of environmental regulations; our ability to remediate any material weaknesses or maintain internal controls over financial reporting; our ability to maintain effective internal controls and disclosure controls; changes in the fair value of our warrants; and other factors beyond our control.

Given the FAA's recent release of the necessary guidelines for\nfuture operations as well as the incoming administration’s stated agenda of achieving adoption ahead\nof other countries, we believe the timeline for this transition has greater clarity.\"\n\"We're pleased to see great conversion of Adjusted EBITDA to Free Cash Flow, Before Aircraft\nAcquisitions, which improved to $3.7 million in Q3 2024, approximately three times the prior year\nperiod, demonstrating the cash benefits of our drive to Passenger profitability and the growth in\nMedical,\" said Will Heyburn, Chief Financial Officer. \"Medical Segment Adjusted EBITDA improved\n15.1% with margins expanding 70 basis points in Q3 2024 versus the prior year, despite a softer than\nexpected Q3 for US organ transplant volumes. Regardless, October was one of the highest revenue\nmonths for Medical in company history and we continue to take market share, including two recent\ncustomer wins for high-volume transplant centers that we expect to begin flying in the coming\nmonths.\"\nHeyburn added, \"We are also excited to announce a strategic alliance with OrganOx to broaden\naccess to their metra perfusion device. We know from speaking with our customers that demand for\nmetra currently exceeds the supply of available machines. This partnership will enable higher\nutilization of available metra devices through rapid distribution, utilizing Blade's air and ground\nlogistics, to transplant centers who need them on a case-by-case basis.\"\n\"During the quarter, we acquired two additional aircraft which we expect to enter service by early\n2025, bringing our owned fleet to ten,\" said Melissa Tomkiel, President. \"Our aircraft ownership\nstrategy is already bearing fruit, enabling us to win new medical contracts in recent months that\nrequired asset ownership. However, lower medical flight volumes in Q3 led to negative operating\nleverage while above average expenses on our owned aircraft fleet, including entry into service\ndelays, did lead to lower Medical Segment Adjusted EBITDA margins in Q3 2024 versus Q2 2024.\nThough quarter to quarter lumpiness in volumes and maintenance expenses may happen from time\nto time, we have already seen a normalization in the performance of our owned fleet Q4 to date.\"\nThird Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 Financial Highlights\n▪ Total revenue increased 4.8% to $74.9 million in the current quarter versus $71.4 million in the\nprior year period, driven primarily by growth in Medical and Short Distance partially offset by\nJet and Other.\n▪ Flight Profit(1) increased 27.3% to $19.8 million in the current quarter versus $15.6 million in the\nprior year period, driven by strong growth in both the Medical and Passenger segments.\n▪ Flight Margin(1) improved to 26.5% in the current quarter from 21.8% in the prior year period,\ndriven primarily by a strong summer season in the Northeast, improved profitability in New York\nAirport and benefits from restructuring actions taken in Europe and Canada in Passenger.\n(1) See \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and \"Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Information\" sections attached to this\nrelease for an explanation of Non-GAAP measures used and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial\nmeasure.\n3\n▪ Medical revenue increased 7.8% to $36.1 million in the current quarter versus $33.4 million in\nthe prior year period. Medical revenue decreased (5.9)% sequentially versus Q2 2024 driven\nprimarily by air trip volume that declined in line with industry transplant volumes, and a\nreduction in block hours per air trip as we increased the size of our dedicated fleet and\npositioned these aircraft closer to our largest hospital clients. This strategy reduces empty leg\nrepositioning, improving outcomes and increasing economic efficiency for our customers while\nfortifying our value proposition to hospitals and making many other operators uncompetitive in\nthese regions.\n▪ Short Distance revenue increased 6.5% to $32.4 million in the current quarter versus $30.4\nmillion in the prior year period. Excluding Canada, which was discontinued, Short Distance\nrevenue increased 9.8% versus the prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by\nNortheast Leisure, Other Short Distance and New York Airport.\n▪ Jet and Other revenue decreased 15.0% to $6.5 million in the current quarter versus $7.6\nmillion in the prior year period driven by a decline in revenue per flight as charter industry\npricing normalized.\n▪ Net loss increased by $2.2 million versus the prior year to $(2.0) million in Q3 2024 driven\nprimarily by a $6.0 million decrease in non-cash income from change in fair value of warrant\nliability, partially offset by a $3.9 million reduced loss from operations.\n▪ Adjusted EBITDA(1) improved by $3.4 million year-over-year to $4.2 million in the current\nquarter versus $0.8 million in the prior year period, primarily due to a $2.8 million improvement\nin Passenger Segment Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. Medical Segment Adjusted EBITDA\nincreased $0.5 million year-over-year and Adjusted Unallocated Corporate Expenses and\nSoftware Development decreased (1.3)% versus the prior year period.\n▪ Operating Cash Flow increased by $4.3 million to $6.4 million in Q3 2024. Capital expenditures\nof $9.9 million were driven primarily by the $7.3 million purchase of aircraft in the Medical\nsegment. Free Cash Flow, Before Aircraft Acquisitions, which is net of all capital expenditures,\nincluding aircraft maintenance expenses, but excludes the impact of aircraft acquisitions,\nincreased by $2.4 million to $3.7 million in Q3 2024.\n▪ Ended Q3 2024 with $136.3 million in cash and short term investments.\nBusiness Highlights and Recent Updates\n▪ Announced strategic alliance with OrganOx to broaden access to OrganOx's metra\nnormothermic machine perfusion device. The metra device extends liver preservation times,\naiding the identification of viable donor livers, enabling longer-distance transportation and\nincreasing the utilization of donor organs. OrganOx will preposition metra devices at strategic\nlocations across the United States, utilizing air and ground logistics from Blade's wholly-owned\nsubsidiary, Trinity Medical, to enable rapid deployment to transplant centers.\n▪ Seven of the eight previously announced aircraft acquisitions operated in Q3 2024, with the\neighth aircraft entering service in October. We signed agreements to acquire two additional\naircraft during Q3 2024 that are expected to enter service by early 2025. With a fleet size of\nten, our owned fleet will only represent approximately one third of our Medical flying hours with\nthe majority remaining on third-party aircraft.\n▪ Medical's organ placement service offering (\"TOPS\") continues to gain market share with five\ncontracted customers today and a strong sales pipeline.\n▪ Completed an acquisition in Medical that expands our captive ground network and fleet of\nvehicles that will enable us to better serve our New York area customers.\n▪ Restructured our European operations which is expected to improve profitability and enable\nstronger organizational and commercial alignment with our local partner.\n▪ Completed exit from Canada in our Passenger business.\n(1) See \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and \"Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Information\" sections attached to this\nrelease for an explanation of Non-GAAP measures used and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial\nmeasure.\n4\nFinancial Outlook(1)\nFor the full year 2024, we expect:\n▪ Revenue of $240 million to $250 million\n▪ Positive Adjusted EBITDA\nFor the full year 2025, we expect:\n▪ Double-digit Medical revenue growth\n▪ Passenger revenue of $85 million to $95 million\n▪ Double-digit millions of Adjusted EBITDA\nConference Call\nThe Company will conduct a conference call starting at 8:00 a.m. ET on Tuesday November 12, 2024\nto discuss the results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\nA live audio-only webcast of the call may be accessed from the Investor Relations section of the\nCompany’s website at https://ir.blade.com/. An archived replay of the call will be available on the\nInvestor Relations section of the Company's website for one year.\n(1) We have not reconciled the forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA guidance included above to the most directly comparable GAAP\nmeasure because this cannot be done without unreasonable effort due to the variability and low visibility with respect to certain costs,\nthe most significant of which are incentive compensation (including stock-based compensation), transaction-related expenses, certain\nfair value measurements, which are potential adjustments to future earnings. We expect the variability of these items to have a\npotentially unpredictable, and a potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.\n5\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nBlade believes that the non-GAAP measures discussed below, viewed in addition to and not in lieu of\nour reported U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") results, provide useful\ninformation to investors by providing a more focused measure of operating results, enhance the\noverall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater\ntransparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational\ndecision making. The non-GAAP measures presented herein may not be comparable to similarly\ntitled measures presented by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Unallocated Corporate\nExpenses, SG&A, Adjusted SG&A, Flight Profit, Flight Margin, Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow,\nbefore Aircraft Acquisitions have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in the tables within\nthis press release.\nAdjusted EBITDA – Blade reports Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Blade\ndefines Adjusted EBITDA as net loss adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization, stock-based\ncompensation, change in fair value of warrant liabilities, interest income and expense, income tax,\nrealized gains and losses on short-term investments, impairment of intangible assets and certain\nother non-recurring items that management does not believe are indicative of ongoing Company\noperating performance and would impact the comparability of results between periods.\nAdjusted Unallocated Corporate Expenses – Blade defines Adjusted Unallocated Corporate\nExpenses as expenses that cannot be allocated to either of our reporting segments (Passenger and\nMedical) and therefore attributable to our Corporate expenses and software development, less non-\ncash items and certain other non-recurring items that management does not believe are indicative of\nongoing Company operating performance and would impact the comparability of results between\nperiods.\nSG&A and Adjusted SG&A – Blade defines SG&A as total operating expenses excluding cost of\nrevenue. Blade defines Adjusted SG&A as total operating expenses excluding cost of revenue and\nexcluding non-cash items and certain other non-recurring items that management does not believe\nare indicative of ongoing Company operating performance and would impact the comparability of\nresults between periods.\nFlight Profit and Flight Margin – Blade defines Flight Profit as revenue less cost of revenue. Cost of\nrevenue consists of flight costs paid to operators of aircraft and vehicles, landing fees, depreciation of\naircraft and vehicles, right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset amortization, internal costs incurred in generating\norgan ground transportation revenue using the Company’s owned vehicles and costs of operating our\nowned aircraft including fuel, management fees paid to the operator, maintenance costs and pilot\nsalaries. Blade defines Flight Margin for a period as Flight Profit for the period divided by revenue for\nthe same period. Blade believes that Flight Profit and Flight Margin provide an important measure of\nthe profitability of the Company's flight and ground operations, as they focus solely on the non\ndiscretionary direct costs associated with those operations such as third party variable costs and\ncosts of owning and operating Blade's owned aircraft.\nFree Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow, before Aircraft Acquisitions – Blade defines Free Cash Flow as\nnet cash provided by / (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures and capitalized software\ndevelopment costs. Blade also reports Free Cash Flow, before Aircraft Acquisitions, which is Free\nCash Flow excluding cash outflows for aircraft acquisitions. Blade believes that Free Cash Flow and\nFree Cash Flow, before Aircraft Acquisitions provide important insights into the cash-generating\ncapability of the business, with Free Cash Flow, before Aircraft Acquisition specifically highlighting the\ncash generated by our core operations before the impact of discretionary strategic investments in new\naircraft.\n6\nFinancial Results\nBLADE AIR

          "content": "Q3 2024 Investor Update\nQ3 2024 Investor Update | 1\nTo Our Shareholders,\nI’m extremely proud of our team’s effort in reaching an important milestone this quarter in our Passenger business,\nachieving positive Segment Adjusted EBITDA in the trailing twelve month period ending September 30, 2024, more than\na full year ahead of our previous guidance to achieve profitability by the end of 2025. In Q3 2024, we saw significant\nmargin expansion, driven by both our Passenger and Medical Segments, resulting in a 27.3% year-over-year increase in\nFlight Profit while Adjusted EBITDA of $4.2 million increased more than fivefold compared to $0.8 million in the prior\nyear period. We’re also pleased to see strong conversion of Adjusted EBITDA into cash flow as we generated $6.4 million\nof operating cash flow and $3.7 million of free cash flow before aircraft acquisitions in the quarter.\nWe had a strong summer season, particularly for Northeast\nLeisure, that drove Q3 2024 Short Distance revenue up 6.5%\nyear-over-year or 9.8% excluding our discontinued Canadian\noperations. Our Passenger segment enjoyed a significant\nimprovement in profitability this quarter, with Passenger Flight\nProfit up 31.0% versus the prior year period, Passenger\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA doubling, and Passenger\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA margin increasing to 14.4%\nversus 7.3% in the prior year period. On top of strong\nunderlying customer demand, several factors contributed to\nour faster path to profitability in Passenger.\nWe’ve taken action to exit unprofitable business lines and focus on routes with the most attractive growth and profitability\ncharacteristics that are strategic in nature. For example, we formally exited the Western Canada market during Q3 2024,\nan intention we discussed on our Q2 earnings call. In Europe, our management team has taken several aggressive steps to\nimprove profitability. During Q3, we restructured our European operations which is expected to generate significant cost\nsavings and enable stronger organizational and commercial alignment with our local partner. As a result, we expect to see\nimprovement in profitability for Europe, which will mostly manifest itself during the busy summer months given the\nseasonality of the market.\nWe’ve also been laser-focused on maximizing cost efficiencies across Passenger with year-to-date Segment Adjusted\nSG&A falling approximately 6% compared to the same period in 2023.\nBlade's vertical transportation platform is now stronger than ever and well positioned for the transition to Electric Vertical\nAircraft, what we call EVA or eVTOL in industry parlance. This transition from conventional rotorcraft and seaplanes to EVA\nis now coming closer into focus following the FAA's recent release of the necessary guidelines for EVA operations as well\nas the incoming administration’s stated agenda of achieving adoption ahead of other countries.\nThe timing couldn’t be better for Blade. We’ve always said that our strategy is to create an urban air mobility platform that\ncan operate profitably at scale today, using conventional aircraft before the introduction of EVA, which we expect will lead\nto an abundance of conveniently located landing locations throughout all major metropolitan areas as well as lower costs of\noperation.\nQ3 2024 Investor Update | 2\nBlade Hamptons\nToday, we’ve achieved a key milestone with a Passenger Segment Adjusted EBITDA positive year for the twelve months\nending September 30, 2024 – over one full year earlier than expected. I couldn’t be more proud of the hard work from our\nteam to make this possible.\nOur Passenger business, given its captive infrastructure, proprietary technology, large flier base and strong brand, has never\nbeen more valuable to our customers and EVA manufacturers. Blade has only fortified its position as the largest operating\nvertical transportation company for commuters in the world, and we are without competitors for many of our key services.\nMedical Segment Adjusted EBITDA improved 15.1% in Q3 2024 versus the prior year period, with margins expanding\n70 basis points year over year despite a softer than expected quarter for US organ transplant volumes. We remain extremely\nbullish regarding the long term opportunities for our Medical business. The fundamental growth drivers of organ transplants\nin America continue to gain momentum as well as our ability to continue to gain market share. We’re seeing increased\nadoption of existing and rapidly emerging technologies to increase the supply of donor organs in the US including organ\nperfusion and preservation devices, procedures like Normothermic Regional Perfusion, or NRP, and a thriving industry of\ncompanies to provide the surgical staffing necessary for hospitals to increase recovery volumes.\nThis reinforces the validity of our strategy to remain agnostic as to the technologies, procedures and services embraced by\nour hospital partners and we welcome the opportunity to work directly with these innovative companies whenever the need\narises.\nTo that end, we’re excited to announce a strategic alliance with OrganOx to broaden access to their metra perfusion\ndevice, which extends liver preservation times, aids in the identification of viable donor livers, enables longer-distance\ntransportation and increases the utilization of donor organs. OrganOx will preposition metra devices at strategic locations\nacross the United States, utilizing Blade's air and ground logistics to enable rapid deployment to transplant centers for on-\nground use. We know from speaking with our customers that demand for OrganOx’s metra device currently exceeds the\nsupply of available machines. This partnership will enable higher utilization of available devices through rapid distribution to\ncenters who need them on a case-by-case basis. As livers make up more than half of all heart, liver and lung transplants in\nthe US, increased access to this device could have a huge positive impact.\nQ3 2024 Investor Update | 3\nOur Medical platform continues to strengthen with 10 owned and 20 dedicated aircraft strategically positioned near our\ncustomers, a growing ground logistics capability with 9 hubs and 45 vehicles around the country and an organ placement\nservices offering (“TOPS”) that is gaining traction in the industry with five signed customers and a strong sales pipeline.\nLooking through the quarter to quarter volatility, our continued market share gains are highlighted in our performance and\nreinforce the strength of our platform. In the last two months we won competitive RFPs for two new high volume\ntransplant centers that we expect to begin flying in early 2025. Importantly, over the last year we have not lost a single\ncontracted customer, a testament to the service and value that we are providing.\nTurning to our Medical aircraft strategy, seven of the eight previously announced aircraft acquisitions were operational in\nthe quarter, with the eighth aircraft entering service in the last week of September after a significant entry into service delay.\nWe signed agreements to acquire two additional aircraft during Q3 that are expected to enter service by early 2025\nand increase our owned fleet size to ten aircraft. This strategy is already bearing fruit, enabling us to win new medical\ncontracts in recent months that required aircraft ownership. It’s important to note that at a fleet size of ten, our owned fleet\nwill only represent approximately one third of our Medical flying hours with the majority remaining on third-party aircraft.\nWe remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged,\nprioritizing low-risk, financially accretive investments in Medical aircraft and ground vehicles as well as bolt-on acquisitions\nin Medical that enhance our competitive posture or enableexpansion into other time critical logistics verticals that include\nindustrial manufacturing, parts for grounded aircraft or other medical cargo use cases. During Q3, we completed a tuck-in\nacquisition in Medical to geographically expand our captive network of ground vehicles. We will continue to weigh these\nacquisition priorities relative to opportunistic share repurchases.\nQ3 2024 Investor Update | 4\nBlade Airport – New York City\nFinancial Results and Outlook\nShort Distance revenue for Q3 2024 increased 6.5% year-over-year or 9.8% excluding Canada, as we formally exited\nthe Western Canada market at the end of August. In Jet and Other, revenues declined 15.0% year-over-year driven primarily\nby lower revenue per flight given softer jet charter industry pricing. We saw significant margin improvement in Passenger\nthis quarter as Passenger Flight Margin and Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by approximately 700 basis points year-\nover-year. The profitability improvement in passenger was driven by several factors including strength in our Northeast\nLeisure routes, improved pricing, higher load factor in New York Airport transfers and early benefits from our\nEuropean restructuring.\nMedical revenue rose 7.8% year-over-year to $36.1 million. On a sequential basis, Medical revenue fell 5.9% versus Q2\n2024. Blade’s air trip volumes declined in line with industry heart, liver, lung transplant volumes in Q3 versus Q2 2024 though\nour sequential revenue decline was slightly higher than the industry given a reduction in empty-leg aircraft repositioning. As\nwe’ve increased the size of our dedicated aircraft fleet and based more aircraft at the home airports of our customers, we\nare able to significantly reduce empty aircraft repositioning time and costs, fortifying our value proposition to hospitals and\nmaking many other operators uncompetitive in these regions. This had a discrete impact on revenue in Q3, but is the right\ndecision for us and our customers. Long term this is a win-win, saving money for our customers, enabling shorter call-\nout times and longer trips, while at the same time these well-positioned dedicated aircraft generate more flight profit\ndollars per hour and per trip.\nQ3 2024 Investor Update | 5\nBlade Medical\nEven in Q3 2024, a quarter with unusually high owned aircraft related expenses and lower than expected volumes, we saw\na nearly 20% increase in flight profit per flight hour and an approximately 10% increase in average flight profit per air trip,\ndespite only a low-single digit increase in flight revenue per hour flown, which is consistent with our contractual annual\nescalators.\nMedical segment profitability metrics continued to improve on a year over year basis but declined sequentially in the quarter.\nMedical Flight Margin expanded 240 basis points year-over-year to 20.8% in Q3 2024 up from 18.4% in the year ago\nperiod. On a sequential basis, Medical Flight Margin declined by 280 basis points. Medical Segment Adjusted EBITDA\nMargin increased by 70 basis points year over year to 10.7% in Q3 2024 up from 10.0% in Q3 2023, but declined 370 basis\npoints sequentially.\nSeveral factors contributed to the sequential Medical margin decline in the quarter, the majority of which are timing related\nand set to improve from here. The lower revenue sequentially drove negative fixed cost leverage in the quarter. In addition,\nabove average maintenance downtime and owned fleet expenses also contributed to the sequential margin decline,\nincluding start-up costs and delays in aircraft onboarding for the owned fleet.\nThe good news is that we’ve seen a quick rebound in industry volumes and Medical segment revenue, and we expect\nto see a meaningful improvement in margins and our owned fleet performance in Q4 2024 relative to Q3 2024 driven by\nincreased volumes, a normalization in maintenance downtime, the entry into service of our eighth aircraft and a normalization\nof other owned fleet costs. This outlook is consistent with our actual financial performance in October.\nMoving forward, we think it’s reasonable to expect quarter to quarter variability in our Medical business given the non-linear\ngrowth of organ transplant volumes and our owned fleet that brings with it some unpredictability with respect to timing of\ncertain expenses and maintenance downtime.\nWe’d also like to highlight some data around an exciting industry trend poised to drive even faster growth in availability\nof donor organs: Normothermic Regional Perfusion. We’re seeing higher adoption of this technique which improves\ntransplant outcomes and yields, meaning the total number of usable organs recovered from one donor, in recoveries from\nQ3 2024 Investor Update | 6\nBlade Europe – Monaco\ndonors who have undergone cardiac death. Hospitals and Organ Procurement Organizations can often utilize off-the-shelf\nequipment to perform this technique at low cost and we’ve seen a more than threefold increase in the number of NRP\nrecoveries performed by our transplant center customers year-to-date in 2024 versus 2023. NRP is still a low-single digit\npercentage of our total recoveries and, based on conversations with our customers, we believe it is still early days for this\nexciting growth driver.\nWe continue to focus on controlling Unallocated Corporate Expenses and Software Development, which declined\n1.3% year over year in Q3 2024 and shrunk 50 basis points as a percentage of revenues to 7%. On the cash flow front, the\ndifference between our Adjusted EBITDA of $4.2 million and cash from operations of $6.4 million in the quarter was primarily\ndriven by a cash inflow from working capital.\nOur capital expenditures, inclusive of capitalized software development costs, were $9.9 million in the quarter and driven\nprimarily by $7.3 million of aircraft acquisition payments, while capitalized aircraft maintenance was approximately $900\nthousand. This aircraft acquisition amount includes payments for our eighth aircraft, delivered in the last week of the quarter,\nalong with two additional aircraft that we purchased during the quarter, but did not begin flying. We have approximately $1.9\nmillion of remaining payments on the ten aircraft that we expect to pay in Q4 2024. Beyond the ten aircraft acquisitions\npreviously discussed, we do not have any other aircraft purchases in process currently and our focus right now is on\nonboarding the final two planes and optimizing the financial performance of the current fleet. However, given the significant\nstrategic and financial benefits of our owned aircraft, we will opportunistically consider adding a low single digit number of\nsimilarly priced aircraft to the fleet over the next 9 to 12 months.\nWe ended the quarter with no debt and $136.3 million of cash and short-term investments, providing flexibility for\nstrategic investments in aircraft, acquisitions in Medical and opportunistic share repurchases.\nQ3 2024 Investor Update | 7\nConclusion\nIn summary, we are pleased to have achieved such an important milestone by achieving full-year Passenger Segment\nAdjusted EBITDA profitability a year ahead of our guidance. We remain focused on delivering value to our shareholders\nthrough disciplined execution towards our financial and operational targets in the quarters ahead.\nThank you all for your continued support.\nSincerely,\nRob Wiesenthal\nFounder and Chief Executive Officer\nQ3 2024 Investor Update | 8\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nBlade believes that the non-GAAP measures discussed below, viewed in addition to and not in lieu of our reported U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting\nPrinciples (\"GAAP\") results, provide useful information to investors by providing a more focused measure of operating results, enhance the overall\nunderstanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in\nits financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP measures presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by\nother companies. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Unallocated Corporate Expenses, SG&A, Adjusted SG&A, Flight Profit, Flight Margin, Free Cash Flow and\nFree Cash Flow before Aircraft Acquisitions have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in the tables within this press release.\nAdjusted EBITDA – Blade reports Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Blade defines Adjusted EBITDA as net loss adjusted to exclude\ndepreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, change in fair value of warrant liabilities, interest income and expense, income tax, realized\ngains and losses on short-term investments, impairment of intangible assets and certain other non-recurring items that management does not believe are\nindicative of ongoing Company operating performance and would impact the comparability of results between periods.\nAdjusted Unallocated Corporate Expenses – Blade defines Adjusted Unallocated Corporate Expenses as expenses that cannot be allocated to either of\nour reporting segments (Passenger and Medical) and therefore attributable to our Corporate expenses and software development, less non-cash items\nand certain other non-recurring items that management does not believe are indicative of ongoing Company operating performance and would impact the\ncomparability of results between periods.\nSG&A and Adjusted SG&A – Blade defines SG&A as total operating expenses excluding cost of revenue. Blade defines Adjusted SG&A as total operating\nexpenses excluding cost of revenue and excluding non-cash items and certain other non-recurring items that management does not believe are indicative\nof ongoing Company operating performance and would impact the comparability of results between periods.\nFlight Profit and Flight Margin – Blade defines Flight Profit as revenue less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists of flight costs paid to operators of\naircraft and vehicles, landing fees, depreciation of aircraft and vehicles, right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset amortization, internal costs incurred in generating organ\nground transportation revenue using the Company’s owned vehicles and costs of operating our owned aircraft including fuel, management fees paid to\nthe operator, maintenance costs and pilot salaries. Blade defines Flight Margin for a period as Flight Profit for the period divided by revenue for the same\nperiod. Blade believes that Flight Profit and Flight Margin provide an important measure of the profitability of the Company's flight and ground operations,\nas they focus solely on the non discretionary direct costs associated with those operations such as third party variable costs and costs of owning and\noperating Blade's owned aircraft.\nFree Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow, before Aircraft Acquisitions – Blade defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by / (used in) operating activities\nless capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Blade also reports Free Cash Flow, before Aircraft Acquisitions, which is Free Cash\nFlow excluding cash outflows for aircraft acquisitions. Blade believes that Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow before Aircraft Acquisitions provide important\ninsights into the cash-generating capability of the business, with Free Cash Flow before Aircraft Acquisition specifically highlighting the cash generated by\nour core operations before the impact of discretionary strategic investments in new aircraft.\nQ3 2024 Investor Update | 9\nFinancial

Given the FAA's recent release of the necessary guidelines for future operations as well as the incoming administration’s stated agenda of achieving adoption ahead of other countries, we believe the timeline for this transition has greater clarity.\"\n\n\"We're pleased to see great conversion of Adjusted EBITDA to Free Cash Flow, Before Aircraft Acquisitions, which improved to $3.7 million in Q3 2024, approximately three times the prior year period, demonstrating the cash benefits of our drive to Passenger profitability and the growth in Medical,\" said Will Heyburn, Chief Financial Officer. \"Medical Segment Adjusted EBITDA improved 15.1% with margins expanding 70 basis points in Q3 2024 versus the prior year, despite a softer than expected Q3 for US organ transplant volumes. Regardless, October was one of the highest revenue months for Medical in company history and we continue to take market share, including two recent customer wins for high-volume transplant centers that we expect to begin flying in the coming months.\"\n\nHeyburn added, \"We are also excited to announce a strategic alliance with OrganOx to broaden access to their _metra_ perfusion device. We know from speaking with our customers that demand for _metra_ currently exceeds the supply of available machines. This partnership will enable higher utilization of available _metra_ devices through rapid distribution, utilizing Blade's air and ground logistics, to transplant centers who need them on a case-by-case basis.\"\n\n\"During the quarter, we acquired two additional aircraft which we expect to enter service by early 2025, bringing our owned fleet to ten,\" said Melissa Tomkiel, President. \"Our aircraft ownership strategy is already bearing fruit, enabling us to win new medical contracts in recent months that required asset ownership. However, lower medical flight volumes in Q3 led to negative operating leverage while above average expenses on our owned aircraft fleet, including entry into service delays, did lead to lower Medical Segment Adjusted EBITDA margins in Q3 2024 versus Q2 2024. Though quarter to quarter lumpiness in volumes and maintenance expenses may happen from time to time, we have already seen a normalization in the performance of our owned fleet Q4 to date.\"\n\n**Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Total revenue increased 4.8% to $74.9 million in the current quarter versus $71.4 million in the prior year period, driven primarily by growth in Medical and Short Distance partially offset by Jet and Other.\n  * Flight Profit _(_ 1) increased 27.3% to $19.8 million in the current quarter versus $15.6 million in the prior year period, driven by strong growth in both the Medical and Passenger segments.\n  * Flight Margin _(_ 1) improved to 26.5% in the current quarter from 21.8% in the prior year period, driven primarily by a strong summer season in the Northeast, improved profitability in New York Airport and benefits from restructuring actions taken in Europe and Canada in Passenger.\n  * Medical revenue increased 7.8% to $36.1 million in the current quarter versus $33.4 million in the prior year period. Medical revenue decreased (5.9)% sequentially versus Q2 2024 driven primarily by air trip volume that declined in line with industry transplant volumes, and a reduction in block hours per air trip as we increased the size of our dedicated fleet and positioned these aircraft closer to our largest hospital clients. This strategy reduces empty leg repositioning, improving outcomes and increasing economic efficiency for our customers while fortifying our value proposition to hospitals and making many other operators uncompetitive in these regions.\n  * Short Distance revenue increased 6.5% to $32.4 million in the current quarter versus $30.4 million in the prior year period. Excluding Canada, which was discontinued, Short Distance revenue increased 9.8% versus the prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by Northeast Leisure, Other Short Distance and New York Airport.\n  * Jet and Other revenue decreased 15.0% to $6.5 million in the current quarter versus $7.6 million in the prior year period driven by a decline in revenue per flight as charter industry pricing normalized.\n  * Net loss increased by $2.2 million versus the prior year to $(2.0) million in Q3 2024 driven primarily by a $6.0 million decrease in non-cash income from change in fair value of warrant liability, partially offset by a $3.9 million reduced loss from operations.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA _(_ 1) improved by $3.4 million year-over-year to $4.2 million in the current quarter versus $0.8 million in the prior year period, primarily due to a $2.8 million improvement in Passenger Segment Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. Medical Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $0.5 million year-over-year and Adjusted Unallocated Corporate Expenses and Software Development decreased (1.3)% versus the prior year period.\n  * Operating Cash Flow increased by $4.3 million to $6.4 million in Q3 2024. Capital expenditures of $9.9 million were driven primarily by the $7.3 million purchase of aircraft in the Medical segment. Free Cash Flow, Before Aircraft Acquisitions, which is net of all capital expenditures, including aircraft maintenance expenses, but excludes the impact of aircraft acquisitions, increased by $2.4 million to $3.7 million in Q3 2024.\n  * Ended Q3 2024 with $136.3 million in cash and short term investments.\n\n\n\n**Business Highlights and Recent Updates**\n\n  * Announced strategic alliance with OrganOx to broaden access to OrganOx's _metra_ normothermic machine perfusion device. The _metra_ device extends liver preservation times, aiding the identification of viable donor livers, enabling longer-distance transportation and increasing the utilization of donor organs. OrganOx will preposition _metra_ devices at strategic locations across the United States, utilizing air and ground logistics from Blade's wholly-owned subsidiary, Trinity Medical, to enable rapid deployment to transplant centers.\n  * Seven of the eight previously announced aircraft acquisitions operated in Q3 2024, with the eighth aircraft entering service in October. We signed agreements to acquire two additional aircraft during Q3 2024 that are expected to enter service by early 2025. With a fleet size of ten, our owned fleet will only represent approximately one third of our Medical flying hours with the majority remaining on third-party aircraft.\n  * Medical's organ placement service offering (\"TOPS\") continues to gain market share with five contracted customers today and a strong sales pipeline.\n  * Completed an acquisition in Medical that expands our captive ground network and fleet of vehicles that will enable us to better serve our New York area customers.\n  * Restructured our European operations which is expected to improve profitability and enable stronger organizational and commercial alignment with our local partner.\n  * Completed exit from Canada in our Passenger business.\n\n\n\n(1) See \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and \"Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Information\" sections attached to this release for an explanation of Non-GAAP measures used and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\n\n**Financial Outlook****(****1****)**\n\nFor the full year 2024, we expect:\n\n  * Revenue of $240 million to $250 million\n  * Positive Adjusted EBITDA\n\n\n\nFor the full year 2025, we expect:\n\n  * Double-digit Medical revenue growth\n  * Passenger revenue of $85 million to $95 million\n  * Double-digit millions of Adjusted EBITDA\n\n\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will conduct a conference call starting at 8:00 a.m. ET on Tuesday, November 12, 2024 to discuss the results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nA live audio-only webcast of the call may be accessed from the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at https://ir.blade.com/. An archived replay of the call will be available on the Investor Relations section of the Company's website for one year.\n\n(1) We have not reconciled the forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA guidance included above to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because this cannot be done without unreasonable effort due to the variability and low visibility with respect to certain costs, the most significant of which are incentive compensation (including stock-based compensation), transaction-related expenses, certain fair value measurements, which are potential adjustments to future earnings. We expect the variability of these items to have a potentially unpredictable, and a potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information**\n\nBlade believes that the non-GAAP measures discussed below, viewed in addition to and not in lieu of our reported U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") results, provide useful information to investors by providing a more focused measure of operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP measures presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Unallocated Corporate Expenses, SG&A, Adjusted SG&A, Flight Profit, Flight Margin, Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow, before Aircraft Acquisitions have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in the tables within this press release.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA – Blade reports Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Blade defines Adjusted EBITDA as net loss adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, change in fair value of warrant liabilities, interest income and expense, income tax, realized gains and losses on short-term investments, impairment of intangible assets and certain other non-recurring items that management does not believe are indicative of ongoing Company operating performance and would impact the comparability of results between periods.\n\nAdjusted Unallocated Corporate Expenses – Blade defines Adjusted Unallocated Corporate Expenses as expenses that cannot be allocated to either of our reporting segments (Passenger and Medical) and therefore attributable to our Corporate expenses and software development, less non-cash items and certain other non-recurring items that management does not believe are indicative of ongoing Company operating performance and would impact the comparability of results between periods.\n\nSG&A and Adjusted SG&A – Blade defines SG&A as total operating expenses excluding cost of revenue. Blade defines Adjusted SG&A as total operating expenses excluding cost of revenue and excluding non-cash items and certain other non-recurring items that management does not believe are indicative of ongoing Company operating performance and would impact the comparability of results between periods.\n\nFlight Profit and Flight Margin – Blade defines Flight Profit as revenue less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists of flight costs paid to operators of aircraft and vehicles, landing fees, depreciation of aircraft and vehicles, right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset amortization, internal costs incurred in generating organ ground transportation revenue using the Company’s owned vehicles and costs of operating our owned aircraft including fuel, management fees paid to the operator, maintenance costs and pilot salaries. Blade defines Flight Margin for a period as Flight Profit for the period divided by revenue for the same period. Blade believes that Flight Profit and Flight Margin provide an important measure of the profitability of the Company's flight and ground operations, as they focus solely on the non discretionary direct costs associated with those operations such as third party variable costs and costs of owning and operating Blade's owned aircraft.\n\nFree Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow, before Aircraft Acquisitions – Blade defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by / (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Blade also reports Free Cash Flow, before Aircraft Acquisitions, which is Free Cash Flow excluding cash outflows for aircraft acquisitions. Blade believes that Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow, before Aircraft Acquisitions provide important insights into the cash-generating capability of the business, with Free Cash Flow, before Aircraft Acquisition specifically highlighting the cash generated by our core operations before the impact of discretionary strategic investments in new aircraft.\n\n**Financial Results**\n\n**BLADE AIR

Based in New York City, Blade's asset-light model, coupled with its exclusive passenger terminal infrastructure and proprietary technologies, is designed to facilitate a seamless transition from helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft to Electric Vertical Aircraft (“EVA” or “eVTOL”), enabling lower cost air mobility that is both quiet and emission-free. \n\nFor more information, visit www.blade.com.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and may be identified by the use of words such as \"will\", “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “continue,” “expect,” “estimate,” “may,” “plan,” “outlook,” “future,” \"target,\" and “project” and other similar expressions and the negatives of those terms. These statements, which involve risks and uncertainties, relate to analyses and other information that are based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable and may also relate to Blade’s future prospects, developments and business strategies. In particular, such forward-looking statements include statements concerning Blade’s future financial and operating performance (including the discussion of 2024 and 2025 financial outlook and guidance), the composition and performance of its fleet, results of operations, industry environment and growth opportunities, new product lines and partnerships, and the development and adoption of EVA technology. These statements are based on management’s current expectations and beliefs, as well as a number of assumptions concerning future events. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance.\n\nSuch forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors, many of which are outside Blade’s control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements include: our continued incurrence of significant losses; failure of the markets for our offerings to grow as expected, or at all; our ability to effectively market and sell air transportation as a substitute for conventional methods of transportation; reliance on certain customers in our Passenger segment revenue; the inability or unavailability to use or take advantage of the shift, or lack thereof, to EVA technology; our ability to successfully enter new markets and launch new routes and services; any adverse publicity stemming from accidents involving small aircraft, helicopters or charter flights and, in particular, any accidents involving our third-party operators; any change to the ownership of our aircraft and the challenges related thereto; the effects of competition; harm to our reputation and brand; our ability to provide high-quality customer support; our ability to maintain a high daily aircraft usage rate; changes in consumer preferences, discretionary spending and other economic conditions; impact of natural disasters, outbreaks and pandemics, economic, social, weather, geopolitical, growth constraints, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances on metropolitan areas and airports where we have geographic concentration; the effects of climate change, including potential increased impacts of severe weather and regulatory activity; the availability of aircraft fuel; our ability to address system failures, defects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our website, applications, backend systems or other technology systems or those of third-party technology providers; interruptions or security breaches of our information technology systems; our placements within mobile applications; our ability to protect our intellectual property rights; our use of open source software; our ability to expand and maintain our infrastructure network; our ability to access additional funding; the increase of costs and risks associated with international expansion; our ability to identify, complete and successfully integrate future acquisitions; our ability to manage our growth; increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage; the loss of key members of our management team; our ability to maintain our company culture; our reliance on contractual relationships with certain transplant centers and Organ Procurement Organizations; effects of fluctuating financial results; our reliance on third-party operators; the availability of third-party operators; disruptions to third-party operators; increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage for our third-party aircraft operators; the possibility that our third-party aircraft operators may illegally, improperly or otherwise inappropriately operate our branded aircraft; our reliance on third-party web service providers; changes in our regulatory environment; risks and impact of any litigation we may be subject to; regulatory obstacles in local governments; the expansion of domestic and foreign privacy and security laws; the expansion of environmental regulations; our ability to remediate any material weaknesses or maintain internal controls over financial reporting; our ability to maintain effective internal controls and disclosure controls; changes in the fair value of our warrants; and other factors beyond our control.

Given the FAA's recent release of the necessary guidelines for future operations as well as the incoming administration’s stated agenda of achieving adoption ahead of other countries, we believe the timeline for this transition has greater clarity.\"\n\n\"We're pleased to see great conversion of Adjusted EBITDA to Free Cash Flow, Before Aircraft Acquisitions, which improved to $3.7 million in Q3 2024, approximately three times the prior year period, demonstrating the cash benefits of our drive to Passenger profitability and the growth in Medical,\" said Will Heyburn, Chief Financial Officer. \"Medical Segment Adjusted EBITDA improved 15.1% with margins expanding 70 basis points in Q3 2024 versus the prior year, despite a softer than expected Q3 for US organ transplant volumes. Regardless, October was one of the highest revenue months for Medical in company history and we continue to take market share, including two recent customer wins for high-volume transplant centers that we expect to begin flying in the coming months.\"\n\nHeyburn added, \"We are also excited to announce a strategic alliance with OrganOx to broaden access to their _metra_ perfusion device. We know from speaking with our customers that demand for _metra_ currently exceeds the supply of available machines. This partnership will enable higher utilization of available _metra_ devices through rapid distribution, utilizing Blade's air and ground logistics, to transplant centers who need them on a case-by-case basis.\"\n\n\"During the quarter, we acquired two additional aircraft which we expect to enter service by early 2025, bringing our owned fleet to ten,\" said Melissa Tomkiel, President. \"Our aircraft ownership strategy is already bearing fruit, enabling us to win new medical contracts in recent months that required asset ownership. However, lower medical flight volumes in Q3 led to negative operating leverage while above average expenses on our owned aircraft fleet, including entry into service delays, did lead to lower Medical Segment Adjusted EBITDA margins in Q3 2024 versus Q2 2024. Though quarter to quarter lumpiness in volumes and maintenance expenses may happen from time to time, we have already seen a normalization in the performance of our owned fleet Q4 to date.\"\n\n**Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Total revenue increased 4.8% to $74.9 million in the current quarter versus $71.4 million in the prior year period, driven primarily by growth in Medical and Short Distance partially offset by Jet and Other.\n  * Flight Profit _(_ 1) increased 27.3% to $19.8 million in the current quarter versus $15.6 million in the prior year period, driven by strong growth in both the Medical and Passenger segments.\n  * Flight Margin _(_ 1) improved to 26.5% in the current quarter from 21.8% in the prior year period, driven primarily by a strong summer season in the Northeast, improved profitability in New York Airport and benefits from restructuring actions taken in Europe and Canada in Passenger.\n  * Medical revenue increased 7.8% to $36.1 million in the current quarter versus $33.4 million in the prior year period. Medical revenue decreased (5.9)% sequentially versus Q2 2024 driven primarily by air trip volume that declined in line with industry transplant volumes, and a reduction in block hours per air trip as we increased the size of our dedicated fleet and positioned these aircraft closer to our largest hospital clients. This strategy reduces empty leg repositioning, improving outcomes and increasing economic efficiency for our customers while fortifying our value proposition to hospitals and making many other operators uncompetitive in these regions.\n  * Short Distance revenue increased 6.5% to $32.4 million in the current quarter versus $30.4 million in the prior year period. Excluding Canada, which was discontinued, Short Distance revenue increased 9.8% versus the prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by Northeast Leisure, Other Short Distance and New York Airport.\n  * Jet and Other revenue decreased 15.0% to $6.5 million in the current quarter versus $7.6 million in the prior year period driven by a decline in revenue per flight as charter industry pricing normalized.\n  * Net loss increased by $2.2 million versus the prior year to $(2.0) million in Q3 2024 driven primarily by a $6.0 million decrease in non-cash income from change in fair value of warrant liability, partially offset by a $3.9 million reduced loss from operations.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA _(_ 1) improved by $3.4 million year-over-year to $4.2 million in the current quarter versus $0.8 million in the prior year period, primarily due to a $2.8 million improvement in Passenger Segment Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. Medical Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $0.5 million year-over-year and Adjusted Unallocated Corporate Expenses and Software Development decreased (1.3)% versus the prior year period.\n  * Operating Cash Flow increased by $4.3 million to $6.4 million in Q3 2024. Capital expenditures of $9.9 million were driven primarily by the $7.3 million purchase of aircraft in the Medical segment. Free Cash Flow, Before Aircraft Acquisitions, which is net of all capital expenditures, including aircraft maintenance expenses, but excludes the impact of aircraft acquisitions, increased by $2.4 million to $3.7 million in Q3 2024.\n  * Ended Q3 2024 with $136.3 million in cash and short term investments.\n\n\n\n**Business Highlights and Recent Updates**\n\n  * Announced strategic alliance with OrganOx to broaden access to OrganOx's _metra_ normothermic machine perfusion device. The _metra_ device extends liver preservation times, aiding the identification of viable donor livers, enabling longer-distance transportation and increasing the utilization of donor organs. OrganOx will preposition _metra_ devices at strategic locations across the United States, utilizing air and ground logistics from Blade's wholly-owned subsidiary, Trinity Medical, to enable rapid deployment to transplant centers.\n  * Seven of the eight previously announced aircraft acquisitions operated in Q3 2024, with the eighth aircraft entering service in October. We signed agreements to acquire two additional aircraft during Q3 2024 that are expected to enter service by early 2025. With a fleet size of ten, our owned fleet will only represent approximately one third of our Medical flying hours with the majority remaining on third-party aircraft.\n  * Medical's organ placement service offering (\"TOPS\") continues to gain market share with five contracted customers today and a strong sales pipeline.\n  * Completed an acquisition in Medical that expands our captive ground network and fleet of vehicles that will enable us to better serve our New York area customers.\n  * Restructured our European operations which is expected to improve profitability and enable stronger organizational and commercial alignment with our local partner.\n  * Completed exit from Canada in our Passenger business.\n\n\n\n(1) See \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and \"Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Information\" sections attached to this release for an explanation of Non-GAAP measures used and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\n\n**Financial Outlook****(****1****)**\n\nFor the full year 2024, we expect:\n\n  * Revenue of $240 million to $250 million\n  * Positive Adjusted EBITDA\n\n\n\nFor the full year 2025, we expect:\n\n  * Double-digit Medical revenue growth\n  * Passenger revenue of $85 million to $95 million\n  * Double-digit millions of Adjusted EBITDA\n\n\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will conduct a conference call starting at 8:00 a.m. ET on Tuesday, November 12, 2024 to discuss the results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nA live audio-only webcast of the call may be accessed from the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at https://ir.blade.com/. An archived replay of the call will be available on the Investor Relations section of the Company's website for one year.\n\n(1) We have not reconciled the forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA guidance included above to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because this cannot be done without unreasonable effort due to the variability and low visibility with respect to certain costs, the most significant of which are incentive compensation (including stock-based compensation), transaction-related expenses, certain fair value measurements, which are potential adjustments to future earnings. We expect the variability of these items to have a potentially unpredictable, and a potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information**\n\nBlade believes that the non-GAAP measures discussed below, viewed in addition to and not in lieu of our reported U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") results, provide useful information to investors by providing a more focused measure of operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP measures presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Unallocated Corporate Expenses, SG&A, Adjusted SG&A, Flight Profit, Flight Margin, Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow, before Aircraft Acquisitions have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in the tables within this press release.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA – Blade reports Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Blade defines Adjusted EBITDA as net loss adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, change in fair value of warrant liabilities, interest income and expense, income tax, realized gains and losses on short-term investments, impairment of intangible assets and certain other non-recurring items that management does not believe are indicative of ongoing Company operating performance and would impact the comparability of results between periods.\n\nAdjusted Unallocated Corporate Expenses – Blade defines Adjusted Unallocated Corporate Expenses as expenses that cannot be allocated to either of our reporting segments (Passenger and Medical) and therefore attributable to our Corporate expenses and software development, less non-cash items and certain other non-recurring items that management does not believe are indicative of ongoing Company operating performance and would impact the comparability of results between periods.\n\nSG&A and Adjusted SG&A – Blade defines SG&A as total operating expenses excluding cost of revenue. Blade defines Adjusted SG&A as total operating expenses excluding cost of revenue and excluding non-cash items and certain other non-recurring items that management does not believe are indicative of ongoing Company operating performance and would impact the comparability of results between periods.\n\nFlight Profit and Flight Margin – Blade defines Flight Profit as revenue less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists of flight costs paid to operators of aircraft and vehicles, landing fees, depreciation of aircraft and vehicles, right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset amortization, internal costs incurred in generating organ ground transportation revenue using the Company’s owned vehicles and costs of operating our owned aircraft including fuel, management fees paid to the operator, maintenance costs and pilot salaries. Blade defines Flight Margin for a period as Flight Profit for the period divided by revenue for the same period. Blade believes that Flight Profit and Flight Margin provide an important measure of the profitability of the Company's flight and ground operations, as they focus solely on the non discretionary direct costs associated with those operations such as third party variable costs and costs of owning and operating Blade's owned aircraft.\n\nFree Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow, before Aircraft Acquisitions – Blade defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by / (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Blade also reports Free Cash Flow, before Aircraft Acquisitions, which is Free Cash Flow excluding cash outflows for aircraft acquisitions. Blade believes that Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow, before Aircraft Acquisitions provide important insights into the cash-generating capability of the business, with Free Cash Flow, before Aircraft Acquisition specifically highlighting the cash generated by our core operations before the impact of discretionary strategic investments in new aircraft.\n\n**Financial Results**\n\n**BLADE AIR
