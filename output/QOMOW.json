(the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”), to be held at 9:00 a.m., on December 7, 2023. The special\nmeeting will be held, at Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP, 1177 Avenue of the Americas, 29th Floor, New York,\nNew York 10036. At the special meeting, the stockholders will consider and vote upon the following proposals:\n1. To amend (the “Charter Amendment”) the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of\nIncorporation (our “charter”) to allow the Company to reduce the amount that the Company must\ndeposit in the trust account to extend the date on which the Trustee must liquidate the trust account\nestablished by the Company in connection with the IPO (the “trust account”) from the lesser of\n$0.033 per outstanding share and $80,000 to the lesser of $0.033 per outstanding share and $20,000 by\ndepositing such amount into the trust account for each one-month extension (an “Extension”) of the\ndate by which the Company must consummate a business combination (as defined below) (the “Charter\nAmendment Proposal”).\n2. To amend (the “Trust Amendment”) the Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated September 29,\n2022, as amended on June 30, 2023 (the “Trust Agreement”), by and between the Company and\nAmerican Stock Transfer & Trust Company (the “Trustee”), to reduce the amount the Company must\ndeposit in the trust account for each one-month Extension from the lesser of $0.033 per outstanding\nshare and $80,000 to the lesser of $0.033 per outstanding share and $20,000 (the “Trust Amendment\nProposal”).\n3. A proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary, to\npermit further solicitation and vote of proxies in the event that there are insufficient votes to approve the\nCharter Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal or if we determine that additional time\nis necessary to effectuate the Charter Amendment (the “Adjournment Proposal”). The Adjournment\nProposal will only be presented at the special meeting if there are not sufficient votes for, or otherwise in\nconnection with, the approval of the Charter Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal.\nEach of the Charter Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal is more\nfully described in the accompanying proxy statement. You will be able to attend the special meeting at Kramer Levin\nNaftalis & Frankel LLP, 1177 Avenue of the Americas 29th Floor, New York, New York 10036. Please see “Questions\nand Answers about the Special Meeting — How do I attend the special meeting?” for more information.\nTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE “FOR” THE CHARTER\nAMENDMENT PROPOSAL, THE TRUST AMENDMENT PROPOSAL AND, IF PRESENTED, THE\nADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL.\nThe Company’s charter provides that the Company has the right to extend the period to complete a business\ncombination (the “Combination Period”) twelve times by an additional month each time after August 4, 2024 (for a\ntotal of 22 months from the closing date of the IPO to complete a business combination). In order to extend the time\navailable for the Company to consummate a business combination without the need for a separate stockholder vote\nunder the charter, the Sponsor or its affiliates or designees must deposit into the trust account the lesser of $0.033 per\npublic share and $80,000 on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. Given current market conditions, the\nSponsor would like to pay extension fees that are substantially less than the lesser of $0.033 per public share and\n$80,000 required for each monthly extension under the existing charter. Accordingly, the Company is seeking to\nreduce the amount required for each month extension to the lesser of $0.033 per public share and $20,000. The\nCompany expects that there will be significant redemptions at the special meeting.\nThe Company’s board of directors (the “Board”) believes that the Charter Amendment and the Trust Amendment\nwill provide the Company additional flexibility to extend the date by which the Company must complete an initial\nbusiness combination. Accordingly, our Board believes that the Charter Amendment and the Trust Amendment are\nnecessary in order to be able to consummate an initial business combination. Therefore, our Board has determined\nthat it is in the best interests of our stockholders to approve the Charter Amendment and the Trust Amendment\nto give the Company additional flexibility to consummate a business combination by August 4, 2024 in order to\nprovide our stockholders with the opportunity to participate in the prospective investment. In the event that we\nenter into a definitive agreement for an initial business combination prior to the special meeting, we will issue a\npress release and file a Current Report on Form 8-K with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission\nannouncing the proposed business combination. The purpose of the Adjournment Proposal is to allow the\nCompany to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates if we determine that additional time is necessary to\npermit further solicitation and vote of proxies in the event that there are insufficient votes to approve the Charter\nAmendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal or if we determine that additional time is necessary to\neffectuate the Charter Amendment and the Trust Amendment. Each of the Company, Qomolangma Investments\nLLC or any of their respective affiliates (the “Contributors”) has agreed that if the Charter Amendment Proposal\nand the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved, they will contribute to the trust account the lesser of $0.033 per\npublic share and $20,000 for each one-month Extension, paid on a month-to-month and as-needed basis (each being\nreferred to herein as a “Contribution”), upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable deadlines, to extend\nthe Combination Period for an additional one (1) month period each time, until August 4, 2024. Each Contribution\nwill be deposited in the trust account within two business days prior to the beginning of the additional extension\nperiod (or portion thereof).\nThe Contributors will not make any Contribution unless the Charter Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment\nProposal are both approved and the Combination Period is extended. The Contribution(s) will not bear any interest.\nThe Contributions will be lost if the Company is unable to consummate an initial business combination except to the\nextent of any funds held outside of the trust account. The Company will have the sole discretion whether to continue\nextending the time to complete a business combination until August 4, 2024, and if the Company determines not\nto continue extending for an additional period, any obligation to make additional Contributions will terminate.\nIf this occurs, or if the Company’s board of directors otherwise determines that the Company will not be able to\nconsummate an initial business combination by August 4, 2024 and does not wish to seek an additional Extension,\nthe Company would wind up the Company’s affairs and redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares in accordance\nwith the same procedures set forth below that would be applicable if the Charter Amendment Proposal and the Trust\nAmendment Proposal are not approved.\nThe affirmative vote of at least a majority of the Company’s outstanding common stock, par value $0.0001 per\nshare, held by the Company’s public stockholders (the “public shares”), and the outstanding common stock, par\nvalue $0.0001 per share, held by the Company’s initial stockholders (the “founder shares” and, together with the\npublic shares, the “common stock”), will be required to approve the Charter Amendment Proposal and the Trust\nAmendment Proposal. Approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the majority of the\nvotes cast by stockholders represented in person (including virtually) or by proxy at the special meeting.\nOur Board has fixed the close of business on November 15, 2023 as the record date for determining the Company’s\nstockholders entitled to receive notice of and vote at the special meeting and any adjournment thereof. Only holders\nof record of the Company’s common stock on that date are entitled to have their votes counted at the special meeting\nor any adjournment thereof. A complete list of stockholders of record entitled to vote at the special meeting will\nbe available for ten days before the special meeting at the Company’s principal executive offices for inspection by\nstockholders during ordinary business hours for any purpose germane to the special meeting.\nIn connection with the Charter Amendment Proposal, holders of public shares (“public stockholders”) may elect to\nredeem their public shares for a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the\ntrust account as of two business days prior to such approval, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust\naccount and not previously released to the Company to pay taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public\nshares (the “Election”), regardless of whether such public stockholders vote on the Charter Amendment Proposal\nand the Trust Amendment Proposal. If the Charter Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are\napproved by the requisite vote of stockholders, holders of public shares that do not make the Election will retain the\nopportunity to have their public shares redeemed in conjunction with the consummation of a business combination,\nsubject to any limitations set forth in our charter, as amended. In addition, public stockholders who do not make\nthe Election would be entitled to have their public shares redeemed for cash if the Company has not completed a\nbusiness combination by August 4, 2024.\nThe Company estimates that the per share price at which the public shares may be redeemed from cash held in the\ntrust account will be approximately $10.88 at the time of the special meeting. The closing price of the Company’s\ncommon stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market on November 24, 2023, was $10.65. Accordingly, if the market price\nwere to remain the same until the date of the special meeting, exercising redemption rights would result in a public\nstockholder receiving approximately $0.23 more per share than if such stockholder sold the public shares in the\nopen market. The Company cannot assure public stockholders that they will be able to sell their public shares in the\nopen market, even if the market price per share is higher than the redemption price stated above, as there may not be\nsufficient liquidity in its securities when such stockholders wish to sell their shares.\nThe Adjournment Proposal, if adopted, will allow our Board to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates,\nif necessary or appropriate, to permit further solicitation of proxies. The Adjournment Proposal will be presented to\nour stockholders only in the event that there are insufficient votes for, or otherwise in connection with, the approval\nof the Charter Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal.\nIf the Charter Amendment Proposal or the Trust Amendment Proposal is not approved and the Combination Period\nis not extended in accordance with the terms of the existing charter, the Company will (i) cease all operations except\nfor the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter,\nand subject to having lawfully available funds therefor, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per\nshare price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest\nearned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to the Company to pay taxes, divided by\nthe number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’\nrights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable\nlaw, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining\nstockholders and our Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law\nto provide for claims of creditors and requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or\nliquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, including the warrants included in the units sold in the IPO\n(the “public warrants”), or our rights, including the rights included in the units sold in the IPO (the “public rights”),\nwhich will expire worthless in the event the Company winds up.\nYou are not being asked to vote on a business combination at this time. If the Charter Amendment is\nimplemented and you do not elect to redeem your public shares in connection with the Charter Amendment, you\nwill retain the right to vote on a business combination when it is submitted to the public stockholders (provided\nthat you are a stockholder on the record date for a meeting to consider a business combination) and the right\nto redeem your public shares for a pro rata portion of the trust account in the event a business combination is\napproved and completed or the Company has not consummated a business combination by August 4, 2024.\nAfter careful consideration of all relevant factors, our Board has determined that the Charter Amendment\nProposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and, if presented, the Adjournment Proposal are advisable and\nrecommends that you vote or give instruction to vote “FOR” the Charter Amendment Proposal, the Trust\nAmendment Proposal and, if presented, the Adjournment Proposal.\nEnclosed is the proxy statement containing detailed information concerning the Charter Amendment Proposal, the\nTrust Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal and the special meeting. Whether or not you plan to\nattend the special meeting, the Company urges you to read this material carefully and vote your shares.\nNovember 27, 2023 By Order of the Board of Directors,\nJonathan P. Myers\nChief Executive Officer,\nPresident and Chairman of the Board\nYour vote is important. If you are a stockholder of record, please sign, date and return your proxy card as soon as\npossible to make sure that your shares are represented at the special meeting. If you are a stockholder of record,\nyou may also cast your vote virtually at the special meeting.

Your failure to vote or instruct your\nbroker or bank how to vote will have the same effect as voting against the Charter Amendment Proposal and the\nTrust Amendment Proposal, and an abstention will have the same effect as voting against the Charter Amendment\nProposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal. Abstentions will be counted in connection with the determination of\nwhether a valid quorum is established but will have no effect on the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal.\nImportant Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Special Meeting of Stockholders\nto be held on December 7, 2023: This notice of meeting and the accompanying proxy statement are available at\nwww.QOMO.vote.\nTO EXERCISE YOUR REDEMPTION RIGHTS, YOU MUST (1) IF YOU HOLD PUBLIC SHARES THROUGH\nUNITS, ELECT TO SEPARATE YOUR UNITS INTO THE UNDERLYING PUBLIC SHARES, PUBLIC\nWARRANTS AND PUBLIC RIGHTS PRIOR TO EXERCISING YOUR REDEMPTION RIGHTS WITH\nRESPECT TO THE PUBLIC SHARES, (2) SUBMIT A WRITTEN REQUEST TO THE TRANSFER AGENT BY\n5:00 P.M.

You will be able to attend and participate in the special meeting at Kramer\nLevin Naftalis & Frankel LLP, 1177 Avenue of the Americas 29th Floor, New York, New York 10036.

Only holders\nof record of the Company’s common stock on that date are entitled to have their votes counted at the special meeting\nor any adjournment thereof. A complete list of stockholders of record entitled to vote at the special meeting will\nbe available for ten days before the special meeting at the Company’s principal executive offices for inspection by\nstockholders during ordinary business hours for any purpose germane to the special meeting.\nIn connection with the Charter Amendment Proposal, holders of public shares (“public stockholders”) may elect to\nredeem their public shares for a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the\ntrust account established by the Company in connection with the IPO (the “trust account”) as of two business days\nprior to such approval, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to\nthe Company to pay taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares (the “Election”), regardless of\nwhether such public stockholders vote on the Charter Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal.

In addition, public stockholders who do not make the Election would be entitled to have their\npublic shares redeemed for cash if the Company has not completed a business combination by August 4, 2024.\nThe withdrawal of funds from the trust account in connection with the Election will reduce the amount held in the\ntrust account following the Election, and the amount remaining in the trust account after such withdrawal may be\nonly a fraction of the $20,800,165.57 (including interest, but less the funds used to pay taxes) that was in the trust\naccount as of November 15, 2023. In such event, the Company may still seek to obtain additional funds to complete\na business combination, and there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on terms acceptable to the\nparties or at all. The Company will not use the proceeds placed in the trust account and the interest earned thereon\nto pay any excise taxes or any other similar fees or taxes in nature that may be imposed on the Company pursuant\nto any current, pending or future rules or laws, including without limitation any excise tax due imposed under the\nInflation Reduction Act of 2022 on any redemptions or stock buybacks by the Company.\nThe Company estimates that the per share price at which the public shares may be redeemed from cash held in the\ntrust account will be approximately $10.88 at the time of the special meeting. The closing price of the Company’s\ncommon stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market (the “NASDAQ”) on November 24, 2023, was $10.65. Accordingly, if\nthe market price were to remain the same until the date of the special meeting, exercising redemption rights would\nresult in a public stockholder receiving approximately $0.23 more per share than if such stockholder sold the public\nshares in the open market.

The Adjournment Proposal will be presented to\nour stockholders only in the event that there are insufficient votes for, or otherwise in connection with, the approval\nof the Charter Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal.\nIf the Charter Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are not approved and the Combination\nPeriod is not extended in accordance with the terms of the existing charter, the Company will (i) cease all operations\nexcept for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days\nthereafter, and subject to having lawfully available funds therefor, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares,\nat a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including\ninterest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to the Company to pay taxes,\ndivided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public\nstockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to\napplicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our\nremaining stockholders and our Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware\nlaw to provide for claims of creditors and requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights\nor liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants or our rights, which will expire worthless in the event the\nCompany winds up.\nQomolangma Investments LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Sponsor”), has agreed that it will\nbe liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than the Company’s independent\nregistered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target\nbusiness with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds\nin the trust account to below (i) $10.15 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust\naccount as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each\ncase net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay the Company’s taxes, except as to any claims by a third party\nwho executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under\nthe Company’s indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended. However, we have not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification\nobligations, nor have we independently verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity\nobligations and believe that the Sponsor’s only assets are securities of the Company. Therefore, we cannot assure that\nthe Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations.\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), stockholders may be held liable for claims by third\nparties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. If the corporation\ncomplies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable\nprovision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be\nbrought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and\nan additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of\nstockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of\nthe claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the\nthird anniversary of the dissolution.\nHowever, because the Company will not be complying with Section 280 of the DGCL, Section 281(b) of the DGCL\nrequires the Company to adopt a plan, based on facts known to the Company at such time that will provide for our\npayment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against the Company within\nthe subsequent ten years following our dissolution. However, because the Company is a blank check company, rather\nthan an operating company, and our operations have been limited to searching for prospective target businesses to\nacquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or\nprospective target businesses.\nIf the Charter Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved, such approval will constitute\nconsent for the Company to (i) remove from the trust account an amount (the “Withdrawal Amount”) equal to\nthe number of public shares properly redeemed multiplied by the per share price, equal to the aggregate amount\nthen on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to such approval, including interest earned on the\nfunds held in the trust account and not previously released to the Company to pay taxes, divided by the number of\nthen outstanding public shares and (ii) deliver to the holders of such redeemed public shares their portion of the\nWithdrawal Amount.

such are not historical facts. This includes,\nwithout limitation, statements regarding the Company’s financial position, business strategy and the plans and\nobjectives of management for future operations, including as they relate to a business combination. These statements\nconstitute projections, forecasts and forward-looking statements, and are not guarantees of performance. They\ninvolve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause the actual results,\nperformance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or\nachievements expressed or implied by these statements. Such statements can be identified by the fact that they do not\nrelate strictly to historical or current facts. When used in this proxy statement, words such as “anticipate,” “believe,”\n“continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,”\n“should,” “strive,” “would” and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these\nwords does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. When the Company discusses its strategies or plans,\nincluding as they relate to a business combination, it is making projections, forecasts or forward-looking statements.\nSuch statements are based on the beliefs of, as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to,\nthe Company’s management. Actual results and stockholders’ value will be affected by a variety of risks and factors,\nincluding, without limitation, international, national and local economic conditions, merger, acquisition and business\ncombination risks, financing risks, geo-political risks, acts of terror or war, and those risk factors described in our\nfinal prospectus for our IPO as filed with the SEC on October 3, 2022, in this proxy statement and in other reports\nthe Company files with the SEC. Many of the risks and factors that will determine these results and stockholders’\nvalue are beyond the Company’s ability to control or predict.\nAll such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this proxy statement. The Company expressly\ndisclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking\nstatements contained herein to reflect any change in the Company’s expectations with regard thereto or any\nchange in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. All subsequent written or\noral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on the Company’s behalf are qualified in their\nentirety by this “Forward-Looking Statements” section.\n1\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should consider carefully all of the risks described in our final prospectus for our IPO as filed with the SEC on\nOctober 3, 2022, and in the other reports we file with the SEC before making a decision to invest in our securities.\nFurthermore, if any of the events described in our final prospectus or other reports filed with the SEC occur, our\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected or we could face liquidation.\nIn that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe risks and uncertainties described in our final prospectus and other reports are not the only ones we face.\nAdditional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also\nbecome important factors that adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results or result in our\nliquidation.\n2\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING\nThese Questions and Answers are only summaries of the matters they discuss. They do not contain all of the\ninformation that may be important to you. You should read carefully the entire document, including the annexes to\nthis proxy statement.\nWhy am I receiving this proxy statement?\nThis proxy statement and the enclosed proxy card are being sent to you in connection with the solicitation of proxies\nby our Board for use at the special meeting, or at any adjournments thereof. This proxy statement summarizes the\ninformation that you need to make an informed decision on the proposals to be considered at the special meeting.\nThe Company is a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation on May 6, 2021 formed for\nthe purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization, or similar\nbusiness combination with one or more businesses. On October 4, 2022, the Company consummated the IPO\nof 5,000,000 units at an offering price of $10.00 per unit (the “Public Units”), generating gross proceeds of\n$50,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company sold to the Sponsor, in a private placement,\n260,500 units at $10.00 per unit (the “Private Units”), generating total gross proceeds of $2,605,000.\nThe Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 750,000 additional Public Units to cover\nover-allotments, if any. On October 7, 2022, the underwriters partially exercised the over-allotment option and\npurchased 273,000 Public Units at a price of $10.00 per Public Unit, generating gross proceeds of $2,730,000.\nSimultaneously with the closing of the over-allotment option, the Company consummated the sale of an additional\naggregate of 8,873 Private Units with the Sponsor at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of\n$88,730.\nFollowing the closing of the IPO on October 4, 2022, an amount of $53,520,950 ($10.15 per unit) from the net\nproceeds of the sale of the units in the IPO and the sale of the Private Units was placed in the trust account. The\ntrust account was invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of\nthe Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain\nconditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government\ntreasury obligations, until the earliest of: (a) the completion of the Company’s initial business combination, (b) the\nredemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend the Company’s\ncharter (i) to modify the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to allow redemption in connection with\nour initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if the Company does not complete its initial\nbusiness combination within 9 months (or up to 21 months if the Combination Period is extended in accordance with\nthe existing charter) from the closing of the IPO or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’\nrights or pre-initial business combination activity, and (c) the redemption of the Company’s public shares if the\nCompany is unable to complete the initial business combination within the Combination Period (as defined below).\nLike most blank check companies, our charter provides for the return of the IPO proceeds held in the trust account to\nthe holders of shares of common stock sold in the IPO if there is no qualifying business combination consummated\non or before a certain date (the “Combination Period”). In our case such certain date is August 4, 2024 (unless the\nCombination Period is extended in accordance with the terms of the existing charter). Our Board has determined that\nit is in the best interests of the Company to amend the Company’s charter to reduce the amount the Company must\ndeposit in the trust account to extend the date on which the Trustee must liquidate the trust account by depositing\ninto the trust account to the lesser of $0.033 per outstanding share and $20,000 per month for each subsequent\none-month Extension. Therefore, our Board is submitting the proposals described in this proxy statement for the\nstockholders to vote upon.\nWhat is being voted on?\nYou are being asked to vote on each of the Charter Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and, if\npresented, the Adjournment Proposal. The proposals are listed below:\n1. Charter Amendment Proposal: To amend our charter to allow the Company to reduce the monthly\nextension fee to the lesser of $0.033 per outstanding share and $20,000.\n2. Trust Amendment Proposal: To amend the Trust Agreement to reduce the monthly extension fee to\nthe lesser of $0.033 per outstanding share and $20,000.\n3\n3. Adjournment Proposal: A proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting to a later\ndate or dates, if necessary, to permit further solicitation and vote of proxies in the event that there are\ninsufficient votes to approve the Charter Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal or\nif we determine that additional time is necessary to effectuate the Charter Amendment and the Trust\nAmendment. The Adjournment Proposal will only be presented at the special meeting if there are not\nsufficient votes for, or otherwise in connection with, the approval of the Charter Amendment Proposal\nand the Trust Amendment Proposal.\nWhat are the purposes of the Charter Amendment and the Trust Amendment?\nThe Company’s charter provides that the Company has the right to extend the period to complete a business\ncombination twelve times by an additional month each time after August 4, 2023 (for a total of 22 months from the\nclosing date of the IPO to complete a business combination). In order to extend the time available for the Company\nto consummate a business combination without the need for a separate stockholder vote under the charter, the\nSponsor or its affiliate or designees must deposit into the Trust Account the lesser of $0.033 per public share and\n$80,000 on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. Given current market conditions, the Sponsor would like\nto pay extension fees that are substantially less than the lesser of $0.033 per public share and $80,000 required for\neach monthly extension under the existing charter. The Company expects that there will be significant redemptions\nat the special meeting.\nThe Charter Amendment and the Trust Amendment will provide the Company with flexibility to extend the\nCompany for a reduced extension fee in connection with providing additional time to complete a business\ncombination. While we are currently in discussions with respect to a business combination, the Board currently\nbelieves that there will not be sufficient time within the Combination Period to complete an initial business\ncombination. Accordingly, our Board believes that the Charter Amendment is necessary in order to be able to\nconsummate an initial business combination. Therefore, our Board has determined that it is in the best interests\nof our stockholders to approve the Charter Amendment and the Trust Amendment to give the Company additional\nflexibility to consummate a business combination by August 4, 2024 in order to provide our stockholders with the\nopportunity to participate in the prospective investment. In the event that we enter into a definitive agreement for an\ninitial business combination prior to the special meeting, we will issue a press release and file a Current Report on\nForm 8-K with the SEC announcing the proposed business combination.\nThe purpose of the Adjournment Proposal is to allow the Company to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or\ndates if we determine that additional time is necessary to permit further solicitation and vote of proxies in the event\nthat there are insufficient votes to approve the Charter Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal or if\nwe determine that additional time is necessary to effectuate the Charter Amendment and the Trust Amendment.\nApproval of the Charter Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal is a condition to the\nimplementation of the Charter Amendment and the Trust Amendment.\nIf the Charter Amendment is implemented, such approval will constitute consent for the Company to remove the\nWithdrawal Amount from the trust account, deliver to the holders of redeemed public shares their portion of the\nWithdrawal Amount and retain the remainder of the funds in the trust account for the Company’s use in connection\nwith consummating a business combination on or before August 4, 2024.\nIf the Charter Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved and the Charter Amendment\nand the Trust Amendment are implemented, the removal of the Withdrawal Amount from the trust account in\nconnection with the Election will reduce the amount held in the trust account following the Election. The Company\ncannot predict the amount that will remain in the trust account after such withdrawal if the Charter Amendment\nProposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved and the amount remaining in the trust account may be\nonly a fraction of the $20,800,165.57 (including interest but less the funds used to pay taxes) that was in the trust\naccount as of November 15, 2023. In such event, the Company may still seek to obtain additional funds to complete\na business combination, and there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on terms acceptable to the\nparties or at all. The Company will not use the proceeds placed in the trust account and the interest earned thereon\nto pay any excise taxes or any other similar fees or taxes in nature that may be imposed on the Company pursuant\nto any current, pending or future rules or laws, including without limitation any excise tax due imposed under the\nInflation Reduction Act of 2022 on any redemptions or stock buybacks by the Company.\n4\nIf the Charter Amendment Proposal or the Trust Amendment Proposal is not approved and the Combination Period\nis not extended in accordance with the terms of the existing charter, the Company will (i) cease all operations except\nfor the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter,\nand subject to having lawfully available funds therefor, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per\nshare price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest\nearned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to the Company to pay taxes, divided by\nthe number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’\nrights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable\nlaw, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining\nstockholders and our Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law\nto provide for claims of creditors and requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or\nliquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete an initial\nbusiness combination within the Combination Period.\nThe Adjournment Proposal will be presented at the special meeting only if there are not sufficient votes to approve\nthe Charter Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal or if we determine that additional time is\nnecessary to effectuate the Charter Amendment and the Trust Amendment.\nWhy is the Company proposing the Charter Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and the\nAdjournment Proposal?\nThe Company’s charter provides that the Company has the right to extend the period to complete a business\ncombination twelve times by an additional month each time after August 4, 2023 (for a total of 22 months from the\nclosing date of the IPO to complete a business combination). In order to extend the time available for the Company\nto consummate a business combination without the need for a separate stockholder vote under the charter, the\nSponsor or its affiliate or designees must deposit into the Trust Account the lesser of $0.033 per public share and\n$80,000 on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. Given current market conditions, the Sponsor would like\nto pay extension fees that are substantially less than the amount equal to the lesser of $0.033 per public share and\n$80,000 required for each monthly extension under the existing charter. The Company expects that there will be\nsignificant redemptions at the special meeting.\nThe Charter Amendment and the Trust Amendment will provide the Company additional flexibility to extend the\ndate by which the Company must complete a business combination, which our Board believes is in the best interest\nof our stockholders. The Company believes that given the Company’s expenditure of time, effort and money on\nsearching for potential business combination opportunities, including the fact that we are in active discussions\nregarding a business combination, circumstances warrant providing public stockholders an opportunity to consider\nan initial business combination. In the event that we enter into a definitive agreement for an initial business\ncombination prior to the special meeting, we will issue a press release and file a Current Report on Form 8-K with\nthe SEC announcing the proposed business combination. The purpose of the Adjournment Proposal is to allow the\nCompany to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates if we determine that additional time is necessary to\npermit further solicitation and vote of proxies in the event that there are insufficient votes to approve the Charter\nAmendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal or if we determine that additional time is necessary to\neffectuate the Charter Amendment and the Trust Amendment. Accordingly, our Board is proposing the Charter\nAmendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and, if necessary, the Adjournment Proposal to extend the\nCompany’s corporate existence until August 4, 2024.\nYou are not being asked to vote on any proposed business combination at this time. If the Charter Amendment\nis implemented and you do not elect to redeem your public shares now, you will retain the right to vote on any\nproposed business combination when and if one is submitted to the public stockholders (provided that you are\na stockholder on the record date for a meeting to consider a business combination) and the right to redeem\nyour public shares for a pro rata portion of the trust account in the event a proposed business combination is\napproved and completed or the Company has not consummated a business combination by August 4, 2024.\n5\nWhy should I vote for the Charter Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal?\nOur Board believes stockholders will benefit from the Company consummating a business combination and is\nproposing the Charter Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal to extend the date by which the\nCompany must complete a business combination until August 4, 2024. The Charter Amendment would give the\nCompany the opportunity and flexibility to complete a business combination, which our Board believes in the best\ninterests of the stockholders.\nOur charter provides that if our stockholders approve an amendment to our charter that would affect the substance\nor timing of the Company’s obligation to redeem 100% of the Company’s public shares if the Company does not\ncomplete a business combination within the Combination Period, the Company will provide our public stockholders\nwith the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of common stock upon such approval at a per share\nprice, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days\nprior to such approval, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released\nto the Company to pay taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. This charter provision was\nincluded to protect the Company’s stockholders from having to sustain their investments for an unreasonably long\nperiod if the Company failed to find a suitable business combination in the timeframe contemplated by the charter.\nThe Company also believes, however, that given the Company’s expenditure of time, effort and money on pursuing\na business combination, including the fact that we are in active discussions regarding a business combination,\ncircumstances warrant providing those who believe they might find a business combination to be an attractive\ninvestment with an opportunity to consider such transaction.\nThe Trust Agreement provides that if a business combination has not been consummated, upon the date which is\n9 months (or up to 22 months if the Combination Period is extended in accordance with the terms of the existing\ncharter) after the closing of the IPO, the trust account is to be liquidated and its proceeds are to be distributed to\nthe Company’s public stockholders of record as of such date, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust\naccount and not previously released to the Company to pay its taxes. The purpose of the Trust Amendment is to\namend the Trust Agreement to reduce the monthly extension fee to the lesser of $0.033 per public share and $20,000\nto extend the liquidation date of the trust account on a monthly basis up to twelve times from August 4, 2023 to\nAugust 4, 2024 to match the Company’s charter if the Charter Amendment is approved.\nOur Board recommends that you vote in favor of the Charter Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment\nProposal but expresses no opinion as to whether you should redeem your public shares.\nWhy should I vote for the Adjournment Proposal?\nIf the Adjournment Proposal is presented and not approved by our stockholders, our Board may not be able to\nadjourn the special meeting to a later date in the event that there are insufficient votes for, or otherwise in connection\nwith, the approval of the Charter Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal.\nOur Board recommends that you vote in favor of the Adjournment Proposal.\nWhen would the Board abandon the Charter Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal?\nOur Board will abandon the Charter Amendment and the Trust Amendment if our stockholders do not approve the\nCharter Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal. In addition, notwithstanding stockholder approval\nof the Charter Amendment Proposal, our Board will retain the right to abandon and not implement the Charter\nAmendment at any time without any further action by our stockholders.\nHow do the Company insiders intend to vote their shares?\nThe Company’s initial stockholders (the “initial stockholders”) and their respective affiliates are expected to vote\nany common stock over which they have voting control (including any public shares owned by them) in favor of all\nproposals.\nThe initial stockholders are not entitled to redeem the founder shares or any public shares held by them. On the\nrecord date, the initial stockholders beneficially owned and were entitled to vote 1,318,250 founder shares, which\nrepresents 36.86% of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock, and 269,373 shares of common stock\nunderlying the Private Units.\n6\nIn addition, the Company’s initial stockholders or advisors, or any of their respective affiliates, may purchase public\nshares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market prior to or following the special meeting, although\nthey are under no obligation to do so. There is no limit on the number of shares our initial stockholders, directors,\nofficers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law\nand NASDAQ rules. The purpose of such share purchases and other transactions would be to increase the likelihood\nthat the proposals to be voted upon at the special meeting is approved by the requisite number of votes and to\nreduce the number of public shares that are redeemed. In the event that such purchases do occur, the purchasers\nmay seek to purchase shares from stockholders who would otherwise have voted against the Charter Amendment\nProposal and Trust Amendment Proposal and elected to redeem their shares for a portion of the trust account. Any\npublic shares held by or subsequently purchased by our affiliates may be voted in favor of the Charter Amendment\nProposal and Trust Amendment Proposal. None of the initial stockholders, advisors or their respective affiliates may\nmake any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the\nseller or during a restricted period under Regulation M under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the\n“Exchange Act”).\nDoes the Board recommend voting for the approval of the Charter Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment\nProposal and, if presented, the Adjournment Proposal?\nYes. After careful consideration of the terms and conditions of the proposals, the Board has determined that the\nCharter Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and, if presented, the Adjournment Proposal are\nin the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The Board unanimously recommends that stockholders\nvote “FOR” the Charter Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and, if presented, the Adjournment\nProposal.\nWhat vote is required to adopt the Charter Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal?\nApproval of the Charter Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal will require the affirmative vote\nof holders of at least a majority and sixty-five percent (65%), respectively, of the Company’s outstanding shares of\ncommon stock, including those shares held as a constituent part of our units, on the record date.\nIf the Charter Amendment Proposal and Trust Amendment Proposal are approved, any holder of public shares may\nredeem all or a portion of their public shares at a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then\non deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to such approval, including interest earned on the funds\nheld in the trust account and not previously released to the Company to pay taxes, divided by the number of then\noutstanding public shares.\nWhat vote is required to adopt the Adjournment Proposal?\nIf presented, the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the majority of the votes cast by stockholders\nrepresented in person (including virtually) or by proxy at the special meeting.\nWhat happens if I sell my public shares or units before the special meeting?\nThe November 15, 2023 record date is earlier than the date of the special meeting. If you transfer your public shares,\nincluding those shares held as a constituent part of our units, after the record date, but before the special meeting,\nunless the transferee obtains from you a proxy to vote those shares, you will retain your right to vote at the special\nmeeting. If you transfer your public shares prior to the record date, you will have no right to vote those shares at the\nspecial meeting. If you acquired your public shares after the record date, you will still have an opportunity to redeem\nthem if you so decide.\nWhat if I don’t want to vote for the Charter Amendment Proposal and/or the Trust Amendment Proposal?\nIf you do not want the Charter Amendment Proposal or the Trust Amendment Proposal to be approved, you must\nabstain, not vote, or vote against the proposal. If the Charter Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment\nProposal are approved, and the Charter Amendment is implemented, then the Withdrawal Amount will be withdrawn\nfrom the trust account and paid to the redeeming holders.\n7\nWhat if I don’t want to vote for the Adjournment Proposal?\nIf you do not want the Adjournment Proposal to be approved, you must vote against the proposal. Abstentions will be\ncounted in connection with the determination of whether a valid quorum is established but will have no effect on the\noutcome of the vote on the Adjournment Proposal.\nWill you seek any further extensions to liquidate the trust account?\nThe Company does not currently anticipate seeking any further extension to consummate its initial business\ncombination beyond August 4, 2024, although it may determine to do so in the future.\nWhat happens if the Charter Amendment Proposal or the Trust Amendment Proposal is not approved?\nIf the Charter Amendment Proposal or the Trust Amendment Proposal is not approved and the Combination Period\nis not extended in accordance with the terms of the existing charter, the Company will (i) cease all operations except\nfor the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter,\nand subject to having lawfully available funds therefor, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per\nshare price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest\nearned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to the Company to pay taxes, divided by\nthe number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’\nrights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable\nlaw, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining\nstockholders and our Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law\nto provide for claims of creditors and requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or\nliquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete an initial\nbusiness combination within the Combination Period.\nIf the Charter Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved, what happens next?\nIf the Charter Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved, the Company will continue to\nattempt to consummate an initial business combination until August 4, 2024.\nIf the Charter Amendment Proposal is approved, the Company will file an amendment to the charter with the\nSecretary of State of the State of Delaware in the form of Annex A hereto. The Company will remain a reporting\ncompany under the Exchange Act, and its units, public shares, and public warrants will remain publicly traded. The\nCompany will also execute an amendment to the Trust Agreement in the form of Annex B hereto.\nIf the Charter Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved, the Contributors have agreed\nthey will contribute to the trust account the lesser of $0.033 per outstanding share and $20,000 per month for each\nsubsequent one-month Extension, paid on a month-to-month and as-needed basis, upon five days’ advance notice\nprior to the applicable deadlines, to extend the Combination Period to August 4, 2024 and on a monthly basis up to\ntwelve times from August 4, 2023 to August 4, 2024. Each Contribution will be deposited in the trust account within\ntwo business days prior to the beginning of the additional extension period (or portion thereof).\nIf the Charter Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved, the removal of the Withdrawal\nAmount from the trust account will reduce the amount remaining in the trust account and increase the percentage\ninterest of the Company’s common stock held by our initial stockholders through the founder shares.\nIf I do not redeem my shares now, would I still be able to vote on an initial business combination and exercise my\nredemption rights with respect to an initial business combination?\nYes. If you do not redeem your shares in connection with the Charter Amendment Proposal, then, assuming you are\na stockholder as of the record date for voting on a business combination, you will be able to vote on the business\ncombination when it is submitted to stockholders. You will also retain your right to redeem your public shares upon\nconsummation of a business combination, subject to any limitations set forth in the charter, as amended.\n8\nWhen and where is the special meeting?\nThe special meeting will be held at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time, on December 7, 2023, in person. The Company’s\nstockholders may attend, vote and examine the list of stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting.\nYou will be able to attend the special meeting physically at Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP, 1177 Avenue of\nthe Americas, 29th Floor, New York, New York 10036.\nHow do I attend the special meeting, and will I be able to ask questions?\nThe special meeting will be held at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time, on December 7, 2023, in person. The Company’s\nstockholders may attend, vote and examine the list of stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting or by proxy.\nYou will be able to attend the special meeting physically at Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP, 1177 Avenue of\nthe Americas, 29th Floor, New York, New York 10036.\nHow do I vote?\nIf you are a holder of record of Company common stock, including those shares held as a constituent part of our\nunits, you may vote at the special meeting or by submitting a proxy for the special meeting. Whether or not you\nplan to attend the special meeting, the Company urges you to vote by proxy to ensure your vote is counted. You\nmay submit your proxy by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying\npre-addressed postage paid envelope. You may still attend the special meeting and vote in person if you have already\nvoted by proxy.\nIf your shares of Company common stock, including those shares held as a constituent part of our units, are held in\n“street name” by a broker or other agent, you have the right to direct your broker or other agent on how to vote the\nshares in your account. You are also invited to attend the special meeting. However, since you are not the stockholder\nof record, you may not vote your shares in person at the special meeting unless you request and obtain a valid proxy\nfrom your broker or other agent.\nHow do I change my vote?\nIf you have submitted a proxy to vote your shares and wish to change your vote, you may do so by delivering a\nlater-dated, signed proxy card prior to the date of the special meeting or by voting in person at the special meeting.\nAttendance at the special meeting alone will not change your vote. You also may revoke your proxy by sending a\nnotice of revocation to the Company at 1178 Broadway, 3rd Floor, New York, NY 10001, Attn: Corporate Secretary.\nHow are votes counted?\nVotes will be counted by the inspector of election appointed for the special meeting, who will separately count\n“FOR” and “AGAINST” votes, abstentions and broker non-votes. Because approval of the Charter Amendment\nProposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the stockholders holding at least a\nmajority of the public shares and founder shares outstanding on the record date, abstentions and broker non-votes\nwill have the same effect as votes against the Charter Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal.\nApproval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the majority of the votes cast by stockholders\nrepresented in person (including virtually) or by proxy. Abstentions will be counted in connection with the\ndetermination of whether a valid quorum is established but will have no effect on the outcome of the Adjournment\nProposal.\nIf my shares are held in “street name,” will my broker automatically vote them for me?\nNo. Under the rules governing banks and brokers who submit a proxy card with respect to shares held in street name,\nsuch banks and brokers have the discretion to vote on routine matters, but not on non-routine matters. It is expected\nthat all proposals to be voted on at the special meeting will be treated as “non-routine” matters and therefore, we do\nnot expect there to be any broker non-votes at the special meeting.\n9\nYour bank, broker, or other nominee can vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote. You should\ninstruct your broker to vote your shares in accordance with directions you provide. If your shares are held by your\nbroker as your nominee, which we refer to as being held in “street name”, you may need to obtain a proxy form from\nthe institution that holds your shares and follow the instructions included on that form regarding how to instruct your\nbroker to vote your shares.\nWhat is a quorum requirement?\nA quorum of stockholders is necessary to hold a valid meeting. A quorum will be present if at least a majority of the\noutstanding shares of common stock on the record date, including those shares held as a constituent part of our units,\nare represented virtually or by proxy at the special meeting.\nYour shares will be counted towards the quorum only if you submit a valid proxy (or one is submitted on your behalf\nby your broker, bank or other nominee) or if you vote in person at the special meeting. Because all of the proposals\nto be voted on at the special meeting are expected to be treated as “non-routine” matters, banks, brokers and other\nnominees will not have authority to vote on any proposals unless instructed, so we do not expect there to be any\nbroker non-votes at the special meeting. If there is no quorum, the presiding officer of the special meeting may\nadjourn the special meeting to another date.\nWho can vote at the special meeting?\nOnly holders of record of the Company’s common stock, including those shares held as a constituent part of our\nunits, at the close of business on November 15, 2023, are entitled to have their vote counted at the special meeting\nand any adjournments or postponements thereof. As of the record date, there were 3,575,635 outstanding shares of\ncommon stock outstanding and entitled to vote.\nStockholder of Record: Shares Registered in Your Name. If on the record date your shares or units were registered\ndirectly in your name with the Company’s transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, then you are\na stockholder of record. As a stockholder of record, you may vote in person at the special meeting or vote by proxy.\nWhether or not you plan to attend the special meeting in person, the Company urges you to fill out and return the\nenclosed proxy card to ensure your vote is counted.\nBeneficial Owner: Shares Registered in the Name of a Broker or Bank. If on the record date your shares or units\nwere held, not in your name, but rather in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, dealer, or other similar organization,\nthen you are the beneficial owner of shares held in “street name” and these proxy materials are being forwarded to\nyou by that organization. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker or other agent on how to\nvote the shares in your account. You are also invited to attend the special meeting in person. However, since you are\nnot the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the special meeting unless you request and\nobtain a valid proxy from your broker or other agent.\nWhat interests do the Company’s directors and executive officers have in the approval of the Charter Amendment\nProposal?\nThe Company’s directors and executive officers have interests in the Charter Amendment Proposal that may\nbe different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder. These interests include ownership by them\nor their affiliates of founder shares and the Private Units, loans by them that will not be repaid in the event of\nour winding up and the possibility of future compensatory arrangements. See the section entitled “The Charter\nAmendment — Interests of the Company’s Directors and Officers.”\nWhat if I object to the Charter Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and/or the Adjournment\nProposal? Do I have appraisal rights?\nStockholders do not have appraisal rights in connection with either the Charter Amendment Proposal, the Trust\nAmendment Proposal or, if presented, the Adjournment Proposal under the DGCL.\n10\nWhat happens to the Company’s warrants if the Charter Amendment Proposal and Trust Amendment Proposal\nare not approved?\nIf the Charter Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are not approved and the Combination\nPeriod is not extended in accordance with the terms of the existing charter, the Company will (i) cease all operations\nexcept for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days\nthereafter, and subject to having lawfully available funds therefor, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a\nper share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest\nearned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to the Company to pay taxes, divided by\nthe number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’\nrights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable\nlaw, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining\nstockholders and our Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to\nprovide for claims of creditors and requirements of other applicable law. There will be no distribution from the trust\naccount with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless in the event the Company winds up.\nWhat happens to the Company warrants if the Charter Amendment Proposal and Trust Amendment Proposal are\napproved?\nIf the Charter Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved, the Company will continue\nits efforts to consummate a business combination until August 4, 2024 and will retain the blank check company\nrestrictions previously applicable to it. The warrants will remain outstanding in accordance with their terms.\nHow do I redeem my public shares?\nIf the Extension is implemented, each public stockholder may seek to redeem all or a portion of his or her public\nshares at a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as\nof two business days prior to the approval of the Extension, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust\naccount and not previously released to the Company to pay taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public\nshares. You will also be able to redeem your public shares in connection with any stockholder vote to approve a\nbusiness combination, or if the Company has not consummated a business combination by August 4, 2024.\nPursuant to our charter, a public stockholder may request that the Company redeem all or a portion of such public\nstockholder’s public shares for cash if the Charter Amendment Proposal is approved. You will be entitled to receive\ncash for any public shares to be redeemed only if you:\n(i) (a) hold public shares or (b) hold public shares through units and you elect to separate your units into the\nunderlying public shares and public warrants prior to exercising your redemption rights with respect to\nthe public shares; and\n(ii) prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern time, on December 5, 2023 (two business days prior to the scheduled vote\nat the special meeting), (a) submit a written request, including the name, phone number, and address\nof the beneficial owner of the shares for which redemption is requested, to American Stock Transfer &\nTrust Company, the Company’s transfer agent, at American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, 6201\n15th Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11219, Attn: SPACSUPPORT@equiniti.com, that the Company redeem your\npublic shares for cash and (b) deliver your public shares to the transfer agent, physically or electronically\nthrough The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”).\nHolders of units must elect to separate the underlying public shares and public warrants prior to exercising\nredemption rights with respect to the public shares. If holders hold their units in an account at a brokerage firm or\nbank, holders must notify their broker or bank that they elect to separate the units into the underlying public shares\nand public warrants, or if a holder holds units registered in its own name, the holder must contact the transfer agent\ndirectly and instruct it to do so. Public stockholders may elect to redeem all or a portion of their public shares\nregardless of whether they vote for or against the Charter Amendment Proposal and regardless of whether\nthey hold public shares on the record date.\n11\nIf you hold your shares through a bank or broker, you must ensure your bank or broker complies with the\nrequirements identified herein, including submitting a written request that your shares be redeemed for cash to the\ntransfer agent and delivering your shares to the transfer agent prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on December 5, 2023\n(two business days before the scheduled vote at the special meeting). You will only be entitled to receive cash in\nconnection with a redemption of these shares if you continue to hold them until the effective date of the Charter\nAmendment and Election.\nThrough DTC’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian) System, this electronic delivery process can be\naccomplished by the stockholder, whether or not it is a record holder or its shares are held in “street name,” by\ncontacting the transfer agent or its broker and requesting delivery of its shares through the DWAC system.\nDelivering shares physically may take significantly longer. In order to obtain a physical stock certificate, a\nstockholder’s broker and/or clearing broker, DTC, and the Company’s transfer agent will need to act together to\nfacilitate this request. There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of\ncertificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC system. The transfer agent will typically charge the\ntendering broker $100 and the broker would determine whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder.\nIt is the Company’s understanding that stockholders should generally allot at least two weeks to obtain physical\ncertificates from the transfer agent. The Company does not have any control over this process or over the brokers or\nDTC, and it may take longer than two weeks to obtain a physical stock certificate. Such stockholders will have less\ntime to make their investment decision than those stockholders that deliver their shares through the DWAC system.\nStockholders who request physical stock certificates and wish to redeem may be unable to meet the deadline for\ntendering their shares before exercising their redemption rights and thus will be unable to redeem their shares.\nCertificates that have not been tendered in accordance with these procedures prior to the vote on the Charter\nAmendment Proposal will not be redeemed for cash held in the trust account. In the event that a public stockholder\ntenders its shares and decides prior to the vote at the special meeting that it does not want to redeem its shares, the\nstockholder may withdraw the tender. If you delivered your shares for redemption to our transfer agent and decide\nprior to the vote at the special meeting not to redeem your public shares, you may request that our transfer agent\nreturn the shares (physically or electronically). You may make such request by contacting our transfer agent at the\naddress listed above. In the event that a public stockholder tenders shares and the Charter Amendment Proposal\nis not approved, these shares will not be redeemed and the physical certificates representing these shares will be\nreturned to the stockholder promptly following the determination that the Charter Amendment Proposal will not\nbe approved. The Company anticipates that a public stockholder who tenders shares for redemption in connection\nwith the vote to approve the Extension would receive payment of the redemption price for such shares soon after the\ncompletion of the Charter Amendment. The transfer agent will hold the certificates of public stockholders that make\nthe election until such shares are redeemed for cash or returned to such stockholders.\nIf I am a unit holder, can I exercise redemption rights with respect to my units?\nNo. Holders of outstanding units must separate the underlying public shares and public warrants prior to exercising\nredemption rights with respect to the public shares.\nIf you hold units registered in your own name, you must deliver the certificate for such units to American Stock\nTransfer & Trust Company, our transfer agent, with written instructions to separate such units into public shares, and\npublic warrants. This must be completed far enough in advance to permit the mailing of the public share certificates\nback to you so that you may then exercise your redemption rights upon the separation of the public shares from the\nunits. See “How do I redeem my public shares?” above.\nWhat should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?\nYou may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and\nmultiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards, if your shares are registered in more than one name or are registered\nin different accounts. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a\nseparate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. Please complete, sign, date\nand return each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive in order to cast a vote with respect to all of\nyour shares of common stock.\n12\nWho is paying for this proxy solicitation?\nThe Company will pay for the entire cost of soliciting proxies. The Company has engaged First Cover Stock\nTransfer, LLC (“First Cover Stock Transfer”) to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the special meeting. The\nCompany has agreed to pay First Cover Stock Transfer its customary fee. The Company will also reimburse First\nCover Stock Transfer for reasonable and customary out-of-pocket expenses. In addition to these mailed proxy\nmaterials, our directors and executive officers may also solicit proxies in person, by telephone or by other means\nof communication. These parties will not be paid any additional compensation for soliciting proxies. The Company\nmay also reimburse brokerage firms, banks and other agents for the cost of forwarding proxy materials to beneficial\nowners.\nWhere do I find the voting results of the special meeting?\nWe will announce preliminary voting results at the special meeting. The final voting results will be tallied by the\ninspector of election and published in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K, which the Company is required\nto file with the SEC within four business days following the special meeting.\nWho can help answer my questions?\nIf you have questions about the proposals or if you need additional copies of the proxy statement or the enclosed\nproxy card you should contact:\nQomolangma Acquisition Corp.\n1178 Broadway, 3rd Floor\nNew York, NY 10001\nAttn: Jonathan P.

The special meeting will be held at Kramer\nLevin Naftalis & Frankel LLP, 1177 Avenue of the Americas 29th Floor, New York, New York 10036.

Trust Amendment Proposal: To amend the Trust Agreement to reduce the monthly extension fee to\nthe lesser of $0.033 per outstanding share and $20,000.\n3. Adjournment Proposal: A proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting to a later\ndate or dates, if necessary, to permit further solicitation and vote of proxies in the event that there are\ninsufficient votes to approve the Charter Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal or\nif we determine that additional time is necessary to effectuate the Charter Amendment and the Trust\nAmendment. The Adjournment Proposal will only be presented at the special meeting if there are not\nsufficient votes for, or otherwise in connection with, the approval of the Charter Amendment Proposal\nand the Trust Amendment Proposal.\nVoting Power; Record Date\nYou will be entitled to vote or direct votes to be cast at the special meeting if you owned our common stock,\nincluding as a constituent part of a unit, at the close of business on November 15, 2023, the record date for the\nspecial meeting. You will have one vote per share for each share of common stock you owned at that time. Our\nwarrants do not carry voting rights.\nAt the close of business on the record date, there were 3,575,635 shares of common stock outstanding, each of which\nentitles its holder to cast one vote per share. The warrants do not carry voting rights.\nVotes Required\nApproval of the Charter Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal will require the affirmative vote\nof holders of at least a majority and sixty-five percent (65%), respectively, of the Company’s public shares and\nfounder shares outstanding on the record date.\nApproval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the majority of the votes cast by stockholders\nrepresented in person (including virtually) or by proxy at the special meeting.\nIf you do not vote (i.e., you “abstain” from voting), your action will have the same effect as an “AGAINST” vote\nwith regards to the Charter Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal. Abstentions will be counted in\nconnection with the determination of whether a valid quorum is established but will have no effect on the outcome\nof the Adjournment Proposal.\nIf you do not want the Charter Amendment Proposal or the Trust Amendment Proposal to be approved, you must\nabstain, not vote, or vote against the proposal. The Company anticipates that a public stockholder who tenders shares\nfor redemption in connection with the vote to approve the Charter Amendment Proposal would receive payment of\nthe redemption price for such shares soon after the completion of the Charter Amendment.\nIf you do not want the Adjournment Proposal to be approved, you must vote against the proposal. Abstentions will be\ncounted in connection with the determination of whether a valid quorum is established but will have no effect on the\noutcome of the Adjournment Proposal.\n14\nVoting\nYou can vote your shares at the special meeting by proxy or in person.\nYou can vote by proxy by having one or more individuals who will be at the special meeting vote your shares for\nyou. These individuals are called “proxies” and using them to cast your vote at the special meeting is called voting\n“by proxy.”\nIf you wish to vote by proxy, you must (i) complete the enclosed form, called a “proxy card,” and mail it in the\nenvelope provided or (ii) submit your proxy by telephone or over the Internet (if those options are available to you)\nin accordance with the instructions on the enclosed proxy card or voting instruction card.\nIf you complete the proxy card and mail it in the envelope provided or submit your proxy by telephone or over the\nInternet as described above, you will designate Jonathan P. Myers to act as your proxy at the special meeting. One\nof them will then vote your shares at the special meeting in accordance with the instructions you have given them in\nthe proxy card or voting instructions, as applicable, with respect to the proposals presented in this proxy statement.\nProxies will extend to, and be voted at, any adjournment(s) of the special meeting.\nAlternatively, you can vote your shares in person by attending the special meeting in person.\nA special note for those who plan to attend the special meeting and vote in person: if your shares or units are held\nin the name of a broker, bank or other nominee, please follow the instructions you receive from your broker, bank\nor other nominee holding your shares. You will not be able to vote at the special meeting unless you obtain a legal\nproxy from the record holder of your shares.\nOur Board is asking for your proxy. Giving our Board your proxy means you authorize it to vote your shares at the\nspecial meeting in the manner you direct. You may vote for or against any proposal or you may abstain from voting.\nAll valid proxies received prior to the special meeting will be voted.

We were\nincorporated in Delaware on May 6, 2021. On September 25, 2021, the Company issued 1,437,500 founder shares to\nthe Company’s initial stockholders for an aggregate consideration of $25,000, or approximately $0.0174 per share.\nOn October 4, 2022, the Company consummated the IPO of 5,000,000 units at an offering price of $10.00 per\nunit (the “Public Units”), generating gross proceeds of $50,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO,\nthe Company sold to the Sponsor, in a private placement, 260,500 units at $10.00 per unit (the “Private Units”),\ngenerating total gross proceeds of $2,605,000.\nThe Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 1,500,000 additional Public Units to\ncover over-allotments, if any. On October 7, 2022, the underwriters partially exercised the over-allotment option\nand purchased 27,300 Public Units at a price of $10.00 per Public Unit, generating gross proceeds of $273,000.\nSimultaneously with the closing of the over-allotment option, the Company consummated the sale of an additional\naggregate of 8,873 Private Units with the Sponsor at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of\n$88,730. As a result of the underwriter’s partial exercise of the over-allotment option on October 4, 2022, 119,250\nfounder shares were forfeited for no consideration on October 7, 2022 resulting in 1,318,250 founder shares\noutstanding after the forfeiture.\nA total of $53,520,950 of the net proceeds from our initial public offering and the private placement were deposited\nin a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders.\nOn June 29, 2023, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders (the “June Special Meeting”). At the June\nSpecial Meeting, the stockholders amended the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to\nallow the Company to consummate a business combination until August 4, 2023 (or up to August 4, 2024 if the\ntime to complete a business combination is extended as described therein) to consummate a business combination.\nIn addition, if the Company anticipates that it may not be able to consummate a business combination by August 4,\n2023, the Company may extend the period of time to consummate a business combination up to twelve times, each\nby an additional one month (for a total of 22 months to complete a business combination). In order to extend the\ntime available for the Company to consummate a business combination, the Company’s insiders or their affiliates\nor designees, upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, must deposit into the trust account the\nlesser of $0.033 per outstanding share and $80,000 per month, on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline, for\neach extension.\nAs a result of redemptions by public stockholders in connection with the June Special Meeting, a total of\n$33,233,961.17 was deposited in the trust account as of August 8, 2023 for the benefit of the Company’s public\nstockholders.\nOn September 12, 2023, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders (the “September Special Meeting”).\nAt the Special Meeting, the stockholders amended the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of\nIncorporation to allow the Company to undertake an initial business combination with an entity or business, with\na physical presence, operation, or other significant ties to China (a “China-based Target”) or which may subject\nthe post-business combination business to the laws, regulations and policies of China (including Hong Kong and\nMacao), or entity or business that conducts operations in China through variable interest entities, or VIEs, pursuant\nto a series of contractual arrangements with the VIE and its shareholders on one side, and a China-based subsidiary\nof the China-based Target, on the other side.\nAs a result of redemptions by public stockholders in connection with the September Special Meeting, a total of\n$20,800,165.57 is deposited in the trust account as of November 15, 2023 for the benefit of the Company’s public\nstockholders.\n17\nThe Charter Amendment\nThe Company is proposing to amend its charter to extend the date by which the Company must consummate a\nbusiness combination to August 4, 2024.\nThe Company’s charter provides that the Company has the right to extend the period to complete a business\ncombination twelve times by an additional month each time (for a total of 22 months from the closing date of the\nIPO to complete a business combination). In order to extend the time available for the Company to consummate\na business combination without the need for a separate stockholder vote under the charter, the Sponsor or its\naffiliate or designees must deposit into the Trust Account an amount equal to the lesser of $0.033 per public share\nor $80,000 on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. Given current market conditions, the Sponsor would\nlike to pay extension fees that are substantially less than the lesser amount equal to $0.033 per public share and\n$80,000 required for each monthly extension under the existing charter. The Company expects that there will be\nsignificant redemptions at the special meeting. The Charter Amendment will provide the Company with additional\ntime to complete an initial business combination. Approval of the Charter Amendment Proposal is a condition to the\nimplementation of the Charter Amendment.\nWe are currently in discussions with respect to a business combination. In the event that we enter into a definitive\nagreement for an initial business combination prior to the special meeting, we will issue a press release and file a\nCurrent Report on Form 8-K with the SEC announcing a proposed business combination.\nIf the Charter Amendment Proposal is not approved and the Combination Period is not extended in accordance with\nthe terms of the existing charter, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up,\n(ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, and subject to having lawfully\navailable funds therefor, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per share price, payable in cash, equal\nto the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust\naccount and not previously released to the Company to pay taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public\nshares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right\nto receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably\npossible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our Board, dissolve\nand liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and\nrequirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect\nto our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete an initial business combination within the\nCombination Period.\nA copy of the proposed amendment to the Company’s charter is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A.\nReasons for the Proposal\nThe Company’s charter provides that the Company has the right to extend the period to complete a business\ncombination twelve times by an additional month each time (for a total of 21 months to complete a business\ncombination). In order to extend the time available for the Company to consummate a business combination without\nthe need for a separate stockholder vote under the charter, the Sponsor or its affiliate or designees must deposit into\nthe Trust Account the lesser of $0.033 per public share and $80,000 on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline.\nGiven current market conditions, the Sponsor would like to pay extension fees that are substantially less than the\namount equal to the lesser of $0.033 per public share and $80,000 required for each monthly extension under the\nexisting charter. The Company expects that there will be significant redemptions at the special meeting.\nThe Charter Amendment will provide the Company with additional time to complete a business combination, which\nour Board believes is in the best interest of our stockholders. The Company believes that given the Company’s\nexpenditure of time, effort and money on searching for potential business combination opportunities, including the\nfact that we are in active discussions regarding a business combination, circumstances warrant providing public\nstockholders an opportunity to consider an initial business combination. Accordingly, since the Company will not be\nable to complete an initial business combination within the Combination Period, the Company has determined to seek\nstockholder approval to extend the time for closing a business combination beyond the last day of the Combination\nPeriod to August 4, 2024. The Company and its officers and directors agreed that they would not seek to amend the\nCompany’s charter to allow for a longer period of time to complete a business combination unless the Company\nprovided holders of public shares with the right to seek conversion of their public shares in connection therewith.\n18\nIf the Charter Amendment Proposal is Not Approved\nStockholder approval of the Charter Amendment Proposal is required for the implementation of our Board’s plan to\nextend the date by which we must consummate an initial business combination. Therefore, our Board will abandon\nand not implement the Charter Amendment unless our stockholders approve the Charter Amendment Proposal.\nIf the Charter Amendment Proposal is not approved and the Combination Period is not extended in accordance with\nthe terms of the existing charter, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up,\n(ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, and subject to having lawfully\navailable funds therefor, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per share price, payable in cash, equal\nto the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust\naccount and not previously released to the Company to pay taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public\nshares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right\nto receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably\npossible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our Board, dissolve\nand liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and\nrequirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to\nour warrants, which will expire worthless in the event the Company winds up.\nThe holders of the founder shares have waived their rights to participate in any liquidation distribution with respect\nto such shares. There will be no distribution from the trust account with respect to the Company’s warrants, which\nwill expire worthless in the event the Charter Amendment Proposal is not approved. The Company will pay the costs\nof liquidation from its remaining assets outside of the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, the Sponsor has\nagreed to advance it the funds necessary to complete such liquidation and has agreed not to seek repayment of such\nexpenses.\nIf the Charter Amendment Proposal is Approved\nIf the Charter Amendment Proposal is approved, the Company will file an amendment to the charter with the\nSecretary of State of the State of Delaware in the form of Annex A hereto to extend the time it has to complete a\nbusiness combination until August 4, 2024. The Company will remain a reporting company under the Exchange Act,\nand its units, common stock and public warrants will remain publicly traded. The Company will then continue to\nwork to consummate a business combination by August 4, 2024.\nYou are not being asked to vote on a business combination at this time. If the Extension is implemented and\nyou do not elect to redeem your public shares in connection with the Extension, you will retain the right\nto vote on a business combination when it is submitted to the public stockholders (provided that you are a\nstockholder on the record date for a meeting to consider a business combination) and the right to redeem your\npublic shares for a pro rata portion of the trust account in the event a business combination is approved and\ncompleted or the Company has not consummated a business combination by August 4, 2024.\nIf the Charter Amendment Proposal is approved and the Extension is implemented, the removal of the Withdrawal\nAmount from the trust account in connection with the Election will reduce the amount held in the trust account\nfollowing the Election. The Company cannot predict the amount that will remain in the trust account after such\nwithdrawal if the Charter Amendment Proposal is approved and the amount remaining in the trust account may be\nonly a fraction of the $20,800,165.57 (including interest but less the funds used to pay taxes) that was in the trust\naccount as of the record date. In such event, the Company may still seek to obtain additional funds to complete a\nbusiness combination, and there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on terms acceptable to the\nparties or at all. The Company will not use the proceeds placed in the trust account and the interest earned thereon\nto pay any excise taxes or any other similar fees or taxes in nature that may be imposed on the Company pursuant\nto any current, pending or future rules or laws, including without limitation any excise tax due imposed under the\nInflation Reduction Act of 2022 on any redemptions or stock buybacks by the Company.\n19\nRedemption Rights\nIf the Charter Amendment Proposal is approved, and the Extension is implemented, public stockholders may elect\nto redeem their shares for a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the\ntrust account as of two business days prior to such approval, including interest earned on the funds held in the\ntrust account and not previously released to the Company to pay taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding\npublic shares. If the Charter Amendment Proposal is approved by the requisite vote of stockholders, the remaining\nholders of public shares will retain the opportunity to have their public shares redeemed in conjunction with the\nconsummation of a business combination, subject to any limitations set forth in our charter, as amended. In addition,\npublic stockholders who vote for the Charter Amendment Proposal and do not make the Election would be entitled\nto have their shares redeemed for cash if the Company has not completed a business combination by August 4, 2024.\nTO EXERCISE YOUR REDEMPTION RIGHTS, YOU MUST ENSURE YOUR BANK OR BROKER\nCOMPLIES WITH THE REQUIREMENTS IDENTIFIED HEREIN, INCLUDING SUBMITTING A\nWRITTEN REQUEST THAT YOUR SHARES BE REDEEMED FOR CASH TO THE TRANSFER AGENT\nAND DELIVERING YOUR SHARES TO THE TRANSFER AGENT PRIOR TO 5:00 P.M. EASTERN\nTIME ON DECEMBER 5, 2023 (TWO BUSINESS DAYS BEFORE THE SCHEDULED VOTE AT THE\nSPECIAL MEETING). YOU WILL ONLY BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE CASH IN CONNECTION WITH\nA REDEMPTION OF THESE SHARES IF YOU CONTINUE TO HOLD THEM UNTIL THE EFFECTIVE\nDATE OF THE CHARTER AMENDMENT PROPOSAL AND ELECTION.\nPursuant to our charter, a public stockholder may request that the Company redeem all or a portion of such public\nstockholder’s public shares for cash if the Charter Amendment Proposal is approved. You will be entitled to receive\ncash for any public shares to be redeemed only if you:\n(i) (a) hold public shares or (b) hold public shares through units and you elect to separate your units into the\nunderlying public shares and public warrants prior to exercising your redemption rights with respect to\nthe public shares; and\n(ii) prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern time, on December 5, 2023 (two business days prior to the scheduled vote at\nthe special meeting), (a) submit a written request, including the name, phone number, and address of the\nbeneficial owner of the shares for which redemption is requested, to American Stock Transfer & Trust\nCompany, the Company’s transfer agent, at American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, 6201 15th Avenue,\nBrooklyn, NY 11219, Attn: SPACSUPPORT@equiniti.com, that the Company redeem your public shares\nfor cash and (b) deliver your public shares to the transfer agent, physically or electronically through DTC.\nHolders of units must elect to separate the underlying public shares and public warrants prior to exercising\nredemption rights with respect to the public shares. If holders hold their units in an account at a brokerage firm or\nbank, holders must notify their broker or bank that they elect to separate the units into the underlying public shares\nand public warrants, or if a holder holds units registered in its own name, the holder must contact the transfer agent\ndirectly and instruct it to do so. Public stockholders may elect to redeem all or a portion of their public shares\nregardless of whether they vote for or against the Charter Amendment Proposal and regardless of whether\nthey hold public shares on the record date.\nThrough DTC’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian) System, this electronic delivery process can be\naccomplished by the stockholder, whether or not it is a record holder or its shares are held in “street name,” by\ncontacting the transfer agent or its broker and requesting delivery of its shares through the DWAC system. Delivering\nshares physically may take significantly longer. In order to obtain a physical stock certificate, a stockholder’s broker\nand/or clearing broker, DTC, and the Company’s transfer agent will need to act together to facilitate this request.\nThere is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares\nor delivering them through the DWAC system. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $100\nand the broker would determine whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. It is the Company’s\nunderstanding that stockholders should generally allot at least two weeks to obtain physical certificates from the\ntransfer agent. The Company does not have any control over this process or over the brokers or DTC, and it may\ntake longer than two weeks to obtain a physical stock certificate. Such stockholders will have less time to make their\n20\ninvestment decision than those stockholders that deliver their shares through the DWAC system. Stockholders who\nrequest physical stock certificates and wish to redeem may be unable to meet the deadline for tendering their shares\nbefore exercising their redemption rights and thus will be unable to redeem their shares. Certificates that have not\nbeen tendered in accordance with these procedures prior to the vote on the Charter Amendment will not be redeemed\nfor cash held in the trust account on the redemption date. In the event that a public stockholder tenders its shares\nand decides prior to the vote at the special meeting that it does not want to redeem its shares, the stockholder may\nwithdraw the tender. If you delivered your shares for redemption to our transfer agent and decide prior to the vote\nat the special meeting not to redeem your public shares, you may request that our transfer agent return the shares\n(physically or electronically). You may make such request by contacting our transfer agent at the address listed\nabove. In the event that a public stockholder tenders shares and the Charter Amendment Proposal is not approved,\nthese shares will not be redeemed and the physical certificates representing these shares will be returned to the\nstockholder promptly following the determination that the Charter Amendment will not be approved. The Company\nanticipates that a public stockholder who tenders shares for redemption in connection with the vote to approve the\nExtension would receive payment of the redemption price for such shares soon after the completion of the Charter\nAmendment. The transfer agent will hold the certificates of public stockholders that make the election until such\nshares are redeemed for cash or returned to such stockholders.\nIf properly demanded, the Company will redeem each public share for a per share price, payable in cash, equal to\nthe aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust\naccount and not previously released to the Company to pay taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public\nshares. Based on the amount in the trust account as of November 15, 2023, this would amount to approximately\n$10.88 per share. The closing price of the public shares on the NASDAQ on November 24, 2023, was $10.65.\nAccordingly, if the market price were to remain the same until the date of the special meeting, exercising redemption\nrights would result in a public stockholder receiving approximately $0.23 more per share than if such stockholder\nsold the public shares in the open market. The Company cannot assure public stockholders that they will be able\nto sell their public shares in the open market, even if the market price per share is higher than the redemption price\nstated above, as there may not be sufficient liquidity in its securities when such stockholders wish to sell their shares.\nIf you exercise your redemption rights, you will be exchanging your shares of the Company’s common stock for cash\nand will no longer own the shares. You will be entitled to receive cash for these shares only if you properly demand\nredemption and tender your stock certificate(s) to the Company’s transfer agent prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on\nDecember 5, 2023 (two business days before the scheduled vote at the special meeting). The Company anticipates\nthat a public stockholder who tenders shares for redemption in connection with the vote to approve the Charter\nAmendment would receive payment of the redemption price for such shares soon after the completion of the Charter\nAmendment.\nInterests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers\nWhen you consider the recommendation of our Board, you should keep in mind that the Company’s executive\nofficers and directors, and their affiliates, have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, your interests\nas a stockholder. These interests include, among other things:\n• If the Charter Amendment Proposal is not approved and the Combination Period is not extended in\naccordance with the terms of the existing charter, the 1,318,250 founder shares (after giving effect to the\nforfeiture following expiration of the unexercised underwriters’ over-allotment option) that we issued to\nthe Sponsor in exchange for an aggregate capital contribution of $25,000, or approximately $0.019 per\nshare, will be worthless (as the initial stockholders have waived liquidation rights with respect to such\nshares). The founder shares had an aggregate market value of approximately $14,039,362.50 based on\nthe last sale price for the Company’s public shares of $10.65 on the NASDAQ on November 24, 2023;\n• If the Charter Amendment Proposal is not approved and the Combination Per iod is not extended in\naccordance with the terms of the existing charter, the 269,373 Private Units purchased by the Sponsor\nfor an aggregate investment of $2,693,730, or $10.00 per Private Unit, will be worthless. The Private\nUnits had an aggregate market value (assuming they have the same value per unit as the Public\nUnits) of $2,893,066 based on the last sale price for the public units of $10.74 on the NASDAQ on\nNovember 24, 2023;\n21\n• Even if the trading price of our common stock was as low as $2.06 per share, the aggregate market value\nof the Sponsor’s founder shares alone (without taking into account the value of the Private Units) would\nbe approximately equal to the initial investment in the Company by the Sponsor. As a result, if an initial\nbusiness combination is completed, the initial stockholders are likely to be able to make a substantial\nprofit on their investment in us even at a time when the common stock has lost significant value. On\nthe other hand, if the Charter Amendment Proposal is not approved (and the Combination Period is\nnot extended in accordance with the terms of the existing charter) and the Company liquidates without\ncompleting its initial business combination before August 4, 2024, the initial stockholders will lose their\nentire investment in us;\n• The Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us, if and to the extent any claims by a third-party (other\nthan the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products\nsold to us, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a\ntransaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below: (i) $10.15 per public\nshare or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation\nof the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest\nwhich may be withdrawn to pay the Company’s taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who\nexecuted a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims\nunder the Company’s indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including\nliabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended;\n• All rights specified in the charter relating to the right of officers and directors to be indemnified by\nthe Company, and of the Company’s executive officers and directors to be exculpated from monetary\nliability with respect to prior acts or omissions, will continue after a business combination. If a business\ncombination is not approved and the Company liquidates, the Company will not be able to perform its\nobligations to its officers and directors under those provisions;\n• All of the current members of our Board are expected to continue to serve as directors at least through\nthe date of the special meeting to approve a business combination and some may continue to serve\nfollowing a business combination and receive compensation thereafter; and\n• The Company’s executive officers and directors, and their affiliates are entitled to reimbursement of\nout-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with certain activities on the Company’s behalf,\nsuch as identifying and investigating possible business targets and business combinations. However, if\nthe Company fails to obtain the Extension and consummate a business combination, they will not have\nany claim against the trust account for reimbursement. Accordingly, the Company will most likely not be\nable to reimburse these expenses if a business combination is not completed. As of the date of this proxy\nstatement, there are no outstanding out-of-pocket expenses for which the Company’s executive officers\nor directors, or their respective affiliates are awaiting reimbursement.\nAdditionally, if the Charter Amendment Proposal is approved and we consummate an initial business combination,\nthe Sponsor, officers and directors may have additional interests as will be described in the proxy statement for the\nbusiness combination.\nRequired Vote\nThe affirmative vote by holders of at least a majority of the Company’s outstanding common stock is required to\napprove the Charter Amendment. If the Charter Amendment Proposal is not approved and the Combination Period is\nnot extended in accordance with the terms of the existing charter, the Charter Amendment will not be implemented\nand the Company will be required by its charter to (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up,\n(ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, and subject to having lawfully\navailable funds therefor, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per share price, payable in cash, equal\nto the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust\nAccount and not previously released to the Company to pay taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public\nshares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right\nto receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably\n22\npossible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our Board, dissolve\nand liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and\nrequirements of other applicable law.\nAll of the Company’s initial stockholders are expected to vote any common stock owned by them in favor of the\nCharter Amendment. On the record date, the initial stockholders beneficially owned and were entitled to vote\n1,318,250 founder shares, representing 36.86% of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock, and\n269,373 shares of common stock underlying the Private Units.\nIn addition, the Company’s initial stockholders or advisors, or any of their respective affiliates, may purchase public\nshares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market prior to or following the special meeting, although\nthey are under no obligation to do so. There is no limit on the number of shares our initial stockholders, directors,\nofficers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and\nNASDAQ rules. The purpose of such share purchases and other transactions would be to increase the likelihood that\nthe proposals to be voted upon at the special meeting is approved by the requisite number of votes and to reduce the\nnumber of public shares that are redeemed. In the event that such purchases do occur, the purchasers may seek to\npurchase shares from stockholders who would otherwise have voted against the Charter Amendment Proposal and\nTrust Amendment Proposal and elected to redeem their shares for a portion of the trust account. Any public shares\nheld by or subsequently purchased by our affiliates may be voted in favor of the Charter Amendment Proposal and\nTrust Amendment Proposal. None of the initial stockholders, advisors or their respective affiliates may make any\nsuch purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or\nduring a restricted period under Regulation M under the Exchange Act.\nRecommendation\nAs discussed above, after careful consideration of all relevant factors, our Board has determined that the Charter\nAmendment Proposal is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Our Board has approved and\ndeclared advisable adoption of the Charter Amendment Proposal.\nOUR BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE “FOR” THE CHARTER AMENDMENT PROPOSAL.\nOUR BOARD EXPRESSES NO OPINION AS TO WHETHER YOU SHOULD REDEEM YOUR PUBLIC\nSHARES.\nThe existence of financial and personal interests of our directors and officers may result in a conflict of interest on\nthe part of one or more of the directors or officers between what he, she or they may believe is in the best interests\nof the Company and its stockholders and what he, she or they may believe is best for himself, herself or themselves\nin determining to recommend that stockholders vote for the proposals. See the section entitled “— The Charter\nAmendment — Interests of the Company’s Directors and Officers” for a further discussion.\n23\nTHE TRUST AMENDMENT PROPOSAL\nOverview\nThe Company entered into the Trust Agreement in connection with the IPO and a potential business combination.\nThe Trust Amendment would amend the Trust Agreement to authorize the reduction of the extension fee as\ncontemplated by the Charter Amendment Proposal.\nReasons for the Proposal\nThe purpose of the Trust Amendment Proposal is to authorize the Extension under the Trust Agreement, as the\nExtension is not contemplated under the Trust Agreement’s current terms.\nWe believe that given the Company’s expenditure of time, effort and money on pursuing an initial business\ncombination, circumstances warrant providing public stockholders an opportunity to consider a business\ncombination. For the Company to implement the Extension, the Trust Agreement must be amended to authorize the\nExtension.\nVote Required for Approval\nThe affirmative vote by holders of at least sixty-five percent (65%) of the Company’s outstanding common stock is\nrequired to approve the Trust Amendment.\nIf you do not vote, you abstain from voting or you fail to instruct your broker or other nominee as to the voting of\nshares you beneficially own, your action will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Trust Amendment\nProposal. If you do not want the Trust Amendment Proposal approved, you must abstain, not vote, or vote\n“AGAINST” the Trust Amendment Proposal.\nThe Company’s initial stockholders and their respective affiliates are expected to vote any common stock over which\nthey have voting control (including any public shares owned by them) in favor of the Trust Amendment Proposal.\nThe initial stockholders are not entitled to redeem the founder shares or any public shares held by them. On the\nrecord date, the initial stockholders beneficially owned and were entitled to vote 1,318,250 founder shares, which\nrepresents 36.86% of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock, and 269,373 shares of common stock\nunderlying the Private Units.\nRecommendation\nOur Board has determined that the Trust Amendment Proposal is in the best interests of the Company and its\nstockholders. Our Board has approved and declared advisable adoption of the Trust Amendment Proposal.\nOUR BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE “FOR” THE TRUST AMENDMENT PROPOSAL.\nThe existence of financial and personal interests of our directors and officers may result in a conflict of interest on\nthe part of one or more of the directors or officers between what he, she or they may believe is in the best interests\nof the Company and its stockholders and what he, she or they may believe is best for himself, herself or themselves\nin determining to recommend that stockholders vote for the proposals. See the section entitled “The Charter\nAmendment — Interests of the Company’s Directors and Officers” for a further discussion.\n24\nTHE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL\nOverview\nThe Adjournment Proposal, if adopted, will allow our Board to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates, if\nnecessary or appropriate, to permit further solicitation of proxies in the event that there are insufficient votes for, or\notherwise in connection with, the Charter Amendment Proposal or the Trust Amendment Proposal. The Adjournment\nProposal will be presented to our stockholders only in the event that there are insufficient votes for, or otherwise in\nconnection with, the approval of the Charter Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal.\nConsequences if the Adjournment Proposal is Not Approved\nIf the Adjournment Proposal is not approved by our stockholders, our Board may not be able to adjourn the special\nmeeting to a later date in the event that there are insufficient votes for, or otherwise in connection with, the approval\nof the Charter Amendment Proposal or the Trust Amendment Proposal.\nRequired Vote\nThe approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by the\nCompany’s stockholders represented in person (including virtually) or by proxy at the special meeting. Accordingly,\nif a valid quorum is otherwise established, a stockholder’s failure to vote by proxy or in person (including virtually)\nat the special meeting or an abstention will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on the Adjournment Proposal.\nAbstentions will be counted in connection with the determination of whether a valid quorum is established but will\nhave no effect on the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal.\nRecommendation\nAs discussed above, after careful consideration of all relevant factors, our Board has determined that the\nAdjournment Proposal is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Our Board has approved and\ndeclared advisable the adoption of the Adjournment Proposal.\nOUR BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE “FOR” THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL.\nThe existence of financial and personal interests of our directors and officers may result in a conflict of interest on\nthe part of one or more of the directors or officers between what he, she or they may believe is in the best interests\nof the Company and its stockholders and what he, she or they may believe is best for himself, herself or themselves\nin determining to recommend that stockholders vote for the proposals.
