Words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” co\nnd\n“forecasts,” “plans,” \"outlook,\" “projects,” “will,” “intends,” variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements.\nar\nManagement judgments relating to and discussion of the provision and allowance for credit losses, allowance for uncertain tax positions, accruals for loss\ny\ncontingencies and valuation of mortgage servicing rights involve judgments as to expected events and are inherently forward-looking statements. Assessments\nbr\nthat acquisitions and growth endeavors will be profitable are necessary statements of belief as to the outcome of future events based in part on information\nan\nprovided by others which BOK Financial has not independently verified. These various forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and\nd\ninvolve certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions which are difficult to predict with regard to timing, extent, likelihood and degree of occurrence. Therefore, co\nactual results and outcomes may materially differ from what is expected, implied or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. Internal and external factors lor\nthat might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to changes in government, changes in commodity prices, interest rates and interest rate s\nrelationships, inflation, demand for products and services, the degree of competition by traditional and nontraditional competitors, changes in banking regulations,\ntax laws, prices, levies and assessments, the impact of technological advances, and trends in customer behavior as well as their ability to repay loans.\nFor a discussion of risk factors that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, please refer to BOK Financial Corporation’s most recent annual and\nquarterly reports. BOK Financial Corporation and its affiliates undertake no obligation to update, amend, or clarify forward-looking statements, whether as a result of\nnew information, future events, or otherwise.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures: This presentation may refer to non-GAAP financial measures.
