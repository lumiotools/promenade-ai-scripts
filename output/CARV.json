BUSINESS.\nOVERVIEW\nCarver Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), is the holding company for Carver Federal Savings\nBank (“Carver Federal” or the “Bank”), a federally chartered savings bank. The Company is headquartered in New York,\nNew York. The Company conducts business as a unitary savings and loan holding company, and the principal business of the\nCompany consists of the operation of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Carver Federal. Carver Federal was founded in 1948 to\nserve African-American communities whose residents, businesses and institutions had limited access to mainstream financial\nservices. The Bank remains headquartered in Harlem, and predominantly all of its seven branches and four stand-alone 24/7\nATM centers are located in low- to moderate-income neighborhoods. Many of these historically underserved communities\nhave experienced unprecedented growth and diversification of incomes, ethnicity and economic opportunity, after decades of\npublic and private investment.\nCarver Federal is among the largest African-American operated banks in the United States. The Bank remains\ndedicated to expanding wealth-enhancing opportunities in the communities it serves by increasing access to capital and other\nfinancial services for consumers, businesses and non-profit organizations, including faith-based institutions. A measure of its\nprogress in achieving this goal includes the Bank's sixth consecutive \"Outstanding\" rating, issued by the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency (the \"OCC\") following its most recent Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) examination in\nMarch 2022. The OCC found that 90% of Carver Federal's loans were made within our assessment area, and the Bank has\ndemonstrated excellent responsiveness to its assessment area's needs through its community development lending, investing\nand service activities. The Bank had approximately $735.3 million in assets and 107 employees as of March 31, 2022.\nCarver Federal engages in a wide range of consumer and commercial banking services. The Bank provides deposit\nproducts, including demand, savings and time deposits for consumers, businesses, and governmental and quasi-governmental\nagencies in its local market area within New York City. In addition to deposit products, Carver Federal offers a number of\nother consumer and commercial banking products and services, including debit cards, online account opening and banking,\nonline bill pay and telephone banking. Carver Federal also offers a suite of products and services for unbanked and\nunderbanked consumers, branded as Carver Community Cash. This includes check cashing, wire transfers, bill payment,\nreloadable prepaid cards and money orders.\nCarver Federal offers loan products covering a variety of asset classes, including commercial and multifamily\nmortgages, and business loans. The Bank finances mortgage and loan products through deposits or borrowings. Funds not\nused to originate mortgages and loans are invested primarily in U.S. government agency securities and mortgage-backed\nsecurities.\nThe Bank's primary market area for deposits consists of the areas served by its seven branches in the Brooklyn,\nManhattan and Queens boroughs of New York City. The neighborhoods in which the Bank's branches are located have\nhistorically been low- to moderate-income areas. The Bank's primary lending market includes Kings, New York, Bronx and\nQueens Counties in New York City, and lower Westchester County, New York. Although the Bank's branches are primarily\nlocated in areas that were historically underserved by other financial institutions, the Bank faces significant competition for\ndeposits and mortgage lending in its market areas. Management believes that this competition has become more intense as a\nresult of increased examination emphasis by federal banking regulators on financial institutions' fulfillment of their\nresponsibilities under the CRA and more recently due to the decline in demand for loans. Carver Federal's market area has a\nhigh density of financial institutions, many of which have greater financial resources, name recognition and market presence,\nand all of which are competitors to varying degrees. The Bank's competition for loans comes principally from commercial\nbanks, savings institutions and mortgage banking companies. The Bank's most direct competition for deposits comes from\ncommercial banks, savings institutions and credit unions. Competition for deposits also comes from money market mutual\nfunds, corporate and government securities funds, and financial intermediaries such as brokerage firms and insurance\ncompanies. Many of the Bank's competitors have substantially greater resources and offer a wider array of financial services\nand products. This, combined with competitors' larger presence in the New York market, add to the challenges the Bank faces\nin expanding its current market share and growing its near-term profitability.\nCarver Federal's 70-year history in its market area, its community involvement and relationships, targeted products\nand services and personal service consistent with community banking, help the Bank compete with competitors that have\nentered its market.\n3\nThe Bank formalized its many community focused investments on August 18, 2005, by forming Carver Community\nDevelopment Corporation (\"CCDC\"). CCDC oversees the Bank's participation in local economic development and other\ncommunity-based initiatives, including financial literacy activities. CCDC coordinates the Bank's development of an\ninnovative approach to reach the unbanked customer market in Carver Federal's communities. Importantly, CCDC\nspearheads the Bank's applications for grants and other resources to help fund these important community activities. In this\nconnection, Carver Federal has successfully competed with large regional and global financial institutions in a number of\ncompetitions for government grants and other awards.\nGENERAL\nCarver Bancorp, Inc.\nThe Company is the holding company for Carver Federal and its other active direct subsidiary, Carver Statutory Trust I\n(the “Trust”), a Delaware trust.\nThe principal business of the Company consists of the operation of its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank. The\nCompany's administrative offices are located at 1825 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10034. The home office of the Bank\nis located at 75 West 125th Street, New York, New York 10027. The Company's telephone number is (718) 230-2900.\nCarver Federal Savings Bank\nCarver Federal was chartered in 1948 and began operations in 1949 as Carver Federal Savings and Loan Association, a\nfederally chartered mutual savings and loan association, at which time it obtained federal deposit insurance and became a\nmember of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (the “FHLB-NY”). Carver Federal was founded as an African- and\nCaribbean-American operated institution to provide residents of underserved communities the ability to invest their savings and\nobtain credit. Carver Federal Savings and Loan Association converted to a federal savings bank in 1986 and changed its name\nat that time to Carver Federal Savings Bank.\nOn March 8, 1995, Carver Federal formed CFSB Realty Corp. as a wholly-owned subsidiary to hold real estate\nacquired through foreclosure pending eventual disposition. At March 31, 2022, this subsidiary had $267 thousand in total\nassets. During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003, Carver Federal formed Carver Asset Corporation\n(“CAC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary which qualifies as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) pursuant to the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended. This subsidiary may, among other things, be utilized by Carver Federal to raise capital in\nthe future. As of March 31, 2022, CAC owned mortgage loans carried at approximately $6.7 million and total assets of $129.3\nmillion. On August 18, 2005, Carver Federal formed CCDC, a wholly-owned community development entity, to facilitate and\ndevelop innovative approaches to financial literacy, address the needs of the unbanked and participate in local economic\ndevelopment and other community-based activities. As part of its operations, CCDC monitors the portfolio of investments\nrelated to NMTC awards and makes application for additional awards.\nCarver Statutory Trust I\nCarver Statutory Trust (the \"Trust\") was formed in 2003 for the purpose of issuing $13.0 million aggregate liquidation\namount of floating rate Capital Securities due September 17, 2033 (“Capital Securities”) and $0.4 million of common securities,\nwhich are wholly owned by Carver Bancorp, Inc. and the sole voting securities of the Trust. The Company has fully and\nunconditionally guaranteed the Capital Securities along with all obligations of the Trust under the trust agreement relating to the\nCapital Securities. In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification\n(“ASC”) 810, \"Consolidations,\" the Trust is not consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes. During the\nsecond quarter of fiscal year 2017, the Company applied for and was granted regulatory approval to settle all outstanding\ndebenture interest payments on the Carver Statutory Trust I capital securities through September 2016. Such payments were\nmade in September 2016. Debenture interest payments had been deferred beginning with the December 2016 payment, which\nis permissible under the terms of the Indenture for up to twenty consecutive quarters, as the Company is prohibited from\nmaking payments without prior approval from the Federal Reserve Bank. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, the\nCompany applied for and was granted regulatory approval to settle all outstanding debenture interest payments through June\n2021. Full payment was made on June 16, 2021. The Company deferred the September 17, 2021 interest payment, but has\nsince had discussions with the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia regarding future quarterly payments. A streamlined\nprocess has been developed for the Company to request regulatory approval to make debenture interest payments. On\nDecember 16, 2021, the Company paid the interest deferred from September 16, 2021 and the regular quarterly interest\npayment due on December 17, 2021. Subsequently, the Company made the regular quarterly interest payment on its\noutstanding debentures due on March 17, 2022 and June 17, 2022.\n4\nThe Company relies primarily on dividends from Carver Federal to pay cash dividends to its stockholders and to\nengage in share repurchase programs. The OCC regulates all capital distributions, including dividend payments, by Carver\nFederal to the Company, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (the \"FRB\") regulates dividends paid by the\nCompany. As the subsidiary of a savings and loan association holding company, Carver Federal must file a notice or an\napplication (depending on the proposed dividend amount) with the OCC (and a notice with the FRB) prior to the declaration of\neach capital distribution. The OCC will disallow any proposed dividend, for among other reasons, that would result in Carver\nFederal’s failure to meet the OCC minimum capital requirements. In accordance with the Agreement, Carver Federal is\ncurrently prohibited from paying any dividends without prior OCC approval, and, as such, has suspended its regular quarterly\ncash dividend to the Company. There are no assurances that dividend payments to the Company will resume.\nAt the Market Offering\nIn 2021, we entered into a sales agreement with an agent to sell, from time to time, our common stock having an\naggregate offering price of up to $20.0 million, in an “at the market offering.” As of March 31, 2022, we have sold an\naggregate of 397,367 shares of our common stock pursuant to the terms of such sales agreement, for aggregate gross proceeds\nof approximately $3.1 million. Aggregate net proceeds received were approximately $3.0 million, after deducting expenses and\ncommissions paid to the placement agent.\nHuman Capital Resources\nAt March 31, 2022, the Company had 107 employees, nearly all of whom are full-time and of which approximately\n60% were female and 86% were minorities. The majority of our employees are based in New York. Our goal is to attract,\ndevelop, retain and plan for succession of key talent and executives to achieve strategic objectives. We are continually\ninvesting in our workforce to further emphasize diversity and inclusion and to foster our employees' growth and career\ndevelopment.\nWe offer a comprehensive benefits program to our employees and design our compensation programs to attract, retain\nand motivate employees, as well as to align with Company performance. None of the Company's employees are a member of a\ncollective bargaining agreement and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant operating environmental changes that we\ndetermined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with\nhealth and safety standards as required by federal, state and local government agencies, taking into consideration guidelines of\nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health authorities. This includes implementing a hybrid\nworking model where our employees work in the office 2 to 3 times a week, simultaneously, continuing to implement safety\nmeasures for employees while on-site.\nThe Company team members actively share their talents in their communities through volunteer activities in education,\neconomic development, human and health services, and Community Reinvestment. Additionally, the Company's management\nteam works with leaders of community organizations, community development organizations, and consumer financial\neducations organizations to identify the credit, investment, and service needs of its community.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company makes available on or through its internet website, http://www.carverbank.com, its annual report on\nForm 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports filed or\nfurnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

The SEC maintains an internet website that contains reports, proxy and\ninformation statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC, including the Company, at\nhttp://www.sec.gov.\nIn addition, certain other basic corporate documents, including the Company's Corporate Governance Principles, Code\nof Ethics, the charters of the Company's Finance and Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating/Corporate\nGovernance Committee and the date of the Company's annual meeting are posted on the Company's website.

Information provided on the Company's website is not part of this annual report.\n5\nLending Activities\nGeneral. Carver Federal's loan portfolio consists primarily of mortgage and business loans originated by the Bank's\nlending teams and secured by commercial real estate including multifamily, mixed-use and owner-occupied properties.\nSubstantially all of the Bank's mortgage loans are secured by properties located within the Bank's market area. From time to\ntime, the Bank may participate or purchase loans that comply with the Bank's underwriting standards from other financial\ninstitutions or in contiguous market geographies to achieve loan growth objectives, as well as asset and geographical\ndiversification.\nIn recent years, Carver Federal has focused on the origination of commercial real estate loans extended primarily to\nmultifamily, as well as owner-occupied and mixed-use commercial loans. These loans generally have higher yields and shorter\nmaturities than one-to-four family residential properties, and include prepayment penalties that the Bank collects if the loans\npay in full prior to the contractual maturity. The Bank's increased emphasis remains on effective portfolio management and\nmonitoring of the commercial real estate and multifamily mortgage loans relative to the level of credit risk inherent in this\nmarket segment. In fiscal years 2019 and 2020, the Bank's recoveries on previously charged off loans exceeded its charge-offs\nto such an extent that additional provisions were not necessary. The provision recorded in fiscal year 2020 was primarily\nrelated to overdraft deposit charge-offs. During fiscal year 2021, Carver increased its qualitative factors and assessment criteria\ndue to the ongoing pandemic. In fiscal year 2022, the Bank adjusted its qualitative factors and assessment criteria from high to\nmedium based on improving economic factors, such as unemployment, stable interest rates and overall increased activity due to\nless pandemic related restrictions. The increase in the qualitative reserves was related to the overall increase in our loan\nportfolio, partially offset by decreases in our quantitative reserve analysis as the rolling 20 quarter historical loss look back\nperiod improved for most of our loan categories. The Bank could be required to maintain an allowance for loan losses as a\npercentage of total loans in excess of the allowance currently maintained. Additionally, Carver Federal continually reviews the\ncomposition of its mortgage loan portfolio and underwriting standards to manage the risk in the portfolio. Per the requirements\nof the Formal Agreement, the Bank has reduced its commercial real estate loan concentration as a percentage of risk-based\ncapital to a level well below that mandated by its regulators.\nLoan Portfolio Composition. Total loans receivable increased $96.0 million, or 20.0%, to $576.5 million at March 31,\n2022, compared to $480.5 million at March 31, 2021. Carver Federal's total loans receivable as a percentage of total assets\nincreased to 78.4% at March 31, 2022, compared to 71.0% at March 31, 2021.\nThe following is a summary of loans receivable, net of allowance for loan losses, as of:\nMarch 31, 2022 March 31, 2021 March 31, 2020 March 31, 2019 March 31, 2018\n$ in thousands Amount % Amount % Amount % Amount % Amount %\nGross loans receivable:\nOne-to-four family $ 69,297 12.0 % $ 76,313 15.9 % $ 105,532 24.8 % $ 108,363 25.4 % $ 121,233 25.6 %\nMultifamily 160,800 27.9 % 103,584 21.6 89,241 21.0 86,177 20.2 103,887 21.9\nCommercial real estate 174,270 30.2 % 150,114 31.2 141,761 33.3 130,812 30.7 141,835 29.9\nBusiness 170,497 29.6 % 148,020 30.8 85,425 20.1 96,430 22.6 102,004 21.5\nConsumer and other (1) 1,623 0.3 % 2,439 0.5 3,213 0.8 4,023 0.9 5,238 1.1\nTotal loans receivable $ 576,487 100.0 % $ 480,470 100.0 % $ 425,172 100.0 % $ 425,805 100.0 % $ 474,197 100.0 %\nUnamortized premiums,\ndeferred costs and fees, net 3,017 3,079 3,560 3,023 3,556\nAllowance for loan losses (5,624) (5,140) (4,946) (4,646) (5,126)\nTotal loans receivable, net $ 573,880 $ 478,409 $ 423,786 $ 424,182 $ 472,627\n(1)Includes personal loans\nOne-to-four Family Residential Lending.

The Bank purchased $11.3 million and $2.8 million of\none-to-four family residential loans during fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Approximately 21.2% of the one-to-four\nfamily residential mortgage loans maturing in greater than one year at March 31, 2022 were adjustable rate and approximately\n78.8% were fixed-rate. One-to-four family residential real estate loans decreased $7.0 million, or 9.2%, to $69.3 million at\nMarch 31, 2022, compared to $76.3 million at March 31, 2021.\n6\nCarver Federal's fixed-rate, one-to-four family residential mortgage loans are underwritten in accordance with\napplicable secondary market underwriting guidelines and requirements for sale. From time to time, the Bank has sold such\nloans to Fannie Mae, the State of New York Mortgage Agency (“SONYMA”) and other third parties. Loans are generally sold\nwith limited recourse on a servicing retained basis except to SONYMA where the sale is made with servicing released. Carver\nFederal uses a servicing firm to sub-service mortgage loans, whether held in portfolio or sold with servicing retained. At\nMarch 31, 2022, the Bank, through its sub-servicer, serviced $14.2 million in loans for FNMA and $341 thousand for other\nthird parties. The Bank has recorded $162 thousand in related mortgage servicing rights.\nThe retention of adjustable-rate loans in Carver Federal's portfolio helps reduce Carver Federal's exposure to increases\nin prevailing market interest rates. However, there are credit risks resulting from potential increases in costs to borrowers in the\nevent of upward repricing of adjustable-rate loans. It is possible that during periods of rising interest rates, the risk of default on\nadjustable-rate loans may increase due to increases in interest costs to borrowers. Although adjustable-rate loans allow the\nBank to increase the sensitivity of its interest-earning assets to changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest rate sensitivity\nis limited by periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustment limitations. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that yields on the\nBank's adjustable-rate loans will fully adjust to compensate for increases in the Bank's cost of funds. Adjustable-rate loans\nincrease the Bank's exposure to decreases in prevailing market interest rates, although decreases in the Bank's cost of funds\nwould tend to offset this effect to an extent as well.\nThe Bank previously originated or purchased a limited amount of subprime loans (which are defined by the Bank as\nthose loans where the borrowers have FICO scores of 660 or less at origination). At March 31, 2022, the Bank had $3.3 million\nin subprime loans, or 0.6% of its total loan portfolio, of which $1.0 million are non-performing loans. No subprime loans were\npurchased during fiscal year 2022.\nMultifamily Real Estate Lending. Traditionally, Carver Federal originates and purchases multifamily loans. The Bank\npurchased $15.1 million, $6.9 million and $7.0 million of multifamily loans during fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively. Multifamily property lending entails additional risks compared to one-to-four family residential lending. For\nexample, such loans are dependent on the successful operation of such buildings and can be significantly impacted by supply\nand demand conditions in the market for multifamily residential units. Carver Federal's multifamily real estate loan portfolio\nincreased $57.2 million, or 55.2%, to $160.8 million in fiscal 2022, or 27.9% of Carver Federal's total loan portfolio at\nMarch 31, 2022.\nIn making multifamily real estate loans, the Bank primarily considers the property's ability to generate net operating\nincome sufficient to support the debt service, the financial resources, income level and managerial expertise of the borrower, the\nmarketability of the property and the Bank's lending experience with the borrower, when applicable. Carver Federal's\nmultifamily real estate product guidelines generally require that the maximum loan-to-value (\"LTV\") at origination not exceed\n75% based on the appraised value of the mortgaged property on all such loans. The Bank generally requires a debt service\ncoverage ratio at origination of at least 1.20 on multifamily real estate loans, which requires the properties to generate cash flow\nafter expenses and allowances in excess of the principal and interest payment. Carver Federal originates and purchases\nmultifamily real estate loans, which are predominantly adjustable rate loans that generally amortize on the basis of a 15-, 20-,\n25-, or 30-year period and require a balloon payment after the first five years, or the borrower may have an option to extend the\nloan for additional periods. The Bank occasionally originates fixed rate loans with greater than five year terms on a limited\nbasis. Personal guarantees may be obtained for additional comfort and support to these borrowers.\nTo help ensure continued collateral protection and asset quality for the term of multifamily real estate loans, Carver\nFederal employs a risk rating system for its loans. All commercial loans, including multifamily real estate loans, are risk rated\ninternally at the time of origination. Management continually monitors all commercial loans in order to update risk ratings\nwhen necessary (see \"Asset Classification and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\" for additional information on asset\nclassification and risk ratings). In addition, to assist the Bank in evaluating changes in the credit profile of the borrower and the\nunderlying collateral, an independent consulting firm reviews and prepares a written report for a sample of our commercial loan\nrelationships. Accordingly, on a triannual basis, the independent loan review company i) reviews 70% to 75% of the average\ncommercial loan portfolio, ii) this includes all new and renewed loans greater than $100,000, and iii) all criticized and classified\nloans. Summary reports documenting the loan reviews are then reviewed by management for changes in the credit profile of\nindividual borrowers and the portfolio as a whole, and regularly presented to Senior Management and the Bank's Asset Liability\nand Interest Rate Risk Committee for risk assessment and monitoring.\nCommercial Real Estate Lending. Commercial real estate lending consists predominantly of originating loans for the\npurpose of purchasing or refinancing office, mixed-use (properties used for both commercial and residential purposes but\npredominantly commercial), retail and church buildings in the Bank's market area. Mixed-use loans are secured by properties\nthat are intended for both residential and business use and are classified as commercial real estate (\"CRE\"). The Bank\n7\npurchased $18.2 million, $6.3 million and $12.6 million of commercial real estate loans during fiscal years 2022, 2021 and\n2020, respectively. Although Carver Federal has experienced favorable loss history associated with commercial real estate\nloans, these loans may entail additional risks compared with one-to-four family residential and multifamily lending. For\nexample, such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers and the payment\nexperience on such loans typically is dependent on the successful operation of the commercial property.\nIn originating CRE loans, the Bank primarily considers the ability of the net operating income generated by the real\nestate to support the debt service, the financial resources, income level and managerial expertise of the borrower, the\nmarketability of the property and the Bank's lending experience with the borrower. Carver Federal's maximum LTV ratio on\ncommercial real estate mortgage loans at origination is generally 75% based on the latest appraised fair market value of the\nmortgaged property. The Bank generally requires a debt service coverage ratio at origination of at least 1.20 on commercial\nreal estate loans. The Bank also requires the assignment of rents associated with all tenant leases in the mortgaged property and\npersonal guarantees may be obtained for additional security from these borrowers.\nAt March 31, 2022, commercial real estate mortgage loans totaled $174.3 million, or 30.2% of the total loan portfolio.\nThis balance reflects a year-over-year increase of $24.2 million, or 16.1%, as a result of organic loan originations and\npurchases.\nThe Bank offers 5-year terms for our commercial mortgages. At times, we can offer greater than 5 years for terms of\nup to 15 years and amortization schedules up to 25 years; however, the interest rate generally resets every 5 years. Interest rates\ncurrently offered by the Bank are adjusted at the beginning of each adjustment period and are mostly based upon a fixed spread\nabove the FHLB-NY corresponding regular advance rate.\nHistorically, Carver Federal has been a New York City metropolitan area leader in the origination of loans to churches.\nAt March 31, 2022, loans to churches totaled $18.6 million, or 3.2% of the Bank's gross loan portfolio. These loans generally\nhave five-, seven-, or ten-year terms with 15-, 20- or 25-year amortization periods, a balloon payment due at the end of the term\nand generally have no greater than a 70% LTV ratio at origination. The Bank has also provided construction financing for\nchurches and generally provides permanent financing upon completion of construction. There are currently 21 church loans in\nthe Bank's loan portfolio.\nLoans secured by real estate owned by faith-based organizations generally are larger and involve greater risks than\none-to-four family residential mortgage loans and standard commercial real estate transactions. Because payments on loans\nsecured by such properties are often dependent on voluntary contributions by members of the church's congregation, repayment\nof such loans may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the economy. The Bank seeks to minimize these risks\nin a variety of ways, including reviewing the organization's financial condition, limiting the size of such loans and establishing\nthe quality of the collateral securing such loans. The Bank determines the appropriate amount and type of security for such\nloans based in part upon the governance structure of the particular organization, the length of time the church has been\nestablished in the community and a cash flow analysis to determine the church's ability to service the proposed loan. Carver\nFederal will obtain a first mortgage on the underlying real property and often requires personal guarantees of key members of\nthe congregation and/or key person life insurance that generally includes the pastor at a minimum, depending on the church\nmake-up. The Bank may also require the church to obtain key person life insurance on specific members of the church's\nleadership. While asset quality in the church loan category historically has been one of the strongest asset classes, recent\neconomic conditions have produced higher delinquencies in this portfolio during the early stages of the pandemic, but have\nsince normalized or leveled off. While management believes that Carver Federal will remain a leading lender to churches in its\nmarket area, Carver Federal will continue to conduct disciplined underwriting and maintain focused portfolio management.\nBusiness Loans. Carver Federal's small business (Commercial and Industrial, or \"C&I\") lending portfolio increased\n$22.5 million to $170.5 million, comprising 29.6% of the Bank's gross loan portfolio in fiscal 2022. This includes\n$17.9 million of PPP loans at March 31, 2022. The Bank purchased $5.6 million and $10.7 million business loans during fiscal\nyears 2022 and 2021, respectively. In a strategic attempt to diversify the Bank's loan portfolio, Carver Federal demonstrated an\nemphasis on C&I lending, placing particular focus on organic loan growth through the financing of local entrepreneurs\nbeginning in fiscal year 2018. Carver Federal provides revolving credit, working capital and term loan facilities to small\nbusinesses with annual sales of approximately $1 million to $25 million in educational, health care, personal services, light\nindustrial and wholesale segments. Business loans are typically personally guaranteed by the owners and may also be secured\nby additional collateral, including real estate, equipment, accounts receivable and inventory.\nConsumer and Other Loans. At March 31, 2022, the Bank had $1.6 million in consumer and other loans, or 0.3%, of\nthe Bank's gross loan portfolio, primarily comprised of $1.5 million of guaranteed graduate medical student loans purchased in\nfiscal 2017.\n8\nConsumer loans are not typically secured by collateral and therefore involve more risk than first mortgage loans and\nall other transactions. Collection of a delinquent loan is dependent on the borrower's continuing financial stability and is more\nlikely to be adversely affected by changes in employment, marital status, health and other personal financial factors. Further,\nthe application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the\namount that can be recovered. These loans may also give rise to claims and defenses by a borrower against Carver Federal,\nincluding claims and defenses that the borrower has against the seller of the underlying collateral, if applicable. In underwriting\nunsecured consumer loans other than secured credit cards, Carver Federal considers the borrower's credit history, an analysis of\nthe borrower's income, expenses and ability to repay the loan. The underwriting for secured credit cards only takes into\nconsideration the value of the underlying collateral. See “Asset Quality-Non-performing Assets.”\nLoan Processing. Carver Federal's loan originations are derived from a number of sources, including referrals by\nrealtors, builders, depositors, borrowers and mortgage brokers, as well as walk-in and telephone customers. Loans are\noriginated by the Bank's personnel who receive a base salary, commissions and other incentive compensation. Real estate,\nbusiness and unsecured loan applications are forwarded to the Bank's Lending Department for processing, and to the Credit\nGroup for underwriting pursuant to standards established in Carver Federal's Loan Policy. The underwriting and loan\nprocessing for residential one-to-four family loans are performed by an outsourced third party loan originator using lending\nstandards established by the Bank.\nA commercial real estate loan application is completed for all multifamily and non-residential properties that the Bank\nfinances. Prior to loan approval, the property is inspected by a loan officer. As part of the loan approval process, consideration\nis given to an independent appraisal, location, accessibility, stability of the neighborhood, environmental assessment, personal\ncredit history and the financial capacity of the applicant(s). Business loan applications are completed for all business loans.\nMost business loans are secured by real estate, personal guarantees, and/or guarantees by the United States Small Business\nAdministration (“SBA”), as applicable, along with Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”) lien filings. The loan approval process\nconsiders the credit history of the applicant, collateral, cash flow and purpose and stability of the business.\nUpon receipt of a completed loan application from a prospective borrower, a credit report and other verifications are\nordered to confirm specific information relating to the loan applicant's income and credit standing. It is the Bank's policy to\nobtain an appraisal of the real estate intended to secure a proposed mortgage loan from an independent appraiser approved by\nthe Bank, along with applicable appraisal reviews.\nIt is Carver Federal's policy to record a lien on the real estate securing the loan and to obtain a title insurance policy\nthat insures that the property is free of prior encumbrances. Borrowers must also obtain hazard insurance policies prior to\nclosing and, when the property is in a flood zone or plain as designated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development,\nobtain flood insurance. Most borrowers are also required to advance funds on a monthly basis, together with each payment of\nprincipal and interest, for mortgage payment escrows from which the Bank makes disbursements for items such as real estate\ntaxes and hazard insurance. Written confirmation of the guarantee for SBA loans and evidence of the UCC filing is also\nrequired, as applicable.\nLoan Approval. Except for real estate and business loans in excess of $6.0 million, mortgage and business loan\napproval authority has been delegated by the Bank's Board of Directors to the Board's Asset Liability and Interest Rate Risk\nCommittee. The Asset Liability and Interest Rate Risk Committee has delegated to the Bank's Management Loan Committee,\nwhich consists of certain members of executive management, loan approval authority up to and including $1.0 million for real\nestate and business loans. Real estate and business loans above $6.0 million must be approved by the full Board. Purchased\nloans are subject to the same approval process as originated loans. One-to-four family mortgage loans that conform to FNMA,\nFederal Housing Administration and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\"FHLMC\") standards and limits may be\napproved by the outsourced third party loan originator.\nLoans-to-One-Borrower. Under the loans-to-one-borrower limits of the OCC, with certain limited exceptions, loans\nand extensions of credit to a single or related group of borrowers outstanding at one time generally may not exceed 15% of the\nunimpaired capital and surplus of a savings bank. The Bank includes all outstanding debt and any unfunded commitments\nunder contractually binding commitments for purposes of its legal limit calculation. See “Regulation and Supervision-Federal\nBanking Regulation-Loans-to-One-Borrower Limitations.” At March 31, 2022, the maximum loans-to-one-borrower under this\ntest was $12.2 million and the Bank had no relationships that exceeded this limit.\nLoan Originations and Purchases. Loan originations were $151.5 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $114.5 million\nin fiscal 2021. There were $50.1 million loan purchases during fiscal 2022 and $26.8 million purchases in fiscal 2021.\n9\nThe following table sets forth certain information with respect to Carver Federal's loan originations and advances,\npurchases and sales for the fiscal years ended March 31:\n2022 2021 2020\n$ in thousands Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent\nLoans Originated:\nOne-to-four family $ — — % $ 4,217 3.0 % $ — — %\nMultifamily 42,237 20.9 % 15,936 11.3 % 14,363 21.0 %\nCommercial real estate 79,403 39.4 % 48,334 34.2 % 13,892 20.4 %\nBusiness 29,391 14.6 % 45,643 32.3 % 4,803 7.0 %\nConsumer and others (1) 508 0.3 % 366 0.2 % 394 0.6 %\nTotal loans originated 151,539 75.1 % 114,496 81.0 % 33,452 49.0 %\nLoans purchased (2) 50,144 24.9 % 26,814 19.0 % 34,780 51.0 %\nTotal loans originated and purchased 201,683 100.0 % 141,310 100.0 % 68,232 100.0 %\nLoans sold/participated (3) (6,080) — (1,294)\nNet additions to loan portfolio $ 195,603 $ 141,310 $ 66,938\n(1) Comprised of personal loans.\n(2) Comprised of $11.3 million one-to-four family, $15.1 million multifamily, $18.2 million commercial real estate and $5.6 million\nbusiness loans.\n(3) Comprised of primarily multifamily and commercial real estate loans.\nLoans purchased by the Bank entail certain risks not necessarily associated with loans the Bank originates. The Bank's\npurchased loans are generally acquired without recourse to the seller, with certain exceptions related to the seller's compliance\nwith representations and warranties, and in accordance with the Bank's underwriting criteria for originations. In addition,\npurchased loans have a variety of terms, including maturities, interest rate caps and indices for adjustment of interest rates, that\nmay differ from those offered at that time by the Bank. The Bank initially seeks to purchase loans in its market area. However,\nthe Bank may purchase loans secured by property outside its market area to meet its financial objectives. The market areas in\nwhich the properties that secure the purchased loans are located may differ from Carver Federal's market area and may be\nsubject to economic and real estate market conditions that may significantly differ from those experienced in Carver Federal's\nmarket area. There can be no assurance that economic conditions in these out-of-state markets will not deteriorate in the future,\nresulting in increased loan delinquencies and loan losses among the loans secured by property in these areas.\nIn an effort to reduce risks, the Bank has sought to ensure that purchased loans satisfy the Bank's underwriting\nstandards and do not otherwise have a higher risk of collection or loss than loans originated by the Bank. A review of each loan\nis conducted prior to purchase, and the Bank also requires appropriate documentation and further seeks to reduce its risk by\nrequiring, in each buy/sell agreement, a series of warranties and representations as to the underwriting standards and the\nenforceability of the related legal documents. These warranties and representations remain in effect for the life of the loan.\nAny misrepresentation must be cured within 90 days of discovery or trigger certain repurchase provisions in the buy/sell\nagreement.\nLoan Maturity Schedule. The following table sets forth information at March 31, 2022 regarding the amount of loans\nmaturing in Carver Federal's portfolio, including scheduled repayments of principal, based on contractual terms to maturity.\nDemand loans, loans having no schedule of repayments and no stated maturity, and overdrafts are reported as due in one year or\nless. The table below does not include any estimate of prepayments, which significantly shorten the average life of all\nmortgage loans and may cause Carver Federal's actual repayment experience to differ significantly from that shown below:\nLoan Maturities\n$ in thousands <1 Yr. 1-5 Yrs. 5-15 Yrs 15+ Yrs.

Scheduled contractual principal repayments of\n10\nloans do not necessarily reflect the actual lives of such assets. The average life of long-term loans is substantially less than their\ncontractual terms due to prepayments. In addition, due-on-sale clauses in mortgage loans generally give Carver Federal the\nright to declare a conventional loan due and payable in the event, among other things, that a borrower sells the real property\nsubject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid. The average life of mortgage loans tends to increase when current mortgage\nloan market rates are higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and tends to decrease when current mortgage loan market\nrates are lower than rates on existing mortgage loans:\nDue After March 31, 2023\n$ in thousands Fixed Adjustable Total\nGross loans receivable:\nOne-to-four family $ 54,591 $ 14,706 $ 69,297\nMultifamily 47,990 100,672 148,662\nCommercial real estate 64,887 95,945 160,832\nBusiness 44,780 108,702 153,482\nConsumer 122 — 122\nTotal $ 212,370 $ 320,025 $ 532,395\nAsset Quality\nGeneral. One of the Bank's key operating objectives continues to be to maintain a high level of asset quality. Through\na variety of strategies, including, but not limited to, monitoring loan delinquencies and borrower workout arrangements, the\nBank has been proactive in addressing problem loans and non-performing assets.\nThe underlying credit quality of the Bank's loan portfolio is dependent primarily on each borrower's ability to continue\nto make required loan payments and, in the event a borrower is unable to continue to do so, the adequacy of the value of the\ncollateral securing the loan. For non-owner occupied non-residential real estate and multifamily real estate loans, the\nborrower's ability to pay typically is dependent on rental income, which can be impacted primarily by vacancies and general\nmarket conditions. For owner-occupied one-to-four family loans, a borrowers' ability to pay typically is dependent primarily on\nemployment and other sources of income. For owner occupied non-residential real estate, a borrower's ability to pay typically\nis dependent primarily on the success of the borrower's business. For all of the Bank's loans, a borrower's ability to pay is also\nimpacted by general economic and other factors, such as unanticipated expenditures or changes in the financial markets.\nCollateral values, particularly real estate values, are also impacted by a variety of factors, including general economic\nconditions, demographics, maintenance and collection or foreclosure delays. The COVID-19 pandemic has placed additional\nstrains on the economy. The Company has made provisions in its allowance for loans and lease reserves to mitigate any future\ncharge-offs that may be needed.\nNon-performing Assets. Non-performing assets consist of nonaccrual loans, loans held-for-sale, and property acquired\nin settlement of loans (OREO), including foreclosure. When a borrower fails to make a payment on a loan, the Bank and/or its\nloan servicers take prompt steps to have the delinquency cured and the loan restored to current status. This includes a series of\nactions such as phone calls, letters, customer visits and, if necessary, legal action. In the event the loan has a guarantee, the\nBank may seek to recover on the guarantee, including, where applicable, from the Small Business Administration (“SBA”).\nLoans that remain delinquent are reviewed for reserve provisions and charge-off. The Bank's collection efforts continue after\nthe loan is charged off, except when a determination is made that collection efforts have been exhausted or are not productive.\nThe Bank may from time to time agree to modify the contractual terms of a borrower's loan. In cases where such\nmodifications represent a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, the modification is considered a troubled\ndebt restructuring (“TDR”). Loans modified in a TDR are typically placed on nonaccrual status until the Bank determines that\nfuture collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured, which generally requires that the borrower demonstrate\nperformance according to the restructured terms for a period of at least six months. At March 31, 2022, loans classified as TDR\ntotaled $6.9 million, of which $5.2 million were classified as performing.\n11\nThe following table sets forth information with respect to Carver Federal's non-performing assets, which includes\nnonaccrual loans, loans held-for-sale, and property acquired in settlement of loans as of March 31:\n$ in thousands 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018\nLoans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis (1):\nGross loans receivable:\nOne-to-four family $ 4,892 $ 3,524 $ 3,582 $ 4,488 $ 4,561\nMultifamily 515 369 375 3,214 964\nCommercial real estate 4,601 918 — 476 502\nBusiness 1,448 2,290 2,797 2,051 635\nConsumer 25 90 22 65 —\nTotal nonaccrual loans 11,481 7,191 6,776 10,294 6,662\nOther non-performing assets (2)\nReal estate owned 60 60 120 404 1,145\nTotal other non-performing assets 60 60 120 404 1,145\nTotal non-performing assets (3) $ 11,541 $ 7,251 $ 6,896 $ 10,698 $ 7,807\nNonaccrual loans to total loans 1.98 % 1.49 % 1.58 % 2.40 % 1.39 %\nNon-performing loans to total loans 1.98 % 1.49 % 1.58 % 2.40 % 1.39 %\nNon-performing assets to total assets 1.57 % 1.07 % 1.19 % 1.90 % 1.13 %\n(1) Nonaccrual status denotes any loan where the delinquency exceeds 90 days past due, or in the opinion of management, the collection of\ncontractual interest and/or principal is doubtful. Payments received on a nonaccrual loan are either applied to the outstanding principal\nbalance or recorded as interest income, depending on assessment of the ability to collect on the loan.\n(2) Other non-performing assets generally represent loans that the Bank is in the process of selling and has designated held-for-sale or property\nacquired by the Bank in settlement of loans less costs to sell (i.e. through foreclosure, repossession or as an in-substance\nforeclosure). These assets are recorded at the lower of their cost or fair value.\n(3) Troubled debt restructured loans performing in accordance with their modified terms for less than six months and those not performing in\naccordance with their modified terms are considered nonaccrual and are included in the nonaccrual category in the table above. TDR loans\nincluded in the nonaccrual category above totaled $1.7 million at 2022, $1.8 million at 2021, $2.2 million at 2020, $3.2 million at 2019,\nand $1.9 million at 2018. TDR loans that have performed in accordance with their modified terms for a period of at least six months are\ngenerally considered performing loans and are not presented in the table above. Performing TDR loans were $5.2 million at 2022, $5.8\nmillion at 2021, $1.7 million at 2020, $2.2 million at 2019, and $3.8 million at 2018.\nAt March 31, 2022, total non-performing assets increased by $4.2 million, or 57.5%, to $11.5 million, compared to\n$7.3 million at March 31, 2021, as a result of a $4.3 million increase in nonaccrual loans, year over year. Nonaccrual loans at\nMarch 31, 2022 consisted of fifteen one-to-four family, one multifamily, two commercial real estate, eight small business and\nSBA loans, and five consumer loans. Management believes that there may be losses associated with certain delinquent loans in\nthe future, but also notes that the amount of losses may be reduced by the value of properties securing these delinquent loans\nand the Bank's loan loss reserves. Other non-performing assets at year-end 2022 includes real estate owned assets consisting of\none foreclosed residential property. At March 31, 2022, Carver had 8 loans secured by one-to-four family residential real estate\nproperties in the process of foreclosure with a total outstanding balance of $3.1 million.\nAlthough we believe that substantially all risk elements at March 31, 2022 have been disclosed, other factors,\nincluding economic conditions and the conditions related to COVID-19, may cause borrowers to be unable to comply with the\ncontractual repayment terms on certain real estate and commercial loans. For additional information about certain factors that\nmay affect the future performance of the Company's loan portfolio, please see \"Item 1A - Risk Factors\" and \"Forward Looking\nStatements.\"\nAsset Classification and Allowances for Losses. Federal regulations and the Bank's policies require the classification\nof assets on the basis of credit quality on a quarterly basis. An asset is classified as “substandard” if it is determined to be\ninadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the current value of the collateral pledged,\nif any. An asset is classified as “doubtful” if full collection is highly questionable or improbable. An asset is classified as\n“loss” if it is considered uncollectible, even if a partial recovery could be expected in the future. The regulations also provide\nfor a “special mention” designation, described as assets that do not currently expose a savings institution to a sufficient degree\nof risk to warrant substandard classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving management's\nclose attention. Assets classified as substandard or doubtful result in a higher level of allowances for loan losses recorded in\naccordance with ASC Subtopic 450-20 “Loss Contingencies.” If an asset or portion thereof is classified as a loss, a savings\ninstitution must charge off any amount exceeding the fair value of collateral pursuant to loan impairment guidance in ASC\n12\nSection 310-10-35. If a savings institution does not agree with an examiner's classification of an asset, it may appeal this\ndetermination to the OCC Regional Director.\nThe OCC, in conjunction with the other federal banking agencies, has adopted an interagency policy statement on the\nallowance for loan losses and lease losses (\"ALLL\"). The policy statement provides guidance for financial institutions on both\nthe responsibilities of management for the assessment and establishment of adequate allowances and guidance for banking\nagency examiners to use in determining the adequacy of general valuation guidelines. Generally, the policy statement\nrecommends that institutions have effective systems and controls to identify, monitor and address asset quality problems; that\nmanagement analyze all significant factors that affect the ability to collect the portfolio in a reasonable manner; and that\nmanagement establish acceptable allowance evaluation processes that meet the objectives set forth in the policy statement.\nManagement is responsible for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the periodic provisioning for\nestimated losses included in the consolidated financial statements. The evaluation process is undertaken on a quarterly basis,\nbut may increase in frequency should conditions arise that would require management's prompt attention, such as business\ncombinations and opportunities to dispose of non-performing and marginally performing loans by bulk sale or any development\nwhich may indicate an adverse trend. Although management believes that adequate specific and general loan loss allowances\nhave been established, actual losses are dependent upon future events and, as such, further additions to the level of specific and\ngeneral loan loss allowances may become necessary. For additional information regarding Carver Federal's ALLL policy, refer\nto Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”\nThe Board has designated the Management Credit Review Committee for management to perform a review on a\nquarterly basis of the Bank's asset quality, determine and properly identify and monitor credit risk in the loan portfolio and\ndetermine that the Bank's allowance for loan and lease losses is proper and appropriate and submit their report to the Board for\nreview. Carver Federal's methodology for establishing the allowance for loan losses takes into consideration probable losses\nthat have been identified in connection with specific loans as well as losses that have not been identified but can be expected to\noccur. Further, management reviews the ratio of allowances to total loans and recommends adjustments to the level of\nallowances accordingly. Although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with\nrespect to the allowances for losses, future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ from the economic\nconditions in the assumptions used in making the initial determinations, or if circumstances pertaining to individual loans\nchange, or new information pertaining to individual loans or the loan portfolio is identified. The Bank has a centralized loan\nservicing structure that relies upon outside servicers, each of which generates a monthly report of delinquent loans. The Asset\nLiability and Interest Rate Risk Committees of the Board establish policy relating to internal classification of loans and also\nprovide input to the Credit Review Committee in its review of classified assets. In originating loans, Carver Federal recognizes\nthat credit losses will occur and that the risk of loss will vary with, among other things, the type of loan being made, the\ncreditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan, general economic conditions and, in the case of a secured loan, the\nquality of the security for the loan.\nIt is management's policy to maintain a general allowance for loan losses based on, among other things, regular\nreviews of delinquencies and loan portfolio quality, character and size, the Bank's and the industry's historical and projected\nloss experience and current and forecasted economic conditions and certain qualitative factors. In addition, considerable\nuncertainty exists as to the future improvement or deterioration of the real estate market. See “Lending Activities-Loan\nPurchases and Originations.” Carver Federal increases its allowance for loan losses by charging provisions for possible losses\nagainst the Bank's income. General allowances are established by management on at least a quarterly basis based on an\nassessment of risk in the Bank's loans, taking into consideration the composition and quality of the portfolio, delinquency\ntrends, current charge-off and loss experience, the state of the real estate market and economic conditions generally. Specific\nallowances are provided for individual loans, or portions of loans, when ultimate collection is considered improbable by\nmanagement based on the current payment status of the loan and the fair value or net realizable value of the security for the\nloan. A loan is deemed impaired when it is probable the Bank will be unable to collect both principal and interest due\naccording to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Loans the Bank individually classifies as impaired include\nmultifamily mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans, construction loans and business loans which have been classified by\nthe Bank's credit review officer as substandard, doubtful or loss for which it is probable that principal and interest will not be\ncollected in accordance with the loan's contractual terms, and certain loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring. A charge\noff is recognized on collateral dependent loans when the fair value of the property that collateralizes the impaired loan, if any, is\nless than the recorded investment in the loan. A valuation allowance for cash flow dependent loans is established when based\nupon a discounted cash flow analysis, impairment is demonstrated.\nAt the date of foreclosure or other repossession, the Bank transfers the property to real estate acquired in settlement of\nloans, or other real estate owned (\"OREO\"), at fair value less estimated selling costs. Fair value is defined as the amount in\ncash or cash-equivalent value of other consideration that a real estate parcel would yield in a current sale between a willing\nbuyer and a willing seller. Any amount of cost in excess of fair value is charged off against the allowance for loan losses prior\n13\nto the transfer of the property into OREO. Carver Federal records an allowance for estimated selling costs of the property\nimmediately after foreclosure. Subsequent to taking possession of the property, management periodically evaluates the\nproperty and an allowance is established if the estimated fair value of the property, less estimated costs to sell, declines. If,\nupon ultimate disposition of the property, net sales proceeds exceed the net carrying value of the property, a gain on sale of real\nestate is recorded, providing the Bank did not provide financing for the sale.\nThe following table sets forth an analysis of Carver Federal's allowance for loan losses at and for the years ended\nMarch 31:\n$ in thousands 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018\nBalance at beginning of year $ 5,140 $ 4,946 $ 4,646 $ 5,126 $ 5,060\nLess Charge-offs:\nOne-to-four family — — (12) (151) (96)\nMultifamily — — — (164) (104)\nBusiness — (24) (69) (964) (81)\nConsumer and other (257) (54) (102) (19) (33)\nTotal Charge-offs $ (257) $ (78) $ (183) $ (1,298) $ (314)\nAdd Recoveries:\nOne-to-four family 13 88 302 190 —\nMultifamily — — — 158 131\nCommercial real estate — — — — 20\nBusiness 102 278 160 705 87\nConsumer and other 23 6 2 35 7\nTotal Recoveries $ 138 $ 372 $ 464 $ 1,088 $ 245\nNet loans charged off (119) 294 281 (210) (69)\nProvision for (recovery of) losses 603 (100) 19 (270) 135\nBalance at end of year $ 5,624 $ 5,140 $ 4,946 $ 4,646 $ 5,126\nRatios:\nNet (charge-off) recovery to average loans outstanding:\nOne-to-four family 0.02 % 0.10 % 0.26 % 0.03 % (0.07) %\nMultifamily — % — % — % (0.01) % 0.03 %\nCommercial real estate — % — % — % — % 0.01 %\nBusiness 0.06 % 0.23 % 0.10 % (0.26) % 0.01 %\nConsumer and other (11.55) % (1.62) % (2.68) % 0.34 % (0.33) %\nTotal loans (0.02) % 0.06 % 0.07 % (0.05) % (0.01) %\nAllowance to total loans 0.97 % 1.06 % 1.15 % 1.08 % 1.07 %\nAllowance to nonaccrual loans 48.99 % 71.48 % 72.99 % 45.13 % 76.94 %\nThe following table allocates the allowance for loan losses by asset category at March 31:\n2022 2021 2020 2019 2018\n% of % of % of % of % of\nTotal Total Total Total Total\n$ in thousands Amount ALLL Amount ALLL Amount ALLL Amount ALLL Amount ALLL\nOne-to-four family $ 731 13.0 % $ 1,058 20.6 % $ 1,055 21.3 % $ 1,274 27.4 % $ 1,210 23.6 %\nMultifamily 1,114 19.8 % 880 17.1 % 1,011 20.5 % 885 19.1 % 1,819 35.5 %\nCommercial real estate 1,157 20.6 % 907 17.6 % 812 16.4 % 766 16.5 % 1,052 20.5 %\nBusiness 2,497 44.4 % 1,855 36.1 % 1,567 31.7 % 1,330 28.6 % 1,003 19.5 %\nConsumer and other 123 2.2 % 165 3.2 % 212 4.3 % 154 3.3 % 18 0.4 %\nUnallocated 2 — % 275 5.4 % 289 5.8 % 237 5.1 % 24 0.5 %\nTotal Allowance $ 5,624 100.0 % $ 5,140 100.0 % $ 4,946 100.0 % $ 4,646 100.0 % $ 5,126 100.0 %\nThe allocation of the allowance to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the\nuse of the allowance to absorb losses in any category.\n14\nInvestment Activities\nGeneral. The Bank utilizes mortgage-backed and other investment securities in its asset/liability management\nstrategy. In making investment decisions, the Bank considers, among other things, its yield and interest rate objectives, its\ninterest rate and credit risk position and its liquidity and cash flow.\nGenerally, the investment policy of the Bank is to invest funds among categories of investments and maturities based\nupon the Bank's asset/liability management policies, investment quality, loan and deposit volume and collateral requirements,\nliquidity needs and performance objectives. Securities are classified into one of three categories: trading, held-to-maturity, and\navailable-for-sale. Securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified\nas trading securities and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings. Debt securities for\nwhich the Bank has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and reported at\namortized cost. All other securities not classified as trading or held-to-maturity are classified as available-for-sale and reported\nat fair value with unrealized gains and losses included, on an after-tax basis, in a separate component of stockholders'\nequity. At March 31, 2022, the Bank had no securities classified as trading. At March 31, 2022, $67.6 million, or 92.8% of the\nBank's mortgage-backed and other investment securities, were classified as available-for-sale. The remaining $5.3 million, or\n7.2%, were classified as held-to-maturity.\nThe following table sets forth the amortized cost, fair value and weighted average yields of the Bank's investment\nportfolio at March 31, 2022, categorized by remaining period to contractual maturity:\nDue < 1 Year Due 1 - 5 Years Due 5 - 10 Years Due after 10 Years\nWeighted Weighted Weighted Weighted\nAmortized Fair Average Amortized Fair Average Amortized Fair Average Amortized Fair Average\n$ in thousands Cost Value Yield Cost Value Yield Cost Value Yield Cost Value Yield\nAvailable-for-Sale:\nMortgage-backed securities:\nGovernment\nNational\nMortgage\nAssociation $ — $ — — % $ — $ — — % $ — $ — — % $ 439 $ 448 2.93 %\nFederal Home\nLoan Mortgage\nCorporation — — — % — — — % — — — % 23,744 21,547 1.33 %\nFederal\nNational\nMortgage\nAssociation — — — % — — — % — — — % 12,852 11,584 1.36 %\nTotal\nmortgage-\nbacked\nsecurities — — — % — — — % — — — % 37,035 33,579 1.36 %\nU.S. Government\nAgency Securities — — — % — — — % 4,243 4,203 1.46 % 9,621 9,582 1.27 %\nCorporate Bonds — — — % — — — % — — — % 5,271 4,121 2.61 %\nMuni securities — — — % — — 2,686 2,620 2.67 % 15,055 13,148 5.74 %\nAsset-backed\nsecurities 347 343 1.06 % — — — % — — — % — — — %\nTotal\navailable-for-\nsale $ 347 $ 343 1.06 % $ — $ — — % $ 6,929 $ 6,823 1.92 % $ 66,982 $ 60,430 2.39 %\nHeld-to-Maturity:\nMortgage-backed securities:\nGovernment\nNational\nMortgage\nAssociation — — — % $ 139 $ 143 3.48 % $ — $ — — % $ 342 $ 365 4.17 %\nFederal\nNational\nMortgage\nAssociation 2,498 2,507 2.37 % — — — % 2,219 2,205 2.50 % 56 56 — %\nTotal held-to-\nmaturity $ 2,498 $ 2,507 2.37 % $ 139 $ 143 3.48 % $ 2,219 $ 2,205 2.50 % $ 398 $ 421 3.58 %\nMortgage-Backed Securities. The Bank has invested in mortgage-backed securities to help achieve its asset/liability\nmanagement goals and collateral needs. Although mortgage-backed securities generally yield less than whole loans, they\npresent substantially lower credit risk, are more liquid than individual mortgage loans and may be used to collateralize\n15\nobligations of the Bank. Because Carver Federal receives regular payments of principal and interest from its mortgage-backed\nsecurities, these investments provide more consistent cash flows than investments in other debt securities, which generally only\npay principal at maturity. Mortgage-backed securities also help the Bank meet certain definitional tests for favorable treatment\nunder federal banking and tax laws. See “Regulation and Supervision-Federal Banking Regulation-Qualified Thrift\nLender Test” and “Federal and State Taxation.”\nMortgage-backed securities constituted 5.3% of total assets at March 31, 2022, compared to 7.6% at March 31, 2021.\nCarver Federal maintains a portfolio of mortgage-backed securities in the form of Government National Mortgage Association\n(“GNMA”) pass-through certificates, FNMA mortgage-backed securities and FHLMC mortgage-backed securities. GNMA\npass-through certificates are guaranteed as to the payment of principal and interest by the full faith and credit of the United\nStates Government, while FNMA and FHLMC securities are each guaranteed by their respective agencies as to principal and\ninterest. Mortgage-backed securities generally entitle Carver Federal to receive a pro-rata portion of the cash flows from an\nidentified pool of mortgages. The cash flows from such pools are segmented and paid in accordance with a predetermined\npriority to various classes of securities issued by the entity. Carver Federal has also invested in pools of loans guaranteed as to\nprincipal and interest by the SBA.\nThe Bank seeks to manage interest rate risk by investing in adjustable-rate mortgage-backed securities, which at\nMarch 31, 2022, constituted $680 thousand, or 1.8%, of the mortgage-backed securities portfolio. Mortgage-backed securities,\nhowever, expose Carver Federal to certain unique risks. In a declining rate environment, accelerated prepayments of loans\nunderlying these securities expose Carver Federal to the risk that it will be unable to obtain comparable yields upon\nreinvestment of the proceeds. In the event the mortgage-backed security has been funded with an interest-bearing liability with\nmaturity comparable to the original estimated life of the mortgage-backed security, the Bank's interest rate spread could be\nadversely affected. Conversely, in a rising interest rate environment, the Bank may experience a lower than estimated rate of\nrepayment on the underlying mortgages, effectively extending the estimated life of the mortgage-backed security and exposing\nthe Bank to the risk that it may be required to fund the asset with a liability bearing a higher rate of interest. For additional\ninformation regarding Carver Federal's mortgage-backed securities portfolio and its maturities refer to Note 3 of Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements, “Investment Securities.”\nOther Investment Securities. In addition to mortgage-backed securities, the Bank also invests in assets such as\ngovernment and agency obligations, corporate bonds and mutual funds. Carver Federal is permitted under federal law to make\ncertain investments, including investments in securities issued by various federal agencies and state and municipal\ngovernments, deposits at the FHLB-NY, certificates of deposit in federally insured institutions, certain bankers' acceptances and\nfederal funds. The Bank may also invest, subject to certain limitations, in commercial paper having one of the two highest\ninvestment ratings of a nationally recognized credit rating agency, and certain other types of corporate debt securities and\nmutual funds (See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nOther Earning Assets. Federal regulations require the Bank to maintain an investment in FHLB-NY stock and a\nsufficient amount of liquid assets which may be invested in cash and specified securities. For additional information, see\n“Regulation and Supervision-Federal Banking Regulation-Liquidity.”\nSecurities Impairment. The Bank’s available-for-sale securities portfolio is carried at estimated fair value, with any\nunrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Securities that the Bank\nhas the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and are carried at amortized cost. The fair values\nof securities in the Bank's portfolio are based on published or securities dealers’ market values and are affected by changes in\ninterest rates. On a quarterly basis, the Bank reviews and evaluates the securities portfolio to determine if the decline in the fair\nvalue of any security below its cost basis is other-than-temporary. The Bank generally views changes in fair value caused by\nchanges in interest rates as temporary, which is consistent with its experience. Following FASB guidance, the amount of an\nother-than-temporary impairment when there are credit and non-credit losses on a debt security which management does not\nintend to sell, and for which it is more likely than not that the Bank will not be required to sell the security prior to the recovery\nof the non-credit impairment, the portion of the total impairment that is attributable to the credit loss would be recognized in\nearnings. The remaining difference between the debt security’s amortized cost basis and its fair value would be included in\nother comprehensive income (loss). This guidance also requires additional disclosures about investments in an unrealized loss\nposition and the methodology and significant inputs used in determining the recognition of other-than-temporary impairment.\nThe Bank does not have any securities that are classified as having other-than-temporary impairment in its investment portfolio\nat March 31, 2022.\n16\nSources of Funds\nGeneral. Deposits are the primary source of Carver Federal's funds for lending and other investment purposes. In\naddition to deposits, Carver Federal derives funds from loan principal repayments, loan and investment interest payments,\nmaturing investments and fee income. Loan and mortgage-backed securities repayments and interest payments are a relatively\nstable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows are significantly influenced by prevailing market interest rates,\npricing of deposits, competition and general economic conditions. Borrowed money may be used to supplement the Bank's\navailable funds, and from time to time the Bank borrows funds from the FHLB-NY and has borrowed funds through trust\npreferred debt securities.\nDeposits. Carver Federal attracts deposits from consumers, businesses, non-profit organizations and public entities\nthrough its seven branches principally from within its market area by offering a variety of deposit instruments, including\npassbook and statement accounts and certificates of deposit, which range in term from 6 months to five years. Deposit terms\nvary, principally on the basis of the minimum balance required, the length of time the funds must remain on deposit and the\ninterest rate. Carver Federal also offers Individual Retirement Accounts. Carver Federal's policies are designed primarily to\nattract deposits from local residents and businesses through the Bank's branches. In fiscal year 2021 the Bank launched a\nprogram introducing new products and expanded its digital online account openings into nine states across the Northeast and in\nWashington D.C. Carver Federal also holds deposits from various governmental agencies or authorities and corporations.\nCarver Federal utilizes brokered deposits as an additional funding source and to assist in the management of the Bank's\ninterest rate risk. Carver Federal has obtained brokered certificates of deposit when the interest rate on these deposits is below\nthe prevailing interest rate for non-brokered certificates of deposit with similar maturities in our market, or when obtaining them\nallowed us to extend the maturities of our deposits at favorable rates compared to borrowing funds with similar maturities, or\nwhen we are seeking to extend the maturities of our funding to assist in the management of our interest rate risk. Carver has\nobtained brokered deposits from a variety of brokerage firms. In addition, Carver has obtained brokered deposits through the\nDepository Trust Company. This allows us to better manage the maturity of our deposits and our interest rate risk. Carver\nFederal has also utilized brokers to obtain money market account deposits. The rate we pay on brokered money market accounts\nis the same or below the rate we pay on non-brokered money market accounts. These accounts are similar to brokered\ncertificates of deposit accounts in that we only maintain one account for the total deposit per broker, with the broker\nmaintaining the detailed records of each depositor. As of March 31, 2022, Carver had a total of $64.2 million in brokered\ndeposits, compared to $73.4 million as of March 31, 2021.\nAs of March 31, 2022, the Bank has $46.4 million of reciprocal deposits acquired through its participation in the\nCertificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (“CDARS”). The Bank's CDARS deposits totaled $43.2 million as of\nMarch 31, 2021. The CDARS network arranges for placement of Carver Federal's customer funds into certificate of deposit\naccounts issued by other CDARS member banks. The certificate of deposit accounts are in increments of less than the\nindividual FDIC insurance limit amount, to ensure that both principal and interest are eligible for full FDIC deposit insurance.\nThis allows the Bank to maintain its customer relationship while still providing its customers with FDIC insurance for the full\namount of their deposits, up to $50 million per customer. In exchange, Carver Federal receives from other member banks their\ncustomers' deposits in like amounts. Depositors are allowed to withdraw funds early, with a penalty, from these accounts.\nCarver Federal may elect to participate in the program by making or receiving deposits without making or receiving a reciprocal\ndeposit. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, the standard maximum deposit insurance amount is $250,000.\nDeposit interest rates, maturities, service fees and withdrawal penalties on deposits are established based on the Bank's\nfunds acquisition and liquidity requirements, the rates paid by the Bank's competitors, current market rates, the Bank's growth\ngoals and applicable regulatory restrictions and requirements. For additional information regarding the Bank's deposit accounts\nand the related weighted average interest rates paid, and amount and maturities of certificates of deposit in specified weighted\naverage interest rate categories, refer to Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, “Deposits.”\nBorrowed Funds. While deposits are the primary source of funds for Carver Federal's lending, investment and general\noperating activities, Carver Federal is authorized to use advances from the FHLB-NY and securities sold under agreements to\nrepurchase (“Repos”) from approved primary dealers to supplement its supply of funds and to meet deposit withdrawal\nrequirements. The FHLB-NY functions as a central bank providing credit for savings institutions and certain other member\nfinancial institutions. As a member of the FHLB system, Carver Federal is required to own stock in the FHLB-NY and is\nauthorized to apply for advances. Advances are made pursuant to several different programs, each of which has its own interest\nrate and range of maturities. Advances from the FHLB-NY are secured by Carver Federal's stock in the FHLB-NY and a\npledge of Carver Federal's mortgage loan and mortgage-backed and agency securities portfolios. The Bank takes into\nconsideration the term of borrowed money with the repricing cycle of the mortgage loans on the balance sheet.\n17\nOn September 17, 2003, Carver Statutory Trust I issued 13,000 shares, liquidation amount $1,000 per share, of\nfloating rate capital securities. Gross proceeds from the sale of these trust preferred debt securities of $13 million, and proceeds\nfrom the sale of the trust's common securities of $0.4 million, were used to purchase approximately $13.4 million aggregate\nprincipal amount of the Company's floating rate junior subordinated debt securities due 2033. The trust preferred debt\nsecurities are redeemable at par quarterly at the option of the Company and have a mandatory redemption date of September 17,\n2033. Cash distributions on the trust preferred debt securities are cumulative and payable at a floating rate per annum resetting\nquarterly with a margin of 3.05% over the three-month LIBOR. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, the Company\napplied for and was granted regulatory approval to settle all outstanding debenture interest payments through September 2016.\nSuch payments were made in September 2016. Interest on the debentures had been deferred beginning with the December 2016\npayment, per the terms of the agreement, which permit such deferral for up to twenty consecutive quarters, as the Company is\nprohibited from making payments without prior regulatory approval. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, the\nCompany applied for and was granted regulatory approval to settle all outstanding debenture interest payments through June\n2021. Full payment on the outstanding debenture interest was made on June 16, 2021. The Company deferred the September\n17, 2021 interest payment, but has since had discussions with the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia regarding future\nquarterly payments. A streamlined process has been developed for the Company to request regulatory approval to make\ndebenture interest payments. On December 16, 2021, the Company paid the interest deferred from September 17, 2021 and the\nregular quarterly interest payment due on December 17, 2021. Subsequently, the Company made the regular quarterly interest\npayments on its outstanding debentures due on March 17, 2022. The interest rate was 4.0% at March 31, 2022 and June 17,\n2022.\nCarver relies primarily on dividends from Carver Federal to pay cash dividends to its stockholders and to engage in\nshare repurchase programs. The OCC regulates all capital distributions, including dividend payments, by Carver Federal to the\nCompany, and the FRB regulates dividends paid by the Company. As the subsidiary of a savings and loan association holding\ncompany, Carver Federal must file a notice or an application (depending on the proposed dividend amount) with the OCC (and\na notice with the FRB) prior to the declaration of each capital distribution. The OCC will disallow any proposed dividend, for\namong other reasons, that would result in Carver Federal’s failure to meet the OCC minimum capital requirements. In\naccordance with the Formal Agreement defined directly below, Carver Federal is currently prohibited from paying any\ndividends without prior OCC approval, and, as such, has suspended its regular quarterly cash dividend to the Company. There\nare no assurances that dividend payments to Carver will resume.\nREGULATION AND SUPERVISION\nEnforcement Actions\nOn May 24, 2016, the Bank entered into a formal agreement (the \"Formal Agreement\") with the OCC to undertake\ncertain compliance-related and other actions as further described in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K as filed with\nthe SEC on May 27, 2016. As a result of the Formal Agreement, the Bank must obtain the approval of the OCC prior to\neffecting any change in its directors or senior executive officers. The Bank may not declare or pay dividends or make any other\ncapital distributions, including to the Company, without first filing an application with the OCC and receiving the prior\napproval of the OCC. Furthermore, the Bank must seek the OCC's written approval and the FDIC's written concurrence before\nentering into any \"golden parachute payments\" as that term is defined under 12 U.S.C. § 1828(k) and 12 C.F.R. Part 359.\nAs a result of the Formal Agreement, the OCC established higher minimum capital requirements for the Bank. For\nfurther information with respect to the Individual Minimum Capital Ratios (“IMCR”), effective June 29, 2016, refer to “Capital\nand Liquidity - Carver Federal’s Capital Position.”\nThe Company is subject to similar requirements as the Bank. The Company must provide notice to the FRB prior to\naffecting any change in its directors or senior executive officers. The Company is also subject to the restrictions on golden\nparachute and indemnification payments, as set forth in 12 C.F.R. Part 359. Written approval of the Federal Reserve Bank is\nrequired prior to: (1) the declaration or payment of dividends by the Company to its stockholders, (2) the declaration or\npayment of dividends by the Bank to the Company, (3) any distributions of interest or principal by the Company on\nsubordinated debentures or trust preferred securities, (4) any purchases or redemptions of the Company’s stock and (5) the\nCompany incurring, increasing or guaranteeing certain long-term debt outside the ordinary course of business. These\nlimitations could affect our operations and financial performance.\nGeneral\nThe Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by its primary regulator, the OCC. The\nBank's deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC under the Deposit Insurance Fund. The Bank is a\nmember of the FHLB-NY. The Bank must file reports with the OCC concerning its activities and financial condition, and it\n18\nmust obtain regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions, such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other\ndepository institutions. The Company, as a unitary savings and loan holding company, is subject to regulation, examination and\nsupervision by the FRB and is required to file certain reports with, and otherwise comply with, the rules and regulations of the\nFRB and of the SEC under the federal securities laws. The OCC periodically performs safety and soundness examinations of\nthe Bank and tests compliance with various regulatory requirements. The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over\nfederally chartered savings banks and has substantial discretion to impose enforcement action on an institution that fails to\ncomply with applicable regulatory requirements, particularly with respect to its capital requirements. In addition, the FDIC has\nthe authority to recommend to the Director of the OCC that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular federally\nchartered savings bank and, if action is not taken by the Director, the FDIC has authority to take such action under certain\ncircumstances.\nThe description of statutory provisions and regulations applicable to federally chartered savings banks and their holding\ncompanies and of tax matters set forth in this document does not purport to be a complete description of all such statutes and\nregulations and their effects on the Bank and the Company. Any change in such laws and regulations whether by the OCC, the\nFDIC, the FRB or through legislation could have a material adverse impact on the Bank and the Company and their operations\nand stockholders.\nCapital and Liquidity\nPrompt Corrective Action Regulations. Under the prompt corrective action regulations, the OCC is authorized and, in\nsome cases, required to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings banks. For this purpose, a savings bank\nwould be placed in one of the following five categories based on the bank's regulatory capital: well-capitalized, adequately\ncapitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized.\nThe severity of the action authorized or required to be taken under the prompt corrective action regulations increases\nas a bank's capital decreases within the three undercapitalized categories. All banks are prohibited from paying dividends or\nother capital distributions or paying management fees to any controlling person if, following such distribution, the bank would\nbe undercapitalized. Generally, a capital restoration plan must be filed with the OCC within 45 days of the date a bank receives\nnotice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” In addition, various\nmandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to the institution, including restrictions on growth of assets and\nother forms of expansion.\nUnder OCC regulations, a federally chartered savings bank is treated as well-capitalized if its total risk-based capital\nratio is 10% or greater, its Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is 8% or greater, its common equity Tier 1 capital ratio is 6.5% or\ngreater, and its leverage ratio is 5% or greater, and it is not subject to any order or directive by the OCC to meet a specific\ncapital level. In assessing an institution's capital adequacy, the OCC takes into consideration not only these numeric factors but\nalso qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions as they\ndeem necessary.\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act, or FDICIA, required that the OCC and other federal\nbanking agencies revise their risk-based capital standards to ensure that the standards take into account interest rate risk (\"IRR\")\nconcentration of risk and the risks of non-traditional activities. The OCC monitors the IRR of individual institutions through a\nvariety of means, including an analysis of the change in net portfolio value (\"NPV\"). NPV is defined as the net present value of\nthe expected future cash flows of an entity's assets and liabilities and, therefore, hypothetically represents the value of an\ninstitution's net worth. The OCC has also used this NPV analysis as part of its evaluation of certain applications or notices\nsubmitted by thrift institutions. In addition, OCC Bulletin 2010-1 provides guidance on the management of IRR and the\nresponsibility of boards of directors in that area. The OCC, through its general oversight of the safety and soundness of savings\nassociations, retains the right to impose minimum capital requirements on individual institutions to the extent the institution is\nnot in compliance with certain written guidelines established by the OCC regarding NPV analysis.\nCarver Federal's Capital Position. Federal regulations require depository institutions to meet several minimum capital\nstandards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a\ntotal capital to risk-based assets ratio of 8%, and a Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio of 4%. Federal savings banks\nmust also meet a tangible capital ratio of 1.5%.\nFor purposes of the regulatory capital requirements, a higher risk weight (150%) is assigned to exposures that are more\nthan 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and to certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition,\ndevelopment or construction of real property. Unrealized gains and losses on certain “available-for-sale” securities holdings are\nrequired to be included for purposes of calculating regulatory capital unless a one-time opt-out is exercised. Carver Federal has\n19\nchosen to opt-out and, therefore, does not include accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) in its regulatory capital\ndeterminations. Additional constraints are also imposed on the inclusion in regulatory capital of certain mortgage-servicing\nassets, deferred tax assets and minority interests. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and\nadjustments specified in the regulations. In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the OCC takes into consideration, not\nonly these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for\nindividual institutions when deemed necessary.\nIn addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit a banking organization’s\ncapital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a “capital conservation\nbuffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1capital to risk-weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet\nits minimum risk-based capital requirements.\nLegislation enacted in May 2018 required the federal banking agencies, including the OCC, to establish for qualifying\ninstitutions with assets of less than $10 billion a “community bank leverage ratio” that ranges between 8 to 10% of consolidated\nassets. Institutions with capital complying with the ratio and otherwise meeting the specified requirements (including off-\nbalance sheet exposures of 25% or less of total assets and trading assets and liabilities of 5% or less of total assets) and electing\nthe alternative framework are considered to comply with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, including the risk-\nbased requirements. Such institutions are also considered \"well-capitalized\" for prompt corrective action purposes.\nThe community bank leverage ratio was established at 9% Tier 1 capital to total average assets, effective January 1,\n2020. Pursuant to federal legislation enacted in 2020, the community bank leverage ratio was temporarily lowered to 8% for\n2020. Another rule was issued to increase the ratio to 8.5% for calendar year 2021 and to 9% thereafter. A qualifying bank\nmay opt in and out of the community bank leverage ratio framework on its quarterly call report. A bank that ceases to meet any\nqualifying criteria is provided with a two-quarter grace period to comply with the community bank leverage ratio requirements\nor the general capital regulations by the federal regulators. As of March 31, 2022, the Bank has not opted into the alternative\nframework.\nCarver Federal, as a matter of prudent management, targets as its goal the maintenance of capital ratios which exceed\nminimum requirements and are consistent with Carver Federal’s risk profile. The IMCR established by the OCC on June 29,\n2016, as a result of the previously described Formal Agreement, requires the Bank to maintain minimum regulatory capital\nlevels of 9% for its Tier 1 leverage ratio and 12% for its total risk-based capital ratio. At March 31, 2022, Carver Federal\nexceeded the capital regulatory requirements and its IMCR requirements with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 13.75%, Tier 1\nleverage ratio of 10.45%, total risk-based capital ratio of 14.78% and a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 13.75%.\nLimitation on Capital Distributions. There are various restrictions on a bank's ability to make capital distributions,\nincluding cash dividends, payments to repurchase or otherwise acquire its shares and other distributions charged against capital.\nA savings institution that is the subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, such as the Bank, must file a notice with the\nFRB at least 30 days before making a capital distribution and receive the FRB's nonobjection. The Bank must also file an\napplication or notice for prior approval with the OCC if the total amount of its capital distributions (including each proposed\ndistribution), for the applicable calendar year would exceed the Bank's net income for that year plus the Bank's retained net\nincome for the previous two years, if the Bank is not an \"eligible savings association\" as defined in OCC regulations or the\ncapital distributions would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation or agreement.\nThe Bank may be prohibited from making capital distributions and its application or notice disapproved if:\n(1) the Bank would be undercapitalized following the distribution;\n(2) the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or\n(3) the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation or agreement.\nLiquidity. The Bank maintains a liquidity policy to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure its safe and sound\noperations. In the normal course of business, the levels of liquid assets during any given period are dependent on operating,\ninvesting and financing activities. Cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and repurchase agreements with maturities of\nthree months or less are the Bank's most liquid assets. Management believes Carver Federal’s short-term assets have sufficient\nliquidity to cover loan demand, potential fluctuations in deposit accounts and to meet other anticipated cash requirements,\nincluding interest payments on our subordinated debt securities.\n20\nStandards for Safety and Soundness\nStandards for Safety and Soundness. The OCC has adopted guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards.\nThe guidelines establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan\ndocumentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, compensation, fees and\nbenefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the\nrisks and exposures specified in the guidelines. OCC regulations authorize the OCC to order an institution that has been given\nnotice that it is not satisfying these safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so notified, an\ninstitution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan, or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted compliance\nplan, the OCC must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of\nthe types to which an undercapitalized association is subject under the “prompt corrective action” provisions of federal law. If\nan institution fails to comply with such an order, the OCC may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose\ncivil money penalties.\nEnforcement. The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over the Bank. This enforcement authority includes,\namong other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist orders and to remove directors and\nofficers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or\nunsound practices.\nTARP\nThe Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (“EESA”) was signed into law on October 3, 2008 and authorized\nthe U.S. Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”) to establish the Troubled Asset Relief Program (“TARP”) to purchase certain\ntroubled assets from financial institutions, including banks and thrifts.\nOn October 14, 2008, the Treasury announced that it would purchase equity stakes in a wide variety of banks and\nthrifts. Under this program, known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program Capital Purchase Program (the \"TARP CPP\"), the\nTreasury made $250 billion of capital available (from the $700 billion authorized by the EESA) to U.S. financial institutions in\nthe form of preferred stock. On January 20, 2009, the Company announced that it completed the sale of $18.98 million in\npreferred stock to the Treasury in connection with Carver's participation in the TARP CPP.\nThe Treasury announced in February 2010 the implementation of the Community Development Capital Initiative\n(“CDCI”). This new capital program invested lower cost capital in CDFIs that lend to small businesses in the country's most\neconomically depressed communities. On August 27, 2010, Carver completed with the Treasury the exchange of the $18.98\nmillion of TARP preferred stock for an equivalent amount of CDCI Series B preferred stock. On October 28, 2011, the U.S.\nTreasury exchanged the CDCI Series B preferred stock for 2,321,286 shares of Company common stock.\nOn August 6, 2020, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with the Treasury to repurchase the\n2,321,286 shares of Company common stock held by the Treasury. As a result, the Company is no longer a participant in the\nCDCI program and is not bound by any TARP restrictions as the Treasury is no longer a common stockholder of the Company.\nFor more information concerning the Bank's repurchase of treasury shares, see Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nOther Supervision and Regulation\nActivity Powers. The Bank derives its lending and investment powers from the Home Owners' Loan Act (“HOLA”),\nas amended, and federal regulations. Under these laws and regulations, the Bank may invest in mortgage loans secured by\nresidential and commercial real estate, commercial and consumer loans, certain types of debt securities and certain other\nassets. The Bank may also establish service corporations that may engage in certain activities not otherwise permissible for the\nBank, including certain real estate equity investments and securities and insurance brokerage. The Bank's authority to invest in\ncertain types of loans or other investments is limited by federal law. These investment powers are subject to various\nlimitations, including (1) a prohibition against the acquisition of any corporate debt security that is not rated in one of the four\nhighest rating categories, (2) a limit of 400% of an association's capital on the aggregate amount of loans secured by non-\nresidential real estate property, (3) a limit of 20% of an association's assets on commercial loans, with the amount of\ncommercial loans in excess of 10% of assets being limited to small business loans, (4) a limit of 35% of an association's assets\non the aggregate amount of consumer loans and acquisitions of certain debt securities, (5) a limit of 5% of assets on non-\nconforming loans (certain loans in excess of the specific limitations of HOLA), and (6) a limit of the greater of 5% of assets or\n21\nan association's capital on certain construction loans made for the purpose of financing what is or is expected to become\nresidential property.\nLoans-to-One Borrower Limitations. The Bank is generally subject to the same limits on loans-to-one borrower as a\nnational bank. With specified exceptions, the Bank's total loans or extension of credit to a single borrower or group of related\nborrowers may not exceed 15% of the Bank's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus, which does not include accumulated\nother comprehensive income. The Bank currently complies with applicable loans-to-one borrower limitations. At March 31,\n2022, the Bank's limit on loans-to-one borrower based on its unimpaired capital and surplus was $12.2 million.\nQualified Thrift Lender Test. Under HOLA, the Bank must comply with a Qualified Thrift Lender (“QTL”)\ntest. Under this test, the Bank is required to maintain at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” in certain “qualified thrift\ninvestments” on a monthly basis in at least nine months of the most recent twelve-month period. “Portfolio assets” means, in\ngeneral, an association's total assets less the sum of (a) specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets, (b) goodwill and other\nintangible assets and (c) the value of property used to conduct the Bank's business. “Qualified thrift investments” include\nvarious types of loans made for residential and housing purposes, investments related to such purposes, including certain\nmortgage-backed and related securities and consumer loans. If the Bank fails the QTL test, it must operate under certain\nrestrictions on its activities. The Dodd-Frank Act made noncompliance potentially subject to agency enforcement action for\nviolation of law. At March 31, 2022, the Bank maintained approximately 98% of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift\ninvestments. The Bank had also met the QTL test in each of the prior 12 months and was, therefore, a qualified thrift lender.\nBranching. Subject to certain limitations, federal law permits the Bank to establish branches in any state of the United\nStates. The authority for the Bank to establish an interstate branch network would facilitate a geographic diversification of the\nBank's activities. This authority under federal law and regulations preempts any state law purporting to regulate branching by\nfederal savings associations.\nCommunity Reinvestment. Under the CRA, as amended, as implemented by OCC regulations, the Bank has a\ncontinuing and affirmative obligation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income\nneighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for the Bank nor does it limit the\nBank's discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community. The\nCRA does, however, require the OCC, in connection with its examination of the Bank, to assess the Bank's record of meeting\nthe credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by the Bank.\nIn particular, the system focuses on three tests:\n(1) a lending test, to evaluate the institution's record of making loans in its assessment areas;\n(2) an investment test, to evaluate the institution's record of investing in community development projects, affordable\nhousing and programs benefiting low or moderate income individuals and businesses; and\n(3) a service test, to evaluate the institution's delivery of banking services through its branches, ATM centers and other\noffices.\nThe CRA also requires all institutions to make public disclosure of their CRA ratings. The Bank received an\n“Outstanding” CRA rating in its most recent examination conducted in March 2022.\nRegulations require that Carver Federal publicly disclose certain agreements that are in fulfillment of the CRA. The\nCompany has no such agreements in place at this time.\nIn June 2020, the OCC issued amendments to its CRA regulations. The final rule clarifies and expands the activities\nthat qualify for CRA credit, updates where activities count for such credit and, according to the agency, seeks to create a more\nconsistent and objective method for evaluating CRA performance. The final rule was effective October 1, 2020 but compliance\nwith the certain of the revised requirements is not mandatory for the Association until January 1, 2023.\nTransactions with Related Parties. The Bank's authority to engage in transactions with its “affiliates” is limited by\nfederal regulations and by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. In general, these transactions must be on terms\nwhich are as favorable to the Bank as comparable transactions with non-affiliates. Additionally, certain types of these\ntransactions are restricted to an aggregate percentage of the Bank's capital. Collateral in specified amounts must usually be\nprovided by affiliates to receive loans from the Bank. In addition, OCC regulations prohibit a savings bank from lending to any\n22\naffiliate that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of\nany affiliate other than a subsidiary.\nThe Bank's authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers, and 10% shareholders (\"insiders\"), as well as\nto entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal\nReserve Act and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, these provisions require that all loans or\nextensions of credit to insiders (a) be made on terms that are substantially the same as and follow credit underwriting\nprocedures that are not less stringent than those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not\ninvolve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and (b) not exceed certain limitations,\nindividually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the Bank's capital. In addition, extensions of\ncredit in excess of certain limits must be approved by the Bank's Board. The aggregate amount of related party deposits were\n$432 thousand and there was one related party loan totaling $30 thousand at March 31, 2022.\nAssessment. The OCC charges assessments to recover the cost of examining savings associations and their\naffiliates. These assessments are based on three components: the size of the association, on which the basic assessment is\nbased; the association's supervisory condition, which results in an additional assessment based on a percentage of the basic\nassessment for any savings institution with a composite rating of 3, 4, or 5 in its most recent safety and soundness examination;\nand the complexity of the association's operations, which results in an additional assessment based on a percentage of the basic\nassessment for any savings association that managed over $1 billion in trust assets, serviced for others loans aggregating more\nthan $1 billion, or had certain off-balance sheet assets aggregating more than $1 billion. For fiscal 2022, Carver paid $216\nthousand in regulatory assessments.\nInsurance of Deposit Accounts\nUnder the FDIC's risk-based assessment system, institutions deemed less risky pay lower assessments. Assessments\nfor institutions of less than $10 billion of assets are now based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from\nstatistical modeling estimating the probability of an institution's failure within three years.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to revise its procedures to base assessments upon each insured institution's\ntotal assets less tangible equity instead of deposits. The current assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments) for\ninsured institutions of less than $10 billion of total assets is 1.5 basis points to 30 basis points.\nThe FDIC has authority to further increase insurance assessments and therefore management cannot predict what\ninsurance assessment rates will be in the future. A significant increase in insurance premiums may have an adverse effect on\nthe operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. For fiscal 2022, Carver paid $363 thousand in FDIC insurance.\nAnti-Money Laundering and Customer Identification\nThe Bank is subject to federal regulations implementing the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing\nAppropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (“USA PATRIOT Act”). The USA PATRIOT\nAct gives the federal government new powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures,\nexpanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. By way of\namendments to the Bank Secrecy Act (\"BSA\"), Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act took measures intended to encourage\ninformation sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies. Further, certain provisions of Title III\nimpose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks, thrifts, brokers, dealers, credit unions,\nmoney transfer agents and parties registered under the United States Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, as amended.\nTitle III of the USA PATRIOT Act and the related federal regulations imposed the following requirements with\nrespect to financial institutions:\n• Establish a Board approved policy and perform a risk assessment of BSA, Anti-Money Laundering and\nOffice of Foreign Assets Control;\n• Designate a qualified BSA officer;\n• Establish an effective training program;\n• Establish anti-money laundering programs;\n23\n• Establish a program specifying procedures for obtaining identifying information from customers seeking to\nopen new accounts, including verifying the identity of customers within a reasonable period of time;\n• Establish enhanced due diligence policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report money\nlaundering; and\n• Prohibit correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks and compliance with record keeping obligations with\nrespect to correspondent accounts of foreign banks\nIn addition, bank regulators were directed to consider a holding company's effectiveness in combating money\nlaundering when ruling on certain corporate applications.\nFederal Home Loan Bank System\nThe Bank is a member of the FHLB-NY, which is one of the eleven regional banks composing the FHLB\nSystem. Each regional bank provides a central credit facility primarily for its member institutions. The Bank, as a FHLB-NY\nmember, is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB-NY in specified amounts. The Bank was in\ncompliance with this requirement with an investment in the capital stock of the FHLB-NY at March 31, 2022 of $584\nthousand. Any advances from the FHLB-NY must be secured by specified types of collateral, and all long-term advances may\nbe obtained only for the purpose of providing funds for residential housing finance.\nFHLB-NY is required to provide funds for the resolution of insolvent thrifts and to contribute funds for affordable\nhousing programs. These requirements could reduce the amount of earnings that the FHLB-NY can pay as dividends to its\nmembers and could also result in the FHLB-NY imposing a higher rate of interest on advances to its members. If dividends\nwere reduced, or interest on future FHLB-NY advances increased, the Bank's net interest income would be adversely\naffected. Dividends from FHLB-NY to the Bank amounted to $26 thousand and $33 thousand for fiscal years 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. The dividend rate paid on FHLB-NY stock at March 31, 2022 was 4.75%.\nPrivacy Protection\nCarver Federal is subject to OCC regulations implementing the privacy protection provisions of federal law. These\nregulations require the Bank to disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with whom it shares “nonpublic personal\ninformation” to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter. The regulations also\nrequire the Bank to provide its customers with initial and annual notices that accurately reflect its privacy policies and\npractices. In addition, to the extent its sharing of such information is not exempted, the Bank is required to provide its\ncustomers with the ability to opt-out of having the Bank share their nonpublic personal information with unaffiliated third\nparties before they can disclose such information, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe Bank is subject to regulatory guidelines establishing standards for safeguarding customer information. These\nregulations implement certain provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, as amended (\"GLB\"). The guidelines describe the\nagencies' expectations for the creation, implementation and maintenance of an information security program, which would\ninclude administrative, technical and physical safeguards appropriate to the size and complexity of the institution and the nature\nand scope of its activities. The standards set forth in the guidelines are intended to insure the security and confidentiality of\ncustomer records and information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records\nand protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information that could result in substantial harm or\ninconvenience to any customer. The Bank has a policy to comply with the foregoing guidelines.\nHolding Company Regulation\nThe Company is a savings and loan holding company regulated by the FRB. As such, the Company is registered with\nand subject to FRB examination and supervision, as well as certain reporting requirements. The FRB has enforcement authority\nover the Company and its subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the FRB to restrict or prohibit activities that\nare determined to be a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of a subsidiary savings institution.\nThe GLB restricts the powers of new unitary savings and loan holding companies. Unitary savings and loan holding\ncompanies that are “grandfathered,” i.e., unitary savings and loan holding companies in existence or with applications filed with\nthe regulator on or before May 4, 1999, such as the Company, retain their authority under the prior law. All other unitary\nsavings and loan holding companies are limited to financially related activities permissible for financial holding companies and\n24\ncertain other activities specified by FRB regulations. GLB also prohibits nonfinancial companies from acquiring grandfathered\nunitary savings and loan holding companies.\nRestrictions Applicable to All Savings and Loan Holding Companies. Federal law prohibits a savings and loan\nholding company, including the Company, directly or indirectly, from acquiring:\n(1) control (as defined under the HOLA), of another savings institution (or a holding company parent) without\nprior FRB approval;\n(2) through merger, consolidation, or purchase of assets, another savings institution or a holding company\nthereof, or acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of such institution (or a holding company), without\nprior FRB approval; or\n(3) control of any depository institution not insured by the FDIC.\nA savings and loan holding company may not acquire as a separate subsidiary an insured institution that has a principal\noffice outside of the state where the principal office of its subsidiary institution is located, except:\n(1) in the case of certain emergency acquisitions approved by the FDIC;\n(2) if such holding company controls a savings institution subsidiary that operated a home or branch office in\nsuch additional state as of March 5, 1987; or\n(3) if the laws of the state in which the savings institution to be acquired is located specifically authorize a\nsavings institution chartered by that state to be acquired by a savings institution chartered by the state where\nthe acquiring savings institution or savings and loan holding company is located or by a holding company that\ncontrols such a state chartered association.\nIn evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings associations, the FRB must consider issues such as\nthe financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the\nacquisition on the risk to the insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors.\nThe FRB has promulgated consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are no\nless stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to their subsidiary depository\ninstitutions, including a community bank leverage ratio alternative. However, holding companies with less than $3.0 billion of\nconsolidated assets, such as the Company, are generally not subject to consolidated capital requirements unless otherwise\nadvised by the FRB.\nThe FRB promulgated regulations implementing the “source of strength” policy that requires holding companies act as\na source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of\nfinancial stress.\nThe FRB has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common\nstock by bank holding companies that it has made applicable to savings and loan holding companies as well. In general, the\npolicy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention\nby the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.\nRegulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory consultation with respect to capital distributions in certain circumstances\nsuch as where the company’s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends’ previously paid over that period, is\ninsufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company’s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s\ncapital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a\nsubsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. The policy statement also provides for regulatory consultation prior to a holding\ncompany redeeming or repurchasing regulatory capital instruments when the holding company is experiencing financial\nweaknesses or redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock that would result in a net reduction as of\nthe end of a quarter in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which\nthe redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends,\nrepurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions.\n25\nFederal Securities Laws\nThe Company is subject to the periodic reporting, proxy solicitation, tender offer, insider trading restrictions and other\nrequirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).\nDelaware Corporation Law\nThe Company is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. Thus, it is subject to regulation by the State of\nDelaware and the rights of its shareholders are governed by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”)\nThe CARES Act, which became law on March 27, 2020, provided over $2 trillion to combat the coronavirus\n(COVID-19) and stimulate the economy. The law had several provisions relevant to financial institutions, including:\n• Allowing institutions not to characterize loan modifications relating to the COVID-19 pandemic as a troubled debt\nrestructurings and also allowing them to suspend the corresponding impairment determination for accounting\npurposes.\n• The ability of a borrower of a federally backed mortgage loan (VA, FHA, USDA, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae)\nexperiencing financial hardship due, directly or indirectly, to the COVID-19 pandemic to request forbearance from\npaying their mortgage by submitting a request to the borrower’s servicer affirming their financial hardship during the\nCOVID-19 emergency. Such a forbearance could be granted for up to 180 days, with an extension for an additional\n180-day period upon the request of the borrower. During that time, no fees, penalties or interest beyond the amounts\nscheduled or calculated as if the borrower made all contractual payments on time and in full under the mortgage\ncontract would accrue on the borrower’s account. Except for vacant or abandoned property, the servicer of a federally\nbacked mortgage was prohibited from taking any foreclosure action, including any eviction or sale action, for not less\nthan the 60-day period beginning March 18, 2020, which period was subsequently extended several times by\nadministrative action..\n• The ability of a borrower of a multi-family federally backed mortgage loan that was current as of February 1, 2020, to\nsubmit a request for forbearance to the borrower’s servicer affirming that the borrower is experiencing financial\nhardship during the COVID-19 emergency. A forbearance could be granted for up to 30 days, with an extension for\nup to two additional 30-day periods upon the request of the borrower. During the time of the forbearance, the\nmultifamily borrower cannot evict or initiate the eviction of a tenant or charge any late fees, penalties or other charges\nto a tenant for late payment of rent. Additionally, a multifamily borrower that receives a forbearance may not require a\ntenant to vacate a dwelling unit before a date that is 30 days after the date on which the borrower provides the tenant\nnotice to vacate and may not issue a notice to vacate until after the expiration of the forbearance. Federal mortgage\nbacking agencies have extended this program.\nThe Paycheck Protection Program\nThe Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), established as part of the CARES Act, provided 100% federally\nguaranteed loans to eligible small businesses through the Small Business Administration’s (“SBA”) 7(a) loan guaranty program\nfor amounts up to 2.5 times the average monthly “payroll costs” of the business. The entire principal amount of the borrower’s\nPPP loan, including any accrued interest, is eligible for PPP loan forgiveness so long as employee and compensation levels of\nthe business are maintained and 60% of the loan proceeds are used for payroll expenses, with the remaining 40% of the loan\nproceeds used for other qualifying expenses, including, but not limited to, mortgage interest, rent and utilities. In May 2021,\nthe SBA announced that PPP funding has been exhausted and the SBA stopped accepting new PPP loan applications.\nFEDERAL AND STATE TAXATION\nFederal Taxation\nGeneral. The Company and the Bank currently file a consolidated federal income tax return on the basis of a taxable\nyear ending March 31 using the accrual method of accounting, and are subject to federal income taxation in the same manner as\nother corporations with some exceptions, including in particular the Bank's tax reserve for bad debts. The Bank has a\nsubsidiary which files a REIT tax return which reports its income for tax purposes on the basis of a taxable year ending\n26\nDecember 31. The REIT does not join in the consolidated return and it pays tax on its undistributed taxable income. The REIT\nhas and intends to continue to distribute its taxable income and therefore not pay tax at the REIT level. The following\ndiscussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules\napplicable to the Bank or the Company.\nDistributions. To the extent that the Bank makes “non-dividend distributions” to shareholders, such distributions will\nbe considered to result in distributions from the Bank's “base year reserve,” i.e., its reserve as of March 31, 1988, to the extent\nthereof and then from its supplemental reserve for losses on loans, and an amount based on the amount distributed will be\nincluded in the Bank's taxable income. Non-dividend distributions include distributions in excess of the Bank's current and\naccumulated earnings and profits, distributions in redemption of stock and distributions in partial or complete liquidation.\nHowever, dividends paid out of the Bank's current or accumulated earnings and profits, as calculated for federal income tax\npurposes, will not constitute non-dividend distributions and, therefore, will not be included in the Bank's taxable income.\nThe amount of additional taxable income created from a non-dividend distribution is an amount that, when reduced by\nthe tax attributable to the income, is equal to the amount of the distribution. Thus, approximately 1.2 times the non-dividend\ndistribution would be includable in gross income for federal income tax purposes, assuming a 21% federal corporate income tax\nrate.\nIn December 2017, \"The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" was signed into law. At March 31, 2018, the Company made a\nreasonable estimate and recorded a remeasurement of the Company’s net deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the\nnew reduced U.S. corporate income tax rate. The impact on the net deferred tax asset before valuation allowances was a\nreduction of $3.1 million, which was offset by a corresponding decrease in the valuation allowance of the same amount. The\nCompany recorded a benefit of $0.3 million for alternative minimum tax credits which, under the new tax law, are refundable.\nAs of March 31, 2022, the Company has a pending AMT credit refund of $143 thousand, related to the AMT credits, from its\nfiled fiscal year 2020 federal tax return.\nState and Local Taxation\nState of New York. The Bank and the Company (including the REIT) file tax returns on a combined basis and are\nsubject to New York State franchise tax on their entire net income or one of several alternative bases, whichever results in the\nhighest tax. “Entire net income” means federal taxable income with adjustments. If, however, the application of an alternative\ntax (based on capital allocated to New York or a fixed minimum fee) results in a greater tax, the alternative tax will be\nimposed. The Company was subject to tax based upon capital for New York State for fiscal 2022. In addition, New York State\nimposes a tax surcharge of 30% of the New York State Franchise Tax allocable to business activities carried on in the\nMetropolitan Commuter Transportation District. For fiscal 2022, the New York State franchise tax rate computed on capital\nwas 0.1875%.\nNew York City. The Bank and the Company (including the REIT) file on a combined basis and are also subject to a\nsimilarly calculated New York City banking corporation tax on capital allocated to New York City. For fiscal 2022, the New\nYork City banking corporation tax rate computed on capital is 0.15%.\nDelaware Taxation. As a Delaware holding company not earning income in Delaware, the Company is exempted from\nDelaware corporate income tax but is required to file an annual report with and pay an annual franchise tax to the State of\nDelaware.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nThe material risks that management believes affect the Company are described below. You should carefully consider\nthe risks as described below, together with all of the information included herein. The risks described below are not the only\nrisks the Company faces. Additional risks not presently known also may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Lending Activities\nOur loan portfolio exhibits a high degree of risk.\nWe have a significant amount of commercial real estate loans that have a higher risk of default and loss than single-\nfamily residential mortgage loans. Commercial real estate loans amount to $174.3 million, or 30.2% of our loan portfolio at\nMarch 31, 2022. Commercial real estate loans generally are considered to involve a higher degree of risk due to a variety of\n27\nfactors, including generally larger loan balances and loan terms which often do not require full amortization of the loan over its\nterm and, instead, provide for a balloon payment at the stated maturity date. Repayment of commercial real estate loans\ngenerally is dependent on income being generated by the rental property or underlying business in amounts sufficient to cover\noperating expenses and debt service. Failure to adequately underwrite and monitor these loans may result in significant losses\nto Carver Federal.\nThe allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover Carver's actual loan losses.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the\ncreditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of\nmany of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loans and our loss and\ndelinquency experience, and we evaluate economic conditions. If our assumptions are incorrect, our allowance for loan losses\nmay not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance. Material additions\nto the allowance would materially decrease net income.\nIn addition, the OCC periodically reviews the allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision\nfor loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. A material increase in the allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as\nrequired by the regulatory authorities would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of\noperations. Moreover, additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and real estate market\nconditions, new information regarding existing loans and leases, identification of additional impaired loans and leases and other\nfactors, both within and outside of our control. Additions to the allowance could have a negative impact on our results of\noperations.\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulation and Their Enforcement\nFailure to comply with the Formal Agreement could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating\nresults.\nIn May 2016, the Bank entered into a Formal Agreement with the OCC. The Formal Agreement required the Bank to\nreduce its concentration of commercial real estate and required that the Bank undertake several actions to improve compliance\nmatters and overall profitability. Based on an updated report of examination, the Bank's CRE concentration was at appropriate\nlevels and there were no issues surrounding any compliance matters. Failure to comply with the Formal Agreement could result\nin additional supervisory and enforcement actions against the Bank, its directors, or senior executive officers, including the\nissuance of a cease and desist order or the imposition of civil money penalties. The Bank's compliance efforts may have an\nadverse impact on its non-interest expense and net income.\nCarver is subject to more stringent capital requirements, which may adversely impact the Company's return on equity,\nor constrain it from paying dividends or repurchasing shares.\nIn July 2013, the FDIC and the FRB approved a new rule that substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital\nrules applicable to the Bank and the Company. The final rule implements the “Basel III” regulatory capital reforms and\nchanges required by the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe final rule includes new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective for the Bank and\nthe Company on January 1, 2015, and refines the definition of what constitutes “capital” for purposes of calculating these ratios.\nThe new minimum capital requirements are: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based\nassets capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1\nleverage ratio of 4%. The final rule also established a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5%, and the following minimum ratios:\n(i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total capital\nratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-\nweighted assets and increased each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations\non paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer\namount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such\nactions. Regardless of Basel III's minimum requirements, Carver, as a result of the previously described Formal Agreement,\nwas issued an Individual Minimum Capital Ratio (\"IMCR\") letter by the OCC, which requires the Bank to maintain minimum\nregulatory capital levels of 9% for its Tier 1 leverage ratio and 12% for its total risk-based capital ratio. At March 31, 2022, the\nBank's capital level exceeded the regulatory requirements and its IMCR requirements with a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 10.45%,\nCommon Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 13.75%, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 13.75%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of\n14.78%.\n28\nThere can be no assurance that our regulator will approve payment of our deferred interest on our outstanding trust\npreferred securities.\nCarver is a unitary savings and loan association holding company regulated by the FRB and almost all of its operating\nassets are owned by Carver Federal. Carver relies primarily on dividends from the Bank to pay cash dividends to its\nstockholders, and to engage in share repurchase programs. The OCC regulates all capital distributions, including dividend\npayments, by the Bank to the Company, and the FRB regulates dividends paid by the Company. As the subsidiary of a savings\nand loan association holding company, Carver Federal must file a notice or an application (depending on the proposed dividend\namount) with the OCC (and a notice with the FRB) prior to the declaration of each capital distribution. The OCC will disallow\nany proposed dividend, for among other reasons, that would result in the Bank’s failure to meet the OCC minimum capital\nrequirements. In accordance with the Agreement, the Bank is currently prohibited from paying any dividends without prior\nOCC approval, and, as such, has suspended its regular quarterly cash dividend to the Company. There are no assurances that\ndividend payments to the Company will resume.\nDebenture interest payments on the Carver Statutory Trust I capital securities had been deferred, which is permissible\nunder the terms of the Indenture for up to twenty consecutive quarterly periods, as the Company was prohibited from making\npayments without prior approval from the Federal Reserve Bank. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, the Company\napplied for and was granted regulatory approval to settle all outstanding debenture interest payments through September 2016.\nSuch payments were made in September 2016. Interest on the debentures had been deferred beginning with the December 2016\npayment, per the terms of the agreement. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, the Company applied for and was\ngranted regulatory approval to settle all outstanding debenture interest payments through June 2021. Full payment on the\noutstanding debenture interest was made on June 16, 2021. The Company deferred the September 17, 2021 interest payment,\nbut has since had discussions with the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia regarding future quarterly payments. A\nstreamlined process has been developed for the Company to request regulatory approval to make the debenture interest\npayments. Quarterly interest payments are now current, up to and including the most recent one, which was due on June 17,\n2022. However, there can be no assurance that our regulators will approve future payments on our outstanding trust preferred\nsecurities.\nThe Company and the Bank operate in a highly regulated industry, which limits the manner and scope of business\nactivities.\nCarver Federal is subject to extensive supervision, regulation and examination by the OCC, as the Bank's chartering\nauthority and, to a lesser extent, by the FDIC, as insurer of its deposits. The Company is subject to extensive supervision,\nregulation and examination by the FRB, as regulator of the holding company. As a result, Carver Federal and the Company are\nlimited in the manner in which Carver Federal and the Company conducts its business, undertakes new investments and\nactivities and obtains financing. This regulatory structure is designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds\nand depositors, and not to benefit the Company's stockholders. This regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities\nextensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies\nwith respect to capital levels, the timing and amount of dividend payments, the classification of assets and the establishment of\nadequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. In addition, Carver Federal must comply with significant anti-money\nlaundering and anti-terrorism laws. Government agencies have substantial discretion to impose significant monetary penalties\non institutions which fail to comply with these laws.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive\ncompensation and so-called “golden parachute” payments. It also provides that the listing standards of the national securities\nexchanges shall require listed companies to implement and disclose “clawback” policies mandating the recovery of incentive\ncompensation paid to executive officers in connection with accounting restatements. The legislation also directs the FRB to\npromulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC and other regulatory entities, periodically change the financial\naccounting and reporting guidance that governs the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements. These\nchanges can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how the Company records and reports its financial condition and\nresults of operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply new or revised guidance retroactively.\nRisks Related to the Economic Conditions\nCarver's results of operations are affected by economic conditions in the New York metropolitan area.\n29\nAt March 31, 2022, a significant majority of the Bank's lending portfolio was concentrated in the New York\nmetropolitan area. As a result of this geographic concentration, Carver's results of operations are largely dependent on\neconomic conditions in this area. Decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral\nfor loans to our borrowers. Adverse changes in the economy caused by inflation, recession, unemployment, state or local real\nestate laws and regulations or other factors beyond the Bank's control may also continue to have a negative effect on the ability\nof borrowers to make timely mortgage or business loan payments, which would have an adverse impact on earnings. Over the\npast several months: (1) Russia declared war on Ukraine, (2) the annual inflation rate for the United States reached 8.6% for the\ntwelve-month period ended May 31, 2022 (the largest annual increase since December 1981) and (3) as of June 14, 2022, the\nnational average gas price hit a record high. As of that date, the national average price for a gallon of gas was $5.01, the highest\nnumber ever recorded. Additionally, COVID-19 has impacted businesses in New York more severely than in the rest of the\nnation, according to a report from the Office of the New York State Comptroller. Since the U.S. Census Bureau began\ncollecting and reporting data through the Small Business Pulse Survey, New York’s small businesses have consistently reported\nexperiencing a negative effect from the pandemic at rates that exceed the national average. Consequently, deterioration in\neconomic conditions in the New York metropolitan area, including the continued out-sized negative impact of COVID-19 in the\nNew York metropolitan area, could have a material adverse impact on the quality of the Bank's loan portfolio, which could\nresult in increased delinquencies, decreased interest income results as well as an adverse impact on loan loss experience with\nprobable increased allowance for loan losses. Such deterioration also could adversely impact the demand for products and\nservices, and, accordingly, further negatively affect results of operations.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could negatively affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial\nsoundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing,\ncounterparty, or other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services\ninstitutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or\ndefaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our\ncounterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or\nis liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due us. There is no\nassurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Outbreak\nThe economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak could adversely impact our financial condition and results of\noperations\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant economic dislocation in the United States as many state and local\ngovernments had ordered non-essential businesses to close and residents to shelter in place at home. This resulted in an\nunprecedented slow-down in economic activity, a related increase in unemployment and a significant decline in the value of the\nstock market, and in particular, bank stocks. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Federal Reserve reduced the\nbenchmark fed funds rate to a target range of 0% to 0.25%, and the yields on 10- and 30-year treasury notes declined to historic\nlows. Various state governments and federal agencies required lenders to provide forbearance and other relief to borrowers\n(e.g., waiving late payment and other fees). The federal banking agencies encouraged financial institutions to prudently work\nwith affected borrowers and passed legislation provided relief from reporting loan classifications due to modifications related to\nthe COVID-19 outbreak. Certain industries were particularly hard-hit, including the travel and hospitality industry, the\nrestaurant industry and the retail industry. The spread of the coronavirus has caused the Company to modify its business\npractices, including employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events\nand conferences.\nGiven the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it was difficult to predict the full impact of the\nCOVID-19 outbreak on our business. The extent of such impact is dependent upon future developments, which are highly\nuncertain, including when the coronavirus can be controlled and abated and when and how the economy would reopen.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related adverse local and national economic consequences, we could be\nsubject to any of the following risks, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\nliquidity, and results of operations:\n• demand for our products and services may decline, making it difficult to grow assets and income;\n• if the economy is unable to substantially and safely reopen, and high levels of unemployment continue for an extended\nperiod of time, loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures may increase, resulting in increased charges and\nreduced income;\n30\n• collateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, which could cause loan losses to increase;\n• our allowance for loan losses may have to be increased if borrowers experience financial difficulties beyond\nforbearance periods, which will adversely affect our net income;\n• the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us;\n• our cybersecurity risks are increased as a result of an increase in the number of employees working remotely;\n• we rely on third party vendors for certain services and the unavailability of a critical service due to the COVID-19\noutbreak could have an adverse effect on us; and\n• Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation premiums may increase if the agency experience additional resolution costs.\nMoreover, our future success and profitability substantially depends on the management skills of our executive officers\nand directors, many of whom have held officer and director positions with us for many years. The unanticipated loss or\nunavailability of key employees due to the outbreak could harm our ability to operate our business or execute our business\nstrategy. We may not be successful in finding and integrating suitable successors in the event of key employee loss or\nunavailability.\nAny one or a combination of the factors identified above could negatively impact our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Market Interest Rates\nChanges in interest rates may adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.\nWe derive our income mainly from the difference or “spread” between the interest earned on loans, securities and\nother interest-earning assets and interest paid on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. In general, the\nlarger the spread, the more we earn. When market rates of interest change, the interest we receive on our assets and the interest\nwe pay on our liabilities will fluctuate. This can cause decreases in our spread and can adversely affect our income. From an\ninterest rate risk perspective, for many years the Company was liability sensitive, which indicated that liabilities were generally\nre-pricing faster than assets. For the past several years, Carver has been asset sensitive, which indicates that assets generally re-\nprice faster than liabilities. In a rising rate environment, asset sensitivity is preferable as it results in improvement to our net\ninterest margin.\nIn response to improving economic conditions, the Federal Open Market Committee (\"FOMC\") had slowly increased\nits federal funds rate target from a range of 0.00% - 0.25% that was in effect for several years to the target range of 2.25% -\n2.50% that was in effect at March 31, 2019. However, as the result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related adverse local\nand economic consequences, the target range was decreased to the range of 0.00% - 0.25% at March 31, 2020. Citing strong\njob gains, a falling unemployment rate and \"elevated\" inflation, the Federal Reserve approved the first interest rate hike in more\nthan three years on March 16, 2022, increasing the target range to 0.25% - 0.50%. On May 5, 2022, the FOMC voted approval\nfor a 50 basis-point increase in the primary credit rate up to 1.00%. In their most recent meeting in June 2022, the FOMC\napproved a 75 basis-point increase to 1.75%, which was the first 0.75% rate hike issued by the FOMC since 1994.\nInterest rates also affect how much money we lend. For example, when interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing\nincreases and loan originations tend to decrease. A rising rate environment can also negatively impact the Company if the\nhigher debt service costs on adjustable-rate loans lead to borrowers' inability to pay contractual obligations. In addition,\nchanges in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and securities. For example, a reduction in interest rates generally\nresults in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities, as borrowers refinance their debt in order to reduce\ntheir borrowing cost. This causes reinvestment risk, because we generally are not able to reinvest prepayments at rates that are\ncomparable to the rates we earned on the prepaid loans or securities in a declining rate environment.\nChanges in market interest rates also impact the value of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. In\nparticular, the unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are reported, net of taxes, as accumulated other\ncomprehensive income which is a component of stockholders’ equity. Consequently, declines in the fair value of these\ninstruments resulting from changes in market interest rates may adversely affect stockholders’ equity.\nRisks Related to the Bank's Business\nUncertainty surrounding the elimination of LIBOR and the proposed transition to SOFR may adversely affect our\nbusiness.\n31\nThe U.S. dollar-denominated London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") is used to calculate interest rates for\nnumerous types of debt obligations, including personal and commercial loans, interest rate swaps, and other derivative products,\nmaking it a primary metric in the global banking system. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\") has determined that\nLIBOR should no longer be used as a benchmark rate. In anticipation of the elimination of LIBOR, the U.S. Federal Reserve\nestablished the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\"ARRC\") to select a replacement index for U.S. Dollar LIBOR.\nARRC, comprised of a group of large domestic banks and regulators, has voted to use a benchmark, known as the Secured\nOvernight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\"). SOFR is based on short-term loans backed by Treasury securities, known as repurchase\nagreements or \"repo\" trades. ARRC has announced a paced transition plan for this new rate, including specific steps and\ntimelines designed to encourage adoption of SOFR. As of March 31, 2022, we have exposure to approximately $16.1 million\nof financial assets and liabilities, including off-balance sheet instruments, which are LIBOR-based. We do not yet know\nwhether, and if so the extent to which, the elimination of LIBOR and the transition to SOFR will have any material impact on\nthese instruments.\nRisks Related to the Bank's Operations\nFailure to maintain effective systems of internal and disclosure controls could have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany’s results of operation and financial condition.\nEffective internal and disclosure controls are necessary for the Company to provide reliable financial reports and\neffectively prevent fraud, and to operate successfully as a public company. If the Company cannot provide reliable financial\nreports or prevent fraud, its reputation and operating results would be harmed. As part of the Company’s ongoing monitoring\nof internal controls, it may discover material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in its internal controls that require\nremediation. A “material weakness” is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial\nreporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company’s annual or interim financial\nstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThe Company continually works on improving its internal controls. However, the Company cannot be certain that\nthese measures will ensure that it implements and maintains adequate controls over its financial processes and reporting. Any\nfailure to maintain effective controls or to timely implement any necessary improvement of the Company’s internal and\ndisclosure controls could, among other things, result in losses from fraud or error, harm the Company’s reputation, or cause\ninvestors to lose confidence in the Company’s reported financial information, all of which could have a material adverse effect\non the Company’s results of operation and financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to certain risks with respect to liquidity.\nLiquidity refers to the Company's ability to generate sufficient cash flows to support its operations and to fulfill its\nobligations, including commitments to originate loans, to repay wholesale borrowings and other liabilities, and to satisfy the\nwithdrawal of deposits by its customers.\nThe Company's primary sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated through the repayment of loans and\nsecurities, cash flows from the sale of loans and securities, deposits gathered organically through the Bank's branch network,\nfrom socially motivated depositors, city and state agencies and deposit brokers and borrowed funds, primarily in the form of\nwholesale borrowings from the FHLB-NY. In addition, and depending on current market conditions, the Company has the\nability to access the capital markets from time to time.\nDeposit flows, calls of investment securities and wholesale borrowings, and prepayments of loans and mortgage-\nrelated securities are strongly influenced by such external factors as the direction of interest rates, whether actual or perceived,\nlocal and national economic conditions and competition for deposits and loans in the markets the Bank serves. Furthermore,\nchanges to the FHLB-NY's underwriting guidelines for wholesale borrowings may limit or restrict the Bank's ability to borrow,\nand could therefore have a significant adverse impact on liquidity.\nA decline in available funding could adversely impact the Bank's ability to originate loans, invest in securities, and\nmeet expenses, or to fulfill such obligations as repaying borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands.\nCarver may not be able to utilize its income tax benefits.\nThe Company's ability to utilize the deferred tax asset generated by New Markets Tax Credit income tax benefits as\nwell as other deferred tax assets depends on its ability to meet the NMTC compliance requirements and its ability to generate\nsufficient taxable income from operations in the future. Since the Bank has not generated sufficient taxable income to utilize\n32\ntax credits as they were earned, a deferred tax asset has been recorded in the Company's financial statements. For additional\ninformation regarding Carver's NMTC, refer to Item 7, \"Variable Interest Entities.\"\nThe future recognition of Carver's deferred tax asset is highly dependent upon Carver's ability to generate sufficient\ntaxable income. A valuation allowance is required to be maintained for any deferred tax assets that we estimate are more likely\nthan not to be unrealizable, based on available evidence at the time the estimate is made. In assessing Carver's need for a\nvaluation allowance, we rely upon estimates of future taxable income. Although we use the best available information to\nestimate future taxable income, underlying estimates and assumptions can change over time as a result of unanticipated events\nor circumstances influencing our projections. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes to\ntax laws, statutory rates, and future taxable income levels. The Company determined that it would not be able to realize all of\nits net deferred tax assets in the future, as such a charge to income tax expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2011 was made.\nConversely, if the Company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of\nthe net carrying amounts, the Company would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a decrease in income tax\nexpense in the period in which that determination was made.\nOn June 29, 2011, the Company raised $55 million of equity. The capital raise triggered a change in control under\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Generally, Section 382 limits the utilization of an entity's net operating loss carry\nforwards, general business credits, and recognized built-in losses upon a change in ownership. The Company is subject to an\nannual limitation of approximately $0.9 million. The Company has a net deferred tax asset (“DTA”) of approximately $23.9\nmillion. Based on management's calculations, the Section 382 limitation has resulted in previous reductions of the deferred tax\nasset of $5.8 million. The Company also continues to maintain a valuation allowance for the remaining net deferred tax asset of\n$23.9 million. The Company is unable to determine how much, if any, of the remaining DTA will be utilized.\nRisks associated with cyber-security could negatively affect our earnings.\nThe financial services industry has experienced an increase in both the number and severity of reported cyber attacks\naimed at gaining unauthorized access to bank systems as a way to misappropriate assets and sensitive information, corrupt and\ndestroy data, or cause operational disruptions\nWe have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of security breaches, but such events may still\noccur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. Although we rely on security safeguards to secure our data, these\nsafeguards may not fully protect our systems from compromises or breaches.\nWe also rely on the integrity and security of a variety of third party processors, payment, clearing and settlement\nsystems, as well as the various participants involved in these systems, many of which have no direct relationship with us.\nFailure by these participants or their systems to protect our customers' transaction data may put us at risk for possible losses due\nto fraud or operational disruption.\nOur customers are also the target of cyber attacks and identity theft. Large scale identity theft could result in customers'\naccounts being compromised and fraudulent activities being performed in their name. We have implemented certain safeguards\nagainst these types of activities but they may not fully protect us from fraudulent financial losses.\nThe occurrence of a breach of security involving our customers' information, regardless of its origin, could damage our\nreputation and result in a loss of customers and business and subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, and could expose us to\nlitigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition\nand results of operations.\nSystem failure or breaches of Carver’s network security could subject it to increased operating costs as well as litigation\nand other liabilities.\nThe computer systems and network infrastructure Carver and its third-party service providers use has been, and in the\nfuture, could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems. Carver’s operations are dependent upon its ability to protect its computer\nequipment against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event, as\nwell as from security breaches, denial of service attacks, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Any\ndamage or failure that causes an interruption in Carver’s operations could have a material adverse effect on its financial\ncondition and results of operations. Computer break-ins, phishing and other disruptions may occur, and in infrequent cases\nhave occurred, and could jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through Carver’s computer systems\nand network infrastructure, which may result in significant liability to Carver and may cause existing and potential customers to\nrefrain from doing business with Carver. Although Carver, with the help of third-party service providers, intends to continue to\n33\nimplement security technology and establish operational procedures designed to prevent such damage, its security measures\nmay not be successful. In addition, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other\ndevelopments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms Carver and its third-party service providers use to\nencrypt and protect customer transaction data. A failure of such security measures could have a material adverse effect on\nCarver’s financial condition and results of operations.\nIt is possible that a significant amount of time and money may be spent to rectify the harm caused by a breach or hack.\nWhile Carver has general liability insurance, there are limitations on coverage as well as dollar amount. Furthermore, cyber\nincidents carry a greater risk of injury to Carver’s reputation. Finally, depending on the type of incident, banking regulators can\nimpose restrictions on Carver’s business and consumer laws may require reimbursement of customer loss.\nWe are subject to risks and losses resulting from fraudulent activities that could adversely impact our financial\nperformance and results of operations.\nAs a bank, we are susceptible to fraudulent activity that may be committed against us or our clients, which may result\nin financial losses or increased costs to us or our clients, disclosure or misuse of our information or our client information,\nmisappropriation of assets, privacy breaches against our clients, litigation or damage to our reputation. We are most subject to\nfraud and compliance risk in connection with the origination of loans, ACH transactions, wire transactions, ATM transactions,\nchecking transactions, and debit cards that we have issued to our customers and through our online banking portals.\nThe Company's business could suffer if it fails to retain skilled people.\nThe Company's success depends on its ability to attract and retain key employees reflecting current market\nopportunities and challenges. Competition for the best people is intense, and the Company's size and limited resources may\npresent additional challenges in being able to retain the best possible employees, which could adversely affect the results of\noperations.\nRisks Related to Future Stock Issuances\nWe may be limited in our ability to access sufficient funding through a public or private equity offering or convertible\ndebt offering.\nNasdaq rules impose restrictions on our ability to raise funds through a private offering of our common stock,\nconvertible debt or similar instruments without obtaining stockholder approval. Under Nasdaq rules, an offering of more than\n20% of our total shares outstanding at a price per share less than (i) the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq\nCapital Market immediately preceding the signing of the binding agreement, or (ii) the average closing price of our common\nstock on the Nasdaq Capital Market for the five trading days immediately preceding the signing of the binding agreement\nrequires stockholder approval unless the offering qualifies as a “public offering” for purposes of the Nasdaq rules. As of March\n31, 2022, we had 4,216,815 shares of common stock outstanding. SEC rules impose restrictions on our ability to raise funds\nthrough the registered offering of our securities pursuant to a “shelf” registration statement on Form S-3. Under SEC rules, we\nare prohibited from selling securities under such a registration statement if the aggregate market value of the securities sold\nthereunder in any twelve-month period exceeds one-third of the market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-\naffiliates. In 2021, we entered into a sales agreement, with an agent to sell, from time to time, our common stock having an\naggregate offering price of up to $20.0 million, in one or more “at the market offerings.” As of March 31, 2022, we have sold\nan aggregate of 397,367 shares of our common stock pursuant to the terms of such sales agreement, for aggregate gross\nproceeds of approximately $3.1 million. Aggregate net proceeds received were approximately $3.0 million, after deducting\nexpenses and commissions paid to the placement agent. In the future, we may be limited in our ability to access sufficient\nfunding through a public or private equity offering or convertible debt offering.\nA future issuance of stock could dilute the value of our common stock.\nWe may sell additional shares of common stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such shares, in\nsubsequent public or private offerings. As of March 31, 2022, there were 4,216,815 shares of our common stock outstanding.\nFuture issuance of any new shares could cause further dilution in the value of our outstanding shares of common stock. We\ncannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such shares,\nor the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common\nstock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect\nprevailing market prices of our common stock.\n34\nRisks Related to the Competitive Matters\nStrong competition within the Bank's market areas could adversely affect profits and slow growth.\nThe New York metropolitan area has a high density of financial institutions, of which many are significantly larger\nthan Carver Federal and with greater financial resources. Additionally, various large out-of-state financial institutions may\ncontinue to enter the New York metropolitan area market. All are considered competitors to varying degrees.\nCarver Federal faces intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits. Competition for loans, both\nlocally and in the aggregate, comes principally from mortgage banking companies, commercial banks, savings banks and\nsavings and loan associations. Most direct competition for deposits comes from commercial banks, savings banks, savings and\nloan associations and credit unions. The Bank also faces competition for deposits from money market mutual funds and other\ncorporate and government securities funds, as well as from other financial intermediaries, such as brokerage firms and\ninsurance companies. Market area competition is a factor in pricing the Bank's loans and deposits, which could reduce net\ninterest income. Competition also makes it more challenging to effectively grow loan and deposit balances. The Company's\nprofitability depends upon its continued ability to successfully compete in its market areas.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.\nNot Applicable.\nITEM 2.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time, the Company and the Bank or one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries are parties to various legal\nproceedings incident to their business. At March 31, 2022, certain claims, suits, complaints and investigations (collectively\n“proceedings”) involving the Company and the Bank or a subsidiary, arising in the ordinary course of business, have been filed\nor are pending. The Company is unable at this time to determine the ultimate outcome of each proceeding, but believes, after\ndiscussions with legal counsel representing the Company and the Bank or the subsidiary in these proceedings, that it has\n35\nmeritorious defenses to each proceeding and appropriate measures have been taken to defend the interests of the Company,\nBank or subsidiary. There were no legal proceedings pending or known to be contemplated against us that in the opinion of\nmanagement, would be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the\nCompany or the Bank.\nITEM 4.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND\nISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.\nOur shares of common stock are traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “CARV\". At March 31,\n2022, there were 4,216,815 shares of common stock outstanding, held by approximately 512 stockholders of record.\nAs previously disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 29, 2010, the Company’s\nBoard of Directors announced that Carver suspended payment of the quarterly cash dividend on its common stock.\nUnder OCC regulations, the Bank will not be permitted to pay dividends to the Company on its capital stock if its\nregulatory capital would be reduced below applicable regulatory capital requirements or if its stockholders' equity would be\nreduced below the amount required to be maintained for the liquidation account, which was established in connection with the\nBank's conversion to stock form. The OCC capital distribution regulations applicable to savings institutions (such as the Bank)\nthat meet their regulatory capital requirements permit, after not less than 30 days prior notice to and non-objection by the FRB,\ncapital distributions during a calendar year that do not exceed the Bank's net income for that year plus its retained net income\nfor the prior two years. For information concerning the Bank's liquidation account, see Note 12 of the Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements. In addition, the Company is subject to restrictions under the Agreement that affect their\nability to pay dividends. See Item 1 - Overview - Enforcement Actions.\nOn August 6, 2002, the Company announced a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to 15,442 shares of its\noutstanding common stock. As of March 31, 2022, 11,744 shares of its common stock have been repurchased in open market\ntransactions at an average price of $235.80 per share (as adjusted for 1-for-15 reverse stock split that occurred on October 27,\n2011). The Company reissued shares as restricted stock in accordance with their management recognition plan. No shares\nwere repurchased pursuant to the stock repurchase program during fiscal 2022. As a result of the Company's participation in\nthe TARP CDCI, the Treasury's prior approval was required to make further repurchases. The Treasury converted its preferred\nstock into common stock, which the Treasury continued to hold. On August 6, 2020, the Company repurchased all 2,321,286\nshares of its common stock held by the Treasury for an aggregate purchase price of $2.5 million. The purchase price was\nfunded by a third party grant. As of this date, the Company is not bound by the TARP CDCI restrictions as the Treasury is no\nlonger a common stockholder of the Company.\nCarver has the following equity compensation plans:\n(1) The 2006 Stock Incentive Plan became effective in September 2006 and provides for discretionary option grants,\nstock appreciation rights and restricted stock to those employees and directors so selected by the Compensation Committee.\n(2) The Carver Bancorp, Inc. 2014 Equity Incentive Plan became effective in September 2014 and provides for\ndiscretionary option grants, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock to those officers and directors selected by the\nCompany’s Compensation Committee.\nAdditional information regarding Carver's equity compensation plans is incorporated by reference from the section\nentitled \"Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans\" in the Proxy Statement (as defined below in\nItem 10).\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities; Use of Proceeds from Registered Securities\nThere were no unregistered securities to report which have not been previously included in a Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q or a Current Report on Form 8-K.\n36\nITEM 6. [RESERVED]\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company's Consolidated Financial\nStatements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presented elsewhere in this report.\nExecutive Summary\nCarver concluded fiscal 2022 with a net loss of $0.8 million compared to net loss of $3.9 million for the prior year\nperiod. The change in our results of operations was primarily driven by increases in net interest income and non-interest\nincome, partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense.\nThe business climate continues to present significant challenges as banks continue to absorb heightened regulatory\ncosts and compete for limited loan demand. Goods and services saw rapid growth in May and there was a large rise in food and\nenergy prices. Additionally, the Federal Reserve has increased the federal funds rate, and will likely continue to increase the\nfederal funds rate in order to bring down inflation that is at a 40-year high.\nCOVID-19 has impacted businesses in New York more severely than in the rest of the nation, according to a report\nfrom the Office of the New York State Comptroller. Since the U.S. Census Bureau began collecting and reporting data through\nthe Small Business Pulse Survey, New York’s small businesses have consistently reported experiencing a negative effect from\nthe pandemic at rates that exceed the national average. Despite the fact that one in five New York small businesses reported a\nreturn to normal operations in October 2021, the negative impacts on small businesses with less than 500 employees persist.\nSmall businesses account for the overwhelming majority of firms in most industry sectors in New York. They also employ the\nmajority of workers in industry sectors such as accommodation and food services; wholesale trade; real estate; construction;\nprofessional, scientific and technical services; and arts, entertainment and recreation. Carver continues to focus on diversifying\nits loan portfolio with C&I lending to local small businesses and strives to generate new loan production and to purchase loans\nat suitable prices.\nThe prolonged pandemic, or any other epidemic of this sort that ultimately harms the global economy, the U.S.\neconomy or the markets in which we operate could adversely affect Carver’s operations. The long-term effects of COVID-19\non the Company’s business cannot be ascertained as there remains significant uncertainty regarding the breadth and duration of\nbusiness disruptions related to the virus. In addition, new information may emerge regarding the severity of COVID-19 or the\neffectiveness of the vaccines developed, causing federal, state and local governments to take additional actions to contain\nCOVID-19 or to treat its impact. Even after formal restrictions have been lifted, changes in the behavior of customers,\nbusinesses and their employees – including social distancing – as a result of the pandemic, are unknown. The Company is\nclosely monitoring its asset quality, liquidity, and capital positions. Management is actively working to minimize the current\nand future impact of this unprecedented situation, and is continuing to make adjustments to operations where appropriate or\nnecessary to help slow the spread of the virus. In addition, as a result of further actions that may be taken to contain or reduce\nthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company may experience changes in the value of collateral securing outstanding\nloans, reductions in the credit quality of borrowers and the inability of borrowers to repay loans in accordance with their terms.\nThe Company is actively managing the credit risk in its loan portfolio. These and similar factors and events may have\nsubstantial negative effects on the business, financial condition, and results of operations of the Company and its customers.\nAt the Market Offering\nIn 2021, we entered into a sales agreement with an agent to sell, from time to time, our common stock having an\naggregate offering price of up to $20.0 million, in an “at the market offering.” As of March 31, 2022, we have sold an\naggregate of 397,367 shares of our common stock pursuant to the terms of such sales agreement, for aggregate gross proceeds\nof approximately $3.1 million. Aggregate net proceeds received were approximately $3.0 million, after deducting expenses and\ncommissions paid to the placement agent.\n37\nSELECTED FINANCIAL DATA\nThe following selected consolidated financial and other data is as of and for the years ended March 31 and is derived\nin part from, and should be read in conjunction with the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes:\n$ in thousands 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018\nSelected Financial Condition Data:\nAssets $ 735,314 $ 676,748 $ 578,770 $ 563,713 $ 693,910\nTotal loans receivable, net 573,880 478,409 423,786 424,182 472,627\nInvestment securities 72,850 94,314 75,980 90,982 72,784\nCash and cash equivalents 61,018 75,591 47,540 31,228 134,558\nDeposits 628,117 556,559 488,815 480,196 586,883\nAdvances from the FHLB-NY and other borrowed money 15,949 37,222 13,573 21,403 38,403\nEquity 55,087 52,301 48,894 47,136 51,971\nNumber of deposit accounts 29,950 33,400 30,496 31,447 31,972\nNumber of branches 7 7 7 8 9\nOperating Data:\nInterest income 22,865 20,307 21,627 23,230 24,359\nInterest expense 2,399 4,420 5,631 6,141 5,280\nNet interest income before provision for (recovery of) loan losses 20,466 15,887 15,996 17,089 19,079\nProvision for (recovery of) loan losses 603 (100) 19 (270) 135\nNet interest income after provision for (recovery of) loan losses 19,863 15,987 15,977 17,359 18,944\nNon-interest income 7,354 6,198 3,739 4,649 14,359\nNon-interest expense 28,064 26,081 25,139 27,944 27,982\n(Loss) income before income tax (benefit) expense (847) (3,896) (5,423) (5,936) 5,321\nIncome tax (benefit) expense — — — — (33)\nNet (loss) income attributable to Carver Bancorp, Inc.

Management believes these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures provide information that is useful to investors in understanding the Company's underlying operating\nperformance and trends, and facilitates comparisons with the performance of other banks and thrifts.\nReturn on equity measures how efficiently we generate profits from the resources provided by our net assets. Return\non average stockholders' equity is calculated by dividing annualized net income (loss) attributable to Carver by average\nstockholders' equity, excluding AOCI. Management believes that this performance measure explains the results of the\nCompany's ongoing businesses in a manner that allows for a better understanding of the underlying trends in the Company's\ncurrent businesses. For purposes of the Company's presentation, AOCI includes the changes in the market or fair value of its\ninvestment portfolio. These fluctuations have been excluded due to the unpredictable nature of this item and is not necessarily\nindicative of current operating or future performance.\n$ in thousands 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018\nAverage Stockholders' Equity\nAverage Stockholders' Equity $ 54,858 $ 47,306 $ 51,609 $ 45,920 $ 47,943\nAverage AOCI (1,940) 57 43 (2,315) (1,779)\nAverage Stockholders' Equity, excluding AOCI $ 56,798 $ 47,249 $ 51,566 $ 48,235 $ 49,722\nReturn on Average Stockholders' Equity (1.54) % (8.24) % (10.51) % (12.93) % 11.17 %\nReturn on Average Stockholders' Equity, excluding AOCI (1.49) % (8.25) % (10.52) % (12.31) % 10.77 %\nAverage Stockholders' Equity to Average Assets 7.77 % 7.09 % 9.00 % 7.41 % 7.24 %\nAverage Stockholders' Equity, excluding AOCI, to Average Assets 8.05 % 7.08 % 9.00 % 7.79 % 7.51 %\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nVarious elements of accounting policies, by their nature, are inherently subject to estimation techniques, valuation\nassumptions and other subjective assessments. Carver's policy with respect to the methodologies used to determine the\nallowance for loan and lease losses is the most critical accounting policies. These policies are important to the presentation of\nCarver's financial condition and results of operations, and involve a high degree of complexity, requiring management to make\ndifficult and subjective judgments, which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters. Such\nassumptions and estimates are susceptible to significant changes in today's economic environment. Changes in these\njudgments, assumptions or estimates could result in material differences in the Company's results of operations or financial\ncondition.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nThe ALLL reflects management's evaluation of the loans presenting identified loss potential, as well as the risk\ninherent in various components of the portfolio. There is significant judgment applied in estimating the ALLL. These\nassumptions and estimates are susceptible to significant changes based on the current environment. Citing strong job gains, the\nFederal Reserve approved the first interest rate hike in more than three years on March 16, 2022 and has intimated that rate\nhikes will continue the remainder of the year. A rising rate environment can negatively impact the Company if the higher debt\nservice costs on adjustable-rate loans lead to borrowers' inability to pay contractual obligations. Further, any change in the size\nof the loan portfolio or any of its components could necessitate an increase in the ALLL even though there may not be a decline\nin credit quality or an increase in potential problem loans. As such, there can never be assurance that the ALLL accurately\nreflects the actual loss potential inherent in a loan portfolio.\n39\nGeneral Reserve Allowance\nCarver's maintenance of a general reserve allowance in accordance with ASC Subtopic 450-20 includes the Bank's\nevaluating the risk to loss potential of homogeneous pools of loans based upon historical loss factors and a review of nine\ndifferent environmental factors that are then applied to each pool. The main pools of loans (“Loan Type”) are:\n• One-to-four family\n• Multifamily\n• Commercial Real Estate\n• Business Loans\n• Consumer (including Overdraft Accounts)\nThe Bank next applies to each pool a risk factor that determines the level of general reserves for that specific pool.\nThe Bank estimates its historical charge-offs via a lookback analysis. The actual historical loss experience by major loan\ncategory is expressed as a percentage of the outstanding balance of all loans within the category. As the loss experience for a\nparticular loan category increases or decreases, the level of reserves required for that particular loan category also increases or\ndecreases. The Bank’s historical charge-off rate reflects the period over which the charge-offs were confirmed and recognized,\nnot the period over which the earlier losses occurred. That is, the charge-off rate measures the confirmation of losses over a\nperiod that occurs after the earlier actual losses. During the period between the loss-causing events and the eventual\nconfirmations of losses, conditions may have changed. There is always a time lag between the period over which average\ncharge-off rates are calculated and the date of the financial statements. During that period, conditions may have changed.\nAnother factor influencing the General Reserve is the Bank’s loss emergence period (\"LEP\") assumptions which represent the\nBank’s estimate of the average amount of time from the point at which a loss is incurred to the point at which the loss is\nconfirmed, either through the identification of the loss or a charge-off. Based upon adequate management information systems\nand effective methodologies for estimating losses, management has established a LEP floor of one year on all pools. In some\npools, such as in its Commercial Real Estate, Multifamily and Business pools, the Bank demonstrates a LEP in excess of 12\nmonths. The Bank also recognizes losses in accordance with regulatory charge-off criteria.\nBecause actual loss experience may not adequately predict the level of losses inherent in a portfolio, the Bank reviews\nnine qualitative factors to determine if reserves should be adjusted based upon any of those factors. As the risk ratings worsen,\nsome of the qualitative factors tend to increase. The nine qualitative factors the Bank considers and may utilize are:\n1. Changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and collection, charge-off,\nand recovery practices not considered elsewhere in estimating credit losses (Policy & Procedures).\n2. Changes in relevant economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio,\nincluding the condition of various market segments (Economy).\n3. Changes in the nature or volume of the loan portfolio and in the terms of loans (Nature & Volume).\n4. Changes in the experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff (Management).\n5. Changes in the volume and severity of past due loans, the volume of nonaccrual loans, and the volume and severity of\nadversely classified loans (Problem Assets).\n6. Changes in the quality of the loan review system (Loan Review).\n7. Changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans (Collateral Values).\n8. The existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations\n(Concentrations).\n9. The effect of other external forces such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated\ncredit losses in the existing portfolio (External Forces).\nSpecific Reserve Allowance\nCarver also maintains a specific reserve allowance for criticized and classified loans individually reviewed for\nimpairment in accordance with ASC Subtopic 310-10 guidelines. The amount assigned to the specific reserve allowance is\nindividually determined based upon the loan. The ASC Subtopic 310-10 guidelines require the use of one of three approved\nmethods to estimate the amount to be reserved and/or charged off for such credits. The three methods are as follows:\n1. The present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate,\n2. The loan's observable market price; or\n3. The fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.\n40\nThe Bank may choose the appropriate ASC Subtopic 310-10 measurement on a loan-by-loan basis for an individually\nimpaired loan, except for an impaired collateral dependent loan. Guidance requires impairment of a collateral dependent loan\nto be measured using the fair value of collateral method. A loan is considered \"collateral dependent\" when the repayment of the\ndebt will be provided solely by the underlying collateral, and there are no other available and reliable sources of repayment.\nAll substandard and doubtful loans and any other loans that the Chief Credit Officer deems appropriate for review, are\nidentified and reviewed for individual evaluation for impairment in accordance with ASC Subtopic 310-10. Loans rated\nSubstandard have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. These loans are\ninadequately protected by the current sound worth, paying capacity of the obligor, or of the collateral pledged, if any. They are\ncharacterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Loans rated\nDoubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified Substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses\npresent make collection or liquidation in full, based on currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and\nimprobable. Carver also performs impairment analysis for all TDRs. If it is determined that it is probable the Bank will be\nunable to collect all amounts due according with the contractual terms of the loan agreement, the loan is categorized as\nimpaired. Loans determined to be impaired are evaluated to determine the amount of impairment based on one of the three\nmeasurement methods noted above. In accordance with guidance, if there is no impairment amount, no reserve is established\nfor the loan.\nFinancial institutions were not required to comply with ASU No. 2016-13, \"Financial Instruments - Credit Loss,\"\nwhich updates the guidance on recognition and measurement of credit losses for financial assets, from the enactment date of the\nCARES Act until the earlier of the end of the President's declaration of a National Emergency or December 31, 2020. The new\nmethodology requirements, know as the current expected credit loss model (\"CECL\"), will require entities to adopt an\nimpairment model based on expected losses, rather than incurred losses. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, that was\nenacted in December 2020, provided for a further extension of the required CECL adoption date to January 1, 2022. For\nsmaller reporting companies, as defined by the SEC, the FASB further extended the CECL implementation date. The new\neffective date is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 (for the Company, the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024),\nincluding interim periods within those fiscal years.\nAsset/Liability Management\nThe Company's primary earnings source is net interest income, which is affected by changes in the level of interest\nrates, the relationship between the rates on interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the impact of interest rate\nfluctuations on asset prepayments, the level and composition of deposits and assets, and the credit quality of earning assets.\nManagement's asset/liability objectives are to maintain a strong, stable net interest margin, to utilize the Company's capital\neffectively without taking undue risks, to maintain adequate liquidity and to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates.\nThe economic environment is uncertain regarding long-term interest rate trends. Management monitors the\nCompany's cumulative gap position, which is the difference between the sensitivity to rate changes on the Company's interest-\nearning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, the Company uses various tools to monitor and manage interest rate\nrisk, such as a model that projects net interest income based on increasing or decreasing interest rates.\nDiscussion of Market Risk-Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis\nAs a financial institution, the Bank's primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Fluctuations in\ninterest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of the Company's assets\nand liabilities, and the market value of all interest-earning assets, other than those which are short-term in maturity. Based upon\nthe Company's nature of operations, it is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk. The Company does\nnot own any trading assets.\nThe Company seeks to manage its interest rate risk by monitoring and controlling the variation in repricing intervals\nbetween its assets and liabilities. To a lesser extent, it also monitors its interest rate sensitivity by analyzing the estimated\nchanges in market value of its assets and liabilities assuming various interest rate scenarios. As discussed more fully below,\nthere are a variety of factors that influence the repricing characteristics of any given asset or liability.\nThe matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are\n“interest rate sensitive” and by monitoring an institution's interest rate sensitivity gap. An asset or liability is said to be interest\nrate sensitive within a specific period if it will mature or reprice within that period. The interest rate sensitivity gap is defined\nas the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific period of time and the\namount of interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period. A gap is considered positive when the\n41\namount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities and is considered negative when\nthe amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets. Generally, during a period of\nfalling interest rates, a negative gap could result in an increase in net interest income, while a positive gap could adversely\naffect net interest income. Conversely, during a period of rising interest rates a negative gap could adversely affect net interest\nincome, while a positive gap could result in an increase in net interest income. As illustrated below, the Company had a\npositive one-year gap equal to 6.57% of total rate sensitive assets at March 31, 2022. As a result, the Company's net interest\nincome may be positively affected by rising interest rates and may be negatively affected by falling interest rates.\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the projected maturities, prepayments and repricing of the major\nrate-sensitive asset and liability categories of the Company as of March 31, 2022. Maturity repricing dates have been projected\nby applying estimated prepayment rates based on the current rate environment. The repricing and other assumptions are not\nnecessarily representative of the Company's actual results.

Although certain assets and\nliabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in the market\ninterest rates. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest\nrates, while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates. Certain assets, such as\nadjustable-rate mortgages, generally have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of\nthe asset. In the event of a change in interest rates, prepayments and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly\nfrom those assumed in calculating the table. Additionally, credit risk may increase as many borrowers may experience an\ninability to service their debt in the event of a rise in interest rate. Virtually all of the adjustable-rate loans in the Company's\nportfolio contain conditions that restrict the periodic change in interest rate.\nEconomic Value of Equity (“EVE”) Analysis. As part of its efforts to maximize net interest income while managing\nrisks associated with changing interest rates, management also uses the EVE methodology. EVE is the present value of\nexpected net cash flows from existing assets less the present value of expected cash flows from existing liabilities plus the\npresent value of net expected cash inflows from existing financial derivatives and off-balance sheet contracts. At March 31,\n2022, the Company did not report any holdings in financial derivative contracts.\n42\nUnder this methodology, interest rate risk exposure is assessed by reviewing the estimated changes in EVE that would\nhypothetically occur if interest rates rapidly rise or fall along the yield curve. Projected values of EVE at both higher and lower\ninterest rate risk scenarios are compared to base case values (no change in rates) to determine the sensitivity to changing interest\nrates.\nPresented below, as of March 31, 2022, is an analysis of the Company's interest rate risk as measured by changes in\nEVE for instantaneous parallel shifts of +400/-200 basis points change in market interest rates. Such limits have been\nestablished with consideration of the impact of various rate changes and the Company's current capital position.\n$ in thousands Economic Value of Equity\nChange in Rate $ Amount $ Change % Change\n+400 bps 101,000 26,000 34.7 %\n+300 bps 98,000 23,000 30.7 %\n+200 bps 94,000 19,000 25.3 %\n+100 bps 87,000 12,000 16.0 %\n0 bps 75,000\n-100 bps 58,000 (17,000) (22.7) %\n-200 bps 34,000 (41,000) (54.7) %\nCertain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling\nchanges in EVE requires the making of certain assumptions, which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields\nand costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the models presented assume that the composition of our\ninterest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and\nalso assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to\nmaturity or the repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the EVE table provides an indication of the\nCompany's interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a\nprecise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the Company's net interest income and may differ from\nactual results.\nAverage Balance, Interest and Average Yields and Rates\nThe following table sets forth certain information relating to Carver Federal's average interest-earning assets and\naverage interest-bearing liabilities, and their related average yields and costs for the years ended March 31, 2022, 2021, and\n2020. The table also presents information for the fiscal years indicated with respect to the difference between the weighted\naverage yield earned on interest-earning assets and the weighted average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, or “interest rate\nspread,” which savings institutions have traditionally used as an indicator of profitability. Another indicator of an institution's\nprofitability is its “net interest margin,” which is its net interest income divided by the average balance of interest-earning\nassets. Net interest income is affected by the interest rate spread and by the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and\ninterest-bearing liabilities. When interest-earning assets approximate or exceed interest-bearing liabilities, any positive interest\nrate spread will generate net interest income:\n43\n2022 2021 2020\nAverage Average Average\nAverage Yield/ Average Yield/ Average Yield/\n$ in thousands Balance Interest Cost Balance Interest Cost Balance Interest Cost\nInterest-Earning Assets:\nLoans (1) $ 516,687 $ 21,335 4.13 % $ 456,112 $ 18,552 4.07 % $ 423,454 $ 18,959 4.48 %\nMortgage-backed securities 45,371 710 1.56 % 41,513 708 1.71 % 49,407 1,230 2.49 %\nInvestment securities 42,278 714 1.69 % 50,727 953 1.88 % 37,717 868 2.30 %\nOther investments 75,833 106 0.14 % 90,857 94 0.10 % 32,364 570 1.76 %\nTotal interest-earning assets 680,169 22,865 3.36 % 639,209 20,307 3.18 % 542,942 21,627 3.99 %\nNon-interest-earning assets 25,526 27,704 30,207\nTotal assets $ 705,695 $ 666,913 $ 573,149\nInterest-Bearing Liabilities:\nDeposits\nInterest-bearing checking $ 53,180 $ 30 0.06 % $ 37,313 $ 30 0.08 % $ 23,765 $ 29 0.12 %\nSavings and clubs 112,094 123 0.11 % 107,820 235 0.22 % 97,453 256 0.26 %\nMoney market 155,719 378 0.24 % 125,867 525 0.42 % 100,796 533 0.53 %\nCertificates of deposit 152,803 1,349 0.88 % 192,637 2,974 1.54 % 188,285 3,799 2.02 %\nMortgagors deposits 2,786 10 0.36 % 2,257 6 0.27 % 2,219 23 1.04 %\nTotal deposits 476,582 1,890 0.40 % 465,894 3,770 0.81 % 412,518 4,640 1.12 %\nBorrowed money 22,923 509 2.22 % 38,005 650 1.71 % 21,600 991 4.59 %\nTotal interest-bearing\nliabilities 499,505 2,399 0.48 % 503,899 4,420 0.88 % 434,118 5,631 1.30 %\nNon-interest-bearing liabilities:\nDemand deposits 123,493 85,890 58,548\nOther liabilities 27,839 29,818 28,874\nTotal liabilities 650,837 619,607 521,540\nStockholders' equity 54,858 47,306 51,609\nTotal liabilities & equity $ 705,695 $ 666,913 $ 573,149\nNet interest income $ 20,466 $ 15,887 $ 15,996\nAverage interest rate spread 2.88 % 2.30 % 2.69 %\nNet interest margin 3.01 % 2.49 % 2.95 %\nRatio of average interest-earning assets to\ninterest-bearing liabilities 136.17 % 126.85 % 125.07 %\n(1) Includes nonaccrual loans.\n(2) Includes FHLB-NY stock.\nRate/Volume Analysis\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in\nvolume of interest related assets and liabilities have affected the Company's interest income and expense during the fiscal years\nended March 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 (in thousands). For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing\nliabilities, information is provided for changes attributable to: (1) changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior\nrate); (2) changes in rate (change in rate multiplied by old volume).

The increase was primarily attributable to a $95.5 million increase in the Bank's net loan\nportfolio, partially offset by decreases of $21.4 million in the investment portfolio and $14.6 million in cash and cash\nequivalents.\nTotal cash and cash equivalents decreased $14.6 million, or 19.3%, from $75.6 million at March 31, 2021 to $61.0\nmillion at March 31, 2022. The decrease in cash was primarily due to the funding of net loan activity and repayment of\nadvances on the PPPLF. In addition, the Company made a payment of approximately $3.2 million to settle deferred interest on\nthe subordinated debt associated with its trust preferred securities during the first quarter of the fiscal year. These cash outflows\nwere partially offset by an increase in total deposits and paydowns received on investment securities.\nTotal investment securities decreased $21.4 million, or 22.7%, to $72.9 million at March 31, 2022, compared to $94.3\nmillion at March 31, 2021 due to scheduled principal payments received, and early payoffs of a $1.7 million mortgage-backed\nsecurity in the held-to-maturity portfolio during the first quarter of the fiscal year, and a $2.5 million asset-backed security in\nthe available-for-sale portfolio during the second quarter of the fiscal year.\nGross portfolio loans increased $96.0 million to $579.5 million at March 31, 2022, compared to $483.5 million at\nMarch 31, 2021, primarily due to loan pool purchases of $50.1 million and new loan originations of $151.5 million, of which\n$14.9 million were part of the SBA's PPP. The new volume was partially offset by attrition and payoffs of $99.5 million and\nloans participated of $6.1 million.\nLiabilities and Equity\nLiabilities\nTotal liabilities increased $55.8 million, or 8.9%, to $680.2 million at March 31, 2022, compared to $624.4 million at\nMarch 31, 2021, primarily due to increases in total deposits, partially offset by a decrease in other borrowings related to the\nPPP.\nDeposits increased $71.5 million, or 12.8%, to $628.1 million at March 31, 2022, compared to $556.6 million at\nMarch 31, 2021, due primarily to PPP loan funds deposited by the program borrowers into their accounts at the Bank (a\n45\nmajority of which have been retained as new customers) and new deposit account relationships established as the Bank\ncontinued to expand its digital online account openings into nine states across the Northeast and Washington D.C. As of\nMarch 31, 2022 and 2021, the aggregate amount of uninsured deposits (deposits in amounts greater than or equal to $250,000,\nwhich is the maximum amount for federal deposit insurance) was $187.4 million and $104.4 million, respectively. These\nuninsured balances disclosed do not consider that FDIC insurance can be further extended by claimant within certain law firm\ndeposit accounts. In addition, as of March 31, 2022, the aggregate amount of all our uninsured certificates of deposit was $36.9\nmillion. We have no deposits that are uninsured for any reason other than being in excess of the maximum amount for federal\ndeposit insurance. See Note 8 to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our deposits.\nAdvances from the FHLB-NY and other borrowed money decreased $21.3 million to $15.9 million at March 31, 2022,\ncompared to $37.2 million at March 31, 2021. The Bank paid down $23.7 million of its PPPLF at the Federal Reserve as it\ncontinued to receive forgiveness payments from the SBA on the PPP loan portfolio. The Company borrowed $2.5 million in\nlow-rate unsecured loans from third parties to finance eligible loans offered through the Bank's community investment\ninitiatives loan program. At March 31, 2022, the Bank had no outstanding borrowings from the FHLB-NY.\nOther liabilities increased $7.1 million to $21.8 million at March 31, 2022, compared to $14.7 million at March 31,\n2021 due to an increase in retail liabilities, primarily attributed to an outstanding teller check at March 31, 2022.\nEquity\nTotal equity increased $2.8 million, or 5.4%, to $55.1 million at March 31, 2022, compared to $52.3 million at\nMarch 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to $4.0 million raised in net proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock\nduring the second quarter. During fiscal year 2022, a series of transfers was effected to convert $3.8 million Series D Preferred\nStock into common stock, resulting in a transfer between preferred shares and paid in capital. These conversions had no impact\non the Company's total capital. The Company also raised approximately $3.0 million in net proceeds through the sale of\ncommon stock under the ATM offering during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2022. These were partially offset by\nan increase of $3.5 million in unrealized losses on securities available-for-sale and a net loss of $0.8 million for the fiscal year.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended March 31, 2022 and 2021\nNet Loss\nThe Company reported a net loss of $0.8 million for fiscal year 2022, compared to net loss of $3.9 million for the prior\nyear period. The change in our results was primarily driven by increases in net interest income and non-interest income,\npartially offset by an increase in non-interest expense and a provision for loan loss compared to a recovery of loan loss in the\nprior fiscal year.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income increased $4.6 million, or 28.9%, to $20.5 million for fiscal year 2022, compared to $15.9 million\nfor the prior year period. The increase was attributable to a $2.6 million increase in interest income and $2.0 million decrease\nin interest expense for the period.\nInterest income increased $2.6 million, or 12.8%, to $22.9 million, compared to $20.3 million for the prior year period.\nInterest income on loans increased $2.7 million, or 14.5%, primarily due to a $60.6 million, or 13.3%, increase in average loan\nbalances coupled with an increase in the average yield on the portfolio of 6 basis points. The increase in the loan portfolio was\ndriven by a restructured lending team and funded by an increase in total deposits. Interest income on investment securities\ndecreased $0.3 million, or 30.0%, due to a decrease in average balances and yields compared to the prior fiscal year.\nInterest expense decreased $2.0 million, or 45.5%, to $2.4 million compared to $4.4 million for the prior year period.\nInterest expense on deposits decreased $1.9 million, or 50.0%, primarily due to a decrease in the average balances and rates\npaid on certificates of deposit. The Company strategically exited its high-cost DTC brokered deposits, as well as many of its\nlarge high-rate non-relationship time deposits, and replaced them with demand deposits, savings and money market accounts\n(core deposits). Interest expense on borrowings decreased $0.2 million, or 28.6%, from the prior fiscal year despite an increase\nin the average rates, due to a decrease in average borrowings as the Bank paid down advances on its PPPLF at the Federal\nReserve.\n46\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe Bank recorded a $603 thousand provision for loan losses for fiscal year 2022, compared to a $100 thousand\nrecovery of loan losses for the prior year period. The provision was primarily due to the overall increase in the Bank's loan\nportfolio during fiscal year 2022. For the year ended March 31, 2022, net charge-offs of $119 thousand were recognized,\ncompared to net recoveries of $294 thousand in the prior year period. Total charge-offs of $257 thousand were recognized for\nfiscal year 2022, compared to total charge-offs of $78 thousand for the prior fiscal year. At March 31, 2022, nonaccrual loans\ntotaled $11.5 million, or 1.6% of total assets, compared to $7.2 million, or 1.1% of total assets at March 31, 2021. The ALLL\nwas $5.6 million at March 31, 2022, which represents a ratio of the ALLL to nonaccrual loans of 49.0%, compared to 71.5% at\nMarch 31, 2021. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans receivable, excluding PPP loans, was 1.00% at\nMarch 31, 2022, compared to 1.15% at March 31, 2021.\nNon-interest Income\nNon-interest income for the twelve months ended March 31, 2022 increased $1.2 million, or 19.4%, to $7.4 million\ncompared to $6.2 million in the prior year period. Non-interest income included grant income of $2.1 million and $0.5 million\nfor fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2022, the Bank recognized $0.2 million\nand $1.8 million grant income from the CDFI Fund's Bank Enterprise Award and Rapid Response Program, respectively. In\naddition, other non-interest income for the current fiscal year included $2.6 million correspondent banking fees, which was $1.3\nmillion higher compared to the prior fiscal year due to higher volume related to the Bank's servicing of PPPLF activity for the\ncorrespondent bank. The increases in the current fiscal year were partially offset by a reduction of $0.5 million, or 19.2%, in\ndepository fees and charges as the Bank partnered with Wells Fargo and Chase to offer no-charge ATM access to our\ncustomers. The prior fiscal year included $1.2 million gains recognized from the sales of securities, as management\nrestructured the Bank's investment portfolio to improve the overall yield.\nNon-interest Expense\nNon-interest expense for the twelve months ended March 31, 2022 increased $2.0 million, or 7.7%, to $28.1 million\ncompared to $26.1 million for the prior year period. Compensation and benefits increased $0.3 million, or 2.7%, due primarily\nto annual merit increases. Consulting fees increased as the Bank hired consultants to support the higher loan production. Other\nnon-interest expense included additional audit and legal fees related to a wire fraud matter that occurred during the first quarter\nof fiscal year 2022. In addition, security services were higher as the Bank continues to address the need for security guards in\nour branches in response to the ongoing homeless crisis in New York City. These increases were partially offset by lower data\nprocessing costs for the current fiscal year as the Company was able to utilize flex credits received from conversion costs\nassociated with the Bank's upgrade to a new core banking system during the prior fiscal year.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company did not have any federal, state and local income tax expense as of March 31, 2022 and 2021. State and\nlocal capital tax expenses of $0.2 million and $0.1 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively, were included in other\nnon-interest expense on the statements of operations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity is a measure of the Bank's ability to generate adequate cash to meet its financial obligations. The principal\ncash requirements of a financial institution are to cover potential deposit outflows, fund increases in its loan and investment\nportfolios and ongoing operating expenses. The Bank's primary sources of funds are deposits, borrowed funds and principal\nand interest payments on loans, mortgage-backed securities and investment securities. While maturities and scheduled\namortization of loans, mortgage-backed securities and investment securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and\nloan and mortgage-backed securities prepayments are strongly influenced by changes in general interest rates, economic\nconditions and competition. Carver Federal monitors its liquidity utilizing guidelines that are contained in a policy developed\nby its management and approved by its Board of Directors. Carver Federal's several liquidity measurements are evaluated on a\nfrequent basis.\nManagement believes Carver Federal’s short-term assets have sufficient liquidity to cover loan demand, potential\nfluctuations in deposit accounts and to meet other anticipated cash requirements, including interest payments on our\nsubordinated debt securities. Additionally, Carver Federal has other sources of liquidity including the ability to borrow from\nthe Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (\"FHLB-NY\") utilizing unpledged mortgage-backed securities and certain mortgage\nloans, the sale of available-for-sale securities and the sale of certain mortgage loans. Net borrowings decreased $21.3 million\n47\nduring fiscal year 2022 as the Bank paid down $23.7 million of its PPP liquidity facility (\"PPPLF\") at the Federal Reserve. The\nBank had no advances outstanding from the FHLB-NY at March 31, 2022. At March 31, 2022, based on available collateral\nheld at the FHLB-NY, Carver Federal had the ability to borrow an additional $50.0 million on a secured basis, utilizing\nmortgage-related loans and securities as collateral. The Bank has the ability to pledge additional loans as collateral in order to\nborrow up to 30% of its total assets. The Company also had $13.4 million in long-term subordinated debt securities and added\n$2.5 million in low interest loans during fiscal year 2022.\nThe Bank's most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments. The level of these assets is dependent on the\nBank's operating, investing and financing activities during any given period. At March 31, 2022 and 2021, assets qualifying for\nshort-term liquidity, including cash and cash equivalents, totaled $61.0 million and $75.6 million, respectively.\nIn 2021, we entered into a sales agreement with an agent to sell, from time to time, our common stock having an\naggregate offering price of up to $20.0 million, in an “at the market offering.” As of March 31, 2022, we have sold an\naggregate of 397,367 shares of our common stock pursuant to the terms of such sales agreement, for aggregate gross proceeds\nof approximately $3.1 million. Aggregate net proceeds received were approximately $3.0 million, after deducting expenses and\ncommissions paid to the placement agent.\nThe most significant potential liquidity challenge the Bank faces is variability in its cash flows as a result of mortgage\nrefinance activity. When mortgage interest rates decline, customers’ refinance activities tend to accelerate, causing the cash\nflow from both the mortgage loan portfolio and the mortgage-backed securities portfolio to accelerate. In contrast, when\nmortgage interest rates increase, refinance activities tend to slow, causing a reduction of liquidity. However, in a rising rate\nenvironment, customers generally tend to prefer fixed rate mortgage loan products over variable rate products. Carver Federal\nis also at risk to deposit outflows due to a competitive interest rate environment.\nThe Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows present the change in cash from operating, investing and financing\nactivities. During fiscal year 2022, total cash and cash equivalents decreased $14.6 million to $61.0 million reflecting cash used\nin investing activities of $79.1 million, partially offset by cash provided by financing activities of $57.4 million and cash\nprovided by operating activities of $7.2 million. Net cash used in investing activities of $79.1 million was attributable to loan\noriginations and purchases, net of principal repayments and payoffs, offset by investment paydowns. Net cash provided by\nfinancing activities of $57.4 million resulted from net increases in deposits of $71.6 million, partially offset by a decrease of\n$21.2 million in FHLB-NY advances and other borrowings. The net increase in deposits was primarily due to PPP loan funds\ndeposited by the program borrowers into their accounts at the Bank and new deposit account relationships established as the\nBank continues to expand its digital online account openings into nine states across the Northeast. The $21.2 million decrease\nin other borrowings was attributable to $23.7 million paydowns on the Bank's PPP liquidity facility at the Federal Reserve,\noffset by $2.5 million in unsecured low interest loans provided by third parties to finance eligible loans offered through the\nBank's community investment initiatives loan program. In addition, cash provided by financing activities included $4.0 million\ncapital raised from the issuance of preferred stock during the second quarter and $3.0 million net proceeds from the ATM\nofferings during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2022.\nPotential Mortgage Representation and Warranty Liabilities\nDuring the period 2004 through 2009, the Bank originated 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and sold the loans to\nthe FNMA. The loans were sold to FNMA with the standard representations and warranties for loans sold to the GSE's. The\nBank may be required to repurchase these loans in the event of breaches of these representations and warranties. In the event of\na repurchase, the Bank is typically required to pay the unpaid principal balance as well as outstanding interest and fees. The\nBank then recovers the loan or, if the loan has been foreclosed, the underlying collateral. The Bank is exposed to any losses on\nrepurchased loans after giving effect to any recoveries on the collateral.\nThrough fiscal 2011, none of the loans sold to FNMA were repurchased by the Bank. During the periods from fiscal\n2012 through 2015, 20 loans that had been sold to FNMA were repurchased by the Bank. No loans have been repurchased by\nthe Bank subsequent to fiscal 2015. At March 31, 2022 the Bank continues to service 90 loans with a principal balance of\n$14.2 million for FNMA that were sold with standard representations and warranties.\nManagement has established a representation and warranty reserve for losses associated with the repurchase of\nmortgage loans sold by the Bank to FNMA that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable. These reserves are\nreported in the consolidated statement of financial condition as a component of other liabilities. The Bank has not received a\nrequest to repurchase any of these loans since the second quarter of fiscal 2015, and there have not been any additional requests\nfrom FNMA for loans to be reviewed. The reserves totaled $123 thousand as of March 31, 2022. The table below summarizes\nchanges in our representation and warranty reserves in fiscal 2022:\n48\n$ in thousands March 31, 2022\nRepresentation and warranty repurchase reserve, as of March 31, 2021 (1) $ 181\nNet adjustment to reserve for repurchase losses (2) (58)\nRepresentation and warranty repurchase reserve, as of March 31, 2022 (1) $ 123\n(1) Reported in consolidated statements of financial condition as a component of other liabilities.\n(2) Component of other non-interest expense.\nAdditional information related to the representation and warranty reserve, including factors that may impact the\nadequacy of the reserves and the ultimate amount of losses incurred is found in “Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies.”\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\nThe Bank is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the\nfinancing needs of its customers and in connection with its overall investment strategy. These instruments involve, to varying\ndegrees, elements of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. In accordance with GAAP, these instruments are not recorded in the\nconsolidated financial statements. Such instruments primarily include lending obligations, including commitments to originate\nmortgage and consumer loans and to fund unused lines of credit. The Bank also has contractual obligations related to operating\nleases. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the Bank's outstanding lending commitments and\ncontractual obligations at March 31, 2022.\nThe Bank has contractual obligations at March 31, 2022 as follows:\n$ in thousands Payments due by period\nLess than 1 - 3 3 - 5 More than\nContractual Obligations Total 1 year years years 5 years\nCertificates of deposit $ 139,304 $ 110,298 $ 21,051 $ 6,665 $ 1,290\nDebt obligations:\nOther borrowings 2,565 17 29 2,519 —\nGuaranteed preferred beneficial interest in junior\nsubordinated debentures 13,425 — — — 13,425\nTotal debt obligations 15,990 17 29 2,519 13,425\nOperating lease obligations:\nLease obligations for rental properties 15,815 2,618 5,132 4,642 3,423\nTotal contractual obligations $ 171,109 $ 112,933 $ 26,212 $ 13,826 $ 18,138\nVariable Interest Entities (\"VIEs\")\nThe Company's subsidiary, Carver Statutory Trust I, is not consolidated with Carver Bancorp Inc. for financial\nreporting purposes in accordance with the FASB's ASC Topic 810 regarding the consolidation of variable interest entities.\nCarver Statutory Trust I was formed in 2003 for the purpose of issuing $13 million aggregate liquidation amount of floating rate\nCapital Securities due September 17, 2033 (“Capital Securities”) and $0.4 million of common securities (which are the only\nvoting securities of Carver Statutory Trust I), which are 100% owned by Carver Bancorp Inc., and using the proceeds to acquire\njunior subordinated debentures issued by Carver Bancorp, Inc.

For a description of the OCC capital\nregulation, see “Item 1-Regulation and Supervision-Federal Banking Regulation-Capital Requirements.” Regardless of Basel\nIII's minimum requirements, Carver, as a result of the Formal Agreement, was issued an Individual Minimum Capital Ratio\n(\"IMCR\") letter by the OCC, which requires the Bank to maintain minimum regulatory capital levels of 9% for its Tier 1\nleverage ratio and 12% for its total risk-based capital ratio.\nAt March 31, 2022, the Bank's capital level exceeded the regulatory requirements and its IMCR requirements with a\ncommon equity Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, and total risk-based capital ratio of 13.75%,\n10.45%, 13.75% and 14.78%, respectively. For additional information regarding Carver Federal's Regulatory Capital and\nRatios, refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, “Stockholders' Equity.”\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere herein have been prepared in accordance with\nGAAP, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without\nconsidering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is\nreflected in the increased cost of Carver Federal's operations. Unlike most industrial companies, nearly all the assets and\nliabilities of the Bank are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on Carver Federal's performance\nthan do the effects of the general level of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same\nextent as the prices of goods and services.\nITEM 7A.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations.\n50\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nShareholders and Board of Directors\nCarver Bancorp, Inc.\nNew York, New York\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of Carver Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) as\nof March 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, change in equity, and cash\nflows for each of the two years in the period ended March 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the\n“consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position of the Company at March 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each\nof the two years in the period ended March 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express\nan opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered\nwith the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement,\nwhether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over\nfinancial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a\ntest basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or\ncomplex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate\nopinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAllowance for loan losses\nAs described in Notes 2 and 4 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, the Company has a gross loan portfolio of\n$579.5 million and related allowance for loan losses of $5.6 million as of March 31, 2022. The allowance for loan losses\nincludes a general reserve of $5.5 million and a specific reserve of $0.07 million. In calculating the general reserve component\nof the allowance for loan losses, the Company segregates the loan portfolio by loan pools and utilizes nine qualitative factors in\naddition to quantitative factors (historical loss experience).\nWe identified the qualitative factors used by management to estimate the general reserve portion of the allowance for loan\nlosses, specifically the economic factor, as a critical audit matter. Significant management judgment is required in the\nevaluation of the economic factor, which include consideration of local, and national economic trends. Auditing these complex\n51\njudgments and assumptions involves especially challenging auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit evidence and\neffort required to address these matters.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n• Evaluating the reasonableness of assumptions used by management in forming the economic factor, by assessing\nwhether the assumptions reflected relevant considerations and were reasonable and reliable for the purpose used.\n• Evaluating the appropriateness of the data used by management in developing the economic factor by comparing it to\nthird-party data and evaluating any contradictory evidence identified.\n/s/ BDO USA, LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2016.\nNew York, New York\nJuly 14, 2022\n52\nCARVER BANCORP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1. ORGANIZATION\nNature of operations\nCarver Bancorp, Inc. (on a stand-alone basis, the “Company” or “Registrant”), was incorporated in May 1996 and its\nprincipal wholly-owned subsidiaries are Carver Federal Savings Bank (the “Bank” or “Carver Federal”) and Alhambra Holding\nCorp., an inactive Delaware corporation. Carver Federal's wholly-owned subsidiaries are CFSB Realty Corp., Carver\nCommunity Development Corporation (“CCDC”) and CFSB Credit Corp., which is currently inactive. The Bank has a real\nestate investment trust, Carver Asset Corporation (\"CAC\"), that was formed in February 2004.\n“Carver,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” refers to the Company along with its consolidated subsidiaries. The\nBank was chartered in 1948 and began operations in 1949 as Carver Federal Savings and Loan Association, a federally-\nchartered mutual savings and loan association. The Bank converted to a federal savings bank in 1986. On October 24, 1994,\nthe Bank converted from a mutual holding company structure to stock form and issued 2,314,375 shares of its common stock,\npar value $0.01 per share. On October 17, 1996, the Bank completed its reorganization into a holding company structure (the\n“Reorganization”) and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.\nCarver Federal’s principal business consists of attracting deposit accounts through its branches and investing those\nfunds in mortgage loans and other investments permitted by federal savings banks. The Bank has seven branches located\nthroughout the City of New York that primarily serve the communities in which they operate.\nIn September 2003, the Company formed Carver Statutory Trust I (the “Trust”) for the sole purpose of issuing trust\npreferred securities and investing the proceeds in an equivalent amount of floating rate junior subordinated debentures of the\nCompany. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 810, “Consolidation,” Carver Statutory Trust I is\nunconsolidated for financial reporting purposes. On September 17, 2003, Carver Statutory Trust I issued 13,000 shares,\nliquidation amount $1,000 per share, of floating rate capital securities. Gross proceeds from the sale of these trust preferred\ndebt securities of $13 million, and proceeds from the sale of the trust's common securities of $0.4 million, were used to\npurchase approximately $13.4 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's floating rate junior subordinated debt\nsecurities due 2033. The trust preferred debt securities are redeemable at par quarterly at the option of the Company beginning\non or after September 17, 2008, and have a mandatory redemption date of September 17, 2033. Cash distributions on the trust\npreferred debt securities are cumulative and payable at a floating rate per annum resetting quarterly with a margin of 3.05%\nover the three-month LIBOR. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, the Company applied for and was granted\nregulatory approval to settle all outstanding debenture interest payments through September 2016. Such payments were made\nin September 2016. Interest on the debentures had been deferred beginning with the December 2016 payment, per the terms of\nthe agreement, which permit such deferral for up to twenty consecutive quarters, as the Company is prohibited from making\npayments without prior regulatory approval. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, the Company applied for and was\ngranted regulatory approval to settle all outstanding debenture interest payments through June 2021. Full payment was made\non June 16, 2021. The Company deferred the September 17, 2021 interest payment, but has since had discussions with the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia regarding future quarterly payments. A streamlined process has been developed for the\nCompany to request regulatory approval to make debenture interest payments. On December 16, 2021, the Company paid the\ndeferred interest that was due on September 17, 2021 and the interest scheduled for December 17, 2021. Subsequently, the\nCompany made the regular quarterly interest payment on its outstanding debentures due on March 17, 2022 and June 17, 2022.\nThe interest rate was 3.97% and the total amount of deferred interest was $22 thousand at March 31, 2022.\nCarver relies primarily on dividends from Carver Federal to pay cash dividends to its stockholders, and to engage in\nshare repurchase programs. The OCC regulates all capital distributions, including dividend payments, by Carver Federal to\nCarver, and the FRB regulates dividends paid by Carver. As the subsidiary of a savings and loan association holding company,\nCarver Federal must file a notice or an application (depending on the proposed dividend amount) with the OCC (and a notice\nwith the FRB) prior to the declaration of each capital distribution. The OCC will disallow any proposed dividend, for among\nother reasons, that would result in Carver Federal’s failure to meet the OCC minimum capital requirements. In accordance with\nthe Agreement defined directly below, Carver Federal is currently prohibited from paying any dividends without prior OCC\napproval, and, as such, has suspended Carver’s regular quarterly cash dividend on its common stock. There are no assurances\nthat dividend payments to Carver will resume.\n58\nRegulation\nOn October 23, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted resolutions requiring, among other things,\nwritten approval from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia prior to the declaration or payment of dividends, any increase\nin debt by the Company, or the redemption of Company common stock.\nOn May 24, 2016, the Bank entered into a Formal Agreement (\"the Agreement\") with the OCC to undertake certain\ncompliance-related and other actions. As a result of the Agreement, the Bank must obtain the approval of the OCC prior to\neffecting any change in its directors or senior executive officers. The Bank may not declare or pay dividends or make any other\ncapital distributions, including to the Company, without first filing an application with the OCC and receiving the prior\napproval of the OCC. Furthermore, the Bank must seek the OCC's written approval and the FDIC's written concurrence before\nentering into any \"golden parachute payments\" as that term is defined under 12 U.S.C. § 1828(k) and 12 C.F.R. Part 359. As a\nresult of the Formal Agreement, Carver was issued an Individual Minimum Capital Ratio (\"IMCR\") letter by the OCC, which\nrequires the Bank to maintain minimum regulatory capital levels of 9% for its Tier 1 leverage ratio and 12% for its total risk-\nbased capital ratio.\nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of consolidated financial statement presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, the Bank and the Bank's wholly-owned or\nmajority-owned subsidiaries, Carver Asset Corporation, CFSB Realty Corp., CCDC, and CFSB Credit Corp., which is currently\ninactive. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nVariable interest entities (“VIEs”) are consolidated, as required, when Carver has controlling financial interest in these\nentities and is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Carver is normally deemed to have a controlling financial interest and be\nthe primary beneficiary if it has both (a) the power to direct activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entities\neconomic performance; and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could benefit from the activities that could\npotentially be significant to the VIE.\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (GAAP). In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated statement of financial\ncondition and revenues and expenses for the period then ended. Amounts subject to significant estimates and assumptions are\nitems such as the allowance for loan losses, realization of deferred tax assets, assessment of other-than-temporary impairment of\nsecurities, and the fair value of financial instruments. While management uses available information to recognize losses on\nloans, future additions to the allowance for loan losses or future write-downs of real estate owned may be necessary based on\nchanges in economic conditions in the areas where Carver Federal has extended mortgages and other credit instruments. Actual\nresults could differ significantly from those assumptions. Current market conditions increase the risk and complexity of the\njudgments in these estimates.\nRecent Events\nCOVID-19 continues to have a significant, negative effect on families and businesses in New York and throughout the\nUnited States. While New York State went through a phased reopening upon expiration of an earlier executive order to shelter\nin place, maintain social distancing and close all non-essential businesses statewide, there remains a significant amount of\nuncertainty as certain geographic areas continue to experience surges in COVID-19 cases and governments at all levels\ncontinue to react to changes in circumstances. The impact of new restrictive measures and mandates taken or issued by\ngovernments, businesses and individuals have caused uncertainty in the financial markets. The prolonged pandemic, or any\nother epidemic of this sort that ultimately harms the global economy, the U.S. economy or the markets in which we operate\ncould adversely affect Carver’s operations. The long-term effects of COVID-19 on the Company’s business cannot be\nascertained as there remains significant uncertainty regarding the breadth and duration of business disruptions related to the\nvirus. In addition, new information may emerge regarding the severity of COVID-19 or the effectiveness of the vaccines\ndeveloped, causing federal, state and local governments to take additional actions to contain COVID-19 or to treat its impact.\nEven after formal restrictions have been lifted, changes in the behavior of customers, businesses and their employees –\nincluding social distancing – as a result of the pandemic, are unknown. The Company is closely monitoring its asset quality,\nliquidity, and capital positions. Management is actively working to minimize the current and future impact of this\nunprecedented situation, and is continuing to make adjustments to operations where appropriate or necessary to help slow the\nspread of the virus. In addition, as a result of further actions that may be taken to contain or reduce the impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, the Company may experience changes in the value of collateral securing outstanding loans, reductions in\n59\nthe credit quality of borrowers and the inability of borrowers to repay loans in accordance with their terms. The Company is\nactively managing the credit risk in its loan portfolio. These and similar factors and events may have substantial negative\neffects on the business, financial condition, and results of operations of the Company and its customers.\nCash and cash equivalents\nFor the purpose of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash, amounts due from depository\ninstitutions and other short-term instruments with an original maturity of three months or less. The amounts due from\ndepository institutions include an interest-bearing account held at the Federal Reserve Bank where any additional cash reserve\nrequired on demand deposits would be maintained. Currently, this reserve requirement is zero since the Bank's vault cash\nsatisfies cash reserve requirements for deposits.\nInvestment Securities\nWhen purchased, debt securities are designated as either investment securities held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or\ntrading.\nSecurities are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost only if the Bank has a positive intent and\nability to hold such securities to maturity. Securities held-to-maturity are carried at cost, adjusted for the amortization of\npremiums and the accretion of discounts using the level-yield method over the remaining period until maturity.\nIf not classified as held-to-maturity or trading, securities are classified as available-for-sale based upon management's\nability to sell in response to actual or anticipated changes in interest rates, resulting prepayment risk or any other factors.\nAvailable-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Estimated fair values of securities are based on either published or\nsecurity dealers' market value if available. If quoted or dealer prices are not available, fair value is estimated using quoted or\ndealer prices for similar securities.\nSecurities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading\nsecurities and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings.\nThe Company conducts periodic reviews to identify and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized holding loss.\nUnrealized holding gains or losses for securities available-for-sale are excluded from earnings and reported net of deferred\nincome taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a component of Stockholders' Equity. The amount of an other-than-\ntemporary impairment when there are credit and non-credit losses on a debt security that management does not intend to sell,\nand for which it is more likely than not that the Bank will not be required to sell the security prior to the recovery of the non-\ncredit impairment, the portion of the total impairment that is attributable to the credit loss would be recognized in earnings. The\nremaining difference between the debt security's amortized cost basis and its fair value would be included in other\ncomprehensive income (loss). There were no other-than-temporary impairment charges recorded during the fiscal year ended\nMarch 31, 2022. Gains or losses on sales of securities of all classifications are recognized based on the specific identification\nmethod.\nLoans Held-for-Sale\nLoans are only transferred to held-for-sale classification upon the determination by Carver to sell a loan. Held-for-sale\nloans are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. The initial charge-off, if any is required, will be taken upon the transfer to\nheld-for-sale and absorbed through Carver's loan loss reserve. Subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in earnings as a\nvaluation allowance. The valuation methodology for loans held-for-sale varies based upon the circumstances. Held-for-sale\nvalues may be based upon accepted offer amounts, appraised value of underlying mortgaged premises, prior loan loss\nexperience of Carver in connection with recent loan sales for the loan type in question, and/or other acceptable valuation\nmethods.\nLoans Receivable\nLoans receivable are carried at unpaid principal balances plus unamortized premiums, certain deferred direct loan\norigination costs and deferred loan origination fees and discounts, less the allowance for loan losses and charge-offs.\nThe Bank defers loan origination fees and certain direct loan origination costs and amortizes or accretes such amounts\nas an adjustment of yield over the contractual lives of the related loans using methodologies which approximate the interest\nmethod. Premiums and discounts on loans purchased are amortized or accreted as an adjustment of yield over the contractual\n60\nlives of the related loans, adjusted for prepayments when applicable, using methodologies which approximate the interest\nmethod.\nLoans are placed on nonaccrual status when they are past due 90 days or more as to contractual obligations or when\nother circumstances indicate that collection is not probable. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, any interest accrued\nbut not received is reversed against interest income. Payments received on a nonaccrual loan are either applied to protective\nadvances, the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income, depending on an assessment of the ability to collect\nthe loan. A nonaccrual loan may be restored to accrual status when principal and interest payments have been brought current\nand the loan has performed in accordance with its contractual terms for a reasonable period (generally six months).\nIf the Bank determines, after considering factors such as payment status and collateral value, that a loan is impaired,\nthe Bank next determines the amount of the impairment. The amount of impairment on collateral dependent loans is charged\noff within the given fiscal quarter. Generally the amount of the loan and negative escrow in excess of the appraised value less\nestimated selling costs, for the fair value of collateral valuation method, is charged off. For all other loans, impairment is\nmeasured as described below in Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses (\"ALLL\")\nThe adequacy of the Bank's ALLL is determined in accordance with ASC Subtopics 450-20 \"Loss Contingencies\" and\n310-10 \"Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan.\" Management reviews the Bank's loan portfolio to identify and\nreview individual problem situations that may affect a borrower's ability to repay. In addition, management reviews the overall\nportfolio quality through an analysis of delinquency and non-performing loan data, estimates of the value of underlying\ncollateral, current charge-offs and other factors that may affect the portfolio, including an assessment of current and expected\neconomic conditions and changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio.\nThe ALLL reflects management's evaluation of the loans presenting identified loss potential, as well as the risk\ninherent in various components of the portfolio. There is significant judgment applied in estimating the ALLL. These\nassumptions and estimates are susceptible to significant changes based on the current environment. Further, any change in the\nsize of the loan portfolio or any of its components could necessitate an increase in the ALLL even though there may not be a\ndecline in credit quality or an increase in potential problem loans.\nThe Bank utilizes an internal loan classification system as a means of reporting problem loans within its loan\ncategories. Loans may be classified as \"Pass,\" “Special Mention,” “Substandard,” “Doubtful,” and “Loss.” Loans rated Pass\nhave demonstrated satisfactory asset quality, earning history, liquidity, and other adequate margins of creditor protection. They\nrepresent a moderate credit risk and some degree of financial stability. Loans are considered collectible in full, but perhaps\nrequire greater than average amount of loan officer attention. Borrowers are capable of absorbing normal setbacks without\nfailure. Loans rated Special Mention have potential weaknesses that deserve management's close attention. If left uncorrected,\nthese potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the Bank's credit position at\nsome future date. Loans rated Substandard are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the\nobligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, that\njeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if\nthe deficiencies are not corrected. Loans rated Doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified Substandard with\nthe added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, based on currently existing facts,\nconditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. Loans classified as Loss are those considered uncollectible with\ninsignificant value and are charged off immediately to the allowance for loan losses.\nOne-to-four family residential loans and consumer and other loans are rated non-performing if they are delinquent in\npayments ninety or more days, a troubled debt restructuring with less than six months contractual performance or past maturity.\nAll other one-to-four family residential loans and consumer and other loans are performing loans.\nGeneral Reserve Allowance\nCarver's maintenance of a general reserve allowance includes the Bank evaluating the risk of potential loss on\nhomogeneous pools of loans based upon historical loss factors and a review of nine different environmental factors that are then\napplied to each pool. The pools of loans (“Loan Type”) are:\n• One-to-four family\n• Multifamily\n• Commercial Real Estate\n61\n• Business Loans\n• Consumer (including Overdraft Accounts)\nThe Bank next applies to each pool a risk factor that determines the level of general reserves for that specific pool.\nThe Bank estimates its historical charge-offs via a lookback analysis. The actual historical loss experience by major loan\ncategory is expressed as a percentage of the outstanding balance of all loans within the category. As the loss experience for a\nparticular loan category increases or decreases, the level of reserves required for that particular loan category also increases or\ndecreases. The Bank’s historical charge-off rate reflects the period over which the charge-offs were confirmed and recognized,\nnot the period over which the earlier losses occurred. That is, the charge-off rate measures the confirmation of losses over a\nperiod that occurs after the earlier actual losses. During the period between the loss-causing events and the eventual\nconfirmations of losses, conditions may have changed. There is always a time lag between the period over which average\ncharge-off rates are calculated and the date of the financial statements. During that period, conditions may have changed.\nAnother factor influencing the General Reserve is the Bank’s loss emergence period (\"LEP\") assumptions which represent the\nBank’s estimate of the average amount of time from the point at which a loss is incurred to the point at which the loss is\nconfirmed, either through the identification of the loss or a charge-off. Based upon adequate management information systems\nand effective methodologies for estimating losses, management has established a LEP floor of one year on all pools. In some\npools, such as Commercial Real Estate, Multifamily and Business pools, the Bank demonstrates a LEP in excess of 12 months.\nThe Bank also recognizes losses in accordance with GAAP.\nBecause actual loss experience may not adequately predict the level of losses inherent in a portfolio, the Bank reviews\nnine qualitative factors to determine if reserves should be adjusted based upon any of those factors. As the risk ratings worsen,\nsome of the qualitative factors tend to increase. The nine qualitative factors the Bank considers and may utilize are:\n1. Changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and collection, charge-off,\nand recovery practices not considered elsewhere in estimating credit losses (Policy & Procedures).\n2. Changes in relevant economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio,\nincluding the condition of various market segments (Economy).\n3. Changes in the nature or volume of the loan portfolio and in the terms of loans (Nature & Volume).\n4. Changes in the experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff (Management).\n5. Changes in the volume and severity of past due loans, the volume of nonaccrual loans, and the volume and severity of\nadversely classified loans (Problem Assets).\n6. Changes in the quality of the loan review system (Loan Review).\n7. Changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans (Collateral Values).\n8. The existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations\n(Concentrations).\n9. The effect of other external forces such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated\ncredit losses in the existing portfolio (External Forces).\nThe following discussion describes the general risks associated with the Bank’s lending activities:\n• One-to-four family - Carver Federal purchases first mortgage loans secured by one-to-four family properties that serve\nas the primary residence of the owner. The loans are underwritten in accordance with applicable secondary market\nunderwriting guidelines and requirements for sale. These loans present a moderate level of risk due primarily to\ngeneral economic conditions. During fiscal year 2021, the Bank also started purchasing non-qualified mortgages for\none-to-four family residential loans. The Bank has approved guidelines for these loans.\n• Multifamily - Carver Federal originates and purchases recourse and non-recourse multifamily loans. These loans can\nbe affected by economic conditions and the value of the underlying properties. The Bank primarily considers the\nproperty's ability to generate net operating income sufficient to support the debt service, the financial resources,\nincome level and managerial expertise of the borrower, the marketability of the property and the Bank's lending\nexperience with the owner/guarantor.\n• Commercial - Commercial real estate (\"CRE\") lending consists predominantly of originating loans for the purpose of\npurchasing or refinancing office, mixed-use properties, retail and church buildings in the Bank's market area. Mixed-\nuse loans are secured by properties that are intended for both commercial and residential use, but predominantly\ncommercial, and are classified as CRE. In originating CRE loans, the Bank primarily considers the ability of the net\noperating income generated by the real estate to support the debt service, the financial resources, income level and\nmanagerial expertise of the borrower, the marketability of the property and the Bank's lending experience with the\nowner/guarantor. The Bank also requires the assignment of rents of all tenants' leases in the mortgaged property and\n62\npersonal guarantees may be obtained for additional security from these borrowers. CRE loans generally present a\nhigher level of risk than other types of loans due primarily to the effect of general economic conditions and the\ncomplexities involved in valuing the underlying collateral.\n• Business - The Bank originates and purchases business and SBA loans primarily to businesses located in its primary\nmarket area and surrounding areas. Business loans are typically personally guaranteed by the owners and may also be\nsecured by additional collateral, including real estate, equipment and inventory. Business loans are also subject to\nincreased risk from the effect of general economic conditions. SBA loans are guaranteed by the U.S. government\nbased on the percentage of each individual program.\n• Consumer - The majority of the Consumer portfolio are student loans to medical students enrolled in several Caribbean\nschools.\nSpecific Reserve Allowance\nCarver also maintains a specific reserve allowance for criticized and classified loans individually reviewed for\nimpairment. The amount assigned to the specific reserve allowance is individually determined based upon the loan. Carver\nuses one of three methods to estimate the amount to be reserved and/or charged off for such credits. The three methods are as\nfollows:\n1. The present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate;\n2. The loan's observable market price; or\n3. The fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.\nThe Bank may choose the appropriate method on a loan-by-loan basis for an individually impaired loan, except for an\nimpaired collateral dependent loan. Impairment of a collateral dependent loan is measured using the fair value of collateral\nmethod. A loan is considered \"collateral dependent\" when the repayment of the debt will be provided solely by the underlying\ncollateral, and there are no other available and reliable sources of repayment.\nAll substandard and doubtful loans and any other loans that the Chief Credit Officer deems appropriate for review, are\nidentified and reviewed for individual evaluation for impairment. Carver also performs impairment analysis for all troubled\ndebt restructurings (“TDRs”). All TDRs are classified as impaired. For non-TDRs, if it is determined that it is probable the\nBank will be unable to collect all amounts due according with the contractual terms of the loan agreement, the loan is\ncategorized as impaired. Loans determined to be impaired are evaluated to determine the amount of impairment based on one\nof the three measurement methods noted above. In accordance with guidance, if there is no impairment amount, no reserve is\nestablished for the loan.\nAn unallocated loan loss allowance is appropriate when it reflects an estimate of probable loss, determined in\naccordance with GAAP, and is properly supported.\nTroubled Debt Restructured Loans\nTDRs are those loans where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and a concession is made. A concession\ncould include extension of the terms of the loan, reduced interest rates, capitalization of interest, a significant delay in payment\nterms and forgiveness of accrued interest and/or principal. Once an obligation has been restructured because of such credit\nproblems, it continues to be considered a TDR until paid in full. For a collateral dependent loan, the Bank records an\nimpairment charge when the current estimated fair value (less estimated costs of disposal) of the property that collateralizes the\nimpaired loan, if any, is less than the recorded investment in the loan. For all other TDRs, the Bank records a specific valuation\nallowance reserve equal to the difference between the present value of estimated future cash flows under the restructured terms\ndiscounted at the loan's original effective interest rate, and the loan's recorded investment. TDR loans remain on nonaccrual\nstatus until they have performed in accordance with the restructured terms for a period of at least six months.\nInteragency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers\nAffected by the Coronavirus\nOn March 22, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interagency statement to provide additional guidance to\nfinancial institutions who are working with borrowers affected by COVID-19. The statement provided that agencies will not\ncriticize institutions for working with borrowers and will not direct supervised institutions to automatically categorize all\nCOVID-19 related loan modifications as troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”). The agencies have confirmed with staff of the\n63\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board that short-term modifications made on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19 to\nborrowers who were current prior to any relief, are not TDRs. This includes short-term (e.g., six months) modifications such as\npayment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or other delays in payment that are insignificant. Borrowers\nconsidered current are those that are less than 30 days past due on their contractual payments at the time a modification program\nis implemented.\nThe statement further provided that working with borrowers that are current on existing loans, either individually or as\npart of a program for creditworthy borrowers who are experiencing short-term financial or operational problems as a result of\nCOVID-19, generally would not be considered TDRs. For modification programs designed to provide temporary relief for\ncurrent borrowers affected by COVID-19, financial institutions may presume that borrowers that are current on payments are\nnot experiencing financial difficulties at the time of the modification for purposes of determining TDR status, and thus no\nfurther TDR analysis is required for each loan modification in the program.\nThe statement indicated that the agencies’ examiners will exercise judgment in reviewing loan modifications,\nincluding TDRs, and will not automatically adversely risk rate credits that are affected by COVID-19, including those\nconsidered TDRs.\nIn addition, the statement noted that efforts to work with borrowers of one-to-four family residential mortgages, where\nthe loans are prudently underwritten, and not past due or carried on nonaccrual status, will not result in the loans being\nconsidered restructured or modified for the purposes of their risk-based capital rules. With regard to loans not otherwise\nreportable as past due, financial institutions are not expected to designate loans with deferrals granted due to COVID-19 as past\ndue because of the deferral.\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”)\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (\"CARES Act\") was signed to provide\nemergency economic relief to individuals and businesses impacted by the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic. The law had\nseveral provisions relevant to financial institutions, including:\n• Allowing institutions not to characterize loan modifications relating to the COVID-19 pandemic as a troubled debt\nrestructuring and also allowing them to suspend the corresponding impairment determination for accounting purposes.\n• The ability of a borrower of a federally backed mortgage loan (VA, FHA, USDA, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae)\nexperiencing financial hardship due, directly or indirectly, to the COVID-19 pandemic to request forbearance from\npaying their mortgage by submitting a request to the borrower’s servicer affirming their financial hardship during the\nCOVID-19 emergency. Such a forbearance will be granted for up to 180 days, which can be extended for an\nadditional 180-day period upon the request of the borrower. During that time, no fees, penalties or interest beyond the\namounts scheduled or calculated as if the borrower made all contractual payments on time and in full under the\nmortgage contract will accrue on the borrower’s account. Except for vacant or abandoned property, the servicer of a\nfederally backed mortgage is prohibited from taking any foreclosure action, including any eviction or sale action, for\nnot less than the 60-day period beginning March 18, 2020.\n• The ability of a borrower of a multifamily federally backed mortgage loan that was current as of February 1, 2020, to\nsubmit a request for forbearance to the borrower’s servicer affirming that the borrower is experiencing financial\nhardship during the COVID-19 emergency. A forbearance will be granted for up to 30 days, which can be extended\nfor up to two additional 30-day periods upon the request of the borrower. During the time of the forbearance, the\nmultifamily borrower cannot evict or initiate the eviction of a tenant or charge any late fees, penalties or other charges\nto a tenant for late payment of rent. Additionally, a multifamily borrower that receives a forbearance may not require a\ntenant to vacate a dwelling unit before a date that is 30 days after the date on which the borrower provides the tenant\nnotice to vacate and may not issue a notice to vacate until after the expiration of the forbearance.\nConsistent with regulatory guidance and the provisions of the CARES Act, loans less than 30 days past due at\nDecember 31, 2019 that were granted COVID-19 related payment deferrals will continue to be considered current and not be\nreported as TDRs.\nCoronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2021 (the “CRRSA Act”)\nOn December 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2021 (\"CRRSA\nAct\") was signed into law, which also contains provisions that could directly impact financial institutions including extending\n64\nthe time that insured depository institutions and depository institution holding companies have to comply with the current\nexpected credit losses (CECL) accounting standard and extending the authority granted to banks under the CARES Act to elect\nto temporarily suspend the requirements under U.S. GAAP applicable to troubled debt restructurings for loan modifications\nrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic for any loan that was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019.\nRepresentation and Warranty Reserve\nDuring the period 2004 through 2009, the Bank originated 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and sold the loans to\nthe Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”). The loans were sold to FNMA with the standard representations and\nwarranties for loans sold to the Government Sponsored Entities (GSEs). The Bank may be required to repurchase these loans in\nthe event of breaches of these representations and warranties. In the event of a repurchase, the Bank is typically required to pay\nthe unpaid principal balance as well as outstanding interest and fees. The Bank then recovers the loan or, if the loan has been\nforeclosed, the underlying collateral. The Bank is exposed to any losses on repurchased loans after giving effect to any\nrecoveries on the collateral.\nManagement has established a representation and warranty reserve for losses associated with the repurchase of\nmortgage loans sold by the Bank to FNMA that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable. These reserves are\nreported in the consolidated statement of financial condition as a component of other liabilities. The calculation of the reserve\nis based on estimates, which are uncertain, and require the application of judgment. In establishing the reserves, we consider a\nvariety of factors, including those loans that are under review by FNMA that have not yet received a repurchase request. The\nBank tracks the FNMA claims monthly and evaluates the reserve on a quarterly basis.\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company has determined that all of its activities constitute one reportable operating segment.\nConcentration of Risk\nThe Bank's principal lending activities are concentrated in loans secured by real estate, a substantial portion of which\nare located in New York City. Accordingly, the ultimate collectability of a substantial portion of the Company's loan portfolio\nis susceptible to changes in New York's real estate market conditions. Qualitative factors in the ALLL calculation considers the\nBank's concentration risk.\nPremises and Equipment\nPremises and equipment are comprised of land, at cost, and buildings, building improvements, furnishings and\nequipment and leasehold improvements, at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization\ncharges are included in Non-Interest Expense in the consolidated statements of operations and are computed using the straight-\nline method over the following estimated useful lives:\nBuildings and improvements 10 to 25 years\nFurnishings and equipment 3 to 5 years\nLeasehold improvements Lesser of useful life or remaining term of lease\nMaintenance, repairs and minor improvements are charged to non-interest expense in the period incurred.\nLeases\nLeases are classified as operating or finance leases at the lease commencement date. The Company includes lease\nrenewal options in the lease term if it is reasonably certain the option will be exercised. Right-of-use assets represent the\nCompany's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company's obligation to make\nlease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date\nbased on the estimated present value of the lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing\nrate, which is the rate for a fully collateralized and fully amortizing loan with a maturity date that is similar to the lease term, at\nlease commencement to calculate the present value of lease payments when the implicit rate in a lease is not readily\ndeterminable.\n65\nFederal Home Loan Bank Stock\nThe FHLB-NY has assigned to the Bank a mandated membership stock purchase, based on the Bank's asset size. In\naddition, for all borrowing activity, the Bank is required to purchase shares of FHLB-NY non-marketable capital stock at par.\nSuch shares are redeemed by FHLB-NY at par with reductions in the Bank's borrowing levels. FHLB stock does not have a\nreadily determinable fair value and we do not consider these shares to be other-than-temporarily impaired at March 31, 2022.\nThe Bank carries this investment at historical cost.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nAll separately recognized servicing assets totaled $162 thousand and $147 thousand, respectively, at March 31, 2022\nand 2021, and are included in Other Assets in the consolidated statements of financial condition and measured at fair value.\nChanges in fair value is included in Non-Interest Income in the consolidated statements of operations. Servicing fee income of\n$41 thousand and $38 thousand, respectively, was recognized during the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, and is included\nin Non-Interest Income in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nReal estate acquired by foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition less\nestimated selling costs. Any subsequent adjustments will be to the lower of cost or fair value and included in Non-Interest\nExpense in the consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of such assets is determined based primarily upon\nindependent appraisals and other relevant factors. The amounts ultimately recoverable from real estate owned could differ from\nthe net carrying value of these properties because of economic conditions. Costs incurred to improve properties or prepare\nthem for sale are capitalized. Revenues and expenses related to the holding and operating of properties are recognized in\noperations as earned or incurred. Gains or losses on sale of properties are recognized as incurred and are included in Non-\nInterest Expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As of March 31, 2022, the Bank held $60 thousand in a\nforeclosed residential real estate property as a result of obtaining physical possession. In addition, as of March 31, 2022 and\n2021, we had residential loans with a carrying value of $3.1 million and $2.5 million, respectively, collateralized by residential\nreal estate property for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in process.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company records income taxes using the asset and liability method. Income tax expense (benefit) consists of\nincome taxes currently payable (receivable) and deferred income taxes. Temporary differences between the basis of assets and\nliabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes are measured as of the balance sheet date. Deferred tax liabilities or\nrecognizable deferred tax assets are calculated on such differences, using current statutory rates, which result in future taxable\nor deductible amounts. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes\nthe enactment date. Where applicable, deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance for any portion determined\nmore likely than not to be realized. This valuation allowance would subsequently be adjusted by a charge or credit to income\ntax expense as changes in facts and circumstances warrant. A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is \"more likely\nthan not\" that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The\namount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax\npositions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded. Any interest expense or penalties would be\nrecorded as interest expense.\nEarnings (Loss) per Common Share\nThe Company has preferred stock which are entitled to receive dividends if declared on the Company's common stock\nand are therefore considered to be participating securities. Basic earnings (loss) per share (“EPS”) is computed using the two\nclass method. This calculation divides net income (loss) available to common stockholders after the allocation of undistributed\nearnings to the participating securities by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the\nperiod. Diluted earnings per share takes into account the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to\nissue common stock were exercised and converted into common stock. These potentially dilutive shares are then included in\nthe weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period. Dilution calculations are not applicable to net loss periods.\n66\nPreferred and Common Dividends\nThe Company is prohibited from paying any dividends without prior regulatory approval pursuant to the terms of the\nFormal Agreement and Resolution to which it is subject, and is generally subject to regulations governing the payment of\ndividends. There are no assurances that the payments of common stock dividends will resume.\nTreasury Stock\nTreasury stock is recorded at cost and is presented as a reduction of stockholders' equity.\nStock Compensation Plans\nThe Company currently has multiple stock plans in place for employees and directors of the Company. The\ncompensation cost related to share-based payment transactions is included in Employee Compensation and Benefits in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. Compensation cost for all stock awards is calculated and recognized over a defined\nvesting period. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. For awards with graded-vesting, compensation cost is recognized\non a straight-line basis over the requisite vesting period for the entire award. The Black-Scholes model is used to estimate the\nfair value of stock options, while the market price of the Company's common stock at the date of grant is used for restricted\nstock awards.\nOff-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Bank has entered into off-balance sheet financial instruments consisting of\ncommitments to extend credit and letters of credit. Such financial instruments are recorded in the consolidated statements of\ncondition when they are funded. Reserves for unfunded lending commitments are included in Other Liabilities in the\nconsolidated statements of financial condition.\nGrant Income\nDesignated as a Community Development Financial Institution (\"CDFI\") by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the\nBank is eligible for, and on occasion receives, assistance from the government and other financial institutions in the form of\ngrants. The Company earns these grants through compliance with their conditions and by meeting the stated obligations. The\nCompany therefore recognizes the grant income over the periods that bear the cost of meeting the obligations.\nAdvertising Costs\nThe Company follows the policy of charging the costs of advertising to expense as incurred.\nTransfers of Financial Assets\nTransfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been surrendered. Control\nover transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when (1) the assets have been isolated from the Company, (2) the transferee\nobtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred\nassets, and (3) the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase\nthem before their maturity.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nAccounting Standards Recently Adopted\nOn April 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU No. 2018-13 \"Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820):\nDisclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement,\" which improved the\neffectiveness of disclosures in the notes to financial statements by facilitating clear communication of the information required\nby GAAP that is most important to users of an entity's financial statements. The amendments removed the disclosure\nrequirements for (1) transfers between Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy, (2) the policy for timing of transfers between\nlevels, and (3) the valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements. Additionally, the amendments modified the\ndisclosure requirements for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value and measurement uncertainty. Finally,\nthe amendments added disclosure requirements for (1) the changes in unrealized gains and losses included in other\ncomprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements, and (2) the range and weighted average of significant\n67\nunobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 measurements. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the\nCompany's consolidated statements of financial condition and results of operations.\nOn April 1, 2021, the Company adopted ASU No. 2019-12 \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting\nfor Income Taxes,\" which was part of the FASB's simplification initiative to reduce complexity, while maintaining or\nimproving the usefulness of information provided to users of financial statements. The amendments in this update simplified\nthe accounting for income taxes and improved consistent application of GAAP by removing certain exceptions and clarifying\nand amending existing guidance for areas of Topic 740. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the\nCompany's financial statements.\nAccounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, \"Financial Instruments - Credit Loss,\" which updates the guidance\non recognition and measurement of credit losses for financial assets. The new requirements, known as the current expected\ncredit loss model (\"CECL\") will require entities to adopt an impairment model based on expected losses rather than incurred\nlosses. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 (for the Company, the fiscal year\nending March 31, 2021), including interim periods within those fiscal years. In May 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-05,\n\"Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Target Transition Relief,\" to provide transition relief by giving entities an\noption to irrevocably elect the fair value option for certain financial assets measured at amortized cost upon adoption of ASU\n2016-13. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10, which extended the CECL implementation date for smaller\nreporting companies, as defined by the SEC. The new effective date is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 (for\nthe Company, the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024), including interim periods within those fiscal years. In November 2019,\nthe FASB issued ASU No. 2019-11, \"Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses,\" to\namend or clarify guidance regarding expected recoveries for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration, transition relief\nfor troubled debt restructurings, disclosures related to accrued interest receivables, and financial assets secured by collateral\nmaintenance provisions. The Company is currently in the implementation stage of ASU 2016-13 and has engaged two vendors\nto assist management in evaluating the requirements of the new standard, modeling requirements and assessment of the impact\nof the adoption of the new standard on its consolidated statements of financial condition and results of operations. In March\n2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-02, \"Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (ASC 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings\n(TDRs) and Vintage Disclosures,\" which eliminates the accounting guidance for TDRs by creditors, while enhancing disclosure\nrequirements for certain loan refinancing and restructuring activities by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial\ndifficulty. The amendments also require disclosure of current period gross writeoffs by year of origination. The effective dates\nfor the amendments in ASU 2022-02 are the same as the effective dates in ASU 2016-13. The Company is evaluating the\nimpacts of this ASU and does not believe it will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04 \"Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of\nReference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting,\" which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to\nloan and lease agreements, derivative contracts, and other transactions affected by the anticipated transition away from LIBOR\ntoward new interest rate benchmarks. For transactions that are modified because of reference rate reform and that meet certain\nscope guidance (i) modifications of loan agreements should be accounted for by prospectively adjusting the effective interest\nrate and the modification will be considered \"minor\" so that any existing unamortized origination fees/costs would carry\nforward and continue to be amortized and (ii) modifications of lease agreements should be accounted for as a continuation of\nthe existing agreement with no reassessments of the lease classification and the discount rate or remeasurements of lease\npayments that otherwise would be required for modifications not accounted for as separate contracts. ASU 2020-04 is effective\nMarch 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. An entity may elect to apply ASU 2020-04 for contract modifications as of any\ndate from the beginning of an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020, or prospectively from a date\nwithin an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020, up to the date that the financial statements are\navailable to be issued. Once elected for a Topic or an Industry Subtopic, the amendments in this ASU must be applied\nprospectively for all eligible contract modifications for that Topic or Industry Subtopic. We anticipate this ASU will simplify\nany modifications we execute between the selected start date (yet to be determined) and December 31, 2022 that are directly\nrelated to LIBOR transition by allowing prospective recognition of the continuation of the contract, rather than extinguishment\nof the old contract resulting in writing off unamortized fees/costs. The Company is evaluating the impacts of this ASU and has\nnot yet determined whether LIBOR transition and this ASU will have a material impact on the Company's consolidated\nstatements of financial condition and results of operations.\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-10 \"Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by\nBusiness Entities about Government Assistance,\" to improve the financial reporting of government assistance received by\nbusiness entities by requiring the disclosure of (1) the types of assistance received, (2) an entity’s accounting for the assistance,\nand (3) the effect of the assistance on an entity’s financial statements. ASU 2021-10 is effective for all entities for financial\n68\nstatements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021 (for the Company, the fiscal year ending March 31,\n2023). Early application of the guidance is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impacts of this ASU to determine\nwhether it will have a material impact on the Company's consolidated statements of financial condition and results of\noperations.\nNOTE 3. INVESTMENT SECURITIES\nThe Bank utilizes mortgage-backed and other investment securities in its asset/liability management strategy. In\nmaking investment decisions, the Bank considers, among other things, its yield and interest rate objectives, its interest rate and\ncredit risk position, and its liquidity and cash flow.\nGenerally, the investment policy of the Bank is to invest funds among categories of investments and maturities based\nupon the Bank’s asset/liability management policies, investment quality, loan and deposit volume and collateral requirements,\nliquidity needs and performance objectives. Debt securities are classified into three categories: trading, held-to-maturity, and\navailable-for-sale. At March 31, 2022, securities with fair value of $67.6 million, or 92.8%, of the Bank’s total securities were\nclassified as available-for-sale, and the remaining securities with amortized cost of $5.3 million, or 7.2%, were classified as\nheld-to-maturity. The Bank had no securities classified as trading at March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021.\nOther investments as of March 31, 2022 primarily consists of the Bank's investment in a limited partnership\nCommunity Capital Fund. These securities are measured at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in net income. Other\ninvestments totaled $1.1 million at March 31, 2022 and are included in Other Assets on the Statements of Financial Condition.\nThe following tables set forth the amortized cost and fair value of securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity at\nMarch 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021:\nAt March 31, 2022\nAmortized Gross Unrealized\n$ in thousands Cost Gains Losses Fair Value\nAvailable-for-Sale:\nMortgage-backed securities:\nGovernment National Mortgage Association $ 439 $ 9 $ — $ 448\nFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation 23,744 — 2,197 21,547\nFederal National Mortgage Association 12,852 — 1,268 11,584\nTotal mortgage-backed securities 37,035 9 3,465 33,579\nU.S. Government Agency Securities 13,864 — 79 13,785\nCorporate Bonds 5,271 — 1,150 4,121\nMuni Securities 17,741 — 1,973 15,768\nAsset-backed Securities 347 — 4 343\nTotal available-for-sale $ 74,258 $ 9 $ 6,671 $ 67,596\nHeld-to-Maturity:\nMortgage-backed securities:\nGovernment National Mortgage Association $ 481 $ 27 $ — $ 508\nFederal National Mortgage Association 4,773 9 14 4,768\nTotal held-to-maturity $ 5,254 $ 36 $ 14 $ 5,276\n69\nAt March 31, 2021\nAmortized Gross Unrealized\n$ in thousands Cost Gains Losses Fair Value\nAvailable-for-Sale:\nMortgage-backed securities:\nGovernment National Mortgage Association $ 987 $ 39 $ — $ 1,026\nFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation 28,458 88 761 27,785\nFederal National Mortgage Association 15,120 — 510 14,610\nTotal mortgage-backed securities 44,565 127 1,271 43,421\nU.S. Government Agency Securities 18,744 — 113 18,631\nCorporate Bonds 5,274 — 793 4,481\nMuni Securities 17,763 — 1,153 16,610\nAsset-backed Securities 3,336 28 — 3,364\nTotal available-for-sale $ 89,682 $ 155 $ 3,330 $ 86,507\nHeld-to-Maturity:\nMortgage-backed securities:\nGovernment National Mortgage Association $ 683 $ 69 $ — $ 752\nFederal National Mortgage Association 7,124 264 — 7,388\nTotal held-to-maturity $ 7,807 $ 333 $ — $ 8,140\nThere were no sales of available-for-sale securities and held-to-maturity securities for the year ended March 31, 2022.\nThe following is a summary regarding proceeds and gross gains realized from the sale of securities from the available-for-sale\nportfolio for the year ended March 31, 2021.\n$ in thousands March 31, 2021\nProceeds $ 37,802\nGross gains 1,193\nCarver maintains a portfolio of mortgage-backed securities in the form of Government National Mortgage Association\n(“GNMA”) pass-through certificates, Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”) mortgage-backed securities and\nFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC”) mortgage-backed securities. GNMA pass-through certificates are\nguaranteed as to the payment of principal and interest by the full faith and credit of the United States Government, while\nFNMA and FHLMC securities are each guaranteed by their respective agencies as to principal and interest. Based on the high\nquality of the Bank's investment portfolio, current market conditions have not significantly impacted the pricing of the portfolio\nor the Bank's ability to obtain reliable prices.\nAt March 31, 2022, the Bank pledged mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities of $5.9 million as collateral for\nadvances from the FHLB-NY.\n70\nThe following tables set forth the unrealized losses and fair value of securities in an unrealized loss position at\nMarch 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021 for less than 12 months and 12 months or longer:\nAt March 31, 2022\nLess than 12 months 12 months or longer Total\nUnrealized Fair Unrealized Fair Unrealized Fair\n$ in thousands Losses Value Losses Value Losses Value\nAvailable-for-Sale:\nMortgage-backed securities $ 519 $ 7,057 $ 2,946 $ 26,128 $ 3,465 $ 33,185\nU.S. Government Agency Securities — — 79 13,785 79 13,785\nCorporate bonds — — 1,150 4,121 1,150 4,121\nMuni securities 1,640 13,512 333 2,256 1,973 15,768\nAsset-backed securities 4 343 — — 4 343\nTotal available-for-sale securities $ 2,163 $ 20,912 $ 4,508 $ 46,290 $ 6,671 $ 67,202\nHeld-to-Maturity:\nMortgage-backed securities $ 14 $ 2,204 $ — $ — $ 14 $ 2,204\nTotal held-to-maturity securities $ 14 $ 2,204 $ — $ — $ 14 $ 2,204\nAt March 31, 2021\nLess than 12 months 12 months or longer Total\nUnrealized Fair Unrealized Fair Unrealized Fair\n$ in thousands Losses Value Losses Value Losses Value\nAvailable-for-Sale:\nMortgage-backed securities $ 1,271 $ 39,020 $ — $ — $ 1,271 $ 39,020\nU.S. Government Agency Securities — — 113 18,631 113 18,631\nCorporate bonds 793 4,481 — — 793 4,481\nMuni securities 1,153 16,609 — — 1,153 16,609\nTotal available-for-sale securities $ 3,217 $ 60,110 $ 113 $ 18,631 $ 3,330 $ 78,741\nA total of 23 securities had an unrealized loss at March 31, 2022, compared to 15 at March 31, 2021. Mortgage-\nbacked securities, municipal securities, U.S. government agency securities and a corporate bond security represented 49.4%,\n23.5%, 20.5% and 6.1%, respectively, of total available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position at March 31, 2022.\nThere were four mortgage-backed securities, three U.S. government agency securities, one corporate bond and one municipal\nsecurity that had an unrealized loss position for more than 12 months at March 31, 2022. The cause of the temporary\nimpairment is directly related to changes in interest rates. In general, as interest rates decline, the fair value of securities will\nrise, and conversely as interest rates rise, the fair value of securities will decline. Management considers fluctuations in fair\nvalue as a result of interest rate changes to be temporary, which is consistent with the Bank's experience. The impairments are\ndeemed temporary based on the direct relationship of the change in fair value to movements in interest rates, the life of the\ninvestments and their high credit quality. Given the high credit quality of the mortgage-backed securities which are backed by\nthe U.S. government's guarantees, the high credit quality and strong financial performance of the U.S. Government Agency and\nmunicipal securities, and the corporate security that is a reputable institution in good financial standing, the risk of credit loss is\nminimal. Management believes that these unrealized losses are a direct result of the current rate environment and the Company\nhas the ability and intent to hold the securities until maturity or the valuation recovers.\nThe Bank did not have any securities that were classified as having other-than-temporary impairment in its investment\nportfolio at March 31, 2022.\nThe following is a summary of the amortized cost and fair value of debt securities at March 31, 2022, by remaining\nperiod to contractual maturity (ignoring earlier call dates, if any).

Accordingly, as with most financial institutions in the market area, the ultimate collectability of a substantial portion of\nthe Company's loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in market conditions in this area.\nReal estate mortgage loan portfolios (one-to-four family) serviced for Federal National Mortgage Association\n(“FNMA”) and other third parties are not included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The unpaid\nprincipal balances of these loans aggregated $14.5 million and $16.8 million at March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAt March 31, 2022 the Bank pledged $58.3 million in total real estate mortgage loans as collateral for advances from\nthe FHLB-NY.\nThe Bank participated as a lender in the Paycheck Protection Program (\"PPP\"), which opened on April 3, 2020. As\npart of the CARES Act, the Small Business Administration (\"SBA\") was authorized to temporarily guarantee loans under this\nnew 7(a) loan program. Under the PPP, small businesses and other entities and individuals could apply for loans from existing\nSBA lenders and other approved regulated lenders that enroll in the program, subject to numerous limitations and eligibility\ncriteria. Since the PPP loans are fully guaranteed by the SBA, there are no additional ALLL reserves required. As of\nMarch 31, 2022, the Bank had approved and funded approximately 420 applications totaling $57.1 million of loans under the\nPPP. Business loans included PPP loans outstanding totaling $17.9 million as of March 31, 2022. The net loan origination fees\non these loans totaled approximately $399 thousand and are being recognized into interest income on loans over the 2-year and\n5-year stated maturity terms of the PPP loans using the straight-line deferral method. The Bank has begun to receive debt\nforgiveness payments on PPP loans closed during the first and second rounds of the program.\nConsistent with regulatory guidance and the provisions of the CARES Act, loans less than 30 days past due at\nDecember 31, 2019 that were granted COVID-19 related payment deferrals continued to be considered current and not reported\nas TDRs. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, the Bank received 83 applications for payment deferrals on approximately\n72\n$90.4 million of loans. The Bank has been working with the borrowers to determine if there is a risk of any losses associated\nwith repayment and if any additional reserves would have to be allocated to this portfolio. At March 31, 2022, no loans were\non COVID-related deferrals as the remaining 90-day loan deferments expired and borrowers became current.\nThe following is an analysis of the allowance for loan losses based upon the method of evaluating loan impairment for\nthe fiscal year ended March 31, 2022:\nOne-to-four Commercial\n$ in thousands family Multifamily Real Estate Business Consumer Unallocated Total\nAllowance for loan losses:\nBeginning Balance $ 1,058 $ 880 $ 907 $ 1,855 $ 165 $ 275 $ 5,140\nCharge-offs — — — — (257) — (257)\nRecoveries 13 — — 102 23 — 138\nProvision for (Recovery of)\nLoan Losses (340) 234 250 540 192 (273) 603\nEnding Balance $ 731 $ 1,114 $ 1,157 $ 2,497 $ 123 $ 2 $ 5,624\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nEnding Balance: collectively\nevaluated for impairment $ 731 $ 1,114 $ 1,157 $ 2,428 $ 123 $ 2 $ 5,555\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nEnding Balance: individually\nevaluated for impairment — — — 69 — — 69\nLoan Receivables Ending\nBalance $ 70,261 $ 162,261 $ 175,313 $ 170,031 $ 1,638 $ — $ 579,504\nEnding Balance: collectively\nevaluated for impairment 65,369 161,746 175,313 163,991 1,638 — 568,057\nEnding Balance: individually\nevaluated for impairment 4,892 515 — 6,040 — — 11,447\nThe following is an analysis of the allowance for loan losses based upon the method of evaluating loan impairment for\nthe fiscal year ended March 31, 2021:\nOne-to-four Commercial\n$ in thousands family Multifamily Real Estate Business Consumer Unallocated Total\nAllowance for loan losses:\nBeginning Balance $ 1,055 $ 1,011 $ 812 $ 1,567 $ 212 $ 289 $ 4,946\nCharge-offs — — — (24) (54) — (78)\nRecoveries 88 — — 278 6 — 372\nProvision for (Recovery of)\nLoan Losses (85) (131) 95 34 1 (14) (100)\nEnding Balance $ 1,058 $ 880 $ 907 $ 1,855 $ 165 $ 275 $ 5,140\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nEnding Balance: collectively\nevaluated for impairment $ 1,026 $ 880 $ 907 $ 1,729 $ 165 $ 275 $ 4,982\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nEnding Balance: individually\nevaluated for impairment 32 — — 126 — — 158\nLoan Receivables Ending\nBalance $ 78,213 $ 106,400 $ 148,809 $ 147,680 $ 2,447 $ — $ 483,549\nEnding Balance: collectively\nevaluated for impairment 74,387 106,031 147,891 139,925 2,447 — 470,681\nEnding Balance: individually\nevaluated for impairment 3,826 369 918 7,755 — — 12,868\n73\nThe following is a summary of nonaccrual loans at March 31, 2022 and 2021.\n$ in thousands March 31, 2022 March 31, 2021\nLoans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis:\nGross loans receivable:\nOne-to-four family $ 4,892 $ 3,524\nMultifamily 515 369\nCommercial real estate 4,601 918\nBusiness 1,448 2,290\nConsumer 25 90\nTotal nonaccrual loans $ 11,481 $ 7,191\nNonaccrual loans generally consist of loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued as a result of such\nloans becoming 90 days or more delinquent as to principal and/or interest payments. Interest income on nonaccrual loans is\nrecorded when received based upon the collectability of the loan.

Management determined the specific allowance based on the present value of expected future cash\nflows, discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, except when the remaining source of repayment for the loan is the\noperation or liquidation of the collateral. In those cases, the current fair value of the collateral, less selling costs was used to\ndetermine the specific allowance recorded. When the ultimate collectability of the total principal of an impaired loan is in\ndoubt and the loan is on nonaccrual status, all payments are applied to principal under the cost recovery method. When the\nultimate collectability of the total principal of an impaired loan is not in doubt and the loan is on nonaccrual status, contractual\ninterest is credited to interest income when received under the cash basis method.

Situations around these modifications may include extension of maturity date, reduction in the stated interest rate,\nrescheduling of future cash flows, reduction in the face amount of the debt or reduction of past accrued interest. Loans\nmodified in TDRs are placed on nonaccrual status until the Company determines that future collection of principal and interest\nis reasonably assured, which generally requires that the borrower demonstrate performance according to the restructured terms\nfor a period of at least six months.

The\nCompany has operating leases related to its administrative offices, seven retail branches and four ATM centers. Two of the\noperating leases are for branch locations where the Company had entered into a sale and leaseback transaction. The gain had\nbeen calculated utilizing the profit on sale in excess of the present value of the minimum lease payments, and the profit on the\nsale was deferred from gain recognition to be amortized into income over the terms of the leases in accordance with ASC Topic\n840, Leases (\"ASC 840\").

ADVANCES FROM THE FHLB-NY AND OTHER BORROWED MONEY\nFederal Home Loan Bank Advances. As a member of the FHLB-NY, the Bank may have outstanding FHLB-NY\nborrowings in a combination of term advances and overnight funds of up to 30% of its total assets, or approximately $220.6\nmillion at March 31, 2022. Borrowings are secured by the Bank's investment in FHLB-NY stock and by a blanket security\nagreement. This agreement requires the Bank to maintain as collateral certain qualifying assets (principally mortgage loans and\nsecurities) not otherwise pledged. The Bank had no outstanding advances from the FHLB-NY at March 31, 2022. At\nMarch 31, 2022, the Bank's collateral included its investment in FHLB-NY capital stock totaling $584 thousand, and a blanket\nassignment of pledged qualifying mortgage loans of $58.3 million and mortgage-backed and investment securities with a\nmarket value of $5.9 million. The Bank has sufficient collateral at the FHLB-NY to be able to borrow $50.0 million from the\nFHLB-NY at March 31, 2022.\nSubordinated Debt Securities. On September 17, 2003, Carver Statutory Trust I issued 13,000 shares, liquidation\namount $1,000 per share, of floating rate capital securities. Gross proceeds from the sale of these trust preferred debt securities\n79\nof $13 million, and proceeds from the sale of the trust's common securities of $0.4 million, were used to purchase\napproximately $13.4 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's floating rate junior subordinated debt securities due\n2033. The trust preferred debt securities are redeemable at par quarterly at the option of the Company beginning on or after\nSeptember 17, 2008, and have a mandatory redemption date of September 17, 2033. Cash distributions on the trust preferred\ndebt securities are cumulative and payable at a floating rate per annum resetting quarterly with a margin of 3.05% over the\nthree-month LIBOR. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, the Company applied for and was granted regulatory\napproval to settle all outstanding debenture interest payments through September 2016. Such payments totaling $2.5 million\nwere made in September 2016. Interest on the debentures had been deferred beginning with the December 2016 payment, per\nthe terms of the agreement, which permit such deferral for up to twenty consecutive quarters, as the Company is prohibited\nfrom making payments without prior regulatory approval. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, the Company applied\nfor and was granted regulatory approval to settle all outstanding debenture interest payments through June 2021. Full payment\nwas made on June 16, 2021. The Company has since had discussions with the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia regarding\nfuture quarterly payments. A streamlined process has been developed for the Company to request regulatory approval to make\ndebenture interest payments. All quarterly interest payments subsequent to the June 2021 payment up to and including the June\n2022 payment have been made.\nThe accrued interest payable on subordinated debt securities was $22 thousand and the interest expense was $462\nthousand for the year ended March 31, 2022.

On October 24, 1994, the Bank issued in an initial public offering 2,314,375 shares of\ncommon stock, par value $0.01 (the “Common Stock”), at a price of $10 per share resulting in net proceeds of $21.5\nmillion. As part of the initial public offering, the Bank established a liquidation account at the time of conversion, in an amount\n82\nequal to the surplus and reserves of the Bank at September 30, 1994. In the unlikely event of a complete liquidation of the\nBank (and only in such event), eligible depositors who continue to maintain accounts shall be entitled to receive a distribution\nfrom the liquidation account. The total amount of the liquidation account may be decreased if the balances of eligible deposits\ndecreased as measured on the annual determination dates. The Bank is not permitted to pay dividends to the Company on its\ncapital stock if the effect thereof would cause its net worth to be reduced below either: (i) the amount required for the\nliquidation account, or (ii) the amount required for the Bank to comply with applicable minimum regulatory capital\nrequirements. In 2011 the stockholders approved a 1-for-15 reverse stock split pursuant to which each 15 shares of the\nCompany’s Common Stock would be converted into one share of Common Stock. The 1-for-15 reverse stock split was\neffective as of October 27, 2011, resulting in a reduction in the number of outstanding shares of the Company’s Common Stock\nfrom 2,492,415 to 166,161, an increase of the conversion price of the Series C Preferred Stock and the Series D Preferred Stock\nand the exchange ratio of the Series B Preferred Stock from $0.5451 to $8.1765, and a corresponding decrease in the number of\nshares of Common Stock issued to the Investors and Treasury. During the year ended March 31, 2012, all outstanding shares of\nSeries B Preferred Stock were converted to Common Stock and all outstanding shares of Series C preferred Stock were\nconverted to Series D Preferred Stock. As of March 31, 2022, there were 4,216,815 shares of Company common stock\noutstanding.\nSeries D Preferred Stock ranks senior to the Common Stock. The holders of Series D Preferred Stock are entitled to\nreceive dividends, on an as-converted basis, simultaneously to the payment of any dividends on the Company's common stock.\nDividends on the Series D Preferred Stock are not cumulative. If the Company's board of directors does not declare a dividend\nwith respect to any dividend period, the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock will have no right to receive any dividend for\nthat period. The Company may not declare, pay or set apart for payment any dividend or make any distribution on common\nstock, unless at the time of such dividend or distribution the Company simultaneously pays a non-cumulative dividend or makes\na distribution on each outstanding share of Series D Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis. The holders of Series D\npreferred Stock are generally not entitled to vote, except with respect to amendments to the Company's certificate of\nincorporation that would change the rights and preferences of the Series D Preferred Stock, the creation or increase of any class\nof securities senior to the Series D Preferred Stock, the consummation of certain mergers, consolidations or other transactions\nwhere the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock are not converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving\nentity, and as otherwise required by applicable law.\n.\nThe Series D Preferred Stock shall automatically convert into shares of Common Stock only upon the following\ntransfers to third parties (“Eligible Transfers”):\n• a transfer in a widespread public distribution;\n• a transfer in which no transferee (together with its affiliates and other transferees acting in concert with it) acquires\nmore than 2% of the Company’s common stock or any other class or series of the Company’s voting stock; or\n• a transfer to a transferee that (together with its affiliates and other transferees acting in concert with it) owns or\ncontrols more than 50% of the Company’s common stock, without regard to the transfer.\nThe conversion price of the Series D Preferred Stock is $8.1765, and is subject to adjustment in the event of stock\nsplits, subdivisions or combinations, dividends and distributions, issuance of certain rights, spin-offs, self-tenders and exchange\noffers as set forth under the agreement. The Series D Preferred Stock is not convertible at the option of the holders. As of\nMarch 31, 2022, there were 13,751 shares of Series D Preferred Stock outstanding.\nOn August 6, 2002, the Company announced a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to 15,442 shares of its\noutstanding common stock. As of March 31, 2022, 11,744 shares of its common stock have been repurchased in open market\ntransactions. As a result of the Company's participation in the TARP CDCI, the United States Department of the Treasury's\n(the \"U.S. Treasury\") prior approval was required to make further repurchases. On August 6, 2020, the Company entered into a\nSecurities Purchase Agreement with the U.S. Treasury to repurchase 2,321,286 shares of the common stock of the Company,\npar value $0.01 per share, owned by the U.S. Treasury for an aggregate purchase price of $2.5 million. The stock repurchase\nprovided for in the Securities Purchase Agreement was completed on August 6, 2020. Upon completion of the repurchase\npursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, the U.S. Treasury was no longer a stockholder in the Company. In connection\nwith the repurchase, Morgan Stanley provided a grant of $2.5 million that was considered contributed capital to the Company to\nfund the repurchase transaction.\nIn June 2020, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., an institutional investor, notified the Company of their intention to\neffect a series of transfers of up to all its holdings of Series D Preferred Stock. The conversion and subsequent sale of shares\nwere completed on July 2, 2020: 13,519 Series D Preferred Stock shares were converted into 1,653,397 shares of Common\nStock, which were subsequently sold in the open market. The conversion and sale had no impact on the Company's total\ncapital.\n83\nOn July 9, 2020, the Company received notice that Morgan Stanley International Holdings Inc., an institutional\ninvestor, relinquished its ownership of 180,573 shares of Company common stock and 13,523 shares of Company Preferred\nSeries D Stock to the Company at no cost to the Company.\nOn October 15, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with Banc of America Strategic Investments\nCorporation, under which it issued and sold 147,227 shares of its common stock, par value $0.01, at a price of $6.62 per share.\nThe shares were issued on October 15, 2020, in a private placement exempt from registration under Section 4(2) of the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended, and Regulation D of the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.\nOn January 22, 2021, Prudential Insurance Company of America (\"Prudential\"), an institutional investor, notified the\nCompany of its intention to cancel 475 of its holdings of Series D Preferred Stock and convert them into 58,093 shares of\nCommon Stock. During fiscal year 2022, Prudential donated a total of 3,850 shares of its holdings of Series D Preferred Stock\nto third parties. The third parties notified the Company of their intention to cancel the shares and convert them into 470,855\nshares of Common Stock. The conversions had no impact on the Company's total capital.\nOn February 1, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with Wells Fargo Central Pacific Holdings, Inc., under\nwhich it sold: (i) 157,806 shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at a purchase price of $7.75 per share, and (ii)\n3,177 shares of a new series of preferred stock, Series E non-cumulative non-voting participating preferred stock, par value\n$0.01 per share, at a purchase price of $1,000 per share, in a private placement for gross proceeds of approximately\n$4.4 million.

The operations and profitability of the Bank are significantly affected by legislation and the\npolicies of the various regulatory agencies. In July 2013, the FDIC and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final\nrule that revised their leverage and risk-based capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make\nthem consistent with agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of\nthe Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule, which became effective for the Bank on January 1, 2015, established a minimum Common\nEquity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio, a minimum leverage ratio and increases in the Tier 1 and Total risk-based capital ratios. The rule\nalso limits a banking organization's capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization\ndoes not hold a \"capital conservation buffer\" consisting of 2.5% of CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets in addition to the\namount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement was\nphased in annually beginning January 1, 2016. On January 1, 2019, the full capital conservation buffer requirement of 2.5%\nbecame effective, making its minimum CET1 plus buffer 7%, its minimum Tier 1 capital plus buffer 8.5% and its minimum\ntotal capital plus buffer 10.5%.\nIn accordance with the recently enacted Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, the\nfederal banking agencies have adopted, effective January 1, 2020, a final rule whereby financial institutions and financial\ninstitution holding companies that have less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets and meet other qualifying criteria,\nincluding a leverage ratio of greater than 9%, will be eligible to opt into a “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” framework.\nQualifying community banking organizations that elect to use the community bank leverage ratio framework and that maintain\na leverage ratio of greater than 9% will be considered to have satisfied the generally applicable risk-based and leverage capital\nrequirements in the agencies’ capital rules and will be considered to have met the “well capitalized” ratio requirements under\nthe Prompt Corrective Action statutes. The CARES Act and implementing rules temporarily reduced the Community Bank\nLeverage Ratio to 8%, to be gradually increased back to 9% by 2022. The CARES Act also provides that, during the same time\nperiod, if a qualifying community banking organization falls no more than 1% below the community bank leverage ratio, it will\n85\nhave a two quarter grace period to satisfy the community bank leverage ratio. The agencies reserved the authority to disallow\nthe use of the Community Bank Leverage Ratio by a financial institution or holding company based on the risk profile of the\norganization.\nCarver Federal, as a matter of prudent management, targets as its goal the maintenance of capital ratios which exceed\nthese minimum requirements and that are consistent with Carver Federal's risk profile. In assessing an institution's capital\nadequacy, the OCC takes into consideration not only these numeric factors but also qualitative factors, and has the authority to\nestablish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where necessary. Regardless of Basel III's minimum\nrequirements, Carver, as a result of the previously described Formal Agreement, was issued an Individual Minimum Capital\nRatio (\"IMCR\") letter by the OCC, which requires the Bank to maintain minimum regulatory capital levels of 9% for its Tier 1\nleverage ratio and 12% for its total risk-based capital ratio. At March 31, 2022, the Bank's capital level exceeded the regulatory\nrequirements and its IMCR requirements with a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 10.45%, Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of\n13.75%, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 13.75%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of 14.78%.\nThe table below presents the Bank's regulatory capital ratios at March 31, 2022 and 2021.\nMarch 31, 2022 March 31, 2021\n($ in thousands) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nTier 1 leverage capital\nRegulatory capital $ 76,906 10.45 % $ 66,644 10.01 %\nIndividual minimum capital requirement 66,244 9.00 % 59,946 9.00 %\nMinimum capital requirement 29,442 4.00 % 26,643 4.00 %\nExcess 47,464 6.45 % 40,001 6.01 %\nCommon equity Tier 1\nRegulatory capital $ 76,906 13.75 % $ 66,644 14.41 %\nMinimum capital requirement 39,161 7.00 % 32,383 7.00 %\nExcess 37,745 6.75 % 34,261 7.41 %\nTier 1 risk-based capital\nRegulatory capital $ 76,906 13.75 % $ 66,644 14.41 %\nMinimum capital requirement 47,553 8.50 % 39,323 8.50 %\nExcess 29,353 5.25 % 27,321 5.91 %\nTotal risk-based capital\nRegulatory capital $ 82,672 14.78 % $ 71,989 15.56 %\nIndividual minimum capital requirement 67,134 12.00 % 55,514 12.00 %\nMinimum capital requirement 58,742 10.50 % 48,575 10.50 %\nExcess 23,930 4.28 % 23,414 5.06 %\nNOTE 13.

In September 2006, Carver stockholders approved the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the \"2006\nIncentive Plan\") which provides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock to employees and\ndirectors who are selected to receive awards by the Committee. The 2006 Incentive Plan authorizes Carver to grant awards\nwith respect to 20,000 shares, but no more than 10,000 shares of restricted stock may be granted. Options are granted at a price\nnot less than fair market value of Carver common stock at the time of the grant for a period not to exceed 10 years. Shares\ngenerally vest in 20% increments over 5 years, however, the Committee may specify a different vesting schedule. At March 31,\n2022, there were 3,600 options outstanding under the 2006 Incentive Plan and 3,600 were exercisable. All options are\nexercisable immediately upon a participant's disability, death or a change in control, as defined in the 2006 Incentive Plan, if the\nperson is employed on that date. If the person is terminated (voluntary or involuntarily) from the Bank, all unvested shares are\nforfeited. Pursuant to the plan, the Bank recognized no expense for fiscal 2022 and $1 thousand as expense for fiscal 2021.\nIn September 2014, Carver stockholders approved the Carver Bancorp, Inc. 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the \"2014\nIncentive Plan\") which provides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock to executive\nofficers and directors who are selected to receive awards by the Committee. The 2014 Incentive Plan authorizes Carver to grant\nawards with respect to 250,000 shares. All of the shares may be issued pursuant to stock options (all of which may be incentive\nstock options) or all of which may be issued pursuant to restricted stock awards or restricted stock units. Unless the Committee\ndetermines otherwise, the award agreements will specify that no award will vest more rapidly than 25% per year over a four-\nyear period, with the first installment vesting one year after the date of grant, subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of\nspecific events. During fiscal 2022 no restricted stock awards were issued, in fiscal 2021 31,000 restricted stock awards were\nissued. At March 31, 2022, there were 3,000 options outstanding under the 2014 Incentive Plan and 1,417 were exercisable. All\noptions are exercisable immediately upon a participant's disability, death or change in control, as defined in the 2014 Incentive\nPlan, if the person is employed on that date. If the person is terminated (voluntary or involuntarily) from the Bank, all unvested\nshares are forfeited. Pursuant to the plan, the Bank recognized $101 thousand as expense for fiscal year 2022 and $88 thousand\nin fiscal year 2021.\n87\nInformation regarding nonvested shares of restricted stock awards outstanding for the years ended March 31 is as\nfollows:\n2022 2021\nWeighted Weighted\nAverage Average\nShares Grant Price Shares Grant Price\nOutstanding, beginning of year 72,750 $ 5.00 32,100 $ 3.09\nGranted — — 51,000 5.84\nVested (24,917) 4.73 (10,350) 3.02\nForfeited 9,000 5.11 — —\nOutstanding, end of year 56,833 $ 5.15 72,750 $ 5.00\nUnrecognized compensation expense on unvested restricted shares as of March 31, 2022 totaled $138 thousand.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nCredit Related Commitments. The Bank is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal\ncourse of business to meet the financing needs of its customers and in connection with its overall investment strategy. These\ninstruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. These instruments are not recorded\n88\nin the consolidated financial statements. Such instruments primarily include lending obligations, including commitments to\noriginate mortgage and consumer loans and to fund unused lines of credit.\nThe Bank's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for\ncommitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Bank uses the same credit\npolicies in making commitments as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments.\nThe following table reflects the Bank's outstanding commitments as of March 31:\n$ in thousands 2022 2021\nCommitments to fund mortgage loans $ 12,135 $ 2,179\nCommitments to fund commercial and consumer loans — —\nLines of credit 2,986 1,677\nCommitment to fund private equity investment 253 253\n$ 15,374 $ 4,109\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition\nestablished in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require\npayment of a fee. Since some of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment\namounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Bank evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case-\nby-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon extension of credit, is based on\nmanagement's credit evaluation of the counterparty.\nMortgage Representation & Warranty Liabilities\nDuring the period 2004 through 2009, the Bank originated 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and sold the loans to\nthe Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”). The loans were sold to FNMA with the standard representations and\nwarranties for loans sold to the Government Sponsored Entities (GSE's). The Bank may be required to repurchase these loans\nin the event of breaches of these representations and warranties. In the event of a repurchase, the Bank is typically required to\npay the unpaid principal balance as well as outstanding interest and fees. The Bank then recovers the loan or, if the loan has\nbeen foreclosed, the underlying collateral. The Bank is exposed to any losses on repurchased loans after giving effect to any\nrecoveries on the collateral. The Bank has not received a request to repurchase any of these loans since the second quarter of\nfiscal 2015, and there have not been any additional requests from FNMA for loans to be reviewed.\nThe following table presents information on open requests from FNMA. The amounts presented are based on\noutstanding loan principal balances.\n$ in thousands Loans sold to FNMA\nOpen claims as of March 31, 2021 (1) $ 1,687\nGross new demands received —\nLoans repurchased/made whole —\nDemands rescinded —\nAdvances on open claims —\nPrincipal payments received on open claims (324)\nOpen claims as of March 31, 2022 (1) $ 1,363\n(1)The open claims include all open requests received by the Bank where either FNMA has requested loan files for review, where FNMA has\nnot formally rescinded the repurchase request or where the Bank has not agreed to repurchase the loan. The amounts reflected in this table\nare the unpaid principal balance and do not incorporate any losses the Bank would incur upon the repurchase of these loans.\nThe table below summarizes changes in our representation and warranty reserves during fiscal 2022.\n$ in thousands March 31, 2022\nRepresentation and warranty repurchase reserve, March 31, 2021 (1) $ 181\nNet adjustment to reserve for repurchase losses (2) (58)\nRepresentation and warranty repurchase reserve, March 31, 2022 (1) $ 123\n(1) Reported in consolidated statements of financial condition as a component of other liabilities.\n89\n(2) Component of other non-interest expense.\nThe Bank also has, in the normal course of business, commitments for services and supplies.\nLegal Proceedings. From time to time, the Company and the Bank or one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries are parties\nto various legal proceedings incident to their business. At March 31, 2022, certain claims, suits, complaints and investigations\n(collectively “proceedings”) involving the Company and the Bank or a subsidiary, arising in the ordinary course of business,\nhave been filed or are pending. The Company is unable at this time to determine the ultimate outcome of each proceeding, but\nbelieves, after discussions with legal counsel representing the Company and the Bank or the subsidiary in these proceedings,\nthat it has meritorious defenses to each proceeding and appropriate measures have been taken to defend the interests of the\nCompany, Bank or subsidiary. There were no legal proceedings pending or known to be contemplated against us that in the\nopinion of management, would be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations\nof the Company or the Bank.\nNOTE 16. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nFair value is an “exit” price, representing the amount that would be received when selling an asset, or paid when\ntransferring a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants. Fair value is thus a market-based measurement\nthat should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. Fair value\nmeasurements are categorized in a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as\nfollows:\n• Level 1— Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active\nmarkets.\n• Level 2— Inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active\nmarkets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full\nterm of the financial instrument.\n• Level 3— Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.\nA financial instrument’s categorization within this valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is\nsignificant to the fair value measurement.\nThe following table presents, by valuation hierarchy, assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of\nMarch 31, 2022 and 2021, and that are included in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at these\n90\ndates:\nFair Value Measurements at March 31, 2022, Using\nQuoted Prices in\nActive Markets Significant Other Significant\nfor Identical Observable Unobservable Total Fair\n$ in thousands Assets (Level 1) Inputs (Level 2) Inputs (Level 3) Value\nMortgage servicing rights $ — $ — $ 162 $ 162\nInvestment securities\nAvailable-for-sale:\nMortgage-backed securities:\nGovernment National Mortgage Association — 448 — 448\nFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation — 21,547 — 21,547\nFederal National Mortgage Association — 11,584 — 11,584\nU.S. Government Agency securities — 13,785 — 13,785\nCorporate bonds — 4,121 — 4,121\nMuni securities — 15,768 — 15,768\nAsset-backed securities — 343 — 343\nTotal available-for-sale securities — 67,596 — 67,596\nTotal assets $ — $ 67,596 $ 162 $ 67,758\nFair Value Measurements at March 31, 2021, Using\nQuoted Prices in\nActive Markets Significant Other Significant\nfor Identical Observable Unobservable Total Fair\n$ in thousands Assets (Level 1) Inputs (Level 2) Inputs (Level 3) Value\nMortgage servicing rights $ — $ — $ 147 $ 147\nInvestment securities\nAvailable-for-sale:\nMortgage-backed securities:\nGovernment National Mortgage Association — 1,026 — 1,026\nFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation — 27,785 — 27,785\nFederal National Mortgage Association — 14,610 — 14,610\nU.S. Government Agency securities — 18,631 — 18,631\nCorporate bonds — 4,481 — 4,481\nMuni securities — 16,610 — 16,610\nAsset-backed securities — 3,364 — 3,364\nTotal available-for-sale securities — 86,507 — 86,507\nTotal assets $ — $ 86,507 $ 147 $ 86,654\nInstruments for which unobservable inputs are significant to their fair value measurement (i.e., Level 3) include\nmortgage servicing rights (\"MSR\"). Level 3 assets accounted for 0.02% of the Company's total assets measured at fair value at\nMarch 31, 2022 and 2021.\nThe Company reviews and updates the fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Changes from one\nquarter to the next that are related to the observable inputs to a fair value measurement may result in a reclassification from one\nhierarchy level to another.\nBelow is a description of the methods and significant assumptions utilized in estimating the fair value of available-for-\nsale securities and MSR:\nWhere quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation\nhierarchy.\nIf quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing\nmodels, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flows. These pricing models primarily use\nmarket-based or independently sourced market parameters as inputs, including, but not limited to, yield curves, interest rates,\n91\nequity or debt prices, and credit spreads. In addition to market information, models also incorporate transaction details, such as\nmaturity and cash flow assumptions. Securities valued in this manner would generally be classified within Level 2 of the\nvaluation hierarchy and primarily include such instruments as mortgage-related securities and corporate debt.\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, there were no transfers of investments into or out of each level of the fair\nvalue hierarchy.\nIn certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to the valuation, securities are\nclassified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. In valuing certain securities, the determination of fair value may require\nbenchmarking to similar instruments or analyzing default and recovery rates. Quoted price information for the MSRs is not\navailable. Therefore, MSRs are valued using market-standard models to model the specific cash flow structure. Key inputs to\nthe model consist of principal balance of loans being serviced, servicing fees and discount and prepayment rates.\nThe methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value\nor reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and\nconsistent with those of other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value\nof certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\nThe following table includes a rollforward of assets classified by the Company within Level 3 of the valuation\nhierarchy for the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021:\nTotal Realized/ Change in\nUnrealized Unrealized Gains/\nBeginning Gains/(Losses) Transfers Ending (Losses) Related to\nbalance, Recorded in Issuances / to/(from) balance, Instruments Held at\n$ in thousands April 1, 2021 Income (1) (Settlements) Level 3 March 31, 2022 March 31, 2022\nMortgage Servicing Rights 147 15 — — 162 15\nTotal Realized/ Change in\nUnrealized Unrealized Gains/\nBeginning Gains/(Losses) Transfers Ending (Losses) Related to\nbalance, Recorded in Issuances / to/(from) balance, Instruments Held at\n$ in thousands April 1, 2020 Income (1) (Settlements) Level 3 March 31, 2021 March 31, 2021\nMortgage Servicing Rights 145 2 — — 147 2\n(1) Includes net servicing cash flows and the passage of time.\nFor Level 3 assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2022 and 2021, the significant\nunobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements were as follows:\nSignificant\nFair Value at Unobservable\n$ in thousands March 31, 2022 Valuation Technique Significant Unobservable Inputs Input Value\nMortgage Servicing Rights 162 Discounted Cash Flow Weighted Average Constant Prepayment Rate (1) 6.70 %\nOption Adjusted Spread (\"OAS\") applied to 1000 basis\nTreasury curve points\nSignificant\nFair Value at Unobservable\n$ in thousands March 31, 2021 Valuation Technique Significant Unobservable Inputs Input Value\nMortgage Servicing Rights 147 Discounted Cash Flow Weighted Average Constant Prepayment Rate (1) 13.33 %\nOption Adjusted Spread (\"OAS\") applied to 1200 basis\nTreasury curve points\n(1) Represents annualized loan repayment rate assumptions\nCertain assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.

These assets are recorded at the lower of their cost or fair value.\nAt the time of acquisition of the real estate owned, the real property value is adjusted to its current fair value. Any subsequent\nadjustments will be to the lower of cost or fair value.\nNOTE 17. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nDisclosures regarding the fair value of financial instruments are required to include, in addition to the carrying value,\nthe fair value of certain financial instruments, both assets and liabilities recorded on and off-balance sheet, for which it is\npracticable to estimate fair value. Accounting guidance defines financial instruments as cash, evidence of ownership of an\nentity, or a contract that conveys or imposes on an entity the contractual right or obligation to either receive or deliver cash or\nanother financial instrument. The fair value of a financial instrument is discussed below. In cases where quoted market prices\nare not available, estimated fair values have been determined by the Bank using the best available data and estimation\nmethodology suitable for each such category of financial instruments. For those loans and deposits with floating interest rates,\nit is presumed that estimated fair values generally approximate their recorded carrying value. The Bank's primary component\nof market risk is interest rate volatility. Fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact the Bank's fair value of all interest-\nearning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, other than those which are short-term in maturity.\nThe carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Bank's financial instruments and estimation methodologies at\nMarch 31 are as follows:\n93\nMarch 31, 2022\nQuoted\nPrices in\nActive Significant\nMarkets for Other Significant\nIdentical Observable Unobservable\nCarrying Estimated Assets Inputs Inputs\n$ in thousands Amount Fair Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nFinancial Assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 61,018 $ 61,018 $ 61,018 $ — $ —\nSecurities available-for-sale 67,596 67,596 — 67,596 —\nSecurities held-to-maturity 5,254 5,276 — 5,276 —\nLoans receivable 573,880 563,821 — — 563,821\nAccrued interest receivable 2,414 2,414 — 2,414 —\nMortgage servicing rights 162 162 — — 162\nFinancial Liabilities:\nDeposits $ 628,117 $ 624,160 $ 485,884 $ 138,276 $ —\nOther borrowed money 15,906 15,673 — 15,673 —\nAccrued interest payable 91 91 — 91 —\nMarch 31, 2021\nQuoted\nPrices in\nActive Significant\nMarkets for Other Significant\nIdentical Observable Unobservable\nCarrying Estimated Assets Inputs Inputs\n$ in thousands Amount Fair Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nFinancial Assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 75,591 $ 75,591 $ 75,591 $ — $ —\nSecurities available-for-sale 86,507 86,507 — 86,507 —\nSecurities held-to-maturity 7,807 8,140 — 8,140 —\nLoans receivable 478,409 487,806 — — 487,806\nAccrued interest receivable 2,640 2,640 — 2,640 —\nMortgage servicing rights 147 147 — — 147\nFinancial Liabilities:\nDeposits $ 556,559 $ 557,049 $ 402,843 $ 154,206 $ —\nOther borrowed money 37,108 37,150 — 37,150 —\nAccrued interest payable 3,212 3,212 — 3,212 —\nNOTE 18. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES\nThe Company's subsidiary, Carver Statutory Trust I, is not consolidated with Carver Bancorp, Inc. for financial\nreporting purposes. Carver Statutory Trust I was formed in 2003 for the purpose of issuing $13 million aggregate liquidation\namount of floating rate Capital Securities due September 17, 2033 (“Capital Securities”) and $0.4 million of common securities\n(which are the only voting securities of Carver Statutory Trust I), which are 100% owned by Carver Bancorp, Inc., and using\nthe proceeds to acquire Junior Subordinated Debentures issued by Carver Bancorp, Inc. Carver Bancorp, Inc. has fully and\nunconditionally guaranteed the Capital Securities along with all obligations of Carver Statutory Trust I under the trust\nagreement relating to the Capital Securities.\nThe Bank's subsidiary, Carver Community Development Corporation (“CCDC”), was formed to facilitate its\nparticipation in local economic development and other community-based initiatives. Per the NMTC Award's Allocation\nAgreement between the CDFI Fund and CCDC, CCDC is permitted to form and sub-allocate credits to subsidiary Community\nDevelopment Entities (“CDEs”) to facilitate investments in separate development projects. In June 2006, CCDC received a\nNMTC award of $59 million. CCDC received a second NMTC award of $65 million in May 2009, and a third award of\n$25 million in August 2011. The NMTC compliance period was completed for all these entities, and subsidiary CDEs 2-21\nhave been dissolved. CCDC established various special purpose entities (CDEs 22-25) through which its investments in NMTC\neligible activities will be conducted. As of March 31, 2022, there have been no activities in these entities.\n94\nThe variable interest entities (“VIEs”) are consolidated, as required, where Carver has controlling financial interest in\nthese entities and is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Carver is normally deemed to have a controlling financial interest\nand be the primary beneficiary if it has both of the following characteristics:\n(a) the power to direct activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entities economic performance; and\n(b) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could benefit from the activities that could potentially be\nsignificant to the VIE.\nAs none of the Bank's VIEs meet the above criteria, there are no consolidated VIEs at March 31, 2022.\nThe Bank's unconsolidated VIEs, in which the Company holds significant variable interests or has continuing\ninvolvement through servicing a majority of assets in a VIE at March 31, 2022 are presented below:\nInvolvement with SPE (000's) Funded Exposure Unfunded Exposure Total\nTotal\nRecognized Total Significant Involvement Maximum\nGain (Loss) Rights unconsolidated with SPE Debt Equity Funding exposure to\n(000's) transferred VIE assets asset Investments Investments Commitments loss\nCarver\nStatutory\nTrust 1(1) $ — $ — $ 13,403 $ 13,403 $ 13,022 $ 403 $ — $ — $ 13,425\n1 Carver Statutory Trust debt investment includes deferred interest of $22 thousand.\nNOTE 19. NON-INTEREST REVENUE AND EXPENSE\nASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"Topic 606\") does not apply to revenue associated with\nfinancial instruments, including revenue from loans and securities. In addition, certain non-interest income streams such as\ngains on sales of residential mortgage and SBA loans, income associated with servicing assets, and loan fees, including\nresidential mortgage originations to be sold and prepayment and late fees charged across all loan categories are also not in\nscope of the new guidance. Topic 606 is applicable to non-interest revenue streams, such as depository fees, service charges\nand commission revenues. However, the recognition of these revenue streams did not change significantly upon adoption of\nTopic 606. Non-interest revenue streams in-scope of Topic 606 are discussed below.\nDepository fees and charges\nDepository fees and charges primarily relate to service fees on deposit accounts and fees earned from debit cards and\ncheck cashing transactions. Service fees on deposit accounts consist of ATM fees, NSF fees, account maintenance charges and\nother deposit related fees. The revenue is recognized monthly when the Bank's performance obligations are complete, or as\nincurred for transaction-based fees in accordance with the fee schedules for the Bank's deposit products and services.\nLoan fees and service charges\nLoan fees and service charges primarily relate to program management fees and fees earned in accordance with the\nBank's standard lending fees (such as inspection and late charges).

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND\nFINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.\nNone.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\n(a) Evaluation of Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures are the controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information\nrequired to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,\nsummarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures\ninclude, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports\nthat the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the\nChief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nThe Company maintains controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the\nreports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the\ntime periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. As of March 31, 2022, the\nCompany's management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial\nOfficer (Principal Accounting Officer), has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as\ndefined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). In\ndesigning and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no\nmatter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In\naddition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must necessarily reflect the fact that there are resource constraints\nand that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to\ntheir costs.\nBased on the foregoing evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2022.\n(b) Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting. The Company's system of internal control is designed under the supervision of management, including the\nCompany's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of the Company's financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with\nU.S. GAAP. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide\nreasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance\nwith GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are made only in accordance with the authorization of management and the\nBoards of Directors of the Company and the Bank; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection\nof unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the Company's\nfinancial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may\nbecome inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may\ndeteriorate.\nThe management of Carver Bancorp, Inc., with participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial\nOfficer, assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2022. In making\nthis assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\n(COSO) in the Internal Control -- Integrated Framework (2013). Based on the assessment under COSO, management\ndetermined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2022.\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company's independent registered public accounting\nfirm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the Company's\nregistered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management’s report\nin this annual report.\n99\n(c) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have not been any changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal year\nended March 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting.\nITEM 9B.

These factors include but are not limited to the following:\n• the effects of COVID-19, which includes, but is not limited to, the length of time that the pandemic continues, the duration of restrictive orders and the potential imposition of restrictions on businesses and travel in the future, the remedial actions and stimulus measures adopted by\nfederal, state, and local governments, the health of our employees and the inability of employees to work due to illness, quarantine, or government mandates, the business continuity plans of our customers and our vendors, the increased likelihood of cybersecurity risk, data breaches,\nor fraud due to employees working from home, the ability of our borrowers to continue to repay their loan obligations, and the effect of the pandemic on the general economy and the business of our borrowers;\n• the ability of Carver Federal Savings Bank to comply with the Formal Agreement (“Agreement”) between the Bank and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the effect of the restrictions and requirements of the Formal Agreement on the Bank's non-interest expenses and\nnet income;\n• the ability of the Company to obtain approval from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia (the “Federal Reserve Bank”) to distribute all future interest payments owed to the holders of the Company's subordinated debt securities;\n• the limitations imposed on the Company by board resolutions which require, among other things, written approval of the Federal Reserve Bank prior to the declaration or payment of dividends, any increase in debt by the Company, or the redemption of Company common stock, and\nthe effect on operations resulting from such limitations;\n• the results of examinations by our regulators, including the possibility that our regulators may, among other things, require us to increase our reserve for loan losses, write down assets, change our regulatory capital position, limit our ability to borrow funds or maintain or increase\ndeposits, or prohibit us from paying dividends, which could adversely affect our dividends and earnings;\n• national and/or local changes in economic conditions, which could occur from numerous causes, including political changes, domestic and international policy changes, unrest, war and weather, or conditions in the real estate, securities markets or the banking industry, which could\naffect liquidity in the capital markets, the volume of loan originations, deposit flows, real estate values, the levels of non-interest income and the amount of loan losses;\n• adverse changes in the financial industry and the securities, credit, national and local real estate markets (including real estate value);\n• changes in our existing loan portfolio composition (including reduction in commercial real estate loan concentration) and credit quality or changes in loan loss requirements;\n• changes in the level of trends of delinquencies and write-offs and in our allowance and provision for loan losses;\n• legislative or regulatory changes that may adversely affect the Company’s business, including but not limited to new capital regulations, which could result in, among other things, increased deposit insurance premiums and assessments, capital requirements, regulatory fees and\ncompliance costs, and the resources we have available to address such changes;\n• changes in the level of government support of housing finance;\n• changes to state rent control laws, which may impact the credit quality of multifamily housing loans;\n• our ability to control costs and expenses;\n• risks related to a high concentration of loans to borrowers secured by property located in our market area;\n1\n• changes in interest rates, which may reduce net interest margin and net interest income;\n• increases in competitive pressure among financial institutions or non-financial institutions;\n• changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits;\n• technological changes that may be more difficult to implement or more costly than anticipated;\n• changes in deposit flows, loan demand, real estate values, borrowing facilities, capital markets and investment opportunities, which may adversely affect our business;\n• changes in accounting standards, policies and practices, as may be adopted or established by the regulatory agencies or the Financial Accounting Standards Board, could negatively impact the Company’s financial results;\n• litigation or regulatory actions, whether currently existing or commencing in the future, which may restrict our operations or strategic business plan;\n• the ability to originate and purchase loans with attractive terms and acceptable credit quality; and\n• the ability to attract and retain key members of management, and to address staffing needs in response to product demand or to implement business initiatives.\nBecause forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, actual results or future events could differ possibly materially from those that the company anticipated in its forward-looking statements.

BUSINESS.\nOVERVIEW\nCarver Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), is the holding company for Carver Federal Savings Bank (“Carver Federal” or the “Bank”), a federally chartered savings bank. The Company is headquartered in New York, New York. The Company conducts business\nas a unitary savings and loan holding company, and the principal business of the Company consists of the operation of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Carver Federal. Carver Federal was founded in 1948 to serve African-American communities whose residents, businesses and institutions had\nlimited access to mainstream financial services. The Bank remains headquartered in Harlem, and predominantly all of its seven branches and four stand-alone 24/7 ATM centers are located in low- to moderate-income neighborhoods. Many of these historically underserved communities have\nexperienced unprecedented growth and diversification of incomes, ethnicity and economic opportunity, after decades of public and private investment.\nCarver Federal is among the largest African-American operated banks in the United States. The Bank remains dedicated to expanding wealth-enhancing opportunities in the communities it serves by increasing access to capital and other financial services for consumers, businesses\nand non-profit organizations, including faith-based institutions. A measure of its progress in achieving this goal includes the Bank's fifth consecutive \"Outstanding\" rating, issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the \"OCC\") following its most recent Community\nReinvestment Act (“CRA”) examination in January 2019. The OCC found that a substantial majority of originated and purchased loans were within Carver Federal's assessment area, and the Bank has demonstrated excellent responsiveness to its assessment area's needs through its\ncommunity development lending, investing and service activities. The Bank had approximately $676.7 million in assets and 104 employees as of March 31, 2021.\nCarver Federal engages in a wide range of consumer and commercial banking services. The Bank provides deposit products, including demand, savings and time deposits for consumers, businesses, and governmental and quasi-governmental agencies in its local market area within\nNew York City. In addition to deposit products, Carver Federal offers a number of other consumer and commercial banking products and services, including debit cards, online account opening and banking, online bill pay and telephone banking. Carver Federal also offers a suite of products\nand services for unbanked and underbanked consumers, branded as Carver Community Cash. This includes check cashing, wire transfers, bill payment, reloadable prepaid cards and money orders.\nCarver Federal offers loan products covering a variety of asset classes, including commercial and multifamily mortgages, and business loans. The Bank finances mortgage and loan products through deposits or borrowings. Funds not used to originate mortgages and loans are\ninvested primarily in U.S. government agency securities and mortgage-backed securities.\nThe Bank's primary market area for deposits consists of the areas served by its seven branches in the Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens boroughs of New York City. The neighborhoods in which the Bank's branches are located have historically been low- to moderate-income areas.\nThe Bank's primary lending market includes Kings, New York, Bronx and Queens Counties in New York City, and lower Westchester County, New York. Although the Bank's branches are primarily located in areas that were historically underserved by other financial institutions, the Bank\nfaces significant competition for deposits and mortgage lending in its market areas. Management believes that this competition has become more intense as a result of increased examination emphasis by federal banking regulators on financial institutions' fulfillment of their responsibilities\nunder the CRA and more recently due to the decline in demand for loans. Carver Federal's market area has a high density of financial institutions, many of which have greater financial resources, name recognition and market presence, and all of which are competitors to varying degrees. The\nBank's competition for loans comes principally from commercial banks, savings institutions and mortgage banking companies. The Bank's most direct competition for deposits comes from commercial banks, savings institutions and credit unions. Competition for deposits also comes from\nmoney market mutual funds, corporate and government securities funds, and financial intermediaries such as brokerage firms and insurance companies. Many of the Bank's competitors have substantially greater resources and offer a wider array of financial services and products. This,\ncombined with competitors' larger presence in the New York market, add to the challenges the Bank faces in expanding its current market share and growing its near-term profitability.\nCarver Federal's 70-year history in its market area, its community involvement and relationships, targeted products and services and personal service consistent with community banking, help the Bank compete with competitors that have entered its market.\n3\nThe Bank formalized its many community focused investments on August 18, 2005, by forming Carver Community Development Corporation (\"CCDC\"). CCDC oversees the Bank's participation in local economic development and other community-based initiatives, including\nfinancial literacy activities. CCDC coordinates the Bank's development of an innovative approach to reach the unbanked customer market in Carver Federal's communities. Importantly, CCDC spearheads the Bank's applications for grants and other resources to help fund these important\ncommunity activities. In this connection, Carver Federal has successfully competed with large regional and global financial institutions in a number of competitions for government grants and other awards. In June 2006, CCDC was selected by the U.S. Department of Treasury, in a highly\ncompetitive process, to receive an award of $59 million in New Markets Tax Credits (\"NMTC\"). CCDC won a second NMTC award of $65 million in May 2009, and a third award of $25 million in August 2011. The NMTC award is used to stimulate economic development in low- to\nmoderate-income communities. The NMTC awards enable the Bank to invest with community and development partners in economic development projects with attractive terms including, in some cases, below market interest rates, which may have the effect of attracting capital to\nunderserved communities and facilitating revitalization of the community, pursuant to the goals of the NMTC program. NMTC awards provide a credit to Carver Federal against Federal income taxes when the Bank makes qualified investments. The credits are allocated over seven years\nfrom the time of the qualified investment. Alternatively, the Bank can utilize the award in projects where another investor entity provides funding and receives the tax benefits of the award in exchange for the Bank receiving fee income. As of March 31, 2021, all three award allocations have\nbeen fully utilized in qualifying projects. See \"Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and footnotes to the financial statements for additional details on the NMTC activities.\nGENERAL\nCarver Bancorp, Inc.\nThe Company is the holding company for Carver Federal and its other active direct subsidiary, Carver Statutory Trust I (the “Trust”), a Delaware trust.\nThe principal business of the Company consists of the operation of its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank. The Company's administrative offices are located at 1825 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10034. The home office of the Bank is located at 75 West 125th Street, New York, New\nYork 10027. The Company's telephone number is (718) 230-2900.\nCarver Federal Savings Bank\nCarver Federal was chartered in 1948 and began operations in 1949 as Carver Federal Savings and Loan Association, a federally chartered mutual savings and loan association, at which time it obtained federal deposit insurance and became a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank\nof New York (the “FHLB-NY”). Carver Federal was founded as an African- and Caribbean-American operated institution to provide residents of underserved communities the ability to invest their savings and obtain credit. Carver Federal Savings and Loan Association converted to a federal\nsavings bank in 1986 and changed its name at that time to Carver Federal Savings Bank.\nOn March 8, 1995, Carver Federal formed CFSB Realty Corp. as a wholly-owned subsidiary to hold real estate acquired through foreclosure pending eventual disposition. At March 31, 2021, this subsidiary had $267 thousand in total assets. During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year\nended March 31, 2003, Carver Federal formed Carver Asset Corporation (“CAC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary which qualifies as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. This subsidiary may, among other things, be utilized by Carver\nFederal to raise capital in the future. As of March 31, 2021, CAC owned mortgage loans carried at approximately $7.4 million and total assets of $129.2 million. On August 18, 2005, Carver Federal formed CCDC, a wholly-owned community development entity, to facilitate and develop\ninnovative approaches to financial literacy, address the needs of the unbanked and participate in local economic development and other community-based activities. As part of its operations, CCDC monitors the portfolio of investments related to NMTC awards and makes application for\nadditional awards.\nCarver Statutory Trust I\nCarver Statutory Trust (the \"Trust\") was formed in 2003 for the purpose of issuing $13.0 million aggregate liquidation amount of floating rate Capital Securities due September 17, 2033 (“Capital Securities”) and $0.4 million of common securities, which are wholly owned by Carver\nBancorp, Inc. and the sole voting securities of the Trust. The Company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the Capital Securities along with all obligations of the Trust under the trust agreement relating to the Capital Securities. The Trust is not consolidated with the Company for\nfinancial reporting purposes in accordance with the\n4\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 810 regarding the consolidation of variable interest entities. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, the Company applied for and was granted regulatory approval to settle all outstanding debenture\ninterest payments on the Carver Statutory Trust I capital securities through September 2016. Such payments were made in September 2016. Debenture interest payments had been deferred beginning with the December 2016 payment, which was permissible under the terms of the Indenture for\nup to twenty consecutive quarters, as the Company was prohibited from making payments without prior approval from the Federal Reserve Bank. The total amount of deferred interest was $3.1 million at March 31, 2021, which was subsequently paid on June 16, 2021.\nThe Company relies primarily on dividends from Carver Federal to pay cash dividends to its stockholders, to engage in share repurchase programs and to pay principal and interest on its trust preferred debt obligation. The OCC regulates all capital distributions, including dividend\npayments, by Carver Federal to the Company, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (the \"FRB\") regulates dividends paid by the Company. As the subsidiary of a savings and loan association holding company, Carver Federal must file a notice or an application (depending on the\nproposed dividend amount) with the OCC (and a notice with the FRB) prior to the declaration of each capital distribution. The OCC will disallow any proposed dividend, for among other reasons, that would result in Carver Federal’s failure to meet the OCC minimum capital requirements. In\naccordance with the Agreement, Carver Federal is currently prohibited from paying any dividends without prior OCC approval, and, as such, has suspended its regular quarterly cash dividend to the Company. There are no assurances that dividend payments to the Company will resume.\nHuman Capital Resources\nAt March 31, 2021, the Company had 104 employees, nearly all of whom are full-time and of which approximately 62.5% were female and 81.7% were minorities. The majority of our employees are based in New York. Our goal is to attract, develop, retain and plan for succession of key\ntalent and executives to achieve strategic objectives. We are continually investing in our workforce to further emphasize diversity and inclusion and to foster our employees' growth and career development.\nWe offer a comprehensive benefits program to our employees and design our compensation programs to attract, retain and motivate employees, as well as to align with Company performance. None of the Company's employees are a member of a collective bargaining agreement and\nwe consider our relations with our employees to be good.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant operating environmental changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with health and safety standards as required by\nfederal, state and local government agencies, taking into consideration guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health authorities. This includes having the vast majority of our employees work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for\nemployees continuing critical on-site work.\nThe Company team members actively share their talents in their communities through volunteer activities in education, economic development, human and health services, and Community Reinvestment. Additionally, the Company's management team works with leaders of\ncommunity organizations, community development organizations, and consumer financial educations organizations to identify the credit, investment, and service needs of its community.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company makes available on or through its internet website, http://www.carverbank.com, its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Information provided on the Company's website is not part of this annual report.\n5\nLending Activities\nGeneral. Carver Federal's loan portfolio consists primarily of mortgage and business loans originated by the Bank's lending teams and secured by commercial real estate including multifamily, mixed-use and owner-occupied properties. Substantially all of the Bank's mortgage loans\nare secured by properties located within the Bank's market area. From time to time, the Bank may participate or purchase loans that comply with the Bank's underwriting standards from other financial institutions or in contiguous market geographies to achieve loan growth objectives, as well as\nasset and geographical diversification.\nIn recent years, Carver Federal had focused on the origination of commercial real estate loans extended primarily to multifamily, as well as owner-occupied and mixed-use commercial loans. These loans generally have higher yields and shorter maturities than one-to-four family\nresidential properties, and include prepayment penalties that the Bank collects if the loans pay in full prior to the contractual maturity. The Bank's increased emphasis remains on effective portfolio management and monitoring of the commercial real estate and multifamily residential mortgage\nloans given the increase of the overall level of credit risk inherent in this market segment. The greater risk associated with commercial real estate, particularly multifamily residential loans, as well as the growth in this type of loan, had required the Bank to increase its provisions for loan losses\nin fiscal years 2016 to 2018. In fiscal years 2019 and 2020, the Bank's recoveries on previously charged off loans exceeded its chargeoffs to such an extent that additional provisions were not necessary. The provision recorded in fiscal year 2020 was primarily related to overdraft deposit\ncharge-offs. During fiscal year 2021, we increased our qualitative factors due to the ongoing pandemic. These increases in reserves were offset by decreases in our quantitative reserve analysis as the rolling 20 quarter historical loss look back period has improved for most of our loan\ncategories. The Bank could be required to maintain an allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans in excess of the allowance currently maintained. Carver Federal continually reviews the composition of its mortgage loan portfolio and underwriting standards to manage the risk in\nthe portfolio. Per the requirements of the Formal Agreement, the Bank has reduced its commercial real estate loan concentration as a percentage of risk-based capital to a level well below that mandated by its regulators.\nLoan Portfolio Composition. Total loans receivable increased $55.3 million, or 13.0%, to $480.5 million at March 31, 2021, compared to $425.2 million at March 31, 2020. Carver Federal's total loans receivable as a percentage of total assets decreased to 71.0% at March 31, 2021, compared\nto 73.5% at March 31, 2020.\nThe following is a summary of loans receivable, net of allowance for loan losses, as of:\nMarch 31, 2021 March 31, 2020 March 31, 2019 March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017\n$ in thousands Amount % Amount % Amount % Amount % Amount %\nGross loans receivable:\nOne-to-four family $ 76,313 15.9 % $ 105,532 24.8 % $ 108,363 25.4 % $ 121,233 25.6 % $ 132,679 24.5 %\nMultifamily 103,584 21.6 % 89,241 21.0 86,177 20.2 103,887 21.9 87,824 16.2\nCommercial real estate 149,472 31.1 % 141,761 33.3 130,812 30.7 141,835 29.9 241,794 44.7\nConstruction — — % — — — — — — 4,983 0.9\nBusiness 148,662 30.9 % 85,425 20.1 96,430 22.6 102,004 21.5 65,151 12.0\nConsumer and other (1) 2,439 0.5 % 3,213 0.8 4,023 0.9 5,238 1.1 8,994 1.7\nTotal loans receivable $ 480,470 100.0 % $ 425,172 100.0 % $ 425,805 100.0 % $ 474,197 100.0 % $ 541,425 100.0 %\nUnamortized premiums, deferred costs and fees, net 3,079 3,560 3,023 3,556 4,127\nAllowance for loan losses (5,140) (4,946) (4,646) (5,126) (5,060)\nTotal loans receivable, net $ 478,409 $ 423,786 $ 424,182 $ 472,627 $ 540,492\n(1)Includes personal loans\nOne-to-four Family Residential Lending. Carver Federal purchases first mortgage loans secured by one-to-four family properties that serve as the primary residence of the owner. The Bank purchased $2.8 million and $15.2 million of one-to-four family residential loans during fiscal\nyears 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Bank did not purchase any one-to-four family loans during fiscal years 2019 and 2018. In fiscal 2017, the Bank purchased $13.9 million of one-to-four family loans. Approximately 23.0% of the one-to-four family residential mortgage loans maturing in\ngreater than one year at March 31, 2021 were adjustable rate and approximately 77.0% were fixed-rate. One-to-four family residential real estate loans decreased $29.2 million, or 27.7%, to $76.3 million at March 31, 2021, compared to $105.5 million at March 31, 2020.\n6\nCarver Federal's fixed-rate, one-to-four family residential mortgage loans are underwritten in accordance with applicable secondary market underwriting guidelines and requirements for sale. From time to time, the Bank has sold such loans to Fannie Mae, the State of New York\nMortgage Agency (“SONYMA”) and other third parties. Loans are generally sold with limited recourse on a servicing retained basis except to SONYMA where the sale is made with servicing released. Carver Federal uses a servicing firm to sub-service mortgage loans, whether held in\nportfolio or sold with servicing retained. At March 31, 2021, the Bank, through its sub-servicer, serviced $16.4 million in loans for FNMA and $389 thousand for other third parties. The Bank has recorded $147 thousand in related mortgage servicing rights.\nThe retention of adjustable-rate loans in Carver Federal's portfolio helps reduce Carver Federal's exposure to increases in prevailing market interest rates. However, there are credit risks resulting from potential increases in costs to borrowers in the event of upward repricing of\nadjustable-rate loans. It is possible that during periods of rising interest rates, the risk of default on adjustable-rate loans may increase due to increases in interest costs to borrowers. Although adjustable-rate loans allow the Bank to increase the sensitivity of its interest-earning assets to changes\nin interest rates, the extent of this interest rate sensitivity is limited by periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustment limitations. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that yields on the Bank's adjustable-rate loans will fully adjust to compensate for increases in the Bank's cost of funds.\nAdjustable-rate loans increase the Bank's exposure to decreases in prevailing market interest rates, although decreases in the Bank's cost of funds would tend to offset this effect to an extent.\nThe Bank previously originated or purchased a limited amount of subprime loans (which are defined by the Bank as those loans where the borrowers have FICO scores of 660 or less at origination). At March 31, 2021, the Bank had $3.7 million in subprime loans, or 0.8% of its total\nloan portfolio, of which $1.1 million are non-performing loans. No subprime loans were purchased during fiscal 2021.\nMultifamily Real Estate Lending. Traditionally, Carver Federal originates and purchases multifamily loans. The Bank purchased $6.9 million and $7.0 million of multifamily loans during fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Multifamily property lending entails additional risks\ncompared to one-to-four family residential lending. For example, such loans are dependent on the successful operation of such buildings and can be significantly impacted by supply and demand conditions in the market for multifamily residential units. Carver Federal's multifamily real estate\nloan portfolio increased $14.4 million, or 16.1%, to $103.6 million in fiscal 2021, or 21.6% of Carver Federal's total loan portfolio at March 31, 2021.\nIn making multifamily real estate loans, the Bank primarily considers the property's ability to generate net operating income sufficient to support the debt service, the financial resources, income level and managerial expertise of the borrower, the marketability of the property and the\nBank's lending experience with the borrower. Carver Federal's multifamily real estate product guidelines generally require that the maximum loan-to-value (\"LTV\") at origination not exceed 75% based on the appraised value of the mortgaged property on all such loans. The Bank generally\nrequires a debt service coverage ratio at origination of at least 1.20 on multifamily real estate loans, which requires the properties to generate cash flow after expenses and allowances in excess of the principal and interest payment. Carver Federal originates and purchases multifamily real estate\nloans, which are predominantly adjustable rate loans that generally amortize on the basis of a 15-, 20-, 25-, or 30-year period and require a balloon payment after the first five years, or the borrower may have an option to extend the loan for additional periods. The Bank occasionally originates\nfixed rate loans with greater than five year terms. Personal guarantees may be obtained for additional security from these borrowers.\nTo help ensure continued collateral protection and asset quality for the term of multifamily real estate loans, Carver Federal employs a risk rating system for its loans. All commercial loans, including multifamily real estate loans, are risk rated internally at the time of origination.\nManagement continually monitors all commercial loans in order to update risk ratings when necessary (see \"Asset Classification and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\" for additional information on asset classification and risk ratings). In addition, to assist the Bank in evaluating changes\nin the credit profile of the borrower and the underlying collateral, an independent consulting firm reviews and prepares a written report for a sample of our commercial loan relationships. On a triannual basis, an independent loan review company i) reviews 70% to 75% of the average\ncommercial loan portfolio, ii) this includes all new and renewed loans greater than $100,000, and iii) all criticized and classified loans. Summary reports documenting the loan reviews are then reviewed by management for changes in the credit profile of individual borrowers and the portfolio\nas a whole.\nCommercial Real Estate Lending. Commercial real estate lending consists predominantly of originating loans for the purpose of purchasing or refinancing office, mixed-use (properties used for both commercial and residential purposes but predominantly commercial), retail and\nchurch buildings in the Bank's market area. Mixed-use loans are secured by properties that are intended for both residential and business use and are classified as commercial real estate (\"CRE\"). The Bank purchased $6.3 million and $12.6 million of commercial real estate loans during fiscal\nyears 2021 and 2020, respectively. Although Carver Federal has experienced favorable loss history associated with commercial real estate loans, these loans may\n7\nentail additional risks compared with one-to-four family residential and multifamily lending. For example, such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers and the payment experience on such loans typically is dependent on the successful\noperation of the commercial property.\nIn originating CRE loans, the Bank primarily considers the ability of the net operating income generated by the real estate to support the debt service, the financial resources, income level and managerial expertise of the borrower, the marketability of the property and the Bank's\nlending experience with the borrower. Carver Federal's maximum LTV ratio on commercial real estate mortgage loans at origination is generally 75% based on the latest appraised value of the mortgaged property. The Bank generally requires a debt service coverage ratio at origination of at\nleast 1.20 on commercial real estate loans. The Bank also requires the assignment of rents of all tenants' leases in the mortgaged property and personal guarantees may be obtained for additional security from these borrowers.\nAt March 31, 2021, commercial real estate mortgage loans totaled $149.5 million, or 31.1% of the total loan portfolio. This balance reflects a year-over-year increase of $7.7 million, or 5.4%, as a result of organic loan originations and purchases.\nThe Bank offers 5-year terms for our commercial mortgages. At times, we can offer greater than 5 years for terms of up to 15 years and amortization schedules up to 25 years; however, the interest rate always resets every 5 years. Interest rates currently offered by the Bank are\nadjusted at the beginning of each adjustment period and generally are based upon a fixed spread above the FHLB-NY corresponding regular advance rate.\nHistorically, Carver Federal has been a New York City metropolitan area leader in the origination of loans to churches. At March 31, 2021, loans to churches totaled $19.5 million, or 4.1% of the Bank's gross loan portfolio. These loans generally have five-, seven-, or ten-year terms\nwith 15-, 20- or 25-year amortization periods, a balloon payment due at the end of the term and generally have no greater than a 70% LTV ratio at origination. The Bank has also provided construction financing for churches and generally provides permanent financing upon completion of\nconstruction. There are currently 22 church loans in the Bank's loan portfolio.\nLoans secured by real estate owned by faith-based organizations generally are larger and involve greater risks than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. Because payments on loans secured by such properties are often dependent on voluntary contributions by members of the\nchurch's congregation, repayment of such loans may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the economy. The Bank seeks to minimize these risks in a variety of ways, including reviewing the organization's financial condition, limiting the size of such loans and establishing the\nquality of the collateral securing such loans. The Bank determines the appropriate amount and type of security for such loans based in part upon the governance structure of the particular organization, the length of time the church has been established in the community and a cash flow analysis\nto determine the church's ability to service the proposed loan. Carver Federal will obtain a first mortgage on the underlying real property and often requires personal guarantees of key members of the congregation and/or key person life insurance on the pastor. The Bank may also require the\nchurch to obtain key person life insurance on specific members of the church's leadership. While asset quality in the church loan category historically has been one of the strongest asset classes, recent economic conditions have produced higher delinquencies in this portfolio. While\nmanagement believes that Carver Federal will remain a leading lender to churches in its market area, Carver Federal will continue to conduct disciplined underwriting and maintain focused portfolio management.\nBusiness Loans. Carver Federal's small business (Commercial and Industrial, or \"C&I\") lending portfolio increased $63.3 million to $148.7 million, comprising 30.9% of the Bank's gross loan portfolio in fiscal 2021. This includes $36.0 million of PPP loans at March 31, 2021. The\nBank purchased $10.7 million of business loans during fiscal year 2021. In a strategic attempt to diversify the Bank's loan portfolio, Carver Federal demonstrated an emphasis on C&I lending, placing particular focus on organic loan growth through the financing of local entrepreneurs\nbeginning in fiscal year 2018. Carver Federal provides revolving credit, working capital and term loan facilities to small businesses with annual sales of approximately $1 million to $25 million in educational, health care, personal services, and light industrial and wholesale segments. Business\nloans are typically personally guaranteed by the owners and may also be secured by additional collateral, including real estate, equipment and inventory.\nConsumer and Other Loans. At March 31, 2021, the Bank had $2.4 million in consumer and other loans, or 0.5%, of the Bank's gross loan portfolio, primarily comprised of $2.2 million of guaranteed graduate medical student loans purchased in fiscal 2017.\nConsumer loans are not typically secured by collateral and therefore involve more risk than first mortgage loans. Collection of a delinquent loan is dependent on the borrower's continuing financial stability and is more likely to be adversely affected by changes in employment, marital\nstatus, health and other personal financial factors. Further, the application of\n8\nvarious federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered. These loans may also give rise to claims and defenses by a borrower against Carver Federal, including claims and defenses that the borrower has against the\nseller of the underlying collateral. In underwriting unsecured consumer loans other than secured credit cards, Carver Federal considers the borrower's credit history, an analysis of the borrower's income, expenses and ability to repay the loan and the value of the collateral. The underwriting for\nsecured credit cards only takes into consideration the value of the underlying collateral. See “Asset Quality-Non-performing Assets.”\nLoan Processing. Carver Federal's loan originations are derived from a number of sources, including referrals by realtors, builders, depositors, borrowers and mortgage brokers, as well as walk-in and telephone customers. Loans are originated by the Bank's personnel who receive a\nbase salary, commissions and other incentive compensation. Real estate, business and unsecured loan applications are forwarded to the Bank's Lending Department for underwriting pursuant to standards established in Carver Federal's loan policy. The underwriting and loan processing for\nresidential one-to-four family loans are performed by an outsourced third party loan originator using lending standards established by the Bank.\nA commercial real estate loan application is completed for all multifamily and non-residential properties that the Bank finances. Prior to loan approval, the property is inspected by a loan officer. As part of the loan approval process, consideration is given to an independent appraisal,\nlocation, accessibility, stability of the neighborhood, environmental assessment, personal credit history and the financial capacity of the applicant(s). Business loan applications are completed for all business loans. Most business loans are secured by real estate, personal guarantees, and/or\nguarantees by the United States Small Business Administration (“SBA”) or Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”) filings. The loan approval process considers the credit history of the applicant, collateral, cash flow and purpose and stability of the business.\nUpon receipt of a completed loan application from a prospective borrower, a credit report and other verifications are ordered to confirm specific information relating to the loan applicant's income and credit standing. It is the Bank's policy to obtain an appraisal of the real estate\nintended to secure a proposed mortgage loan from an independent appraiser approved by the Bank.\nIt is Carver Federal's policy to record a lien on the real estate securing the loan and to obtain a title insurance policy that insures that the property is free of prior encumbrances. Borrowers must also obtain hazard insurance policies prior to closing and, when the property is in a flood\nplain as designated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, obtain flood insurance. Most borrowers are also required to advance funds on a monthly basis, together with each payment of principal and interest, to a mortgage escrow account from which the Bank makes\ndisbursements for items such as real estate taxes and hazard insurance. Written confirmation of the guarantee for SBA loans and evidence of the UCC filing is also required.\nLoan Approval. Except for real estate and business loans in excess of $6.0 million, mortgage and business loan approval authority has been delegated by the Bank's Board of Directors to the Board's Asset Liability and Interest Rate Risk Committee. The Asset Liability and Interest\nRate Risk Committee has delegated to the Bank's Management Loan Committee, which consists of certain members of executive management, loan approval authority up to and including $1.0 million for real estate and business loans. Real estate and business loans above $6.0 million must be\napproved by the full Board. Purchased loans are subject to the same approval process as originated loans. One-to-four family mortgage loans that conform to FNMA, Federal Housing Administration and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\"FHLMC\") standards and limits may be\napproved by the outsourced third party loan originator.\nLoans-to-One-Borrower. Under the loans-to-one-borrower limits of the OCC, with certain limited exceptions, loans and extensions of credit to a single or related group of borrowers outstanding at one time generally may not exceed 15% of the unimpaired capital and surplus of a\nsavings bank. See “Regulation and Supervision-Federal Banking Regulation-Loans-to-One-Borrower Limitations.” At March 31, 2021, the maximum loans-to-one-borrower under this test was $10.8 million and the Bank had no relationships that exceeded this limit.\nLoan Originations and Purchases. Loan originations were $114.5 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $33.5 million in fiscal 2020. There were $26.8 million loan purchases during fiscal 2021 and $34.8 million purchases in fiscal 2020.\n9\nThe following table sets forth certain information with respect to Carver Federal's loan originations and advances, purchases and sales for the fiscal years ended March 31:\n2021 2020 2019\n$ in thousands Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent\nLoans Originated:\nOne-to-four family $ 4,217 3.0 % $ — — % $ — — %\nMultifamily 15,936 11.3 % 14,363 21.1 % 1,700 6.2 %\nCommercial real estate 48,334 34.2 % 13,892 20.4 % 9,319 34.2 %\nBusiness 45,643 32.3 % 4,803 7.0 % 15,769 57.9 %\nConsumer and others (1) 366 0.3 % 394 0.6 % 450 1.7 %\nTotal loans originated 114,496 81.0 % 33,452 49.1 % 27,238 100.0 %\nLoans purchased (2) 26,814 19.0 % 34,780 51.0 % — — %\nTotal loans originated and purchased 141,310 100.0 % 68,232 100.1 % 27,238 100.0 %\nLoans sold (3) — (1,294) (1,738)\nNet additions to loan portfolio $ 141,310 $ 66,938 $ 25,500\n(1) Comprised of personal loans.\n(2) Comprised of $10.7 million business, $6.9 million multifamily, $6.3 million commercial real estate and $2.8 million one-to-four family residential loans.\n(3) Comprised of primarily multifamily and one-to-four family loans.\nLoans purchased by the Bank entail certain risks not necessarily associated with loans the Bank originates. The Bank's purchased loans are generally acquired without recourse to the seller, with certain exceptions related to the seller's compliance with representations and warranties,\nand in accordance with the Bank's underwriting criteria for originations. In addition, purchased loans have a variety of terms, including maturities, interest rate caps and indices for adjustment of interest rates, that may differ from those offered at that time by the Bank. The Bank initially seeks\nto purchase loans in its market area. However, the Bank may purchase loans secured by property outside its market area to meet its financial objectives. The market areas in which the properties that secure the purchased loans are located may differ from Carver Federal's market area and may\nbe subject to economic and real estate market conditions that may significantly differ from those experienced in Carver Federal's market area. There can be no assurance that economic conditions in these out-of-state markets will not deteriorate in the future, resulting in increased loan\ndelinquencies and loan losses among the loans secured by property in these areas.\nIn an effort to reduce risks, the Bank has sought to ensure that purchased loans satisfy the Bank's underwriting standards and do not otherwise have a higher risk of collection or loss than loans originated by the Bank. A review of each loan is conducted prior to purchase, and the Bank\nalso requires appropriate documentation and further seeks to reduce its risk by requiring, in each buy/sell agreement, a series of warranties and representations as to the underwriting standards and the enforceability of the related legal documents. These warranties and representations remain in\neffect for the life of the loan. Any misrepresentation must be cured within 90 days of discovery or trigger certain repurchase provisions in the buy/sell agreement.\nLoan Maturity Schedule. The following table sets forth information at March 31, 2021 regarding the amount of loans maturing in Carver Federal's portfolio, including scheduled repayments of principal, based on contractual terms to maturity. Demand loans, loans having no schedule\nof repayments and no stated maturity, and overdrafts are reported as due in one year or less. The table below does not include any estimate of prepayments, which significantly shorten the average life of all mortgage loans and may cause Carver Federal's actual repayment experience to differ\nLoan Maturities\n$ in thousands <1 Yr. 1-5 Yrs. 6-20+ Yrs.

Scheduled contractual principal repayments of loans do not necessarily reflect the actual lives of\nsuch assets. The average life of long-term loans is substantially less than their\n10\ncontractual terms due to prepayments. In addition, due-on-sale clauses in mortgage loans generally give Carver Federal the right to declare a conventional loan due and payable in the event, among other things, that a borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not\nrepaid. The average life of mortgage loans tends to increase when current mortgage loan market rates are higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and tends to decrease when current mortgage loan market rates are lower than rates on existing mortgage loans:\nDue After March 31, 2021\n$ in thousands Fixed Adjustable Total\nGross loans receivable:\nOne-to-four family $ 58,760 $ 17,579 $ 76,339\nMultifamily 52,142 46,094 98,236\nCommercial real estate 57,661 74,253 131,914\nBusiness 53,321 82,151 135,472\nConsumer 177 — 177\nTotal $ 222,061 $ 220,077 $ 442,138\nAsset Quality\nGeneral. One of the Bank's key operating objectives continues to be to maintain a high level of asset quality. Through a variety of strategies, including, but not limited to, monitoring loan delinquencies and borrower workout arrangements, the Bank has been proactive in addressing\nproblem loans and non-performing assets.\nThe underlying credit quality of the Bank's loan portfolio is dependent primarily on each borrower's ability to continue to make required loan payments and, in the event a borrower is unable to continue to do so, the adequacy of the value of the collateral securing the loan. For non-\nowner occupied non-residential real estate and multifamily real estate loans, the borrower's ability to pay typically is dependent on rental income, which can be impacted primarily by vacancies and general market conditions. For one-to-four family loans, a borrowers' ability to pay typically is\ndependent primarily on employment and other sources of income. For owner occupied non-residential real estate, a borrower's ability to pay typically is dependent primarily on the success of the borrower's business. For all of the Bank's loans, a borrower's ability to pay is also impacted by\ngeneral economic and other factors, such as unanticipated expenditures or changes in the financial markets. Collateral values, particularly real estate values, are also impacted by a variety of factors, including general economic conditions, demographics, maintenance and collection or\nforeclosure delays. The COVID-19 pandemic has placed additional strains on the economy. The Company has made provisions in its allowance for loans and lease reserves to mitigate any future charge-offs that may be needed.\nNon-performing Assets. Non-performing assets consist of nonaccrual loans, loans held-for-sale, and property acquired in settlement of loans (OREO), including foreclosure. When a borrower fails to make a payment on a loan, the Bank and/or its loan servicers take prompt steps to\nhave the delinquency cured and the loan restored to current status. This includes a series of actions such as phone calls, letters, customer visits and, if necessary, legal action. In the event the loan has a guarantee, the Bank may seek to recover on the guarantee, including, where applicable, from\nthe Small Business Administration (“SBA”). Loans that remain delinquent are reviewed for reserve provisions and charge-off. The Bank's collection efforts continue after the loan is charged off, except when a determination is made that collection efforts have been exhausted or are not\nproductive.\nThe Bank may from time to time agree to modify the contractual terms of a borrower's loan. In cases where such modifications represent a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, the modification is considered a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”). Loans modified\nin a TDR are typically placed on nonaccrual status until the Bank determines that future collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured, which generally requires that the borrower demonstrate performance according to the restructured terms for a period of at least six months. At\nMarch 31, 2021, loans classified as TDR totaled $7.5 million, of which $5.8 million were classified as performing.\nThe following table sets forth information with respect to Carver Federal's non-performing assets, which includes nonaccrual loans, loans held-for-sale, and property acquired in settlement of loans as of March 31:\n11\n$ in thousands 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017\nLoans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis (1):\nGross loans receivable:\nOne-to-four family $ 3,524 $ 3,582 $ 4,488 $ 4,561 $ 3,899\nMultifamily 369 375 3,214 964 1,602\nCommercial real estate 918 — 476 502 993\nBusiness 2,290 2,797 2,051 635 1,922\nConsumer 90 22 65 — 2\nTotal nonaccrual loans 7,191 6,776 10,294 6,662 8,418\nOther non-performing assets (2)\nReal estate owned 60 120 404 1,145 990\nLoans held-for-sale — — — — 944\nTotal other non-performing assets 60 120 404 1,145 1,934\nTotal non-performing assets (3) $ 7,251 $ 6,896 $ 10,698 $ 7,807 $ 10,352\nNon-performing loans to total loans 1.49 % 1.58 % 2.40 % 1.39 % 1.54 %\nNon-performing assets to total assets 1.07 % 1.19 % 1.90 % 1.13 % 1.50 %\n(1) Nonaccrual status denotes any loan where the delinquency exceeds 90 days past due, or in the opinion of management, the collection of contractual interest and/or principal is doubtful. Payments received on a nonaccrual loan are either applied to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income,\ndepending on assessment of the ability to collect on the loan.\n(2) Other non-performing assets generally represent loans that the Bank is in the process of selling and has designated held-for-sale or property acquired by the Bank in settlement of loans less costs to sell (i.e. through foreclosure, repossession or as an in-substance foreclosure). These assets are recorded at the lower\nof their cost or fair value.\n(3) Troubled debt restructured loans performing in accordance with their modified terms for less than six months and those not performing in accordance with their modified terms are considered nonaccrual and are included in the nonaccrual category in the table above. TDR loans included in the nonaccrual category\nabove totaled $1.8 million at 2021, $2.2 million at 2020, $3.2 million in 2019, $1.9 million at 2018, and $2.5 million at 2017. TDR loans that have performed in accordance with their modified terms for a period of at least six months are generally considered performing loans and are not presented in the table above.\nPerforming TDR loans were $5.8 million at 2021, $1.7 million at 2020, $2.2 million at 2019, $3.8 million at 2018, and $3.9 million at 2017.\nAt March 31, 2021, total non-performing assets increased by $0.4 million, or 5.8%, to $7.3 million, compared to $6.9 million at March 31, 2020, as a result of a $0.4 million increase in nonaccrual loans, year over year. Nonaccrual loans at March 31, 2021 consisted of twelve one-to-\nfour family loans, one commercial real estate, one multifamily, eight small business and SBA loans, and six consumer loans. Management believes that there may be losses associated with certain delinquent loans in the future, but also notes that the amount of losses may be reduced by the\nvalue of properties securing these delinquent loans and the Bank's loan loss reserves. Other non-performing assets at year-end 2021 includes real estate owned assets consisting of one foreclosed residential property. At March 31, 2021, Carver had 8 loans secured by one-to-four family\nresidential real estate properties in the process of foreclosure with a total outstanding balance of $2.5 million.\nAlthough we believe that substantially all risk elements at March 31, 2021 have been disclosed, other factors, including economic conditions and the conditions related to COVID-19, may cause borrowers to be unable to comply with the contractual repayment terms on certain real\nestate and commercial loans. For additional information about certain factors that may affect the future performance of the Company's loan portfolio, please see \"Item 1A - Risk Factors\" and \"Forward Looking Statements.\"\nAsset Classification and Allowances for Losses. Federal regulations and the Bank's policies require the classification of assets on the basis of credit quality on a quarterly basis. An asset is classified as “substandard” if it is determined to be inadequately protected by the current net\nworth and paying capacity of the obligor or the current value of the collateral pledged, if any. An asset is classified as “doubtful” if full collection is highly questionable or improbable. An asset is classified as “loss” if it is considered uncollectible, even if a partial recovery could be expected in\nthe future. The regulations also provide for a “special mention” designation, described as assets that do not currently expose a savings institution to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant substandard classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving\nmanagement's close attention. Assets classified as substandard or doubtful result in a higher level of allowances for loan losses recorded in accordance with ASC Subtopic 450-20 “Loss Contingencies.” If an asset or portion thereof is classified as a loss, a savings institution must charge off\nany amount exceeding the fair value of collateral pursuant to loan impairment guidance in ASC Section 310-10-35. If a savings institution does not agree with an examiner's classification of an asset, it may appeal this determination to the OCC Regional Director.\n12\nThe OCC, in conjunction with the other federal banking agencies, has adopted an interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan losses and lease losses (\"ALLL\"). The policy statement provides guidance for financial institutions on both the responsibilities of management for\nthe assessment and establishment of adequate allowances and guidance for banking agency examiners to use in determining the adequacy of general valuation guidelines. Generally, the policy statement recommends that institutions have effective systems and controls to identify, monitor and\naddress asset quality problems; that management analyze all significant factors that affect the ability to collect the portfolio in a reasonable manner; and that management establish acceptable allowance evaluation processes that meet the objectives set forth in the policy statement. Management\nis responsible for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the periodic provisioning for estimated losses included in the consolidated financial statements. The evaluation process is undertaken on a quarterly basis, but may increase in frequency should conditions arise that\nwould require management's prompt attention, such as business combinations and opportunities to dispose of non-performing and marginally performing loans by bulk sale or any development which may indicate an adverse trend. Although management believes that adequate specific and\ngeneral loan loss allowances have been established, actual losses are dependent upon future events and, as such, further additions to the level of specific and general loan loss allowances may become necessary. For additional information regarding Carver Federal's ALLL policy, refer to Note 2\nof Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”\nThe Board has designated the Management Credit Review Committee for management to perform a review on a quarterly basis of the Bank's asset quality, determine and properly identify and monitor credit risk in the loan portfolio and determine that the Bank's allowance for loan\nand lease losses is proper and appropriate and submit their report to the Board for review. Carver Federal's methodology for establishing the allowance for loan losses takes into consideration probable losses that have been identified in connection with specific loans as well as losses that have\nnot been identified but can be expected to occur. Further, management reviews the ratio of allowances to total loans and recommends adjustments to the level of allowances accordingly. Although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect\nto the allowances for losses, future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ from the economic conditions in the assumptions used in making the initial determinations, or if circumstances pertaining to individual loans change, or new information pertaining to individual\nloans or the loan portfolio is identified. The Bank has a centralized loan servicing structure that relies upon outside servicers, each of which generates a monthly report of delinquent loans. The Asset Liability and Interest Rate Risk Committees of the Board establish policy relating to internal\nclassification of loans and also provides input to the Credit Review Committee in its review of classified assets. In originating loans, Carver Federal recognizes that credit losses will occur and that the risk of loss will vary with, among other things, the type of loan being made, the\ncreditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan, general economic conditions and, in the case of a secured loan, the quality of the security for the loan.\nIt is management's policy to maintain a general allowance for loan losses based on, among other things, regular reviews of delinquencies and loan portfolio quality, character and size, the Bank's and the industry's historical and projected loss experience and current and forecasted\neconomic conditions and certain qualitative factors. In addition, considerable uncertainty exists as to the future improvement or deterioration of the real estate market. See “Lending Activities-Loan Purchases and Originations.” Carver Federal increases its allowance for loan losses by charging\nprovisions for possible losses against the Bank's income. General allowances are established by management on at least a quarterly basis based on an assessment of risk in the Bank's loans, taking into consideration the composition and quality of the portfolio, delinquency trends, current\ncharge-off and loss experience, the state of the real estate market and economic conditions generally. Specific allowances are provided for individual loans, or portions of loans, when ultimate collection is considered improbable by management based on the current payment status of the loan\nand the fair value or net realizable value of the security for the loan. A loan is deemed impaired when it is probable the Bank will be unable to collect both principal and interest due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Loans the Bank individually classifies as impaired\ninclude multifamily mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans, construction loans and business loans which have been classified by the Bank's credit review officer as substandard, doubtful or loss for which it is probable that principal and interest will not be collected in accordance with the\nloan's contractual terms, and certain loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring. A charge off is recognized on collateral dependent loans when the fair value of the property that collateralizes the impaired loan, if any, is less than the recorded investment in the loan. A valuation allowance\nfor cash flow dependent loans is established when based upon a discounted cash flow analysis, impairment is demonstrated.\nAt the date of foreclosure or other repossession, the Bank transfers the property to real estate acquired in settlement of loans, or other real estate owned (\"OREO\"), at fair value less estimated selling costs. Fair value is defined as the amount in cash or cash-equivalent value of other\nconsideration that a real estate parcel would yield in a current sale between a willing buyer and a willing seller. Any amount of cost in excess of fair value is charged off against the allowance for loan losses prior to the transfer of the property into OREO. Carver Federal records an allowance\nfor estimated selling costs of the property immediately after foreclosure. Subsequent to taking possession of the property, management periodically evaluates the property and an allowance is established if the estimated fair value of the property, less estimated costs to sell, declines. If,\n13\nupon ultimate disposition of the property, net sales proceeds exceed the net carrying value of the property, a gain on sale of real estate is recorded, providing the Bank did not provide financing for the sale.\nThe following table sets forth an analysis of Carver Federal's allowance for loan losses at and for the years ended March 31:\n$ in thousands 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017\nBalance at beginning of year $ 4,946 $ 4,646 $ 5,126 $ 5,060 $ 5,232\nLess Charge-offs:\nOne-to-four family — (12) (151) (96) (106)\nMultifamily — — (164) (104) (338)\nBusiness (24) (69) (964) (81) —\nConsumer and other (54) (102) (19) (33) (85)\nTotal Charge-offs $ (78) $ (183) $ (1,298) $ (314) $ (529)\nAdd Recoveries:\nOne-to-four family 88 302 190 — —\nMultifamily — — 158 131 —\nCommercial real estate — — — 20 20\nBusiness 278 160 705 87 304\nConsumer and other 6 2 35 7 4\nTotal Recoveries $ 372 $ 464 $ 1,088 $ 245 $ 328\nNet loans charged off 294 281 (210) (69) (201)\nProvision for (recovery of) losses (100) 19 (270) 135 29\nBalance at end of year $ 5,140 $ 4,946 $ 4,646 $ 5,126 $ 5,060\nRatios:\nNet (charge-off) recovery to average loans outstanding 0.06 % 0.07 % (0.05) % (0.01) % (0.04) %\nAllowance to total loans 1.06 % 1.15 % 1.08 % 1.07 % 0.93 %\nAllowance to non-performing loans 71.48 % 72.99 % 45.13 % 76.94 % 60.11 %\nThe following table allocates the allowance for loan losses by asset category at March 31:\n2021 2020 2019 2018 2017\n$ in % of % of % of % of % of\nthousands Amount Total ALLL Amount Total ALLL Amount Total ALLL Amount Total ALLL Amount Total ALLL\nOne-to-four\nfamily $ 1,058 20.6 % $ 1,055 21.3 % $ 1,274 27.4 % $ 1,210 23.6 % $ 1,663 32.9 %\nMultifamily 880 17.1 % 1,011 20.5 % 885 19.1 % 1,819 35.5 % 1,213 24.0 %\nCommercial\nreal estate 907 17.6 % 812 16.4 % 766 16.5 % 1,052 20.5 % 1,496 29.5 %\nConstruction — 0.0 % — 0.0 % — — % — — % 106 2.1 %\nBusiness 1,855 36.1 % 1,567 31.7 % 1,330 28.6 % 1,003 19.5 % 573 11.3 %\nConsumer\nand other 165 3.2 % 212 4.3 % 154 3.3 % 18 0.4 % 9 0.2 %\nUnallocated 275 5.4 % 289 5.8 % 237 5.1 % 24 0.5 % — 0.0 %\nTotal\nAllowance $ 5,140 100.0 % $ 4,946 100.0 % $ 4,646 100.0 % $ 5,126 100.0 % $ 5,060 100.0 %\nThe allocation of the allowance to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any category.\nInvestment Activities\nGeneral. The Bank utilizes mortgage-backed and other investment securities in its asset/liability management strategy. In making investment decisions, the Bank considers, among other things, its yield and interest rate objectives, its interest rate and credit risk position and its\nliquidity and cash flow.\nGenerally, the investment policy of the Bank is to invest funds among categories of investments and maturities based upon the Bank's asset/liability management policies, investment quality, loan and deposit volume and collateral requirements, liquidity needs and performance\nobjectives. Securities are classified into one of three categories: trading, held-to-maturity, and available-for-sale. Securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified\n14\nas trading securities and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings. Debt securities for which the Bank has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost. All other securities not classified\nas trading or held-to-maturity are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included, on an after-tax basis, in a separate component of stockholders' equity. At March 31, 2021, the Bank had no securities classified as trading. At March 31, 2021,\n$86.5 million, or 91.7% of the Bank's mortgage-backed and other investment securities, were classified as available-for-sale. The remaining $7.8 million, or 8.3%, were classified as held-to-maturity.\nThe following table sets forth the amortized cost, fair value and weighted average yields of the Bank's investment portfolio at March 31, 2021, categorized by remaining period to contractual maturity:\nDue 1 - 5 Years Due 5 - 10 Years Due after 10 Years\n$ in thousands Amortized Cost Fair Value Weighted Average Yield Amortized Cost Fair Value Weighted Average Yield Amortized Cost Fair Value Weighted Average Yield\nAvailable-for-Sale:\nMortgage-backed securities:\nGovernment National Mortgage Association $ — $ — — % $ — $ — — % $ 987 $ 1,026 3.11 %\nFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation — — — % — — — % 28,458 27,785 1.36 %\nFederal National Mortgage Association — — — % — — — % 15,120 14,610 1.56 %\nTotal mortgage-backed securities — — — % — — — % 44,565 43,421 1.47 %\nU.S. Government Agency Securities — — — % 5,655 5,612 1.37 % 13,089 13,019 1.20 %\nCorporate Bonds — — — % — — — % 5,274 4,481 2.61 %\nMuni securities — — — — — % 17,763 16,610 5.61 %\nAsset-backed securities 3,336 3,364 3.18 % — — — % — — — %\nTotal available-for-sale $ 3,336 $ 3,364 3.18 % $ 5,655 $ 5,612 1.37 % $ 80,691 $ 77,531 2.38 %\nHeld-to-Maturity:\nMortgage-backed securities:\nGovernment National Mortgage Association $ 211 $ 223 3.50 % $ — $ — — % $ 472 $ 529 4.2 %\nFederal National Mortgage Association 4,317 4,442 2.36 % 2,743 2,882 2.03 % 64 64 — %\nTotal held-to-maturity $ 4,528 $ 4,665 2.41 % $ 2,743 $ 2,882 2.03 % $ 536 $ 593 3.7 %\nMortgage-Backed Securities. The Bank has invested in mortgage-backed securities to help achieve its asset/liability management goals and collateral needs. Although mortgage-backed securities generally yield less than whole loans, they present substantially lower credit risk, are\nmore liquid than individual mortgage loans and may be used to collateralize obligations of the Bank. Because Carver Federal receives regular payments of principal and interest from its mortgage-backed securities, these investments provide more consistent cash flows than investments in\nother debt securities, which generally only pay principal at maturity. Mortgage-backed securities also help the Bank meet certain definitional tests for favorable treatment under federal banking and tax laws. See “Regulation and Supervision-Federal Banking Regulation-Qualified Thrift\nLender Test” and “Federal and State Taxation.”\nMortgage-backed securities constituted 7.6% of total assets at March 31, 2021, compared to 7.7% at March 31, 2020. Carver Federal maintains a portfolio of mortgage-backed securities in the form of Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA”) pass-through certificates,\nFNMA mortgage-backed securities, FHLMC participation certificates and commercial mortgage-backed securities. GNMA pass-through certificates are guaranteed as to the payment of principal and interest by the full faith and credit of the United States Government, while FNMA and\nFHLMC securities are each guaranteed by their respective agencies as to principal and interest. Mortgage-backed securities generally entitle Carver Federal to receive a pro-rata portion of the cash flows from an identified pool of mortgages. The cash flows from such pools are segmented and\npaid in accordance with a predetermined priority to various classes of securities issued by the entity. Carver Federal has also invested in pools of loans guaranteed as to principal and interest by the SBA.\n15\nThe Bank seeks to manage interest rate risk by investing in adjustable-rate mortgage-backed securities, which at March 31, 2021, constituted $1.4 million, or 2.7%, of the mortgage-backed securities portfolio. Mortgage-backed securities, however, expose Carver Federal to certain\nunique risks. In a declining rate environment, accelerated prepayments of loans underlying these securities expose Carver Federal to the risk that it will be unable to obtain comparable yields upon reinvestment of the proceeds. In the event the mortgage-backed security has been funded with\nan interest-bearing liability with maturity comparable to the original estimated life of the mortgage-backed security, the Bank's interest rate spread could be adversely affected. Conversely, in a rising interest rate environment, the Bank may experience a lower than estimated rate of repayment\non the underlying mortgages, effectively extending the estimated life of the mortgage-backed security and exposing the Bank to the risk that it may be required to fund the asset with a liability bearing a higher rate of interest. For additional information regarding Carver Federal's mortgage-\nbacked securities portfolio and its maturities refer to Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, “Investment Securities.”\nOther Investment Securities. In addition to mortgage-backed securities, the Bank also invests in assets such as government and agency obligations, corporate bonds and mutual funds. Carver Federal is permitted under federal law to make certain investments, including investments in\nsecurities issued by various federal agencies and state and municipal governments, deposits at the FHLB-NY, certificates of deposit in federally insured institutions, certain bankers' acceptances and federal funds. The Bank may also invest, subject to certain limitations, in commercial paper\nhaving one of the two highest investment ratings of a nationally recognized credit rating agency, and certain other types of corporate debt securities and mutual funds (See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nOther Earning Assets. Federal regulations require the Bank to maintain an investment in FHLB-NY stock and a sufficient amount of liquid assets which may be invested in cash and specified securities. For additional information, see “Regulation and Supervision-Federal Banking\nRegulation-Liquidity.”\nSecurities Impairment. The Bank’s available-for-sale securities portfolio is carried at estimated fair value, with any unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Securities that the Bank has the intent and ability to hold to\nmaturity are classified as held-to-maturity and are carried at amortized cost. The fair values of securities in the Bank's portfolio are based on published or securities dealers’ market values and are affected by changes in interest rates. On a quarterly basis, the Bank reviews and evaluates the\nsecurities portfolio to determine if the decline in the fair value of any security below its cost basis is other-than-temporary. The Bank generally views changes in fair value caused by changes in interest rates as temporary, which is consistent with its experience. Following FASB guidance, the\namount of an other-than-temporary impairment when there are credit and non-credit losses on a debt security which management does not intend to sell, and for which it is more likely than not that the Bank will not be required to sell the security prior to the recovery of the non-credit\nimpairment, the portion of the total impairment that is attributable to the credit loss would be recognized in earnings. The remaining difference between the debt security’s amortized cost basis and its fair value would be included in other comprehensive income (loss). This guidance also\nrequires additional disclosures about investments in an unrealized loss position and the methodology and significant inputs used in determining the recognition of other-than-temporary impairment. The Bank does not have any securities that are classified as having other-than-temporary\nimpairment in its investment portfolio at March 31, 2021.\nSources of Funds\nGeneral. Deposits are the primary source of Carver Federal's funds for lending and other investment purposes. In addition to deposits, Carver Federal derives funds from loan principal repayments, loan and investment interest payments, maturing investments and fee income. Loan\nand mortgage-backed securities repayments and interest payments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows are significantly influenced by prevailing market interest rates, pricing of deposits, competition and general economic conditions. Borrowed money\nmay be used to supplement the Bank's available funds, and from time to time the Bank borrows funds from the FHLB-NY and has borrowed funds through trust preferred debt securities.\nDeposits. Carver Federal attracts deposits from consumers, businesses, non-profit organizations and public entities through its seven branches principally from within its market area by offering a variety of deposit instruments, including passbook and statement accounts and\ncertificates of deposit, which range in term from 6 months to five years. Deposit terms vary, principally on the basis of the minimum balance required, the length of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate. Carver Federal also offers Individual Retirement Accounts. Carver\nFederal's policies are designed primarily to attract deposits from local residents and businesses through the Bank's branches. However, in fiscal year 2021 the Bank launched a program introducing new products and expanded its digital online account openings into nine states across the\nNortheast and in Washington D.C. Carver Federal also holds deposits from various governmental agencies or authorities and corporations.\n16\nCarver Federal utilizes brokered deposits as an additional funding source and to assist in the management of the Bank's interest rate risk. Carver Federal has obtained brokered certificates of deposit when the interest rate on these deposits is below the prevailing interest rate for non-\nbrokered certificates of deposit with similar maturities in our market, or when obtaining them allowed us to extend the maturities of our deposits at favorable rates compared to borrowing funds with similar maturities, or when we are seeking to extend the maturities of our funding to assist in\nthe management of our interest rate risk. Carver has obtained brokered deposits from a variety of brokerage firms. In addition, Carver has obtained brokered deposits through the Depository Trust Company. This allows us to better manage the maturity of our deposits and our interest rate risk.\nCarver Federal has also utilized brokers to obtain money market account deposits. The rate we pay on brokered money market accounts is the same or below the rate we pay on non-brokered money market accounts. These accounts are similar to brokered certificates of deposit accounts in that\nwe only maintain one account for the total deposit per broker, with the broker maintaining the detailed records of each depositor. As of March 31, 2021, Carver had a total of $73.4 million in brokered deposits, compared to $81.9 million as of March 31, 2020.\nAs of March 31, 2021, the Bank has $43.2 million of reciprocal deposits acquired through its participation in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (“CDARS”). The Bank's CDARS deposits totaled $40.2 million as of March 31, 2020. The CDARS network arranges for\nplacement of Carver Federal's customer funds into certificate of deposit accounts issued by other CDARS member banks. The certificate of deposit accounts are in increments of less than the individual FDIC insurance limit amount, to ensure that both principal and interest are eligible for full\nFDIC deposit insurance. This allows the Bank to maintain its customer relationship while still providing its customers with FDIC insurance for the full amount of their deposits, up to $50 million per customer. In exchange, Carver Federal receives from other member banks their customers'\ndeposits in like amounts. Depositors are allowed to withdraw funds early, with a penalty, from these accounts. Carver Federal may elect to participate in the program by making or receiving deposits without making or receiving a reciprocal deposit. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, the\nstandard maximum deposit insurance amount is $250,000.\nDeposit interest rates, maturities, service fees and withdrawal penalties on deposits are established based on the Bank's funds acquisition and liquidity requirements, the rates paid by the Bank's competitors, current market rates, the Bank's growth goals and applicable regulatory\nrestrictions and requirements. For additional information regarding the Bank's deposit accounts and the related weighted average interest rates paid, and amount and maturities of certificates of deposit in specified weighted average interest rate categories, refer to Note 8 of the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements, “Deposits.”\nBorrowed Funds. While deposits are the primary source of funds for Carver Federal's lending, investment and general operating activities, Carver Federal is authorized to use advances from the FHLB-NY and securities sold under agreements to repurchase (“Repos”) from approved\nprimary dealers to supplement its supply of funds and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements. The FHLB-NY functions as a central bank providing credit for savings institutions and certain other member financial institutions. As a member of the FHLB system, Carver Federal is required to\nown stock in the FHLB-NY and is authorized to apply for advances. Advances are made pursuant to several different programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. Advances from the FHLB-NY are secured by Carver Federal's stock in the FHLB-NY and a pledge\nof Carver Federal's mortgage loan and mortgage-backed and agency securities portfolios. The Bank takes into consideration the term of borrowed money with the repricing cycle of the mortgage loans on the balance sheet.\nOn September 17, 2003, Carver Statutory Trust I issued 13,000 shares, liquidation amount $1,000 per share, of floating rate capital securities. Gross proceeds from the sale of these trust preferred debt securities of $13 million, and proceeds from the sale of the trust's common\nsecurities of $0.4 million, were used to purchase approximately $13.4 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's floating rate junior subordinated debt securities due 2033. The trust preferred debt securities are redeemable at par quarterly at the option of the Company and have a\nmandatory redemption date of September 17, 2033. Cash distributions on the trust preferred debt securities are cumulative and payable at a floating rate per annum resetting quarterly with a margin of 3.05% over the three-month LIBOR, with a rate of 3.2% at March 31, 2021. During the\nsecond quarter of fiscal year 2017, the Company applied for and was granted regulatory approval to settle all outstanding debenture interest payments through September 2016. Such payments were made in September 2016. Interest on the debentures had been deferred beginning with the\nDecember 2016 payment, per the terms of the agreement, which permitted such deferral for up to twenty consecutive quarters, as the Company was prohibited from making payments without prior regulatory approval. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, the Company applied for and\nwas granted regulatory approval to settle all outstanding debenture interest payments through June 2021. Full payment on the outstanding debenture interest was made on June 16, 2021.\nCarver relies primarily on dividends from Carver Federal to pay cash dividends to its stockholders, to engage in share repurchase programs and to pay principal and interest on its trust preferred debt obligation. The OCC regulates all capital distributions, including dividend payments, by\nCarver Federal to the Company, and the FRB regulates dividends paid by the\n17\nCompany. As the subsidiary of a savings and loan association holding company, Carver Federal must file a notice or an application (depending on the proposed dividend amount) with the OCC (and a notice with the FRB) prior to the declaration of each capital distribution. The OCC will\ndisallow any proposed dividend, for among other reasons, that would result in Carver Federal’s failure to meet the OCC minimum capital requirements. In accordance with the Formal Agreement defined directly below, Carver Federal is currently prohibited from paying any dividends without\nprior OCC approval, and, as such, has suspended its regular quarterly cash dividend to the Company. There are no assurances that dividend payments to Carver will resume.\nREGULATION AND SUPERVISION\nEnforcement Actions\nOn October 23, 2015 the Board of Directors of Carver Bancorp, Inc., in response to the FRB’s Bank Holding Company Report of Inspection issued on April 14, 2015, adopted a Board Resolution (“the Resolution”) as a commitment by the Company’s Board to address certain\nsupervisory concerns noted in the Reserve Bank‘s Report. The supervisory concerns are related to the Company’s leverage, cash flow and accumulated deferred interest. As a result of those concerns, the Company is prohibited from paying any dividends without the prior written approval of\nthe Reserve Bank.\nOn May 24, 2016, the Bank entered into a Formal Agreement (the \"Agreement\") with the OCC to undertake certain compliance-related and other actions as further described in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on\nMay 27, 2016. As a result of the Formal Agreement, the Bank must obtain the approval of the OCC prior to effecting any change in its directors or senior executive officers. The Bank may not declare or pay dividends or make any other capital distributions, including to the Company, without\nfirst filing an application with the OCC and receiving the prior approval of the OCC. Furthermore, the Bank must seek the OCC's written approval and the FDIC's written concurrence before entering into any \"golden parachute payments\" as that term is defined under 12 U.S.C. § 1828(k) and\n12 C.F.R. Part 359.\nGeneral\nThe Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by its primary regulator, the OCC. The Bank's deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC under the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”), and is a member of the FHLB. The Bank must file\nreports with the OCC concerning its activities and financial condition, and it must obtain regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions, such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other depository institutions. The Company, as a unitary savings and loan holding company, is\nsubject to regulation, examination and supervision by the FRB and is required to file certain reports with, and otherwise comply with, the rules and regulations of the FRB and of the SEC under the federal securities laws. The OCC periodically performs safety and soundness examinations of\nthe Bank and tests compliance with various regulatory requirements. The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over federally chartered savings banks and has substantial discretion to impose enforcement action on an institution that fails to comply with applicable regulatory\nrequirements, particularly with respect to its capital requirements. In addition, the FDIC has the authority to recommend to the Director of the OCC that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular federally chartered savings bank and, if action is not taken by the Director, the FDIC\nhas authority to take such action under certain circumstances.\nThe description of statutory provisions and regulations applicable to federally chartered savings banks and their holding companies and of tax matters set forth in this document does not purport to be a complete description of all such statutes and regulations and their effects on the\nBank and the Company. Any change in such laws and regulations whether by the OCC, the FDIC, the FRB or through legislation could have a material adverse impact on the Bank and the Company and their operations and stockholders.\nCapital and Liquidity\nPrompt Corrective Action Regulations. Under the prompt corrective action regulations, the OCC is authorized and, in some cases, required to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings banks. For this purpose, a savings bank would be placed in one of the following five\ncategories based on the bank's regulatory capital: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized.\nThe severity of the action authorized or required to be taken under the prompt corrective action regulations increases as a bank's capital decreases within the three undercapitalized categories. All banks are prohibited from paying dividends or other capital distributions or paying\nmanagement fees to any controlling person if, following such distribution, the bank would\n18\nbe undercapitalized. Generally, a capital restoration plan must be filed with the OCC within 45 days of the date a bank receives notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” In addition, various mandatory supervisory actions become\nimmediately applicable to the institution, including restrictions on growth of assets and other forms of expansion. Under OCC regulations, as amended, a federally chartered savings bank is treated as well-capitalized if its total risk-based capital ratio is 10% or greater, its Tier 1 risk-based\ncapital ratio is 8% or greater, its common equity Tier 1 capital ratio is 6.5% or greater, and its leverage ratio is 5% or greater, and it is not subject to any order or directive by the OCC to meet a specific capital level. In assessing an institution's capital adequacy, the OCC takes into consideration\nnot only these numeric factors but also qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions as they deem necessary.\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act, or FDICIA, required that the OCC and other federal banking agencies revise their risk-based capital standards, with appropriate transition rules, to ensure that they take into account IRR concentration of risk and the risks\nof non-traditional activities. The OCC regulations do not include a specific IRR component of the risk-based capital requirement. However, the OCC monitors the IRR of individual institutions through a variety of means, including an analysis of the change in net portfolio value\n(\"NPV\"). NPV is defined as the net present value of the expected future cash flows of an entity's assets and liabilities and, therefore, hypothetically represents the value of an institution's net worth. The OCC has also used this NPV analysis as part of its evaluation of certain applications or\nnotices submitted by thrift institutions. In addition, OCC Bulletin 2010-1 provides guidance on the management of IRR and the responsibility of boards of directors in that area. The OCC, through its general oversight of the safety and soundness of savings associations, retains the right to\nimpose minimum capital requirements on individual institutions to the extent the institution is not in compliance with certain written guidelines established by the OCC regarding NPV analysis.\nCarver Federal's Capital Position. Carver Federal, as a matter of prudent management, targets as its goal the maintenance of capital ratios which exceed minimum requirements and are consistent with Carver Federal's risk profile. At March 31, 2021, Carver Federal exceeded the capital\nregulatory requirements and its Individual Minimum Capital Requirements with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 14.41%, Tier 1 leverage ratio of 10.01%, total risk-based capital ratio of 15.56% and a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 14.41%.\nThe OCC and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule effective January 1, 2015 that revised their leverage and risk-based capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with agreements that were reached by the\nBasel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule generally applies to all depository institutions, and top-tier bank and savings and loan holding companies with total consolidated assets of $3 billion or more. Among other things, the rule\nestablished a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital requirement (4.5% of risk-weighted assets), increased the minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets requirement (from 4% to 6% of risk-weighted assets) and assigned a higher risk weight (150%) to exposures that are more than\n90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and to certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property. The final rule also required unrealized gains and losses on certain “available-for-sale” securities holdings to be included for\npurposes of calculating regulatory capital unless a one-time opt-out is exercised. Carver Federal has chosen to opt-out. Additional constraints are also imposed on the inclusion in regulatory capital of certain mortgage-servicing assets, deferred tax assets and minority interests. The rule limits a\nbanking organization’s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital\nrequirements. As noted, the final rule became effective for the Bank on January 1, 2015. The capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in annually beginning January 1, 2016. On January 1, 2019, the full capital conservation buffer requirement of 2.5% became effective. The final\nrule adjusted the prompt corrective action categories described above to incorporate the increased capital standards and established the \"well-capitalized\" threshold described above.\nLegislation enacted in May 2018 requires the federal banking agencies, including the OCC, to establish for institutions with assets of less than $10 billion a “community bank leverage ratio” of between 8 to 10%. Institutions with capital complying with the ratio and otherwise meeting\nthe specified requirements (including off-balance sheet exposures of 25% or less of total assets and trading assets and liabilities of 5% or less of total assets) and electing the alternative framework are considered to comply with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, including the risk-\nbased requirements. Such institutions are also considered \"well-capitalized\" for prompt corrective action purposes.\nThe community bank leverage ratio was established at 9% Tier 1 capital to total average assets, effective January 1, 2020. A qualifying bank may opt in and out of the community bank leverage ratio framework on its quarterly call report. A bank that ceases to meet any qualifying\ncriteria is provided with a two-quarter grace period to comply with the community bank leverage ratio requirements or the general capital regulations by the federal regulators.\n19\nSection 4012 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act of 2020 required that the community bank leverage ratio be temporarily lowered to 8%. The federal regulators issued a rule making the reduced ratio effective April 23, 2020. The rules also established a two-\nquarter grace period for a qualifying community bank whose leverage ratio falls below the 8% community bank leverage ratio requirement so long as the bank maintains a leverage ratio of 7% or greater. Another rule was issued to transition back to the 9% community bank leverage ratio by\nincreasing the ratio to 8.5% for calendar year 2021 and to 9% thereafter.\nLimitation on Capital Distributions. There are various restrictions on a bank's ability to make capital distributions, including cash dividends, payments to repurchase or otherwise acquire its shares and other distributions charged against capital. A savings institution that is the\nsubsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, such as the Bank, must file a notice with the FRB at least 30 days before making a capital distribution and receive the FRB's nonobjection. The Bank must also file an application or notice for prior approval with the OCC if the total amount of\nits capital distributions (including each proposed distribution), for the applicable calendar year would exceed the Bank's net income for that year plus the Bank's retained net income for the previous two years, if the Bank is not an \"eligible savings association\" as defined in OCC regulations or\nthe capital distributions would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation or agreement.\nThe Bank may be prohibited from making capital distributions and its application or notice disapproved if:\n(1) the Bank would be undercapitalized following the distribution;\n(2) the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or\n(3) the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation or agreement.\nLiquidity. The Bank maintains liquidity levels to meet operational needs. In the normal course of business, the levels of liquid assets during any given period are dependent on operating, investing and financing activities. Cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and repurchase\nagreements with maturities of three months or less are the Bank's most liquid assets. The Bank maintains a liquidity policy to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure its safe and sound operations. Management believes Carver Federal’s short-term assets have sufficient liquidity to cover loan\ndemand, potential fluctuations in deposit accounts and to meet other anticipated cash requirements, including interest payments on our subordinated debt securities.\nStandards for Safety and Soundness\nStandards for Safety and Soundness. The OCC has adopted guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards. The guidelines establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest\nrate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines. OCC regulations authorize the OCC to\norder an institution that has been given notice that it is not satisfying these safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so notified, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan, or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted compliance\nplan, the OCC must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized association is subject under the “prompt corrective action” provisions of federal law. If an institution fails to comply with such\nan order, the OCC may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties.\nEnforcement. The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over the Bank. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist orders and to remove directors and officers. In general, these enforcement\nactions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices.\nTARP\nThe Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (“EESA”) was signed into law on October 3, 2008 and authorized the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”) to establish the Troubled Asset Relief Program (“TARP”) to purchase certain troubled assets from financial\ninstitutions, including banks and thrifts.\nOn October 14, 2008, the Treasury announced that it would purchase equity stakes in a wide variety of banks and thrifts. Under this program, known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program Capital Purchase Program (the \"TARP CPP\"), the\n20\nTreasury made $250 billion of capital available (from the $700 billion authorized by the EESA) to U.S. financial institutions in the form of preferred stock. On January 20, 2009, the Company announced that it completed the sale of $18.98 million in preferred stock to the Treasury in\nconnection with Carver's participation in the TARP CPP.\nThe Treasury announced in February 2010 the implementation of the Community Development Capital Initiative (“CDCI”). This new capital program invested lower cost capital in CDFIs that lend to small businesses in the country's most economically depressed communities. On\nAugust 27, 2010, Carver completed with the Treasury the exchange of the $18.98 million of TARP preferred stock for an equivalent amount of CDCI Series B preferred stock. On October 28, 2011, the U.S. Treasury exchanged the CDCI Series B preferred stock for 2,321,286 shares of\nCompany common stock.\nOn August 6, 2020, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with the Treasury to repurchase the 2,321,286 shares of Company common stock held by the Treasury. As a result, the Company is no longer a participant in the CDCI program and is not bound by any TARP\nrestrictions as the Treasury is no longer a common stockholder of the Company. For more information concerning the Bank's repurchase of treasury shares, see Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther Supervision and Regulation\nActivity Powers. The Bank derives its lending and investment powers from the Home Owners' Loan Act (“HOLA”), as amended, and federal regulations. Under these laws and regulations, the Bank may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate,\ncommercial and consumer loans, certain types of debt securities and certain other assets. The Bank may also establish service corporations that may engage in certain activities not otherwise permissible for the Bank, including certain real estate equity investments and securities and insurance\nbrokerage. The Bank's authority to invest in certain types of loans or other investments is limited by federal law. These investment powers are subject to various limitations, including (1) a prohibition against the acquisition of any corporate debt security that is not rated in one of the four\nhighest rating categories, (2) a limit of 400% of an association's capital on the aggregate amount of loans secured by non-residential real estate property, (3) a limit of 20% of an association's assets on commercial loans, with the amount of commercial loans in excess of 10% of assets being\nlimited to small business loans, (4) a limit of 35% of an association's assets on the aggregate amount of consumer loans and acquisitions of certain debt securities, (5) a limit of 5% of assets on non-conforming loans (certain loans in excess of the specific limitations of HOLA), and (6) a limit of\nthe greater of 5% of assets or an association's capital on certain construction loans made for the purpose of financing what is or is expected to become residential property.\nLoans-to-One Borrower Limitations. The Bank is generally subject to the same limits on loans-to-one borrower as a national bank. With specified exceptions, the Bank's total loans or extension of credit to a single borrower or group of related borrowers may not exceed 15% of the\nBank's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus, which does not include accumulated other comprehensive income. The Bank currently complies with applicable loans-to-one borrower limitations. At March 31, 2021, the Bank's limit on loans-to-one borrower based on its unimpaired capital\nand surplus was $10.8 million.\nQualified Thrift Lender Test. Under HOLA, the Bank must comply with a Qualified Thrift Lender (“QTL”) test. Under this test, the Bank is required to maintain at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” in certain “qualified thrift investments” on a monthly basis in at least nine months of\nthe most recent twelve-month period. “Portfolio assets” means, in general, an association's total assets less the sum of (a) specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets, (b) goodwill and other intangible assets and (c) the value of property used to conduct the Bank's business. “Qualified thrift\ninvestments” include various types of loans made for residential and housing purposes, investments related to such purposes, including certain mortgage-backed and related securities and consumer loans. If the Bank fails the QTL test, it must operate under certain restrictions on its activities.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act made noncompliance potentially subject to agency enforcement action for violation of law. At March 31, 2021, the Bank maintained approximately 96% of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments. The Bank had also met the QTL test in each of the prior 12\nmonths and was, therefore, a qualified thrift lender.\nBranching. Subject to certain limitations, federal law permits the Bank to establish branches in any state of the United States. The authority for the Bank to establish an interstate branch network would facilitate a geographic diversification of the Bank's activities. This authority under\nfederal law and regulations preempts any state law purporting to regulate branching by federal savings associations.\nCommunity Reinvestment. Under CRA, as amended, as implemented by OCC regulations, the Bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. CRA does not establish specific\nlending requirements or programs for the Bank nor does it limit the Bank's\n21\ndiscretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community. CRA does, however, require the OCC, in connection with its examination of the Bank, to assess the Bank's record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such\nrecord into account in its evaluation of certain applications by the Bank.\nIn particular, the system focuses on three tests:\n(1) a lending test, to evaluate the institution's record of making loans in its assessment areas;\n(2) an investment test, to evaluate the institution's record of investing in community development projects, affordable housing and programs benefiting low or moderate income individuals and businesses; and\n(3) a service test, to evaluate the institution's delivery of banking services through its branches, ATM centers and other offices.\nCRA also requires all institutions to make public disclosure of their CRA ratings. The Bank received an “Outstanding” CRA rating in its most recent examination conducted in January 2019.\nRegulations require that Carver Federal publicly disclose certain agreements that are in fulfillment of CRA. The Company has no such agreements in place at this time.\nIn June 2020, the OCC issued amendments to its CRA regulations. The final rule clarifies and expands the activities that qualify for CRA credit, updates where activities count for such credit and, according to the agency, seeks to create a more consistent and objective method for\nevaluating CRA performance. The final rule was effective October 1, 2020 but compliance with the certain of the revised requirements is not mandatory for the Association until January 1, 2023.\nTransactions with Related Parties. The Bank's authority to engage in transactions with its “affiliates” is limited by federal regulations and by Sections 23A, 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (“FRA”). In general, these transactions must be on terms which are as favorable to the Bank as\ncomparable transactions with non-affiliates. Additionally, certain types of these transactions are restricted to an aggregate percentage of the Bank's capital. Collateral in specified amounts must usually be provided by affiliates to receive loans from the Bank. In addition, OCC regulations\nprohibit a savings bank from lending to any of its affiliates that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary.\nThe Bank's authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers, and 10% shareholders (\"insiders\"), as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the FRA and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve\nBoard. Among other things, these provisions require that all loans or extensions of credit to insiders (a) be made on terms that are substantially the same as and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated\npersons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and (b) not exceed certain limitations, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the Bank's capital. In addition, extensions of credit in excess\nof certain limits must be approved by the Bank's Board. The aggregate amount of related party deposits were $216 thousand and there was one related party loan totaling $60 thousand at March 31, 2021.\nAssessment. The OCC charges assessments to recover the cost of examining savings associations and their affiliates. These assessments are based on three components: the size of the association, on which the basic assessment is based; the association's supervisory condition, which\nresults in an additional assessment based on a percentage of the basic assessment for any savings institution with a composite rating of 3, 4, or 5 in its most recent safety and soundness examination; and the complexity of the association's operations, which results in an additional assessment\nbased on a percentage of the basic assessment for any savings association that managed over $1 billion in trust assets, serviced for others loans aggregating more than $1 billion, or had certain off-balance sheet assets aggregating more than $1 billion. For fiscal 2021, Carver paid $197 thousand\nin regulatory assessments.\nInsurance of Deposit Accounts\nUnder the FDIC's risk-based assessment system, institutions deemed less risky pay lower assessments. Assessments for institutions of less than $10 billion of assets are now based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the\nprobability of an institution's failure within three years. That system, effective July 1, 2016, replaced the previous system under which institutions were placed into risk categories.\n22\nThe Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to revise its procedures to base assessments upon each insured institution's total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits. The current assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments) for insured institutions of less than $10 billion of\ntotal assets is 1.5 basis points to 30 basis points.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target Deposit Insurance Fund ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was required to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2010. The Dodd-\nFrank Act required insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more to fund the increase from 1.15% to 1.35% and, effective July 1, 2016, such institutions were subject to a surcharge to achieve that goal. The FDIC has indicated that the 1.35% ratio was exceeded in November 2018.\nInsured institutions of less than $10 billion of assets received credits for their portion of assessments that contributed to raising the reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%. The credits were exhausted as of September 30, 2020. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has exercised that discretion\nby establishing a long-range fund ratio of 2%.\nThe FDIC has authority to further increase insurance assessments and therefore management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future. A significant increase in insurance premiums may have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of\noperations of the Bank. For fiscal 2021, Carver paid $355 thousand in FDIC insurance.\nAnti-Money Laundering and Customer Identification\nThe Bank is subject to federal regulations implementing the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (“USA PATRIOT Act”). The USA PATRIOT Act gives the federal government new powers\nto address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. By way of amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act took\nmeasures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies. Further, certain provisions of Title III impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks, thrifts, brokers, dealers, credit unions, money\ntransfer agents and parties registered under the United States Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, as amended.\nTitle III of the USA PATRIOT Act and the related federal regulations imposed the following requirements with respect to financial institutions:\n• Establish a Board approved policy and perform a risk assessment of BSA, Anti-Money Laundering and OFAC;\n• Designate a qualified BSA officer;\n• Establish an effective training program;\n• Establish anti-money laundering programs;\n• Establish a program specifying procedures for obtaining identifying information from customers seeking to open new accounts, including verifying the identity of customers within a reasonable period of time;\n• Establish enhanced due diligence policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report money laundering; and\n• Prohibit correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks and compliance with record keeping obligations with respect to correspondent accounts of foreign banks\nIn addition, bank regulators were directed to consider a holding company's effectiveness in combating money laundering when ruling on certain corporate applications.\nFederal Home Loan Bank System\nThe Bank is a member of the FHLB-NY, which is one of the eleven regional banks composing the FHLB System. Each regional bank provides a central credit facility primarily for its member institutions. The Bank, as a FHLB-NY member, is required to acquire and hold shares of\ncapital stock in the FHLB-NY in specified amounts. The Bank was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in the capital stock of the FHLB-NY at March 31, 2021 of $552\n23\nthousand. Any advances from the FHLB-NY must be secured by specified types of collateral, and all long-term advances may be obtained only for the purpose of providing funds for residential housing finance.\nFHLB-NY is required to provide funds for the resolution of insolvent thrifts and to contribute funds for affordable housing programs. These requirements could reduce the amount of earnings that the FHLB-NY can pay as dividends to its members and could also result in the FHLB-\nNY imposing a higher rate of interest on advances to its members. If dividends were reduced, or interest on future FHLB-NY advances increased, the Bank's net interest income would be adversely affected. Dividends from FHLB-NY to the Bank amounted to $33 thousand and $56 thousand\nfor fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. The dividend rate paid on FHLB-NY stock at March 31, 2021 was 4.8%.\nFederal Reserve System\nFRB regulations require federally chartered savings associations to maintain non-interest-earning cash reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily interest-bearing checking and demand deposit accounts). A reserve of 3% is to be maintained against aggregate transaction\naccounts between $16.9 million and $127.5 million (subject to adjustment annually by the FRB) plus a reserve of 10% (subject to adjustment by the FRB between 8% and 14%) against that portion of total transaction accounts in excess of $127.5 million. The first $16.9 million of otherwise\nreservable balances (subject to adjustment annually by the FRB) is exempt from the reserve requirements. The Bank was in compliance with the foregoing requirements. Since required reserves must be maintained in the form of either vault cash, a non-interest-bearing account at a Federal\nReserve Bank or a pass-through account as defined by the FRB, the effect of this reserve requirement is to reduce Carver Federal's interest-earning assets. FHLB System members are also authorized to borrow from the Federal Reserve “discount window,” but FRB regulations require\ninstitutions to exhaust all FHLB sources before borrowing from a Federal Reserve Bank. Effective March 26, 2020, the FRB reduced reserve requirement ratios to 0%, which eliminated reserve requirements for all depository institutions.\nPrivacy Protection\nCarver Federal is subject to OCC regulations implementing the privacy protection provisions of federal law. These regulations require the Bank to disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with whom it shares “nonpublic personal information” to customers at the time of\nestablishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter. The regulations also require the Bank to provide its customers with initial and annual notices that accurately reflect its privacy policies and practices. In addition, to the extent its sharing of such information is not exempted, the\nBank is required to provide its customers with the ability to opt-out of having the Bank share their nonpublic personal information with unaffiliated third parties before they can disclose such information, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe Bank is subject to regulatory guidelines establishing standards for safeguarding customer information. These regulations implement certain provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, as amended (\"GLB\"). The guidelines describe the agencies' expectations for the creation,\nimplementation and maintenance of an information security program, which would include administrative, technical and physical safeguards appropriate to the size and complexity of the institution and the nature and scope of its activities. The standards set forth in the guidelines are intended\nto insure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information that could result in substantial harm or\ninconvenience to any customer. The Bank has a policy to comply with the foregoing guidelines.\nHolding Company Regulation\nThe Company is a savings and loan holding company regulated by the FRB. As such, the Company is registered with and subject to FRB examination and supervision, as well as certain reporting requirements. The FRB has enforcement authority over the Company and its\nsubsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the FRB to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of a subsidiary savings institution.\nGLB restricts the powers of new unitary savings and loan holding companies. Unitary savings and loan holding companies that are “grandfathered,” i.e., unitary savings and loan holding companies in existence or with applications filed with the regulator on or before May 4, 1999,\nsuch as the Company, retain their authority under the prior law. All other unitary savings and loan holding companies are limited to financially related activities permissible for financial holding companies and certain other activities specified by FRB regulations. GLB also prohibits\nnonfinancial companies from acquiring grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding companies.\n24\nRestrictions Applicable to All Savings and Loan Holding Companies. Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company, including the Company, directly or indirectly, from acquiring:\n(1) control (as defined under the Home Owners' Loan Act (\"HOLA\") of 1933, as amended), of another savings institution (or a holding company parent) without prior FRB approval;\n(2) through merger, consolidation, or purchase of assets, another savings institution or a holding company thereof, or acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of such institution (or a holding company), without prior FRB approval; or\n(3) control of any depository institution not insured by the FDIC.\nA savings and loan holding company may not acquire as a separate subsidiary an insured institution that has a principal office outside of the state where the principal office of its subsidiary institution is located, except:\n(1) in the case of certain emergency acquisitions approved by the FDIC;\n(2) if such holding company controls a savings institution subsidiary that operated a home or branch office in such additional state as of March 5, 1987; or\n(3) if the laws of the state in which the savings institution to be acquired is located specifically authorize a savings institution chartered by that state to be acquired by a savings institution chartered by the state where the acquiring savings institution or savings and loan holding\ncompany is located or by a holding company that controls such a state chartered association.\nIn evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings associations, the FRB must consider issues such as the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the insurance fund,\nthe convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors.\nThe FRB has promulgated consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to their subsidiary depository institutions, including a community bank\nleverage ratio alternative. Instruments such as cumulative preferred stock and trust-preferred securities, which were previously includable within Tier 1 capital by bank holding companies within certain limits, are no longer includable as Tier 1 capital, subject to certain grandfathering. The\npreviously discussed final rule regarding regulatory capital requirements implemented the Dodd-Frank Act as to savings and loan holding companies. However, pursuant to subsequent legislation, the FRB extended the applicability of the “Small Bank Holding Company” exception of its\nconsolidated capital requirements to savings and loan holding companies and increased the threshold for the exception to $1.0 billion, effective May 15, 2015. Additional subsequent legislation directed the Federal Reserve Board to expand the applicability of the exception to holding\ncompanies up to $3.0 billion in consolidated assets; that change was effective in August 2018. As a result, holding companies with less than $3.0 billion of consolidated assets, such as the Company, are generally not subject to consolidated capital requirements unless otherwise advised by the\nFRB.\nThe FRB promulgated regulations implementing the “source of strength” policy that requires holding companies act as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress.\nThe FRB has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank holding companies that it has made applicable to savings and loan holding companies as well. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be\npaid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory consultation with respect to\ncapital distributions in certain circumstances such as where the company’s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends’ previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company’s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s\ncapital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. The policy statement also provides for regulatory consultation prior to a holding company redeeming or repurchasing regulatory\ncapital instruments when the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock that would result in a net reduction as of the end of a quarter in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the\nbeginning of the quarter in which\n25\nthe redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions.\nFederal Securities Laws\nThe Company is subject to the periodic reporting, proxy solicitation, tender offer, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).\nDelaware Corporation Law\nThe Company is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. Thus, it is subject to regulation by the State of Delaware and the rights of its shareholders are governed by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”)\nThe CARES Act, which became law on March 27, 2020, provided over $2 trillion to combat the coronavirus (COVID-19) and stimulate the economy. The law had several provisions relevant to financial institutions, including:\n• Allowing institutions not to characterize loan modifications relating to the COVID-19 pandemic as a troubled debt restructuring and also allowing them to suspend the corresponding impairment determination for accounting purposes.\n• Temporarily reducing the Community Bank Leverage Ratio (the “CBLR”) as discussed above under \"Carver Federal's Capital Position.\"\n• The ability of a borrower of a federally backed mortgage loan (VA, FHA, USDA, Freddie and Fannie) experiencing financial hardship due, directly or indirectly, to the COVID-19 pandemic to request forbearance from paying their mortgage by submitting a request to the borrower’s\nservicer affirming their financial hardship during the COVID-19 emergency. Such a forbearance will be granted for up to 180 days, which can be extended for an additional 180-day period upon the request of the borrower. During that time, no fees, penalties or interest beyond the\namounts scheduled or calculated as if the borrower made all contractual payments on time and in full under the mortgage contract will accrue on the borrower’s account. Except for vacant or abandoned property, the servicer of a federally backed mortgage is prohibited from taking any\nforeclosure action, including any eviction or sale action, for not less than the 60-day period beginning March 18, 2020, extended by federal mortgage backing agencies to July 31, 2021.\n• The ability of a borrower of a multi-family federally backed mortgage loan that was current as of February 1, 2020, to submit a request for forbearance to the borrower’s servicer affirming that the borrower is experiencing financial hardship during the COVID-19 emergency. A\nforbearance will be granted for up to 30 days, which can be extended for up to two additional 30-day periods upon the request of the borrower. During the time of the forbearance, the multifamily borrower cannot evict or initiate the eviction of a tenant or charge any late fees, penalties\nor other charges to a tenant for late payment of rent. Additionally, a multifamily borrower that receives a forbearance may not require a tenant to vacate a dwelling unit before a date that is 30 days after the date on which the borrower provides the tenant notice to vacate and may not\nissue a notice to vacate until after the expiration of the forbearance. Federal mortgage backing agencies have extended this program three times and will continue to offer forbearances to qualifying multifamily property owners through September 30, 2021, subject to the continued\ntenant protections FHFA has imposed during the pandemic.\nThe Paycheck Protection Program\nThe CARES Act included the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), a nearly $350 billion program designed to aid small- and medium-sized businesses through federally guaranteed loans distributed through banks. These loans were intended to guarantee eight weeks of payroll and\nother costs to help those businesses remain viable and allow their workers to pay their bills. The initial $350 billion program was supplemented in late April 2020 with $310 billion in additional funding. On June 5, 2020, the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act (the “new Act”) was\nsigned into law, and made significant changes to the PPP to provide additional relief for small businesses. The new Act increased flexibility for small businesses that have been unable to rehire employees due to lack of employee availability, or have been unable to operate as normal due to\nCOVID-19 related restrictions, extended the period that businesses have to use PPP funds to qualify for loan forgiveness to 24 weeks, up from 8 weeks under the original rules, and relaxed the requirements that loan recipients must adhere to in order to qualify for loan forgiveness. In addition,\nthe new Act extended the payment deferral period for PPP loans until the date when the amount\n26\nof loan forgiveness is determined and remitted to the lender. For PPP recipients who do not apply for forgiveness, the loan deferral period is 10 months after the applicable forgiveness period ends. On July 4, 2020, Congress enacted a new law to extend the deadline for applying for a PPP loan\nto August 8, 2020. In December 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 was enacted to provide additional economic stimulus to individuals and businesses in response to the extended economic distress caused by the pandemic. This included additional stimulus payments to\nindividuals and their dependents, and extension of enhanced unemployment benefits, $284 billion of additional funds for a second round of PPP loans and a new simplified forgiveness procedure for PPP loans of $150,000 or less. The program was re-opened on January 11, 2021 with updated\nguidance outlining program changes to enhance its effectiveness and accessibility. This round of the PPP will serve new borrowers, as well as allow certain existing PPP borrowers to apply for a second draw PPP loan and make a request to modify their first draw PPP loan.\nCoronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2021 (the “CRRSA Act”)\nOn December 27, 2020, the CRRSA Act was signed into law, which also contains provisions that could directly impact financial institutions including extending the time that insured depository institutions and depository institution holding companies have to comply with the current\nexpected credit losses (CECL) account standing and extending the authority granted to banks under the CARES Act to elect to temporarily suspend the requirements under U.S. GAAP applicable to troubled debt restructurings for loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic for any\nloan that was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019. The act directs financial regulators to support community development financial institutions and minority depository institutions and directs Congress to re-appropriate $429 billion in unobligated CARES Act funds. The\nPPP, which was originally established under the CARES Act, was also extended under the CRRSA Act.\nFEDERAL AND STATE TAXATION\nFederal Taxation\nGeneral. The Company and the Bank currently file consolidated federal income tax returns, report their income for tax return purposes on the basis of a taxable year ending March 31, using the accrual method of accounting and are subject to federal income taxation in the same\nmanner as other corporations with some exceptions, including in particular the Bank's tax reserve for bad debts. The bank has a subsidiary which files a REIT tax return which reports its income for tax purposes on the basis of a taxable year ending December 31st. The REIT does not join in the\nconsolidated return and it pays tax on its undistributed taxable income. The REIT has and intends to continue to distribute its taxable income and therefore not pay tax at the REIT level. The following discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a\ncomprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Bank or the Company.\nDistributions. To the extent that the Bank makes “non-dividend distributions” to shareholders, such distributions will be considered to result in distributions from the Bank's “base year reserve,” i.e., its reserve as of March 31, 1988, to the extent thereof and then from its supplemental\nreserve for losses on loans, and an amount based on the amount distributed will be included in the Bank's taxable income. Non-dividend distributions include distributions in excess of the Bank's current and accumulated earnings and profits, distributions in redemption of stock and distributions\nin partial or complete liquidation. However, dividends paid out of the Bank's current or accumulated earnings and profits, as calculated for federal income tax purposes, will not constitute non-dividend distributions and, therefore, will not be included in the Bank's taxable income.\nThe amount of additional taxable income created from a non-dividend distribution is an amount that, when reduced by the tax attributable to the income, is equal to the amount of the distribution. Thus, approximately 1.2 times the non-dividend distribution would be includable in\ngross income for federal income tax purposes, assuming a 21% federal corporate income tax rate.\nIn December 2017, \"The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" was signed into law. At March 31, 2018, the Company made a reasonable estimate and recorded a remeasurement of the Company’s net deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the new reduced U.S. corporate income tax\nrate. The impact on the net deferred tax asset before valuation allowances was a reduction of $3.1 million, which was offset by a corresponding decrease in the valuation allowance of the same amount. The Company recorded a benefit of $0.3 million for alternative minimum tax credits\nwhich, under the new tax law, are refundable. At March 31, 2020, the amount of the AMT credits was $143 thousand. As of March 31, 2021, the Company requested a $143 thousand refund, related to the AMT credits, from its recently filed fiscal year 2020 federal tax return..\nState and Local Taxation\n27\nState of New York. The Bank and the Company (including the REIT) file tax returns on a combined basis and are subject to New York State franchise tax on their entire net income or one of several alternative bases, whichever results in the highest tax. “Entire net income” means\nfederal taxable income with adjustments. If, however, the application of an alternative tax (based on taxable net assets allocated to New York or a fixed minimum fee) results in a greater tax, the alternative tax will be imposed. The Company was subject to tax based upon capital for New York\nState for fiscal 2021. In addition, New York State imposes a tax surcharge of 29.4% of the New York State Franchise Tax allocable to business activities carried on in the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District. For fiscal 2021, the New York State franchise tax rate computed on\ncapital was 0.025%.\nOn March 31, 2014, New York State tax legislation was signed into law in connection with the approval of the New York State 2014-2015 budget. Portions of the new legislation resulted in significant changes in the calculation of income taxes imposed on banks and thrifts operating\nin New York State, including changes to (1) future period New York State tax rates, (2) rules related to sourcing of revenue for New York State tax purposes and (3) the New York State taxation of entities within one corporate structure, among other provisions. In recent years, the Company\nhas been subject to taxation based upon assets in New York State. The new legislation revised that method to a measurement based on net assets.\nNew York City. The Bank and the Company (including the REIT) file on a combined basis and are also subject to a similarly calculated New York City banking corporation tax on assets allocated to New York City. For fiscal 2021, the New York City banking corporation tax rate\ncomputed on capital is 0.15%. On April 13, 2015, New York State legislation was signed changing the New York City tax law to conform to the New York State law that was adopted in 2014, with some minor differences.\nAs a result of the impact of the 2014 legislation effecting both the New York State and New York City tax law, there was a decrease to the Company's gross deferred tax asset of $1.2 million in fiscal 2015 with no impact to current income due to the full valuation allowance.\nDelaware Taxation. As a Delaware holding company not earning income in Delaware, the Company is exempted from Delaware corporate income tax but is required to file an annual report with and pay an annual franchise tax to the State of Delaware.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nThe material risks that management believes affect the Company are described below. You should carefully consider the risks as described below, together with all of the information included herein. The risks described below are not the only risks the Company faces. Additional risks\nnot presently known also may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Outbreak\nThe economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant economic dislocation in the United States as many state and local governments have ordered non-essential businesses to close and residents to shelter in place at home. This has resulted in an unprecedented slow-down in economic\nactivity, a related increase in unemployment and a significant decline in the value of the stock market, and in particular, bank stocks. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Federal Reserve has reduced the benchmark fed funds rate to a target range of 0% to 0.25%, and the yields on 10-\nand 30-year treasury notes have declined to historic lows. Various state governments and federal agencies are requiring lenders to provide forbearance and other relief to borrowers (e.g., waiving late payment and other fees). The federal banking agencies have encouraged financial institutions\nto prudently work with affected borrowers and recently passed legislation has provided relief from reporting loan classifications due to modifications related to the COVID-19 outbreak. Certain industries have been particularly hard-hit, including the travel and hospitality industry, the\nrestaurant industry and the retail industry. Finally, the spread of the coronavirus has caused us to modify our business practices, including employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences. We have many employees\nworking remotely and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and business partners.\nGiven the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including when the coronavirus can be\ncontrolled and abated and when and how the economy may be reopened. As the result of the\n28\nCOVID-19 pandemic and the related adverse local and national economic consequences, we could be subject to any of the following risks, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations:\n• demand for our products and services may decline, making it difficult to grow assets and income;\n• if the economy is unable to substantially and safely reopen, and high levels of unemployment continue for an extended period of time, loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures may increase, resulting in increased charges and reduced income;\n• collateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, which could cause loan losses to increase;\n• our allowance for loan losses may have to be increased if borrowers experience financial difficulties beyond forbearance periods, which will adversely affect our net income;\n• the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us;\n• as the result of the decline in the Federal Reserve Board's target federal funds rate, the yield on our assets may decline to a greater extent than the decline in our cost of interest-bearing liabilities, reducing our net interest margin and spread and reducing net income;\n• our cybersecurity risks are increased as a result of an increase in the number of employees working remotely;\n• we rely on third party vendors for certain services and the unavailability of a critical service due to the COVID-19 outbreak could have an adverse effect on us; and\n• Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation premiums may increase if the agency experience additional resolution costs.\nMoreover, our future success and profitability substantially depends on the management skills of our executive officers and directors, many of whom have held officer and director positions with us for many years. The unanticipated loss or unavailability of key employees due to the\noutbreak could harm our ability to operate our business or execute our business strategy. We may not be successful in finding and integrating suitable successors in the event of key employee loss or unavailability.\nAny one or a combination of the factors identified above could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to the Lending Activities\nOur loan portfolio exhibits a high degree of risk.\nWe have a significant amount of commercial real estate loans that have a higher risk of default and loss than single-family residential mortgage loans. Commercial real estate loans amount to $149.5 million, or 31.1% of our loan portfolio at March 31, 2021. Commercial real estate\nloans generally are considered to involve a higher degree of risk due to a variety of factors, including generally larger loan balances and loan terms which often do not require full amortization of the loan over its term and, instead, provide for a balloon payment at the stated maturity date.\nRepayment of commercial real estate loans generally is dependent on income being generated by the rental property or underlying business in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service. Failure to adequately underwrite and monitor these loans may result in significant\nlosses to Carver Federal.\nThe allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover Carver's actual loan losses.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the amount of the\nallowance for loan losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience, and we evaluate economic conditions. If our assumptions are incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our\nallowance. Material additions to the allowance would materially decrease net income.\nIn addition, the OCC periodically reviews the allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. A material increase in the allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by the regulatory authorities\nwould have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and real estate market conditions, new information regarding existing loans and leases, identification of\nadditional impaired loans and leases and other factors, both within and outside of our control. Additions to the allowance could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\n29\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulation and Their Enforcement\nFailure to comply with the Formal Agreement could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn May 2016, the Bank entered into a Formal Agreement with the OCC. The Formal Agreement required the Bank to reduce its concentration of commercial real estate and required that the Bank undertake several actions to improve compliance matters and overall profitability. Based\non an updated report of examination, the Bank's CRE concentration was at appropriate levels and there were no issues surrounding any compliance matters. Failure to comply with the Formal Agreement could result in additional supervisory and enforcement actions against the Bank, its\ndirectors, or senior executive officers, including the issuance of a cease and desist order or the imposition of civil money penalties. The Bank's compliance efforts may have an adverse impact on its non-interest expense and net income.\nCarver is subject to more stringent capital requirements, which may adversely impact the Company's return on equity, or constrain it from paying dividends or repurchasing shares.\nIn July 2013, the FDIC and the FRB approved a new rule that substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to the Bank and the Company. The final rule implements the “Basel III” regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe final rule includes new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective for the Bank and the Company on January 1, 2015, and refines the definition of what constitutes “capital” for purposes of calculating these ratios. The new minimum capital requirements\nare: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The final rule also established a “capital conservation\nbuffer” of 2.5%, and the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in beginning in January 2016 at\n0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increased each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These\nlimitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions. Regardless of Basel III's minimum requirements, Carver, as a result of the previously described Formal Agreement, was issued an Individual Minimum Capital Ratio (\"IMCR\")\nletter by the OCC, which requires the Bank to maintain minimum regulatory capital levels of 9% for its Tier 1 leverage ratio and 12% for its total risk-based capital ratio. At March 31, 2021, the Bank's capital level exceeded the regulatory requirements and its IMCR requirements with a Tier 1\nleverage ratio of 10.01%, Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 14.41%, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 14.41%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of 15.56%.\nThere can be no assurance that our regulator will approve payment of our deferred interest on our outstanding trust preferred securities.\nCarver is a unitary savings and loan association holding company regulated by the FRB and almost all of its operating assets are owned by Carver Federal. Carver relies primarily on dividends from the Bank to pay cash dividends to its stockholders, to engage in share repurchase programs\nand to pay principal and interest on its trust preferred debt obligation. The OCC regulates all capital distributions, including dividend payments, by the Bank to the Company, and the FRB regulates dividends paid by the Company. As the subsidiary of a savings and loan association holding\ncompany, Carver Federal must file a notice or an application (depending on the proposed dividend amount) with the OCC (and a notice with the FRB) prior to the declaration of each capital distribution. The OCC will disallow any proposed dividend, for among other reasons, that would result\nin the Bank’s failure to meet the OCC minimum capital requirements. In accordance with the Agreement, the Bank is currently prohibited from paying any dividends without prior OCC approval, and, as such, has suspended its regular quarterly cash dividend to the Company. There are no\nassurances that dividend payments to the Company will resume.\nDebenture interest payments on the Carver Statutory Trust I capital securities had been deferred, which was permissible under the terms of the Indenture for up to twenty consecutive quarterly periods, as the Company was prohibited from making payments without prior approval from the\nFederal Reserve Bank. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, the Company applied for and was granted regulatory approval to settle all outstanding debenture interest payments through September 2016. Such payments were made in September 2016. Interest on the debentures had been\ndeferred beginning with the December 2016 payment, per the terms of the agreement, which permitted such deferral for up to twenty consecutive quarters through September 2021. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, the Company applied for and was granted\n30\nregulatory approval to settle all outstanding debenture interest payments through June 2021. Full payment on the outstanding debenture interest was made on June 16, 2021.\nCarver's results of operations may be adversely affected by loan repurchases from U.S. Government Sponsored entities (“GSE's”).\nIn connection with the sale of loans, Carver as the loan originator is required to make a variety of representations and warranties regarding the originator and the loans that are being sold. If a loan does not comply with the representations and warranties, Carver may be obligated to\nrepurchase the loans, and in doing so, incur any loss directly. Prior to December 31, 2009, the Bank originated and sold loans to the FNMA. During fiscal years 2012 through 2015, the Bank has been obligated to repurchase 20 loans previously sold to FNMA. The Bank has not received any\nrepurchase requests for these loans since the second quarter of fiscal year 2015. There is no assurance that the Bank will not be required to repurchase additional loans in the future. Accordingly, any repurchase obligations to FNMA could materially and adversely affect the Bank's results of\noperations and earnings in the future.\nThe Company and the Bank operate in a highly regulated industry, which limits the manner and scope of business activities.\nCarver Federal is subject to extensive supervision, regulation and examination by the OCC, as the Bank's chartering authority and, to a lesser extent, by the FDIC, as insurer of its deposits. The Company is subject to extensive supervision, regulation and examination by the FRB, as\nregulator of the holding company. As a result, Carver Federal and the Company are limited in the manner in which Carver Federal and the Company conducts its business, undertakes new investments and activities and obtains financing. This regulatory structure is designed primarily for the\nprotection of the deposit insurance funds and depositors, and not to benefit the Company's stockholders. This regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including\npolicies with respect to capital levels, the timing and amount of dividend payments, the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. In addition, Carver Federal must comply with significant anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws.\nGovernment agencies have substantial discretion to impose significant monetary penalties on institutions which fail to comply with these laws.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called “golden parachute” payments. It also provides that the listing standards of the national securities exchanges shall require listed companies to\nimplement and disclose “clawback” policies mandating the recovery of incentive compensation paid to executive officers in connection with accounting restatements. The legislation also directs the FRB to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company\nexecutives.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC and other regulatory entities, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting guidance that governs the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements. These changes can be difficult to predict and can\nmaterially impact how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply new or revised guidance retroactively.\nRisks Related to the Economic Conditions\nCarver's results of operations are affected by economic conditions in the New York metropolitan area.\nAt March 31, 2021, a significant majority of the Bank's lending portfolio was concentrated in the New York metropolitan area. As a result of this geographic concentration, Carver's results of operations are largely dependent on economic conditions in this area. Decreases in real\nestate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for loans to our borrowers. Adverse changes in the economy caused by inflation, recession, unemployment, state or local real estate laws and regulations or other factors beyond the Bank's control may also continue to\nhave a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make timely mortgage or business loan payments, which would have an adverse impact on earnings. Consequently, deterioration in economic conditions in the New York metropolitan area could have a material adverse impact on the quality\nof the Bank's loan portfolio, which could result in increased delinquencies, decreased interest income results as well as an adverse impact on loan loss experience with probable increased allowance for loan losses. Such deterioration also could adversely impact the demand for products and\nservices, and, accordingly, further negatively affect results of operations.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could negatively affect us.\n31\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. As a result,\ndefaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit\nrisk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due us. There is no assurance\nthat any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Market Interest Rates\nChanges in interest rates may adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.\nWe derive our income mainly from the difference or “spread” between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets and interest paid on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. In general, the larger the spread, the more we earn. When\nmarket rates of interest change, the interest we receive on our assets and the interest we pay on our liabilities will fluctuate. This can cause decreases in our spread and can adversely affect our income. From an interest rate risk perspective, we have generally been liability sensitive, which\nindicates that liabilities generally re-price faster than assets.\nIn response to improving economic conditions, the FRB’s Open Market Committee had slowly increased its federal funds rate target from a range of 0.00% - 0.25% that was in effect for several years to the target range of 2.25% - 2.50% that was in effect at March 31, 2019. However,\nas the result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related adverse local and economic consequences, the target range was decreased to the range of 0.00% - 0.25% at March 31, 2020.\nInterest rates also affect how much money we lend. For example, when interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing increases and loan originations tend to decrease. In addition, changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and securities. For example, a reduction in interest\nrates generally results in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities, as borrowers refinance their debt in order to reduce their borrowing cost. This causes reinvestment risk, because we generally are not able to reinvest prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates\nwe earned on the prepaid loans or securities in a declining rate environment.\nChanges in market interest rates also impact the value of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. In particular, the unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are reported, net of taxes, as accumulated other comprehensive income which is a\ncomponent of stockholders’ equity. Consequently, declines in the fair value of these instruments resulting from changes in market interest rates may adversely affect stockholders’ equity.\nRisks Related to the Bank's Business\nUncertainty surrounding the elimination of LIBOR and the proposed transition to SOFR may adversely affect our business.\nThe U.S. dollar-denominated London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") is used to calculate interest rates for numerous types of debt obligations, including personal and commercial loans, interest rate swaps, and other derivative products, making it a primary metric in the global\nbanking system. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\") has determined that LIBOR should no longer be used as a benchmark rate. In anticipation of the elimination of LIBOR, the U.S. Federal Reserve established the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\"ARRC\") to select a\nreplacement index for U.S. Dollar LIBOR. ARRC, comprised of a group of large domestic banks and regulators, has voted to use a benchmark, known as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\"). SOFR is based on short-term loans backed by Treasury securities, known as repurchase\nagreements or \"repo\" trades. ARRC has announced a paced transition plan for this new rate, including specific steps and timelines designed to encourage adoption of SOFR. As of March 31, 2021, we have exposure to approximately $25.3 million of financial assets and liabilities, including off-\nbalance sheet instruments, which are LIBOR-based. We do not yet know whether, and if so the extent to which, the elimination of LIBOR and the transition to SOFR will have any material impact on these instruments.\nRisks Related to the Bank's Operations\n32\nFailure to maintain effective systems of internal and disclosure controls could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operation and financial condition.\nEffective internal and disclosure controls are necessary for the Company to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, and to operate successfully as a public company. If the Company cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, its reputation and operating\nresults would be harmed. As part of the Company’s ongoing monitoring of internal controls, it may discover material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in its internal controls that require remediation. A “material weakness” is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThe Company continually works on improving its internal controls. However, the Company cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that it implements and maintains adequate controls over its financial processes and reporting. Any failure to maintain effective controls or to timely\nimplement any necessary improvement of the Company’s internal and disclosure controls could, among other things, result in losses from fraud or error, harm the Company’s reputation, or cause investors to lose confidence in the Company’s reported financial information, all of which could\nhave a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operation and financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to certain risks with respect to liquidity.\nLiquidity refers to the Company's ability to generate sufficient cash flows to support its operations and to fulfill its obligations, including commitments to originate loans, to repay wholesale borrowings and other liabilities, and to satisfy the withdrawal of deposits by its customers.\nThe Company's primary sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated through the repayment of loans and securities, cash flows from the sale of loans and securities, deposits gathered organically through the Bank's branch network, from socially motivated depositors, city and state\nagencies and deposit brokers and borrowed funds, primarily in the form of wholesale borrowings from the FHLB-NY. In addition, and depending on current market conditions, the Company has the ability to access the capital markets from time to time.\nDeposit flows, calls of investment securities and wholesale borrowings, and prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities are strongly influenced by such external factors as the direction of interest rates, whether actual or perceived, local and national economic conditions and\ncompetition for deposits and loans in the markets the Bank serves. Furthermore, changes to the FHLB-NY's underwriting guidelines for wholesale borrowings may limit or restrict the Bank's ability to borrow, and could therefore have a significant adverse impact on liquidity.\nA decline in available funding could adversely impact the Bank's ability to originate loans, invest in securities, and meet expenses, or to fulfill such obligations as repaying borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands.\nCarver may not be able to utilize its income tax benefits.\nThe Company's ability to utilize the deferred tax asset generated by New Markets Tax Credit income tax benefits as well as other deferred tax assets depends on its ability to meet the NMTC compliance requirements and its ability to generate sufficient taxable income from operations\nin the future. Since the Bank has not generated sufficient taxable income to utilize tax credits as they were earned, a deferred tax asset has been recorded in the Company's financial statements. For additional information regarding Carver's NMTC, refer to Item 7, \"Variable Interest Entities.\"\nThe future recognition of Carver's deferred tax asset is highly dependent upon Carver's ability to generate sufficient taxable income. A valuation allowance is required to be maintained for any deferred tax assets that we estimate are more likely than not to be unrealizable, based on\navailable evidence at the time the estimate is made. In assessing Carver's need for a valuation allowance, we rely upon estimates of future taxable income. Although we use the best available information to estimate future taxable income, underlying estimates and assumptions can change over\ntime as a result of unanticipated events or circumstances influencing our projections. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes to tax laws, statutory rates, and future taxable income levels. The Company determined that it would not be able to realize all of\nits net deferred tax assets in the future, as such a charge to income tax expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2011 was made. Conversely, if the Company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts, the Company\nwould decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a decrease in income tax expense in the period in which that determination was made.\n33\nOn June 29, 2011, the Company raised $55 million of equity. The capital raise triggered a change in control under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Generally, Section 382 limits the utilization of an entity's net operating loss carry forwards, general business credits, and\nrecognized built-in losses upon a change in ownership. The Company is subject to an annual limitation of approximately $0.9 million. The Company has a net deferred tax asset (“DTA”) of approximately $23.7 million. Based on management's calculations, the Section 382 limitation has\nresulted in previous reductions of the deferred tax asset of $5.8 million. The Company also continues to maintain a valuation allowance for the remaining net deferred tax asset of $23.7 million. The Company is unable to determine how much, if any, of the remaining DTA will be utilized.\nRisks associated with cyber-security could negatively affect our earnings.\nThe financial services industry has experienced an increase in both the number and severity of reported cyber attacks aimed at gaining unauthorized access to bank systems as a way to misappropriate assets and sensitive information, corrupt and destroy data, or cause operational\ndisruptions\nWe have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of security breaches, but such events may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. Although we rely on security safeguards to secure our data, these safeguards may not fully protect our\nsystems from compromises or breaches.\nWe also rely on the integrity and security of a variety of third party processors, payment, clearing and settlement systems, as well as the various participants involved in these systems, many of which have no direct relationship with us. Failure by these participants or their systems to\nprotect our customers' transaction data may put us at risk for possible losses due to fraud or operational disruption.\nOur customers are also the target of cyber attacks and identity theft. Large scale identity theft could result in customers' accounts being compromised and fraudulent activities being performed in their name. We have implemented certain safeguards against these types of activities but\nthey may not fully protect us from fraudulent financial losses.\nThe occurrence of a breach of security involving our customers' information, regardless of its origin, could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business and subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, and could expose us to litigation and possible financial\nliability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSystem failure or breaches of Carver’s network security could subject it to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other liabilities.\nThe computer systems and network infrastructure Carver and its third-party service providers use could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems. Carver’s operations are dependent upon its ability to protect its computer equipment against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss,\ntelecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event, as well as from security breaches, denial of service attacks, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Any damage or failure that causes an interruption in Carver’s operations could have a material adverse effect\non its financial condition and results of operations. Computer break-ins, phishing and other disruptions may occur, and in infrequent cases have occurred, and could jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through Carver’s computer systems and network infrastructure,\nwhich may result in significant liability to Carver and may cause existing and potential customers to refrain from doing business with Carver. Although Carver, with the help of third-party service providers, intends to continue to implement security technology and establish operational\nprocedures designed to prevent such damage, its security measures may not be successful. In addition, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms Carver and its third-party\nservice providers use to encrypt and protect customer transaction data. A failure of such security measures could have a material adverse effect on Carver’s financial condition and results of operations.\nIt is possible that a significant amount of time and money may be spent to rectify the harm caused by a breach or hack. While Carver has general liability insurance, there are limitations on coverage as well as dollar amount. Furthermore, cyber incidents carry a greater risk of injury to\nCarver’s reputation. Finally, depending on the type of incident, banking regulators can impose restrictions on Carver’s business and consumer laws may require reimbursement of customer loss.\nWe are subject to risks and losses resulting from fraudulent activities that could adversely impact our financial performance and results of operations.\n34\nAs a bank, we are susceptible to fraudulent activity that may be committed against us or our clients, which may result in financial losses or increased costs to us or our clients, disclosure or misuse of our information or our client information, misappropriation of assets, privacy\nbreaches against our clients, litigation or damage to our reputation. We are most subject to fraud and compliance risk in connection with the origination of loans, ACH transactions, wire transactions, ATM transactions, checking transactions, and debit cards that we have issued to our customers\nand through our online banking portals.\nOn June 7, 2021, the Bank became aware of a possible fraud incident involving the unauthorized use of a borrower’s account through a third-party vendor’s online cash management system. The Bank’s preliminary investigation of this matter indicates that unauthorized wires totaling\n$2.1 million were fraudulently withdrawn from the borrower’s money market account at the Bank from May 12, 2021 through June 1, 2021. The preliminary investigation indicates that an unauthorized person or entity was provided access to the borrower’s account through a third party online\nbanking system. The Bank contacted the appropriate regulatory and law enforcement agencies, as well as its insurance provider. The total exposure to the Bank as a result of this incident is $2.1 million. However, the Bank is pursuing all available sources of recovery and other means of\nmitigating the potential loss. If any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company's business could suffer if it fails to retain skilled people.\nThe Company's success depends on its ability to attract and retain key employees reflecting current market opportunities and challenges. Competition for the best people is intense, and the Company's size and limited resources may present additional challenges in being able to retain\nthe best possible employees, which could adversely affect the results of operations.\nRisks Related to Future Stock Issuances\nA future issuance of stock could dilute the value of our common stock.\nWe may sell additional shares of common stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such shares, in subsequent public or private offerings. As of March 31, 2021, there were 3,333,268 shares of our common stock outstanding. Future issuance of any new shares could\ncause further dilution in the value of our outstanding shares of common stock. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such shares, or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock\nwill have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.\nRisks Related to the Competitive Matters\nStrong competition within the Bank's market areas could adversely affect profits and slow growth.\nThe New York metropolitan area has a high density of financial institutions, of which many are significantly larger than Carver Federal and with greater financial resources. Additionally, various large out-of-state financial institutions may continue to enter the New York metropolitan\narea market. All are considered competitors to varying degrees.\nCarver Federal faces intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits. Competition for loans, both locally and in the aggregate, comes principally from mortgage banking companies, commercial banks, savings banks and savings and loan associations. Most direct\ncompetition for deposits comes from commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations and credit unions. The Bank also faces competition for deposits from money market mutual funds and other corporate and government securities funds, as well as from other financial\nintermediaries, such as brokerage firms and insurance companies. Market area competition is a factor in pricing the Bank's loans and deposits, which could reduce net interest income. Competition also makes it more challenging to effectively grow loan and deposit balances. The Company's\nprofitability depends upon its continued ability to successfully compete in its market areas.\nRisks Related to the Accounting Matters\nA new accounting standard will likely require us to increase our allowance for loan losses and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board has adopted a new accounting standard that will be effective for the Company for our first fiscal year after December 15, 2022. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) will require financial institutions to\ndetermine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and\n35\nrecognize the expected credit losses as allowances for loan losses. This will change the current method of providing allowances for loan losses that are probable, which would likely require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, and to increase the types of data we would need to collect\nand review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or expenses incurred to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nITEM 1B.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time, the Company and the Bank or one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries are parties to various legal proceedings incident to their business. At March 31, 2021, certain claims, suits, complaints and investigations (collectively “proceedings”) involving the Company and the Bank\nor a subsidiary, arising in the ordinary course of business, have been filed or are pending. The Company is unable at this time to determine the ultimate outcome of each proceeding, but believes, after discussions with legal counsel representing the Company and the Bank or the subsidiary in\nthese proceedings, that it has meritorious defenses to each proceeding and appropriate measures have been taken to defend the interests of the Company, Bank or subsidiary. There were no legal proceedings pending or known to be contemplated against us that in the opinion of management,\nwould be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company or the Bank.\nITEM 4.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.\nOur shares of common stock are traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “CARV\". At March 31, 2021, there were 3,333,268 shares of common stock outstanding, held by approximately 546 stockholders of record.\nAs previously disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 29, 2010, the Company’s Board of Directors announced that Carver suspended payment of the quarterly cash dividend on its common stock.\nUnder OCC regulations, the Bank will not be permitted to pay dividends to the Company on its capital stock if its regulatory capital would be reduced below applicable regulatory capital requirements or if its stockholders' equity would be reduced below the amount required to be\nmaintained for the liquidation account, which was established in connection with the Bank's conversion to stock form. The OCC capital distribution regulations applicable to savings institutions (such as the Bank) that meet their regulatory capital requirements permit, after not less than 30\ndays prior notice to and non-objection by the FRB, capital distributions during a calendar year that do not exceed the Bank's net income for that year plus its retained net income for the prior two years. For information concerning the Bank's liquidation account, see Note 12 of the Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements. In addition, the Company is subject to restrictions under the Agreement that affect their ability to pay dividends. See Item 1 - Overview - Enforcement Actions.\nOn August 6, 2002, the Company announced a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to 15,442 shares of its outstanding common stock. As of March 31, 2021, 11,744 shares of its common stock have been repurchased in open market transactions at an average price of $235.80\nper share (as adjusted for 1-for-15 reverse stock split that occurred on October 27, 2011). The Company reissued shares as restricted stock in accordance with their management recognition plan. No shares were repurchased pursuant to the stock repurchase program during fiscal 2021. As a\nresult of the Company's participation in the TARP CDCI, the Treasury's prior approval was required to make further repurchases. The Treasury converted its preferred stock into common stock, which the Treasury continued to hold. On August 6, 2020, the Company repurchased all 2,321,286\nshares of its common stock held by the Treasury for an aggregate purchase price of $2.5 million. The purchase price was funded by a third party grant. As of this date, the Company is not bound by the TARP CDCI restrictions as the Treasury is no longer a common stockholder of the\nCompany.\nCarver has the following equity compensation plans:\n(1) The 2006 Stock Incentive Plan became effective in September 2006 and provides for discretionary option grants, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock to those employees and directors so selected by the Compensation Committee.\n(2) The Carver Bancorp, Inc. 2014 Equity Incentive Plan became effective in September 2014 and provides for discretionary option grants, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock to those officers and directors selected by the Company’s Compensation Committee.\nAdditional information regarding Carver's equity compensation plans is incorporated by reference from the section entitled \"Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans\" in the Proxy Statement (as defined below in Item 10).\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities; Use of Proceeds from Registered Securities\nThere were no unregistered securities to report which have not been previously included in a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or a Current Report on Form 8-K.\nITEM 6.

Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide information that is useful to investors in understanding\nthe Company's underlying operating performance and trends, and facilitates comparisons with the performance of other banks and thrifts.\nReturn on equity measures how efficiently we generate profits from the resources provided by our net assets. Return on average stockholders' equity is calculated by dividing annualized net income (loss) attributable to Carver by average stockholders' equity, excluding AOCI.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presented elsewhere in this report.\nExecutive Summary\nCarver concluded fiscal 2021 with a net loss of $3.9 million compared to net loss of $5.4 million for the prior year period. The change in our results of operations was primarily driven by increases in non-interest income and non-interest expense. The business climate continues to\npresent significant challenges as banks continue to absorb heightened regulatory costs and compete for limited loan demand. Carver continues to focus on diversifying its loan portfolio with C&I lending to local small businesses and strives to generate new loan production and to purchase loans\nat suitable prices. In addition, the Bank launched a program introducing new deposit products and expanded its digital online services into nine states across the Northeast and Washington D.C.\nCOVID-19 continues to have a significant, negative effect on families and businesses in New York and throughout the United States. While New York State went through a phased reopening upon expiration of an earlier executive order to shelter in place, maintain social distancing\nand close all non-essential businesses statewide, there remains a significant amount of uncertainty as certain geographic areas continue to experience surges in COVID-19 cases and governments at all levels continue to react to changes in circumstances. The prolonged pandemic, or any other\nepidemic of this sort that ultimately harms the global economy, the U.S. economy or the markets in which we operate could adversely affect Carver’s operations. The long-term effects of COVID-19 on the Company’s business cannot be ascertained as there remains significant uncertainty\nregarding the breadth and duration of business disruptions related to the virus. At this time, it is unknown if the easing of restrictions on individuals and businesses will continue and if and when businesses and their employees will be able to fully resume normal activities. In addition, new\ninformation may emerge regarding the severity of COVID-19 or the effectiveness of\n39\nthe vaccines developed, causing federal, state and local governments to take additional actions to contain COVID-19 or to treat its impact. Even after formal restrictions have been lifted, changes in the behavior of customers, businesses and their employees – including social distancing – as a\nresult of the pandemic, are unknown. The Company is closely monitoring its asset quality, liquidity, and capital positions. Management is actively working to minimize the current and future impact of this unprecedented situation, and is making adjustments to operations where appropriate or\nnecessary to help slow the spread of the virus. In addition, as a result of further actions that may be taken to contain or reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company may experience changes in the value of collateral securing outstanding loans, reductions in the credit quality of\nborrowers and the inability of borrowers to repay loans in accordance with their terms. The Company is actively managing the credit risk in its loan portfolio, including reviewing the industries that the Company believes are most likely to be impacted by emerging COVID-19 events. These and\nsimilar factors and events may have substantial negative effects on the business, financial condition, and results of operations of the Company and its customers.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nVarious elements of accounting policies, by their nature, are inherently subject to estimation techniques, valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments. Carver's policy with respect to the methodologies used to determine the allowance for loan and lease losses, securities\nimpairment, and assessment of the recoverability of the deferred tax asset are the most critical accounting policies. These policies are important to the presentation of Carver's financial condition and results of operations, and involve a high degree of complexity, requiring management to make\ndifficult and subjective judgments, which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters. Such assumptions and estimates are susceptible to significant changes in today's economic environment. Changes in these judgments, assumptions or estimates could result in\nmaterial differences in the Company's results of operations or financial condition.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nThe adequacy of the Bank's ALLL is determined in accordance with the Interagency Policy Statement on the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (the “Interagency Policy Statement”) released by the OCC on December 13, 2006, and in accordance with ASC Subtopics 450-20 \"Loss\nContingencies\" and 310-10 \"Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan.\" Compliance with the Interagency Policy Statement includes management's review of the Bank's loan portfolio, including the identification and review of individual problem situations that may affect a borrower's\nability to repay. In addition, management reviews the overall portfolio quality through an analysis of delinquency and non-performing loan data, estimates of the value of underlying collateral, current charge-offs and other factors that may affect the portfolio, including a review of regulatory\nexaminations, an assessment of current and expected economic conditions and changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio.\nThe ALLL reflects management's evaluation of the loans presenting identified loss potential, as well as the risk inherent in various components of the portfolio. There is significant judgment applied in estimating the ALLL. These assumptions and estimates are susceptible to\nsignificant changes based on the current environment. Further, any change in the size of the loan portfolio or any of its components could necessitate an increase in the ALLL even though there may not be a decline in credit quality or an increase in potential problem loans. As such, there can\nnever be assurance that the ALLL accurately reflects the actual loss potential inherent in a loan portfolio.\nGeneral Reserve Allowance\nCarver's maintenance of a general reserve allowance in accordance with ASC Subtopic 450-20 includes the Bank's evaluating the risk to loss potential of homogeneous pools of loans based upon historical loss factors and a review of nine different environmental factors that are then\napplied to each pool. The main pools of loans (“Loan Type”) are:\n• One-to-four family\n• Multifamily\n• Commercial Real Estate\n• Business Loans\n• Consumer (including Overdraft Accounts)\nThe Bank next applies to each pool a risk factor that determines the level of general reserves for that specific pool. The Bank estimates its historical charge-offs via a lookback analysis. The actual historical loss experience by major loan category is expressed as a percentage of the\noutstanding balance of all loans within the category. As the loss experience for a particular loan category increases or decreases, the level of reserves required for that particular loan category also increases or decreases. The Bank’s historical charge-off rate reflects the period over which the\ncharge-offs were confirmed and recognized, not the period over which the earlier losses occurred. That is, the charge-off rate measures the confirmation of losses over a\n40\nperiod that occurs after the earlier actual losses. During the period between the loss-causing events and the eventual confirmations of losses, conditions may have changed. There is always a time lag between the period over which average charge-off rates are calculated and the date of the\nfinancial statements. During that period, conditions may have changed. Another factor influencing the General Reserve is the Bank’s loss emergence period (\"LEP\") assumptions which represent the Bank’s estimate of the average amount of time from the point at which a loss is incurred to the\npoint at which the loss is confirmed, either through the identification of the loss or a charge-off. Based upon adequate management information systems and effective methodologies for estimating losses, management has established a LEP floor of one year on all pools. In some pools, such as\nin its Commercial Real Estate, Multifamily and Business pools, the Bank demonstrates a LEP in excess of 12 months. The Bank also recognizes losses in accordance with regulatory charge-off criteria.\nBecause actual loss experience may not adequately predict the level of losses inherent in a portfolio, the Bank reviews nine qualitative factors to determine if reserves should be adjusted based upon any of those factors. As the risk ratings worsen, some of the qualitative factors tend to\nincrease. The nine qualitative factors the Bank considers and may utilize are:\n1. Changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices not considered elsewhere in estimating credit losses (Policy & Procedures).\n2. Changes in relevant economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio, including the condition of various market segments (Economy).\n3. Changes in the nature or volume of the loan portfolio and in the terms of loans (Nature & Volume).\n4. Changes in the experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff (Management).\n5. Changes in the volume and severity of past due loans, the volume of nonaccrual loans, and the volume and severity of adversely classified loans (Problem Assets).\n6. Changes in the quality of the loan review system (Loan Review).\n7. Changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans (Collateral Values).\n8. The existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations (Concentrations).\n9. The effect of other external forces such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the existing portfolio (External Forces).\nSpecific Reserve Allowance\nCarver also maintains a specific reserve allowance for criticized and classified loans individually reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC Subtopic 310-10 guidelines. The amount assigned to the specific reserve allowance is individually determined based upon the loan. The\nASC Subtopic 310-10 guidelines require the use of one of three approved methods to estimate the amount to be reserved and/or charged off for such credits. The three methods are as follows:\n1. The present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate,\n2. The loan's observable market price; or\n3. The fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.\nThe Bank may choose the appropriate ASC Subtopic 310-10 measurement on a loan-by-loan basis for an individually impaired loan, except for an impaired collateral dependent loan. Guidance requires impairment of a collateral dependent loan to be measured using the fair value of\ncollateral method. A loan is considered \"collateral dependent\" when the repayment of the debt will be provided solely by the underlying collateral, and there are no other available and reliable sources of repayment.\nAll substandard and doubtful loans and any other loans that the Chief Credit Officer deems appropriate for review, are identified and reviewed for individual evaluation for impairment in accordance with ASC Subtopic 310-10. Carver also performs impairment analysis for all TDRs.\nIf it is determined that it is probable the Bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according with the contractual terms of the loan agreement, the loan is categorized as impaired. Loans determined to be impaired are evaluated to determine the amount of impairment based on one of the\nthree measurement methods noted above. In accordance with guidance, if there is no impairment amount, no reserve is established for the loan.\nTroubled Debt Restructured Loans\nTDRs are those loans whose terms have been modified because of deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower and a concession is made. Modifications could include extension of the terms of the loan, reduced interest rates, capitalization of interest and forgiveness of\naccrued interest and/or principal. Once an obligation has been restructured because of such credit problems, it continues to be considered restructured until paid in full. For cash flow dependent loans, the Bank records a specific valuation allowance reserve equal to the difference between the\npresent value of estimated future cash flows\n41\nunder the restructured terms discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate, and the loan's original carrying value. For a collateral dependent loan, the Bank records an impairment charge when the current estimated fair value of the property that collateralizes the impaired loan, if any, is\nless than the recorded investment in the loan. TDR loans remain on nonaccrual status until they have performed in accordance with the restructured terms for a period of at least six months.\nInteragency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus\nOn March 22, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interagency statement to provide additional guidance to financial institutions who are working with borrowers affected by COVID-19. The statement provided that agencies will not criticize institutions for working with\nborrowers and will not direct supervised institutions to automatically categorize all COVID-19 related loan modifications as troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”). The agencies have confirmed with staff of the Financial Accounting Standards Board that short-term modifications made on a\ngood faith basis in response to COVID-19 to borrowers who were current prior to any relief, are not TDRs. This includes short-term (e.g., six months) modifications such as payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or other delays in payment that are insignificant.\nBorrowers considered current are those that are less than 30 days past due on their contractual payments at the time a modification program is implemented.\nThe statement further provided that working with borrowers that are current on existing loans, either individually or as part of a program for creditworthy borrowers who are experiencing short-term financial or operational problems as a result of COVID-19, generally would not be\nconsidered TDRs. For modification programs designed to provide temporary relief for current borrowers affected by COVID-19, financial institutions may presume that borrowers that are current on payments are not experiencing financial difficulties at the time of the modification for\npurposes of determining TDR status, and thus no further TDR analysis is required for each loan modification in the program.\nThe statement indicated that the agencies’ examiners will exercise judgment in reviewing loan modifications, including TDRs, and will not automatically adversely risk rate credits that are affected by COVID-19, including those considered TDRs.\nIn addition, the statement noted that efforts to work with borrowers of one-to-four family residential mortgages, where the loans are prudently underwritten, and not past due or carried on nonaccrual status, will not result in the loans being considered restructured or modified for the\npurposes of their risk-based capital rules. With regard to loans not otherwise reportable as past due, financial institutions are not expected to designate loans with deferrals granted due to COVID-19 as past due because of the deferral.\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”)\nThe CARES Act, which became law on March 27, 2020, provide emergency economic relief to combat the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) and stimulate the economy. The law had several provisions relevant to financial institutions, including:\n• Allowing institutions not to characterize loan modifications relating to the COVID-19 pandemic as a troubled debt restructuring and also allowing them to suspend the corresponding impairment determination for accounting purposes.\n• The ability of a borrower of a federally backed mortgage loan (VA, FHA, USDA, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae) experiencing financial hardship due, directly or indirectly, to the COVID-19 pandemic to request forbearance from paying their mortgage by submitting a request to the\nborrower’s servicer affirming their financial hardship during the COVID-19 emergency. Such a forbearance will be granted for up to 180 days, which can be extended for an additional 180-day period upon the request of the borrower. During that time, no fees, penalties or interest\nbeyond the amounts scheduled or calculated as if the borrower made all contractual payments on time and in full under the mortgage contract will accrue on the borrower’s account. Except for vacant or abandoned property, the servicer of a federally backed mortgage is prohibited\nfrom taking any foreclosure action, including any eviction or sale action, for not less than the 60-day period beginning March 18, 2020.\n• The ability of a borrower of a multifamily federally backed mortgage loan that was current as of February 1, 2020, to submit a request for forbearance to the borrower’s servicer affirming that the borrower is experiencing financial hardship during the COVID-19 emergency. A\nforbearance will be granted for up to 30 days, which can be extended for up to two additional 30-day periods upon the request of the borrower. During the time of the forbearance, the multifamily borrower cannot evict or initiate the eviction of a tenant or charge any late fees, penalties\nor other charges\n42\nto a tenant for late payment of rent. Additionally, a multifamily borrower that receives a forbearance may not require a tenant to vacate a dwelling unit before a date that is 30 days after the date on which the borrower provides the tenant notice to vacate and may not issue a notice to\nvacate until after the expiration of the forbearance.\nCoronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2021 (the “CRRSA Act”)\nOn December 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2021 (\"CRRSA Act\") was signed into law, which also contains provisions that could directly impact financial institutions including extending the time that insured depository\ninstitutions and depository institution holding companies have to comply with the current expected credit losses (CECL) account standing and extending the authority granted to banks under the CARES Act to elect to temporarily suspend the requirements under U.S. GAAP applicable to\ntroubled debt restructurings for loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic for any loan that was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019. The act directs financial regulators to support community development financial institutions and minority depository\ninstitutions and directs Congress to re-appropriate $429 billion in unobligated CARES Act funds. The PPP, which was originally established under the CARES Act, was also extended under the CRRSA Act.\nSecurities Impairment\nThe Bank’s available-for-sale securities portfolio is carried at estimated fair value, with any unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. Securities that the Bank has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as\nheld-to-maturity and are carried at amortized cost. The fair values of securities in the Bank's portfolio are based on published or securities dealers’ market values and are affected by changes in interest rates. On a quarterly basis, the Bank reviews and evaluates the securities portfolio to\ndetermine if the decline in the fair value of any security below its cost basis is other-than-temporary. The Bank generally views changes in fair value caused by changes in interest rates as temporary, which is consistent with its experience. The amount of an other-than-temporary impairment,\nwhen there are credit and non-credit losses on a debt security which management does not intend to sell, and for which it is more likely than not that the Bank will not be required to sell the security prior to the recovery of the non-credit impairment, the portion of the total impairment that is\nattributable to the credit loss would be recognized in earnings, and the remaining difference between the debt security’s amortized cost basis and its fair value would be included in other comprehensive (loss) income. This guidance also requires additional disclosures about investments in an\nunrealized loss position and the methodology and significant inputs used in determining the recognition of other-than-temporary impairment. The Bank does not have any securities that are classified as having other-than-temporary impairment in its investment portfolio at March 31, 2021.\nDeferred Tax Assets\nThe Company records income taxes in accordance with ASC 740 Topic “Income Taxes,” as amended, using the asset and liability method. Income tax expense (benefit) consists of income taxes currently payable/(receivable) and deferred income taxes. Temporary differences\nbetween the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes are measured as of the balance sheet date. Deferred tax liabilities or recognizable deferred tax assets are calculated on such differences, using current statutory rates, which result in future taxable or deductible\namounts. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Where applicable, deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance for any portion determined not likely to be realized. Management is continually\nreviewing the operation of the Company with a view to the future. Based on management's current analysis and the appropriate accounting literature, management is of the opinion that a full valuation allowance is appropriate. This valuation allowance could subsequently be adjusted, by a\ncharge or credit to income tax expense, as changes in facts and circumstances warrant.\nOn June 29, 2011, the Company raised $55 million of equity, which resulted in a $51.4 million increase in equity after considering the effect of various expenses associated with the capital raise. The capital raise triggered a change in control under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue\nCode. Generally, Section 382 limits the utilization of an entity's net operating loss carryforwards, general business credits, and recognized built-in losses upon a change in ownership. The Company is currently subject to an annual limitation of approximately $870 thousand. A valuation\nallowance for net deferred tax asset of $23.7 million has been recorded. The valuation allowance was initially recorded during fiscal 2011, and has remained through March 31, 2021, as management concluded and continues to conclude that it is “more likely than not” that the Company will\nnot be able to fully realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets. However, tax legislation passed during the Company's fiscal year 2018 now permits a corporation to receive refunds for AMT credits even if there is no taxable income. As a result, at March 31, 2018, the valuation allowance was\nreduced by $340 thousand, the amount of the Company's AMT credits. The amount of the AMT credits recorded as a deferred tax asset was $0 at March 31, 2020. The AMT credit was $143 thousand as\n43\nof March 31, 2020, all of which was requested to be refunded to the Company upon the recently filed fiscal year 2020 federal tax return.\nAsset/Liability Management\nThe Company's primary earnings source is net interest income, which is affected by changes in the level of interest rates, the relationship between the rates on interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the impact of interest rate fluctuations on asset prepayments, the level\nand composition of deposits and assets, and the credit quality of earning assets. Management's asset/liability objectives are to maintain a strong, stable net interest margin, to utilize the Company's capital effectively without taking undue risks, to maintain adequate liquidity and to manage its\nexposure to changes in interest rates.\nThe economic environment is uncertain regarding future interest rate trends. Management monitors the Company's cumulative gap position, which is the difference between the sensitivity to rate changes on the Company's interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. In\naddition, the Company uses various tools to monitor and manage interest rate risk, such as a model that projects net interest income based on increasing or decreasing interest rates.\nDiscussion of Market Risk-Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis\nAs a financial institution, the Bank's primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of the Company's assets and liabilities, and the market value of all\ninterest-earning assets, other than those which are short-term in maturity. Based upon the Company's nature of operations, it is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk. The Company does not own any trading assets.\nThe Company seeks to manage its interest rate risk by monitoring and controlling the variation in repricing intervals between its assets and liabilities. To a lesser extent, it also monitors its interest rate sensitivity by analyzing the estimated changes in market value of its assets and\nliabilities assuming various interest rate scenarios. As discussed more fully below, there are a variety of factors that influence the repricing characteristics of any given asset or liability.\nThe matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are “interest rate sensitive” and by monitoring an institution's interest rate sensitivity gap. An asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific period\nif it will mature or reprice within that period. The interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific period of time and the amount of interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same\ntime period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets. Generally,\nduring a period of falling interest rates, a negative gap could result in an increase in net interest income, while a positive gap could adversely affect net interest income. Conversely, during a period of rising interest rates a negative gap could adversely affect net interest income, while a positive\ngap could result in an increase in net interest income. As illustrated below, the Company had a positive one-year gap equal to 17.64% of total rate sensitive assets at March 31, 2021. As a result, the Company's net interest income may be positively affected by rising interest rates and may be\nnegatively affected by falling interest rates.\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the projected maturities, prepayments and repricing of the major rate-sensitive asset and liability categories of the Company as of March 31, 2021. Maturity repricing dates have been projected by applying estimated prepayment\nrates based on the current rate environment. The repricing and other assumptions are not necessarily representative of the Company's actual results.

Although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in the market interest rates. The interest rates on certain\ntypes of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates. Certain assets, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, generally have features that restrict changes in interest\nrates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. In the event of a change in interest rates, prepayments and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table. Additionally, credit risk may increase as many borrowers may experience\nan inability to service their debt in the event of a rise in interest rate. Virtually all of the adjustable-rate loans in the Company's portfolio contain conditions that restrict the periodic change in interest rate.\nEconomic Value of Equity (“EVE”) Analysis. As part of its efforts to maximize net interest income while managing risks associated with changing interest rates, management also uses the EVE methodology. EVE is the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets\nless the present value of expected cash flows from existing liabilities plus the present value of net expected cash inflows from existing financial derivatives and off-balance sheet contracts. At March 31, 2021, the Company did not report any holdings in financial derivative contracts.\nUnder this methodology, interest rate risk exposure is assessed by reviewing the estimated changes in EVE that would hypothetically occur if interest rates rapidly rise or fall along the yield curve. Projected values of EVE at both higher and lower interest rate risk scenarios are\ncompared to base case values (no change in rates) to determine the sensitivity to changing interest rates.\nPresented below, as of March 31, 2021, is an analysis of the Company's interest rate risk as measured by changes in EVE for instantaneous parallel shifts of +400/-200 basis points change in market interest rates. Such limits have been established with consideration of the impact of\nvarious rate changes and the Compamy's current capital position.\n45\n$ in thousands Economic Value of Equity\nChange in Rate $ Amount $ Change % Change\n+400 bps 109,000 40,000 58.0 %\n+300 bps 104,000 35,000 50.7 %\n+200 bps 96,000 27,000 39.1 %\n+100 bps 85,000 16,000 23.2 %\n0 bps 69,000\n-100 bps 43,000 (26,000) (37.7)%\n-200 bps 8,000 (61,000) (88.4)%\nCertain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes in EVE require the making of certain assumptions, which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market\ninterest rates. In this regard, the models presented assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly\nacross the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the EVE table provides an indication of the Company's interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not\nprovide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the Company's net interest income and may differ from actual results.\nAverage Balance, Interest and Average Yields and Rates\nThe following table sets forth certain information relating to Carver Federal's average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities, and their related average yields and costs for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019. The table also presents information for\nthe fiscal years indicated with respect to the difference between the weighted average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the weighted average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, or “interest rate spread,” which savings institutions have traditionally used as an indicator of\nprofitability. Another indicator of an institution's profitability is its “net interest margin,” which is its net interest income divided by the average balance of interest-earning assets. Net interest income is affected by the interest rate spread and by the relative amounts of interest-earning assets\nand interest-bearing liabilities. When interest-earning assets approximate or exceed interest-bearing liabilities, any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income:\n46\n2021 2020 2019\nAverage Average Average\nYield/ Yield/ Yield/\n$ in thousands Average Balance Interest Cost Average Balance Interest Cost Average Balance Interest Cost\nInterest-Earning Assets:\nLoans (1) $ 456,112 $ 18,552 4.07 % $ 423,454 $ 18,959 4.48 % $ 442,218 $ 19,470 4.40 %\nMortgage-backed securities 41,513 708 1.71 % 49,407 1,230 2.49 % 52,002 1,265 2.43 %\nInvestment securities 50,727 953 1.88 % 37,717 868 2.30 % 51,505 1,252 2.43 %\nOther investments 90,857 94 0.10 % 32,364 570 1.76 % 63,555 1,243 1.96 %\nTotal interest-earning assets 639,209 20,307 3.18 % 542,942 21,627 3.99 % 609,280 23,230 3.81 %\nNon-interest-earning assets 27,704 30,207 10,135\nTotal assets $ 666,913 $ 573,149 $ 619,415\nInterest-Bearing Liabilities:\nDeposits\nInterest-bearing checking $ 37,313 $ 30 0.08 % $ 23,765 $ 29 0.12 % $ 25,159 $ 30 0.12 %\nSavings and clubs 107,820 235 0.22 % 97,453 256 0.26 % 100,838 265 0.26 %\nMoney market 125,867 525 0.42 % 100,796 533 0.53 % 98,061 466 0.48 %\nCertificates of deposit 192,637 2,974 1.54 % 188,285 3,799 2.02 % 250,260 4,427 1.77 %\nMortgagors deposits 2,257 6 0.27 % 2,219 23 1.04 % 2,142 44 2.05 %\nTotal deposits 465,894 3,770 0.81 % 412,518 4,640 1.12 % 476,460 5,232 1.10 %\nBorrowed money 38,005 650 1.71 % 21,600 991 4.59 % 17,521 909 5.19 %\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 503,899 4,420 0.88 % 434,118 5,631 1.30 % 493,981 6,141 1.24 %\nNon-interest-bearing liabilities:\nDemand deposits 85,890 58,548 59,525\nOther liabilities 29,818 28,874 19,989\nTotal liabilities 619,607 521,540 573,495\nStockholders' equity 47,306 51,609 45,920\nTotal liabilities & equity $ 666,913 $ 573,149 $ 619,415\nNet interest income $ 15,887 $ 15,996 $ 17,089\nAverage interest rate spread 2.30 % 2.69 % 2.57 %\nNet interest margin 2.49 % 2.95 % 2.80 %\nRatio of average interest-earning assets to interest-bearing liabilities 126.85 % 125.07 % 123.34 %\n(1) Includes nonaccrual loans.\n(2) Includes FHLB-NY stock.\nRate/Volume Analysis\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest related assets and liabilities have affected the Company's interest income and expense during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 (in\nthousands).

The increase was attributable to a $28.1 million increase in cash and cash equivalents, and increases of $54.6 million and\n$18.3 million in the Bank's net loan and investment portfolios, respectively.\nTotal cash and cash equivalents increased $28.1 million, or 59.2%, from $47.5 million at March 31, 2020 to $75.6 million at March 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in total deposits of $67.8 million and a $23.6 million increase in advances from the FHLB and other borrowings.\nThese increases were partially offset by investment purchases and loan originations and purchases.\nTotal investment securities increased $18.3 million, or 24.1%, to $94.3 million at March 31, 2021, compared to $76.0 million at March 31, 2020. The Bank sold $37.8 million of securities out of the available-for-sale portfolio, recognizing gains of $1.2 million during the current fiscal year.\nThe proceeds were reinvested along with excess cash towards new securities purchases with a higher yield as part of management's strategy to restructure the Bank's investment portfolio and to improve its overall mix and duration.\nGross portfolio loans increased $54.8 million to $483.5 million at March 31, 2021, compared to $428.7 million at March 31, 2020, primarily due to new loan originations of $114.5 million, of which $41.9 million were part of the SBA's Paycheck Protection Program (\"PPP\"), and $26.8\nmillion were from loan pool purchases. The new volume was partially offset by attrition and payoffs of $86.5 million, primarily in residential and non-owner occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans.\nLiabilities and Equity\nLiabilities\nTotal liabilities increased $94.5 million, or 17.8%, to $624.4 million at March 31, 2021, compared to $529.9 million at March 31, 2020, primarily due to increases in total deposits and other borrowings related to the PPP.\nDeposits increased $67.8 million, or 13.9%, to $556.6 million at March 31, 2021, compared to $488.8 million at March 31, 2020, due primarily to PPP loan funds deposited by the program borrowers into their accounts at the Bank and new\n48\ndeposit account relationships established as the Bank launched a program introducing new products and expanded its digital online account openings into nine states across the Northeast and Washington D.C.\nAdvances from the FHLB-NY and other borrowed money increased $23.6 million to $37.2 million at March 31, 2021, compared to $13.6 million at March 31, 2020 as the Bank secured advances on its PPP liquidity facility (\"PPPLF\") at the Federal Reserve to fund PPP loans. At March 31,\n2021, the Bank had no outstanding borrowings from the FHLB-NY.\nEquity\nTotal equity increased $3.4 million, or 7.0%, to $52.3 million at March 31, 2021, compared to $48.9 million at March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to capital raised from several equity transactions that were completed outside of the ordinary course of business during the\nfiscal year. These were partially offset by an increase of $4.1 million in unrealized losses on securities available-for-sale and a net loss of $3.9 million for the fiscal year.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended March 31, 2021 and 2020\nNet Loss\nThe Company reported a net loss of $3.9 million for fiscal year 2021, compared to net loss of $5.4 million for the prior year period. The change in our results was primarily driven by an increase in non-interest income and recoveries of loan losses compared to a provision for loan loss in the\nprior year, which were partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense and decline in net interest income compared to the prior fiscal year.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income decreased $0.1 million, or 0.6%, to $15.9 million for fiscal year 2021, compared to $16.0 million for the prior year period. The decrease was attributable to a $1.3 million decrease in interest income, partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease in interest expense for the\nperiod.\nInterest income decreased $1.3 million, or 6.0%, to $20.3 million, compared to $21.6 million for the prior year period. Interest income on mortgage-backed securities decreased $0.5 million due to a decline in average balances and rates compared to the prior year. Interest income on money\nmarket investments decreased $0.5 million as the $58.9 million increase in the average balance of the Bank's interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve Bank was offset by a 1.77% decrease in interest rates. Interest income on loans decreased $0.4 million, or 2.1%, comprised of a decrease\nof $1.9 million due to a 41 basis-point decline in the overall yield of the loan portfolio resulting primarily from attrition of above market-rate purchased residential loans, which also caused acceleration of premiums. This was partially offset by an increase in interest income of $1.5 million due\nto a $32.7 million increase in average loan balances.\nInterest expense decreased $1.2 million, or 21.4%, to $4.4 million compared to $5.6 million for the prior year period. Interest expense on deposits decreased $0.8 million, or 17.4%, primarily due to a decrease in the average rates of certificates of deposit. Interest expense on borrowings\ndecreased $0.3 million, or 30.0%, from the prior fiscal year despite an increase in the average borrowings as the Bank secured advances on the PPPLF at the Federal Reserve at a lower cost to borrow of 35 basis points in order to support its PPP program.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe Bank recorded a $0.1 million recovery of loan loss for fiscal year 2021, compared to a $19 thousand provision for loan losses for the prior year period. The prior year provision was primarily related to overdraft deposit chargeoffs. For the year ended March 31, 2021, net recoveries of\n$294 thousand were recognized, compared to net recoveries of $281 thousand in the prior year period. Total chargeoffs of $78 thousand were recognized for fiscal year 2021, compared to total chargeoffs of $183 thousand for the prior fiscal year. At March 31, 2021, nonaccrual loans totaled\n$7.2 million, or 1.1% of total assets, compared to $6.8 million, or 1.2% of total assets at March 31, 2020. The ALLL was $5.1 million at March 31, 2021, which represents a ratio of the ALLL to nonaccrual loans of 71.5%, compared to 73.0% at March 31, 2020. The ratio of the allowance for\nloan losses to total loans receivable was 1.06% at March 31, 2021, compared to 1.15% at March 31, 2020.\nNon-interest Income\nNon-interest income for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021 increased $2.5 million, or 67.6%, to $6.2 million compared to $3.7 million in the prior year period. Other non-interest income for the current fiscal year included $1.2 million\n49\nfees earned from a new correspondent banking relationship and $0.5 million grant income provided by UBS for the Company to extend working capital loans and financial education to small businesses owned and operated by minorities. In addition, non-interest income included $1.2 million\ngains recognized from the sales of securities during the fiscal year, as management restructured the Bank's investment portfolio. These increases were partially offset by lower depository fees compared to the prior fiscal year due to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on branch\nactivities.\nNon-interest Expense\nNon-interest expense for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021 increased $1.0 million, or 4.0%, to $26.1 million compared to $25.1 million for the the prior year period. Net equipment and data processing costs were higher compared to the prior fiscal year due to new hardware/software\ncontracts related to technology upgrades required to facilitate the infrastructure for a remote work environment due to the ongoing pandemic, and one-time conversion costs associated with the Bank's upgrade to a new core banking system. In addition, FDIC premiums were lower in the prior\nyear since the Bank was eligible for the FDIC small bank assessment credit.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company did not have any federal, state and local income tax expense as of March 31, 2021 and 2020. State and local capital tax expenses of $0.1 million and $0.2 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively, were included in other non-interest expense on the statements of\noperations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity is a measure of the Bank's ability to generate adequate cash to meet its financial obligations. The principal cash requirements of a financial institution are to cover potential deposit outflows, fund increases in its loan and investment portfolios and ongoing operating\nexpenses. The Bank's primary sources of funds are deposits, borrowed funds and principal and interest payments on loans, mortgage-backed securities and investment securities. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans, mortgage-backed securities and investment securities are\npredictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan and mortgage-backed securities prepayments are strongly influenced by changes in general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. Carver Federal monitors its liquidity utilizing guidelines that are contained in a policy developed\nby its management and approved by its Board of Directors. Carver Federal's several liquidity measurements are evaluated on a frequent basis.\nManagement believes Carver Federal’s short-term assets have sufficient liquidity to cover loan demand, potential fluctuations in deposit accounts and to meet other anticipated cash requirements, including interest payments on our subordinated debt securities. Additionally, Carver\nFederal has other sources of liquidity including the ability to borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (\"FHLB-NY\") utilizing unpledged mortgage-backed securities and certain mortgage loans, the sale of available-for-sale securities and the sale of certain mortgage loans. Net\nborrowings increased $23.6 million during fiscal year 2021 as the Bank secured advances on the PPP liquidity facility (\"PPPLF\") at the Federal Reserve at a rate of 35 basis points to fund PPP loans. The Bank had no advances outstanding from the FHLB-NY at March 31, 2021. At March 31,\n2021, based on available collateral held at the FHLB-NY, Carver Federal had the ability to borrow an additional $42.7 million on a secured basis, utilizing mortgage-related loans and securities as collateral. The bank has the ability to pledge additional loans as collateral in order to borrow up to\n30% of its total assets.\nThe Bank's most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments. The level of these assets is dependent on the Bank's operating, investing and financing activities during any given period. At March 31, 2021 and 2020, assets qualifying for short-term liquidity, including cash and\ncash equivalents, totaled $75.6 million and $47.5 million, respectively.\nThe most significant potential liquidity challenge the Bank faces is variability in its cash flows as a result of mortgage refinance activity. When mortgage interest rates decline, customers’ refinance activities tend to accelerate, causing the cash flow from both the mortgage loan\nportfolio and the mortgage-backed securities portfolio to accelerate. In contrast, when mortgage interest rates increase, refinance activities tend to slow, causing a reduction of liquidity. However, in a rising rate environment, customers generally tend to prefer fixed rate mortgage loan products\nover variable rate products. Carver Federal is also at risk to deposit outflows due to a competitive interest rate environment.\nThe Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows present the change in cash from operating, investing and financing activities. During fiscal year 2021, total cash and cash equivalents increased $28.1 million to $75.6 million reflecting cash provided by financing activities of $102.8 million\nand cash provided by operating activities of $2.2 million, partially offset by cash used in investing activities of $77.0 million. Net cash provided by financing activities of $102.8 million resulted from net\n50\nincreases in deposits and borrowings of $67.7 million and $23.7 million, respectively. The net increase in deposits was primarily due to PPP loan funds deposited by the program borrowers into their accounts at the Bank and new deposit account relationships established across the Northeast as\nthe Bank launched a program introducing new products and expanded its digital online account openings into nine states and Washington D.C. The $23.7 million increase in other borrowings was attributable to advances secured on the Bank's PPP liquidity facility at the Federal Reserve to\nfund PPP loans. In addition, the Company raised capital through the issuance of common and preferred shares. Net cash used in investing activities of $77.0 million was attributable to securities purchases and loan originations and purchases, net of principal repayments and payoffs.\nPotential Mortgage Representation and Warranty Liabilities\nDuring the period 2004 through 2009, the Bank originated 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and sold the loans to the FNMA. The loans were sold to FNMA with the standard representations and warranties for loans sold to the GSE's. The Bank may be required to repurchase\nthese loans in the event of breaches of these representations and warranties. In the event of a repurchase, the Bank is typically required to pay the unpaid principal balance as well as outstanding interest and fees. The Bank then recovers the loan or, if the loan has been foreclosed, the underlying\ncollateral. The Bank is exposed to any losses on repurchased loans after giving effect to any recoveries on the collateral.\nThrough fiscal 2011, none of the loans sold to FNMA were repurchased by the Bank. During the periods from fiscal 2012 through 2015, 20 loans that had been sold to FNMA were repurchased by the Bank. No loans have been repurchased by the Bank subsequent to fiscal 2015. At\nMarch 31, 2021 the Bank continues to service 100 loans with a principal balance of $16.4 million for FNMA that were sold with standard representations and warranties.\nManagement has established a representation and warranty reserve for losses associated with the repurchase of mortgage loans sold by the Bank to FNMA that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable. These reserves are reported in the consolidated statement of\nfinancial condition as a component of other liabilities. The Bank has not received a request to repurchase any of these loans since the second quarter of fiscal 2015, and there have not been any additional requests from FNMA for loans to be reviewed. The reserves totaled $181 thousand as of\nMarch 31, 2021. The table below summarizes changes in our representation and warranty reserves in fiscal 2021:\n$ in thousands March 31, 2021\nRepresentation and warranty repurchase reserve, as of March 31, 2020 (1) $ 226\nNet adjustment to reserve for repurchase losses (2) (45)\nRepresentation and warranty repurchase reserve, as of March 31, 2021 (1) $ 181\n(1) Reported in consolidated statements of financial condition as a component of other liabilities.\n(2) Component of other non-interest expense.\nAdditional information related to the representation and warranty reserve, including factors that may impact the adequacy of the reserves and the ultimate amount of losses incurred is found in “Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies.”\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\nThe Bank is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers and in connection with its overall investment strategy. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate\nand liquidity risk. In accordance with GAAP, these instruments are not recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Such instruments primarily include lending obligations, including commitments to originate mortgage and consumer loans and to fund unused lines of credit. The Bank\nalso has contractual obligations related to operating leases. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the Bank's outstanding lending commitments and contractual obligations at March 31, 2021.\n51\nThe Bank has contractual obligations at March 31, 2021 as follows:\n$ in thousands Payments due by period\nLess than 1 - 3 3 - 5 More than\nContractual Obligations Total 1 year years years 5 years\nCertificates of deposit $ 152,751 $ 114,045 $ 28,351 $ 10,259 $ 96\nDebt obligations:\nOther borrowings 23,895 72 23,820 3 —\nGuaranteed preferred beneficial interest in junior subordinated debentures 16,513 — — — 16,513\nTotal debt obligations 40,408 72 23,820 3 16,513\nOperating lease obligations:\nLease obligations for rental properties 18,564 2,748 5,293 4,907 5,616\nTotal contractual obligations $ 211,723 $ 116,865 $ 57,464 $ 15,169 $ 22,225\nVariable Interest Entities (\"VIEs\")\nThe Company's subsidiary, Carver Statutory Trust I, is not consolidated with Carver Bancorp Inc. for financial reporting purposes in accordance with the FASB's ASC Topic 810 regarding the consolidation of variable interest entities. Carver Statutory Trust I was formed in 2003 for\nthe purpose of issuing $13 million aggregate liquidation amount of floating rate Capital Securities due September 17, 2033 (“Capital Securities”) and $0.4 million of common securities (which are the only voting securities of Carver Statutory Trust I), which are 100% owned by Carver Bancorp\nInc., and using the proceeds to acquire junior subordinated debentures issued by Carver Bancorp, Inc. Carver Bancorp, Inc. has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the Capital Securities along with all obligations of Carver Statutory Trust I under the trust agreement relating to the Capital\nSecurities.\nThe Bank's subsidiary, CCDC, was formed to facilitate its participation in local economic development and other community-based activities. In June 2006, CCDC was selected by the U.S. Department of Treasury, in a highly competitive process, to receive an award of $59 million in\nNMTC. CCDC won a second NMTC award of $65 million in May 2009, and a third award of $25 million in August 2011. The NMTC awards provide a credit to Carver Federal against federal income taxes when the Bank makes qualified investments. The credits are allocated over seven years\nfrom the time of the qualified investment. Alternatively, the Bank can utilize the awards in projects where another investor entity provides funding and receives the tax benefits of the award in exchange for the Bank receiving fee income.\nCCDC provides funding to underlying projects. While providing funding to investments in the NMTC eligible projects, CCDC retained a 0.01% interest in other special purpose entities created to facilitate the investments, with the investors owning the remaining 99.99%. CCDC also\nprovides certain administrative services to these entities and receives servicing fee income during the term of the qualifying projects. The Bank has determined that it and CCDC do not have the sole power to direct the activities of these special purpose entities that significantly impact the\nentities' performance, and therefore are not the primary beneficiaries of these entities. The Bank has a contingent obligation to reimburse the investors for any loss or shortfall incurred as a result of the NMTC project not being in compliance with certain regulations that would void the\ninvestor's ability to otherwise utilize tax credits stemming from the award. The NMTC compliance period was completed for all these entities, which were dissolved upon exiting the NMTC projects.\nThe Bank's unconsolidated VIEs, in which the Company holds significant variable interests or has continuing involvement through servicing a majority of assets in a VIE are presented in the table below.\nInvolvement with SPE (000s) Funded Exposure Unfunded Exposure Total\nRecognized Gain (Loss) Total Involvement with SPE\n(000's) Total Rights transferred Significant unconsolidated VIE assets asset Debt Investments Equity Investments Funding Commitments Maximum exposure to loss\nCarver Statutory Trust I(1) $ — $ — $ 13,400 $ 13,400 $ 16,110 $ 400 $ — $ — $ 16,510 .\n1 Carver Statutory Trust debt investment includes deferred interest of $3.1 million, which was paid on June 16, 2021.\nRegulatory Capital Position\n52\nThe Bank must satisfy minimum capital standards established by the OCC. For a description of the OCC capital regulation, see “Item 1-Regulation and Supervision-Federal Banking Regulation-Capital Requirements.” Regardless of Basel III's minimum requirements, Carver, as a\nresult of the Formal Agreement, was issued an Individual Minimum Capital Ratio letter by the OCC, which requires the Bank to maintain minimum regulatory capital levels of 9% for its Tier 1 leverage ratio and 12% for its total risk-based capital ratio.\nAt March 31, 2021, the Bank had a common equity Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, and total risk-based capital ratio of 14.41%, 10.01%, 14.41% and 15.56%, respectively. For additional information regarding Carver Federal's Regulatory Capital and\nRatios, refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, “Stockholders' Equity.”\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere herein have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative\npurchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of Carver Federal's operations. Unlike most industrial companies, nearly all the assets and liabilities of the Bank are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a greater\nimpact on Carver Federal's performance than do the effects of the general level of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.\nITEM 7A.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n53\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nShareholders and Board of Directors\nCarver Bancorp, Inc.\nNew York, New York\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated financial condition of Carver Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended\nMarch 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at March 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended March 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The\nCompany is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the\neffectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the\namounts and disclosures in the Consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Consolidated financial statements. We believe that our\naudits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the\nconsolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the\ncritical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAllowance for loan losses\nAs described in Notes 2 and 4 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, the Company has a gross loan portfolio of $483.5 million and related allowance for loan losses of $5.1 million as of March 31, 2021. The allowance for loan losses includes a general reserve of $5.0 million and\na specific reserve of $0.1 million. In calculating the general reserve component of the allowance for loan losses, the Company segregates the loan portfolio by loan pools and utilizes nine qualitative factors in addition to quantitative factors (historical loss experience).\nWe identified the qualitative factors used by management to estimate the general reserve portion of the allowance for loan losses, specifically the economic factor, as a critical audit matter. Significant management judgment is required in the evaluation of the economic factor, which include\nconsideration of local, national economic trends, and the impact of\n54\nCOVID-19. Auditing these complex judgments and assumptions involves especially challenging auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit evidence and effort required to address these matters.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n• Evaluating the reasonableness of assumptions used by management in forming the economic factor, by assessing whether the assumptions reflected relevant considerations and were reasonable and reliable for the purpose used.\n• Evaluating the appropriateness of the data used by management in developing the economic factor by comparing it to third-party data and evaluating any contradictory evidence identified.\n/s/ BDO USA, LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2016.\nNew York, New York\nJune 29, 2021\n55\nCARVER BANCORP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1. ORGANIZATION\nNature of operations\nCarver Bancorp, Inc. (on a stand-alone basis, the “Company” or “Registrant”), was incorporated in May 1996 and its principal wholly-owned subsidiaries are Carver Federal Savings Bank (the “Bank” or “Carver Federal”) and Alhambra Holding Corp., an inactive Delaware\ncorporation. Carver Federal's wholly-owned subsidiaries are CFSB Realty Corp., Carver Community Development Corporation (“CCDC”) and CFSB Credit Corp., which is currently inactive. The Bank has a real estate investment trust, Carver Asset Corporation (\"CAC\"), that was formed in\nFebruary 2004.\n“Carver,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” refers to the Company along with its consolidated subsidiaries. The Bank was chartered in 1948 and began operations in 1949 as Carver Federal Savings and Loan Association, a federally-chartered mutual savings and loan association.\nThe Bank converted to a federal savings bank in 1986. On October 24, 1994, the Bank converted from a mutual holding company structure to stock form and issued 2,314,375 shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share. On October 17, 1996, the Bank completed its reorganization\ninto a holding company structure (the “Reorganization”) and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.\nCarver Federal’s principal business consists of attracting deposit accounts through its branches and investing those funds in mortgage loans and other investments permitted by federal savings banks. The Bank has seven branches located throughout the City of New York that primarily\nserve the communities in which they operate.\nIn September 2003, the Company formed Carver Statutory Trust I (the “Trust”) for the sole purpose of issuing trust preferred securities and investing the proceeds in an equivalent amount of floating rate junior subordinated debentures of the Company. In accordance with Accounting\nStandards Codification (“ASC”) 810, “Consolidation,” Carver Statutory Trust I is unconsolidated for financial reporting purposes. On September 17, 2003, Carver Statutory Trust I issued 13,000 shares, liquidation amount $1,000 per share, of floating rate capital securities. Gross proceeds\nfrom the sale of these trust preferred debt securities of $13 million, and proceeds from the sale of the trust's common securities of $0.4 million, were used to purchase approximately $13.4 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's floating rate junior subordinated debt securities due\n2033. The trust preferred debt securities are redeemable at par quarterly at the option of the Company beginning on or after September 17, 2008, and have a mandatory redemption date of September 17, 2033. Cash distributions on the trust preferred debt securities are cumulative and payable\nat a floating rate per annum resetting quarterly with a margin of 3.05% over the three-month LIBOR. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, the Company applied for and was granted regulatory approval to settle all outstanding debenture interest payments through September 2016.\nSuch payments were made in September 2016. Interest on the debentures has been deferred beginning with the December 2016 payment, per the terms of the agreement, which permit such deferral for up to twenty consecutive quarters, as the Company is prohibited from making payments\nwithout prior regulatory approval. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, the Company applied for and was granted regulatory approval to settle all outstanding debenture interest payments through June 2021. Full payment was made on June 16, 2021. The interest rate was 3.23% and the\ntotal amount of deferred interest was $3.1 million at March 31, 2021.\nCarver relies primarily on dividends from Carver Federal to pay cash dividends to its stockholders, to engage in share repurchase programs and to pay principal and interest on its trust preferred debt obligation. The OCC regulates all capital distributions, including dividend payments, by\nCarver Federal to Carver, and the FRB regulates dividends paid by Carver. As the subsidiary of a savings and loan association holding company, Carver Federal must file a notice or an application (depending on the proposed dividend amount) with the OCC (and a notice with the FRB) prior to\nthe declaration of each capital distribution. The OCC will disallow any proposed dividend, for among other reasons, that would result in Carver Federal’s failure to meet the OCC minimum capital requirements. In accordance with the Agreement defined directly below, Carver Federal is\ncurrently prohibited from paying any dividends without prior OCC approval, and, as such, has suspended Carver’s regular quarterly cash dividend on its common stock. There are no assurances that dividend payments to Carver will resume.\nRegulation\nOn October 23, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted resolutions requiring, among other things, written approval from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia prior to the declaration or payment of dividends, any increase in debt by the Company, or the redemption\nof Company common stock.\n61\nOn May 24, 2016, the Bank entered into a Formal Agreement (\"the Agreement\") with the OCC to undertake certain compliance-related and other actions as further described in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(“SEC”) on May 27, 2016. As a result of the Agreement, the Bank must obtain the approval of the OCC prior to effecting any change in its directors or senior executive officers. The Bank may not declare or pay dividends or make any other capital distributions, including to the Company,\nwithout first filing an application with the OCC and receiving the prior approval of the OCC. Furthermore, the Bank must seek the OCC's written approval and the FDIC's written concurrence before entering into any \"golden parachute payments\" as that term is defined under 12 U.S.C. §\n1828(k) and 12 C.F.R. Part 359. As a result of the Formal Agreement, Carver was issued an Individual Minimum Capital Ratio (\"IMCR\") letter by the OCC, which requires the Bank to maintain minimum regulatory capital levels of 9% for its Tier 1 leverage ratio and 12% for its total risk-\nbased capital ratio.\nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of consolidated financial statement presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, the Bank and the Bank's wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiaries, Carver Asset Corporation, CFSB Realty Corp., CCDC, and CFSB Credit Corp., which is currently inactive. All significant\nintercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated statement of financial condition and revenues and expenses for the period then ended. Amounts subject to significant estimates and assumptions are items such as the allowance for loan losses, realization of deferred tax assets, assessment\nof other-than-temporary impairment of securities, and the fair value of financial instruments. While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, future additions to the allowance for loan losses or future writedowns of real estate owned may be necessary based on\nchanges in economic conditions in the areas where Carver Federal has extended mortgages and other credit instruments. Actual results could differ significantly from those assumptions. Current market conditions increase the risk and complexity of the judgments in these estimates.\nIn addition, the OCC, Carver Federal's regulator, as an integral part of its examination process, periodically reviews Carver Federal's allowance for loan losses and, if applicable, real estate owned valuations. The OCC may require Carver Federal to recognize additions to the allowance\nfor loan losses or additional writedowns of real estate owned based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.\nRecent Events\nCOVID-19 continues to have a significant, negative effect on families and businesses in New York and throughout the United States. While New York State went through a phased reopening upon expiration of an earlier executive order to shelter in place, maintain social distancing\nand close all non-essential businesses statewide, there remains a significant amount of uncertainty as certain geographic areas continue to experience surges in COVID-19 cases and governments at all levels continue to react to changes in circumstances. The prolonged pandemic, or any other\nepidemic of this sort that ultimately harms the global economy, the U.S. economy or the markets in which we operate could adversely affect Carver’s operations. The long-term effects of COVID-19 on the Company’s business cannot be ascertained as there remains significant uncertainty\nregarding the breadth and duration of business disruptions related to the virus. At this time, it is unknown if the easing of restrictions on individuals and businesses will continue and if and when businesses and their employees will be able to fully resume normal activities. In addition, new\ninformation may emerge regarding the severity of COVID-19 or the effectiveness of the vaccines developed, causing federal, state and local governments to take additional actions to contain COVID-19 or to treat its impact. Even after formal restrictions have been lifted, changes in the\nbehavior of customers, businesses and their employees – including social distancing – as a result of the pandemic, are unknown. The Company is closely monitoring its asset quality, liquidity, and capital positions. Management is actively working to minimize the current and future impact of\nthis unprecedented situation, and is making adjustments to operations where appropriate or necessary to help slow the spread of the virus. In addition, as a result of further actions that may be taken to contain or reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company may experience\nchanges in the value of collateral securing outstanding loans, reductions in the credit quality of borrowers and the inability of borrowers to repay loans in accordance with their terms. The Company is actively managing the credit risk in its loan portfolio, including reviewing the industries that\nthe Company believes are most likely to be impacted by emerging COVID-19 events. These and similar factors and events may have substantial negative effects on the business, financial condition, and results of operations of the Company and its customers.\n62\nCash and cash equivalents\nFor the purpose of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash, amounts due from depository institutions and other short-term instruments with an original maturity of three months or less. The amounts due from depository institutions include an interest-bearing\naccount held at the Federal Reserve Bank where any additional cash reserve required on demand deposits would be maintained. Currently, this reserve requirement is zero since the Bank's vault cash satisfies cash reserve requirements for deposits.\nInvestment Securities\nWhen purchased, debt securities are designated as either investment securities held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading.\nSecurities are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost only if the Bank has a positive intent and ability to hold such securities to maturity. Securities held-to-maturity are carried at cost, adjusted for the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts using\nthe level-yield method over the remaining period until maturity.\nIf not classified as held-to-maturity or trading, securities are classified as available-for-sale based upon management's ability to sell in response to actual or anticipated changes in interest rates, resulting prepayment risk or any other factors. Available-for-sale securities are reported at\nfair value. Estimated fair values of securities are based on either published or security dealers' market value if available. If quoted or dealer prices are not available, fair value is estimated using quoted or dealer prices for similar securities.\nSecurities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings.\nThe Company adopted ASU 2016-01 on April 1, 2018; this standard required that all equity securities are measured at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses reflected in net income. In the prior fiscal year, equity securities measured at fair value reported any change in\nunrealized gains and losses through other comprehensive income.\nThe Company conducts periodic reviews to identify and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized holding loss. Unrealized holding gains or losses for securities available-for-sale are excluded from earnings and reported net of deferred income taxes in accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss, a component of Stockholders' Equity. Following Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") guidance, the amount of an other-than-temporary impairment when there are credit and non-credit losses on a debt security which management does not intend to sell, and\nfor which it is more likely than not that the Bank will not be required to sell the security prior to the recovery of the non-credit impairment, the portion of the total impairment that is attributable to the credit loss would be recognized in earnings. The remaining difference between the debt\nsecurity's amortized cost basis and its fair value would be included in other comprehensive income (loss). There were no other-than-temporary impairment charges recorded during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. Gains or losses on sales of securities of all classifications are recognized\nbased on the specific identification method.\nLoans Held-for-Sale\nLoans are only transferred to held-for-sale classification upon the determination by Carver to sell a loan. Held-for-sale loans are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. The initial charge-off, if any is required, will be taken upon the transfer to held-for-sale and absorbed through Carver's\nloan loss reserve. Subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in earnings as a valuation allowance. The valuation methodology for loans held-for-sale varies based upon the circumstances. Held-for-sale values may be based upon accepted offer amounts, appraised value of underlying\nmortgaged premises, prior loan loss experience of Carver in connection with recent loan sales for the loan type in question, and/or other acceptable valuation methods.\nLoans Receivable\nLoans receivable are carried at unpaid principal balances plus unamortized premiums, certain deferred direct loan origination costs and deferred loan origination fees and discounts, less the allowance for loan losses and charge-offs.\nThe Bank defers loan origination fees and certain direct loan origination costs and amortizes or accretes such amounts as an adjustment of yield over the contractual lives of the related loans using methodologies which approximate the interest method. Premiums and discounts on\nloans purchased are amortized or accreted as an adjustment of yield over the contractual\n63\nlives of the related loans, adjusted for prepayments when applicable, using methodologies which approximate the interest method.\nLoans are placed on nonaccrual status when they are past due 90 days or more as to contractual obligations or when other circumstances indicate that collection is not probable. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, any interest accrued but not received is reversed against\ninterest income. Payments received on a nonaccrual loan are either applied to protective advances, the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income, depending on an assessment of the ability to collect the loan. A nonaccrual loan may be restored to accrual status when principal\nand interest payments have been brought current and the loan has performed in accordance with its contractual terms for a reasonable period (generally six months).\nIf the Bank determines that a loan is impaired, the Bank next determines the amount of the impairment. The amount of impairment on collateral dependent loans is charged off within the given fiscal quarter. Generally the amount of the loan and negative escrow in excess of the\nappraised value less estimated selling costs, for the fair value of collateral valuation method, is charged off. For all other loans, impairment is measured as described below in Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses (\"ALLL\")\nThe adequacy of the Bank's ALLL is determined, in accordance with the Interagency Policy Statement on the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (the “Interagency Policy Statement”) released by the OCC on December 13, 2006 and in accordance with ASC Subtopics 450-20 \"Loss\nContingencies\" and 310-10 \"Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan.\" Compliance with the Interagency Policy Statement includes management's review of the Bank's loan portfolio, including the identification and review of individual problem situations that may affect a borrower's\nability to repay. In addition, management reviews the overall portfolio quality through an analysis of delinquency and non-performing loan data, estimates of the value of underlying collateral, current charge-offs and other factors that may affect the portfolio, including a review of regulatory\nexaminations, an assessment of current and expected economic conditions and changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio.\nThe ALLL reflects management's evaluation of the loans presenting identified loss potential, as well as the risk inherent in various components of the portfolio. There is significant judgment applied in estimating the ALLL. These assumptions and estimates are susceptible to\nsignificant changes based on the current environment. Further, any change in the size of the loan portfolio or any of its components could necessitate an increase in the ALLL even though there may not be a decline in credit quality or an increase in potential problem loans.\nGeneral Reserve Allowance\nCarver's maintenance of a general reserve allowance in accordance with ASC Subtopic 450-20 includes the Bank evaluating the risk of potential loss on homogeneous pools of loans based upon historical loss factors and a review of nine different environmental factors that are then\napplied to each pool. The pools of loans (“Loan Type”) are:\n• One-to-four family\n• Multifamily\n• Commercial Real Estate\n• Business Loans\n• Consumer (including Overdraft Accounts)\nThe Bank next applies to each pool a risk factor that determines the level of general reserves for that specific pool. The Bank estimates its historical charge-offs via a lookback analysis. The actual historical loss experience by major loan category is expressed as a percentage of the\noutstanding balance of all loans within the category. As the loss experience for a particular loan category increases or decreases, the level of reserves required for that particular loan category also increases or decreases. The Bank’s historical charge-off rate reflects the period over which the\ncharge-offs were confirmed and recognized, not the period over which the earlier losses occurred. That is, the charge-off rate measures the confirmation of losses over a period that occurs after the earlier actual losses. During the period between the loss-causing events and the eventual\nconfirmations of losses, conditions may have changed. There is always a time lag between the period over which average charge-off rates are calculated and the date of the financial statements. During that period, conditions may have changed. Another factor influencing the General Reserve is\nthe Bank’s loss emergence period (\"LEP\") assumptions which represent the Bank’s estimate of the average amount of time from the point at which a loss is incurred to the point at which the loss is confirmed, either through the identification of the loss or a charge-off. Based upon adequate\nmanagement information systems and effective methodologies for estimating losses, management has established a LEP floor of one year on all pools. In some\n64\npools, such as Commercial Real Estate, Multifamily and Business pools, the Bank demonstrates a LEP in excess of 12 months. The Bank also recognizes losses in accordance with regulatory charge-off criteria.\nBecause actual loss experience may not adequately predict the level of losses inherent in a portfolio, the Bank reviews nine qualitative factors to determine if reserves should be adjusted based upon any of those factors. As the risk ratings worsen, some of the qualitative factors tend to\nincrease. The nine qualitative factors the Bank considers and may utilize are:\n1. Changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices not considered elsewhere in estimating credit losses (Policy & Procedures).\n2. Changes in relevant economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio, including the condition of various market segments (Economy).\n3. Changes in the nature or volume of the loan portfolio and in the terms of loans (Nature & Volume).\n4. Changes in the experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff (Management).\n5. Changes in the volume and severity of past due loans, the volume of nonaccrual loans, and the volume and severity of adversely classified loans (Problem Assets).\n6. Changes in the quality of the loan review system (Loan Review).\n7. Changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans (Collateral Values).\n8. The existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations (Concentrations).\n9. The effect of other external forces such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the existing portfolio (External Forces).\nThe following discussion describes the general risks associated with the Bank’s lending activities:\n• One-to-four family - Carver Federal purchases first mortgage loans secured by one-to-four family properties that serve as the primary residence of the owner. The loans are underwritten in accordance with applicable secondary market underwriting guidelines and requirements for sale.\nThese loans present a moderate level of risk due primarily to general economic conditions. During fiscal year 2021, the Bank also started purchasing non-qualified mortgages for one-to-four family residential loans. The Bank has approved guidelines for these loans.\n• Multifamily - Carver Federal originates and purchases recourse and non-recourse multifamily loans. These loans can be affected by economic conditions and the value of the underlying properties. The Bank primarily considers the property's ability to generate net operating income\nsufficient to support the debt service, the financial resources, income level and managerial expertise of the borrower, the marketability of the property and the Bank's lending experience with the borrower.\n• Commercial - Commercial real estate (\"CRE\") lending consists predominantly of originating loans for the purpose of purchasing or refinancing office, mixed-use (properties used for both commercial and residential purposes but predominantly commercial), retail and church buildings\nin the Bank's market area. Mixed-use loans are secured by properties that are intended for both residential and business use and are classified as CRE. In originating CRE loans, the Bank primarily considers the ability of the net operating income generated by the real estate to support\nthe debt service, the financial resources, income level and managerial expertise of the borrower, the marketability of the property and the Bank's lending experience with the borrower. The Bank also requires the assignment of rents of all tenants' leases in the mortgaged property and\npersonal guarantees may be obtained for additional security from these borrowers. CRE loans generally present a higher level of risk than other types of loans due primarily to the effect of general economic conditions and the complexities involved in valuing the underlying collateral.\n• Business - The Bank originates and purchases business and SBA loans primarily to businesses located in its primary market area and surrounding areas. Business loans are typically personally guaranteed by the owners and may also be secured by additional collateral, including real\nestate, equipment and inventory. Business loans are also subject to increased risk from the effect of general economic conditions. SBA loans are guaranteed by the U.S. government based on the percentage of each individual program.\n• Consumer - The majority of the Consumer portfolio are student loans to medical students enrolled in several Caribbean schools.\nSpecific Reserve Allowance\n65\nCarver also maintains a specific reserve allowance for criticized and classified loans individually reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC Subtopic 310-10 guidelines. The amount assigned to the specific reserve allowance is individually determined based upon the loan. The\nASC Subtopic 310-10 guidelines require the use of one of three approved methods to estimate the amount to be reserved and/or charged off for such credits. The three methods are as follows:\n1. The present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate,\n2. The loan's observable market price; or\n3. The fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.\nThe Bank may choose the appropriate ASC Subtopic 310-10 measurement on a loan-by-loan basis for an individually impaired loan, except for an impaired collateral dependent loan. Guidance requires impairment of a collateral dependent loan to be measured using the fair value of\ncollateral method. A loan is considered \"collateral dependent\" when the repayment of the debt will be provided solely by the underlying collateral, and there are no other available and reliable sources of repayment.\nAll substandard and doubtful loans and any other loans that the Chief Credit Officer deems appropriate for review, are identified and reviewed for individual evaluation for impairment in accordance with ASC Subtopic 310-10. Carver also performs impairment analysis for all troubled\ndebt restructurings (“TDRs”). All TDRs are classified as impaired. For non-TDRs, if it is determined that it is probable the Bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according with the contractual terms of the loan agreement, the loan is categorized as impaired. Loans determined to be\nimpaired are evaluated to determine the amount of impairment based on one of the three measurement methods noted above. In accordance with guidance, if there is no impairment amount, no reserve is established for the loan.\nAn unallocated loan loss allowance is appropriate when it reflects an estimate of probably loss, determined in accordance with GAAP, and is properly supported.\nTroubled Debt Restructured Loans\nTDRs are those loans whose terms have been modified because of deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower and a concession is made. Modifications could include extension of the terms of the loan, reduced interest rates, capitalization of interest and forgiveness of\naccrued interest and/or principal. Once an obligation has been restructured because of such credit problems, it continues to be considered a TDR until paid in full. For a collateral dependent loan, the Bank records an impairment charge when the current estimated fair value (less estimated costs\nof disposal) of the property that collateralizes the impaired loan, if any, is less than the recorded investment in the loan. For all other TDRs, the Bank records a specific valuation allowance reserve equal to the difference between the present value of estimated future cash flows under the\nrestructured terms discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate, and the loan's recorded investment. TDR loans remain on nonaccrual status until they have performed in accordance with the restructured terms for a period of at least six months.\nInteragency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus\nOn March 22, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interagency statement to provide additional guidance to financial institutions who are working with borrowers affected by COVID-19. The statement provided that agencies will not criticize institutions for working with\nborrowers and will not direct supervised institutions to automatically categorize all COVID-19 related loan modifications as troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”). The agencies have confirmed with staff of the Financial Accounting Standards Board that short-term modifications made on a\ngood faith basis in response to COVID-19 to borrowers who were current prior to any relief, are not TDRs. This includes short-term (e.g., six months) modifications such as payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or other delays in payment that are insignificant.\nBorrowers considered current are those that are less than 30 days past due on their contractual payments at the time a modification program is implemented.\nThe statement further provided that working with borrowers that are current on existing loans, either individually or as part of a program for creditworthy borrowers who are experiencing short-term financial or operational problems as a result of COVID-19, generally would not be\nconsidered TDRs. For modification programs designed to provide temporary relief for current borrowers affected by COVID-19, financial institutions may presume that borrowers that are current on payments are not experiencing financial difficulties at the time of the modification for\npurposes of determining TDR status, and thus no further TDR analysis is required for each loan modification in the program.\n66\nThe statement indicated that the agencies’ examiners will exercise judgment in reviewing loan modifications, including TDRs, and will not automatically adversely risk rate credits that are affected by COVID-19, including those considered TDRs.\nIn addition, the statement noted that efforts to work with borrowers of one-to-four family residential mortgages, where the loans are prudently underwritten, and not past due or carried on nonaccrual status, will not result in the loans being considered restructured or modified for the\npurposes of their risk-based capital rules. With regard to loans not otherwise reportable as past due, financial institutions are not expected to designate loans with deferrals granted due to COVID-19 as past due because of the deferral.\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”)\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (\"CARES Act\") was signed to provide emergency economic relief to individuals and businesses impacted by the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic. The law had several provisions relevant to financial\ninstitutions, including:\n• Allowing institutions not to characterize loan modifications relating to the COVID-19 pandemic as a troubled debt restructuring and also allowing them to suspend the corresponding impairment determination for accounting purposes.\n• The ability of a borrower of a federally backed mortgage loan (VA, FHA, USDA, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae) experiencing financial hardship due, directly or indirectly, to the COVID-19 pandemic to request forbearance from paying their mortgage by submitting a request to the\nborrower’s servicer affirming their financial hardship during the COVID-19 emergency. Such a forbearance will be granted for up to 180 days, which can be extended for an additional 180-day period upon the request of the borrower. During that time, no fees, penalties or interest\nbeyond the amounts scheduled or calculated as if the borrower made all contractual payments on time and in full under the mortgage contract will accrue on the borrower’s account. Except for vacant or abandoned property, the servicer of a federally backed mortgage is prohibited\nfrom taking any foreclosure action, including any eviction or sale action, for not less than the 60-day period beginning March 18, 2020.\n• The ability of a borrower of a multifamily federally backed mortgage loan that was current as of February 1, 2020, to submit a request for forbearance to the borrower’s servicer affirming that the borrower is experiencing financial hardship during the COVID-19 emergency. A\nforbearance will be granted for up to 30 days, which can be extended for up to two additional 30-day periods upon the request of the borrower. During the time of the forbearance, the multifamily borrower cannot evict or initiate the eviction of a tenant or charge any late fees, penalties\nor other charges to a tenant for late payment of rent. Additionally, a multifamily borrower that receives a forbearance may not require a tenant to vacate a dwelling unit before a date that is 30 days after the date on which the borrower provides the tenant notice to vacate and may not\nissue a notice to vacate until after the expiration of the forbearance.\nConsistent with regulatory guidance and the provisions of the CARES Act, loans less than 30 days past due at December 31, 2019 that were granted COVID-19 related payment deferrals will continue to be considered current and not be reported as TDRs.\nCoronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2021 (the “CRRSA Act”)\nOn December 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2021 (\"CRRSA Act\") was signed into law, which also contains provisions that could directly impact financial institutions including extending the time that insured depository\ninstitutions and depository institution holding companies have to comply with the current expected credit losses (CECL) accounting standard and extending the authority granted to banks under the CARES Act to elect to temporarily suspend the requirements under U.S. GAAP applicable to\ntroubled debt restructurings for loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic for any loan that was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019.\nRepresentation and Warranty Reserve\nDuring the period 2004 through 2009, the Bank originated 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and sold the loans to the Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”). The loans were sold to FNMA with the standard representations and warranties for loans sold to the\nGovernment Sponsored Entities (GSEs). The Bank mgay be required to repurchase these loans in the event of breaches of these representations and warranties. In the event of a repurchase, the Bank is typically required to pay the unpaid principal balance as well as outstanding interest and\nfees. The Bank then recovers the loan or, if the loan has\n67\nbeen foreclosed, the underlying collateral. The Bank is exposed to any losses on repurchased loans after giving effect to any recoveries on the collateral.\nManagement has established a representation and warranty reserve for losses associated with the repurchase of mortgage loans sold by the Bank to FNMA that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable. These reserves are reported in the consolidated statement of\nfinancial condition as a component of other liabilities. The calculation of the reserve is based on estimates, which are uncertain, and require the application of judgment. In establishing the reserves, we consider a variety of factors, including those loans that are under review by FNMA that\nhave not yet received a repurchase request. The Bank tracks the FNMA claims monthly and evaluates the reserve on a quarterly basis.\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company has determined that all of its activities constitute one reportable operating segment.\nConcentration of Risk\nThe Bank's principal lending activities are concentrated in loans secured by real estate, a substantial portion of which are located in New York City. Accordingly, the ultimate collectability of a substantial portion of the Company's loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in New York's\nreal estate market conditions. Qualitative factors in the ALLL calculation considers the Bank's concentration risk.\nPremises and Equipment\nPremises and equipment are comprised of land, at cost, and buildings, building improvements, furnishings and equipment and leasehold improvements, at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization charges are computed using the straight-line\nmethod over the following estimated useful lives:\nBuildings and improvements 10 to 25 years\nFurnishings and equipment 3 to 5 years\nLeasehold improvements Lesser of useful life or remaining term of lease\nMaintenance, repairs and minor improvements are charged to non-interest expense in the period incurred.\nFederal Home Loan Bank Stock\nThe FHLB-NY has assigned to the Bank a mandated membership stock purchase, based on the Bank's asset size. In addition, for all borrowing activity, the Bank is required to purchase shares of FHLB-NY non-marketable capital stock at par. Such shares are redeemed by FHLB-NY\nat par with reductions in the Bank's borrowing levels. FHLB stock does not have a readily determinable fair value and we do not consider these shares to be other-than-temporarily impaired at March 31, 2021. The Bank carries this investment at historical cost.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nAll separately recognized servicing assets totaled $147 thousand and $145 thousand, respectively, at March 31, 2021 and 2020, and are included in Other Assets in the consolidated statements of financial condition and measured at fair value. Servicing fee income of $38 thousand and\n$44 thousand, respectively, was recognized during the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, and is included in Non-Interest Income in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nReal estate acquired by foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition less estimated selling costs. Any subsequent adjustments will be to the lower of cost or fair value. The fair value of such assets is determined based primarily upon\nindependent appraisals and other relevant factors. The amounts ultimately recoverable from real estate owned could differ from the net carrying value of these properties because of economic conditions. Costs incurred to improve properties or prepare them for sale are capitalized. Revenues\nand expenses related to the holding and operating of properties are recognized in operations as earned or incurred. Gains or losses on sale of properties are recognized as incurred. As of March 31, 2021, the Bank held $60 thousand in a foreclosed residential real estate property as a result of\nobtaining physical possession. In addition, as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, we had residential loans with a carrying value of $2.5 million\n68\nand $3.0 million, respectively, collateralized by residential real estate property for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in process.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company records income taxes using the asset and liability method. Income tax expense (benefit) consists of income taxes currently payable (receivable) and deferred income taxes. Temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax\npurposes are measured as of the balance sheet date. Deferred tax liabilities or recognizable deferred tax assets are calculated on such differences, using current statutory rates, which result in future taxable or deductible amounts. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is\nrecognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Where applicable, deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance for any portion determined not likely to be realized. This valuation allowance would subsequently be adjusted by a charge or credit to income tax\nexpense as changes in facts and circumstances warrant. A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is \"more likely than not\" that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of\ntax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded. Any interest expense or penalties would be recorded as interest expense.\nEarnings (Loss) per Common Share\nThe Company has preferred stock which are entitled to receive dividends if declared on the Company's common stock and are therefore considered to be participating securities. Basic earnings (loss) per share (“EPS”) is computed using the two class method. This calculation divides\nnet income (loss) available to common stockholders after the allocation of undistributed earnings to the participating securities by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share takes into account the potential dilution that\ncould occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and converted into common stock. These potentially dilutive shares are then included in the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period. Dilution calculations are not applicable to net loss\nperiods.\nPreferred and Common Dividends\nThe Company is prohibited from paying any dividends without prior regulatory approval pursuant to the terms of the Formal Agreement and Resolution to which it is subject, and is generally subject to regulations governing the payment of dividends. See Item 1 - Business - Regulation and\nSupervision - Enforcement Actions. There are no assurances that the payments of common stock dividends will resume.\nTreasury Stock\nTreasury stock is recorded at cost and is presented as a reduction of stockholders' equity.\nStock Compensation Plans\nThe Company currently has multiple stock plans in place for employees and directors of the Company. The compensation cost related to share-based payment transactions is recognized in financial statements. Compensation cost for all stock awards is calculated and recognized over a\ndefined vesting period. For awards with graded-vesting, compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite vesting period for the entire award. A Black-Scholes model is used to estimate the fair value of stock options, while the market price of the Company's common\nstock at the date of grant is used for restricted stock awards.\nOff-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Bank has entered into off-balance sheet financial instruments consisting of commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. Such financial instruments are recorded in the consolidated statements of condition when they are funded.\nNMTC fee income\nThe fee income the Company receives related to the transfers of its New Market Tax Credits (\"NMTC\") varies with each transaction, but all are similar in nature. There are two basic types of fees associated with these transactions. The first is a “sub-allocation fee” that is paid to\nCCDC when the tax credits are allocated to a subsidiary entity at the time a qualified equity\n69\ninvestment is made. This fee is recognized by the Company at the time of allocation. The second type of fee is paid to cover the administrative and servicing costs associated with CCDC's compliance with NMTC reporting requirements. This fee is recognized as the services are rendered.\nAdvertising Costs\nThe Company follows the policy of charging the costs of advertising to expense as incurred.\nTransfers of Financial Assets\nTransfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been surrendered. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when (1) the assets have been isolated from the Company, (2) the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that\nconstrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and (3) the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nAccounting Standards Recently Adopted\nOn April 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU No. 2018-13 \"Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement,\" which improved the effectiveness of disclosures in the notes to financial statements by\nfacilitating clear communication of the information required by GAAP that is most important to users of an entity's financial statements. The amendments removed the disclosure requirements for (1) transfers between Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy, (2) the policy for timing of\ntransfers between levels, and (3) the valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements. Additionally, the amendments modified the disclosure requirements for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value and measurement uncertainty. Finally, the amendments added\ndisclosure requirements for (1) the changes in unrealized gains and losses included in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements, and (2) the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 measurements. The adoption of\nthe standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated statements of financial condition and results of operations.\nOn April 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASC Topic 842, Leases (Topic 842). From the lessee's perspective, the new standard establishes a right-of-use (\"ROU\") model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer\nthan 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement for a lessee. From the lessor's perspective, the new standard requires a lessor to classify leases as either sales-type, finance or\noperating. A lease will be treated as a sale if it transfers all of the risks and rewards, as well as control of the underlying asset, to the lessee. If risks and rewards are conveyed without the transfer of control, the lease is treated as a financing. If the lessor does not convey risks and rewards or\ncontrol, an operating lease results. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessors for sales-type, direct financing, and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain\npractical expedients available. The Company elected to apply the guidance as of the beginning of the period of adoption (April 1, 2019) and not restate comparative periods. The Company also elected certain optional practical expedients, which allow the Company to forego a reassessment of\n(1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (2) the lease classification for any expired or existing leases, and (3) the initial direct costs for any existing leases. The Company did not elect the use-of-hindsight or the practical expedient pertaining to land easements, the\nlatter not being applicable to the Company. Topic 842 also provides certain accounting policy elections for an entity’s ongoing accounting. For operating leases wherein the Company is the lessee, the Company has elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components.\nUpon adoption, the Company recorded ROU assets and corresponding operating lease liabilities totaling $20.0 million. In addition, a $5.3 million cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings was recorded to recognize the total deferred gain from the sale of buildings at the adoption date.\nAs the implicit rate in each of the Company’s leases is not readily determinable, the Company is required to apply the Company’s incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”) to calculate the lease liability and ROU asset for its leasing arrangements. The Company has used the FHLB borrowing rate to\ncalculate the IBR. The Company will also consider lease renewal options reasonably certain of exercise for purposes of determining the term of the underlying borrowing. The Company has considered various other factors, including, economic environment and determined that these factors do\nnot currently impact the Company’s IBR calculation. The Company will continue to assess the appropriateness of the conclusions reached herein with respect to each of the factors discussed above and will determine the appropriate IBR for each new lease arrangement or modification, as\nrequired. See Note 6 “Leases” for further information.\n70\nOn April 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU No. 2017-08, \"Receivables - Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities,\" which shortens the amortization period for the premium on certain purchased callable\ndebt securities to the earliest call date. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated statements of financial condition and results of operations.\nOn April 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU No. 2018-02 \"Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220),\" which allows a reclassification for stranded tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings, to eliminate the stranded tax\neffects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The amendments addressed concerns regarding the guidance that requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be adjusted for the effect of a change in tax laws or rates with the effect included in income from continuing operations in the\nreporting periods that include the enactment date. As the Company has provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets, the change in tax rates resulted in a writedown of the deferred tax assets, which was offset by a reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance.\nOn April 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2017-09, \"Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Scope of Modification Accounting,\" which clarifies when changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award must be accounted for as modifications. The\nadoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated statements of financial condition and results of operations.\nAccounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, \"Financial Instruments - Credit Loss,\" which updates the guidance on recognition and measurement of credit losses for financial assets. The new requirements, known as the current expected credit loss model (\"CECL\") will require\nentities to adopt an impairment model based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 (for the Company, the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021), including interim periods within those fiscal years. In May\n2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-05, \"Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Target Transition Relief,\" to provide transition relief by giving entities an option to irrevocably elect the fair value option for certain financial assets measured at amortized cost upon adoption of\nASU 2016-13. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10, which extended the CECL implementation date for smaller reporting companies, as defined by the SEC. The new effective date is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 (for the Company, the fiscal year\nending March 31, 2024), including interim periods within those fiscal years. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-11, \"Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses,\" to amend or clarify guidance regarding expected recoveries for purchased\nfinancial assets with credit deterioration, transition relief for troubled debt restructurings, disclosures related to accrued interest receivables, and financial assets secured by collateral maintenance provisions. The Company is currently in the implementation stage of ASU 2016-13 and has\nengaged two vendors to assist management in evaluating the requirements of the new standard, modeling requirements and assessment of the impact of the adoption of the new standard on its consolidated statements of financial condition and results of operations.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12 \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes,\" as part of the FASB's simplification initiative to reduce complexity, while maintaining or improving the usefulness of information provided to users of\nfinancial statements. The amendments in this update simplify the accounting for income taxes and improve consistent application of GAAP by removing certain exceptions and clarifying and amending existing guidance for areas of Topic 740. ASU No. 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2020 (for the Company, the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022), and interim periods within those fiscal years. ASU 2019-12 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04 \"Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting,\" which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to loan and lease agreements, derivative\ncontracts, and other transactions affected by the anticipated transition away from LIBOR toward new interest rate benchmarks. For transactions that are modified because of reference rate reform and that meet certain scope guidance (i) modifications of loan agreements should be accounted for\nby prospectively adjusting the effective interest rate and the modification will be considered \"minor\" so that any existing unamortized origination fees/costs would carry forward and continue to be amortized and (ii) modifications of lease agreements should be accounted for as a continuation of\nthe existing agreement with no reassessments of the lease classification and the discount rate or remeasurements of lease payments that otherwise would be required for modifications not accounted for as separate contracts. ASU 2020-04 is effective March 12, 2020 through December 31,\n2022. An entity may elect to apply ASU 2020-04 for contract modifications as of any date from the beginning of an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020, or prospectively from a date within an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020, up to the\ndate that the financial statements are available to be issued. Once elected for a Topic or an Industry Subtopic, the amendments in this ASU must be applied\n71\nprospectively for all eligible contract modifications for that Topic or Industry Subtopic. We anticipate this ASU will simplify any modifications we execute between the selected start date (yet to be determined) and December 31, 2022 that are directly related to LIBOR transition by allowing\nprospective recognition of the continuation of the contract, rather than extinguishment of the old contract resulting in writing off unamortized fees/costs. The Company is evaluating the impacts of this ASU and has not yet determined whether LIBOR transition and this ASU will have a\nmaterial impact on the Company's consolidated statements of financial condition and results of operations.\nNOTE 3. INVESTMENT SECURITIES\nThe Bank utilizes mortgage-backed and other investment securities in its asset/liability management strategy. In making investment decisions, the Bank considers, among other things, its yield and interest rate objectives, its interest rate and credit risk position, and its liquidity and\ncash flow.\nGenerally, the investment policy of the Bank is to invest funds among categories of investments and maturities based upon the Bank’s asset/liability management policies, investment quality, loan and deposit volume and collateral requirements, liquidity needs and performance objectives.\nGAAP requires that debt securities be classified into three categories: trading, held-to-maturity, and available-for-sale. At March 31, 2021, securities with fair value of $86.5 million, or 91.7%, of the Bank’s total securities were classified as available-for-sale, and the remaining securities with\namortized cost of $7.8 million, or 8.3%, were classified as held-to-maturity. The Bank had no securities classified as trading at March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020.\nOther investments as of March 31, 2021 primarily consists of the Bank's investment in a limited partnership Community Capital Fund. These securities are measured at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses reflected in net income. Other investments totaled $948 thousand\nat March 31, 2021 and are included in Other Assets on the Statements of Financial Condition.\nThe following tables set forth the amortized cost and fair value of securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity at March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020:\nAt March 31, 2021\nAmortized Gross Unrealized\n$ in thousands Cost Gains Losses Fair Value\nAvailable-for-Sale:\nMortgage-backed securities:\nGovernment National Mortgage Association $ 987 $ 39 $ — $ 1,026\nFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation 28,458 88 761 27,785\nFederal National Mortgage Association 15,120 — 510 14,610\nTotal mortgage-backed securities 44,565 127 1,271 43,421\nU.S. Government Agency Securities 18,744 — 113 18,631\nCorporate Bonds 5,274 — 793 4,481\nMuni Securities 17,763 — 1,153 16,610\nAsset-backed Securities 3,336 28 — 3,364\nTotal available-for-sale $ 89,682 $ 155 $ 3,330 $ 86,507\nHeld-to-Maturity:\nMortgage-backed securities:\nGovernment National Mortgage Association $ 683 $ 69 $ — $ 752\nFederal National Mortgage Association 7,124 264 — 7,388\nTotal held-to-maturity $ 7,807 $ 333 $ — $ 8,140\n72\nAt March 31, 2020\nAmortized Gross Unrealized\n$ in thousands Cost Gains Losses Fair Value\nAvailable-for-Sale:\nMortgage-backed securities:\nGovernment National Mortgage Association $ 3,510 $ 77 $ — $ 3,587\nFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation 9,244 312 18 9,538\nFederal National Mortgage Association 21,495 673 — 22,168\nTotal mortgage-backed securities 34,249 1,062 18 35,293\nU.S. Government Agency Securities 26,616 20 155 26,481\nCorporate Bonds 4,032 33 10 4,055\nTotal available-for-sale $ 64,897 $ 1,115 $ 183 $ 65,829\nHeld-to-Maturity:\nMortgage-backed securities:\nGovernment National Mortgage Association $ 972 $ 76 $ — $ 1,048\nFederal National Mortgage Association and Other 8,179 342 — 8,521\nTotal held-to-maturity mortgage-backed securities 9,151 418 — 9,569\nCorporate Bonds 1,000 — 5 995\nTotal held-to-maturity $ 10,151 $ 418 $ 5 $ 10,564\nThe following is a summary regarding proceeds, gross gains and gross losses realized from the sale of securities from the available-for-sale portfolio for the year ended March 31, 2021. There were no sales of available-for-sale securities and held-to-maturity securities for the year ended\nMarch 31, 2020.\n$ in thousands March 31, 2021\nProceeds $ 37,802\nGross gains 1,193\nCarver maintains a portfolio of mortgage-backed securities in the form of Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA”) pass-through certificates, Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”) mortgage-backed securities and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation\n(“FHLMC”) participation certificates. GNMA pass-through certificates are guaranteed as to the payment of principal and interest by the full faith and credit of the United States Government, while FNMA and FHLMC securities are each guaranteed by their respective agencies as to principal\nand interest. Based on the high quality of the Bank's investment portfolio, current market conditions have not significantly impacted the pricing of the portfolio or the Bank's ability to obtain reliable prices.\nAt March 31, 2021, the Bank pledged mortgage-backed and agency securities of $9.0 million as collateral for advances from the FHLB-NY.\nThe following tables set forth the unrealized losses and fair value of securities in an unrealized loss position at March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020 for less than 12 months and 12 months or longer:\nAt March 31, 2021\nLess than 12 months 12 months or longer Total\nUnrealized Fair Unrealized Fair Unrealized Fair\n$ in thousands Losses Value Losses Value Losses Value\nAvailable-for-Sale:\nMortgage-backed securities $ 1,271 $ 39,020 $ — $ — $ 1,271 $ 39,020\nU.S. Government Agency Securities — — 113 18,631 113 18,631\nCorporate bonds 793 4,481 — — 793 4,481\nMuni securities 1,153 16,609 — — 1,153 16,609\nTotal available-for-sale securities $ 3,217 $ 60,110 $ 113 $ 18,631 $ 3,330 $ 78,741\n73\nAt March 31, 2020\nLess than 12 months 12 months or longer Total\nUnrealized Fair Unrealized Fair Unrealized Fair\n$ in thousands Losses Value Losses Value Losses Value\nAvailable-for-Sale:\nMortgage-backed securities $ — $ — $ 18 $ 619 $ 18 $ 619\nU.S. Government Agency Securities — — 155 21,494 155 21,494\nCorporate bonds 10 1,999 — — 10 1,999\nTotal available-for-sale securities $ 10 $ 1,999 $ 173 $ 22,113 $ 183 $ 24,112\nHeld-to-Maturity:\nCorporate bonds $ 5 995 — — $ 5 $ 995\nTotal held-to-maturity securities $ 5 $ 995 $ — $ — $ 5 $ 995\nA total of 15 securities had an unrealized loss at March 31, 2021, compared to 7 at March 31, 2020. Mortgage-backed securities, U.S. government agency securities and muni securities represented 49.6%, 23.7% and 21.1%, respectively, of total available-for-sale securities in an\nunrealized loss position at March 31, 2021. There were three U.S. government agency securities that had an unrealized loss position for more than 12 months at March 31, 2021. The cause of the temporary impairment is directly related to changes in interest rates. In general, as interest rates\ndecline, the fair value of securities will rise, and conversely as interest rates rise, the fair value of securities will decline. Management considers fluctuations in fair value as a result of interest rate changes to be temporary, which is consistent with the Bank's experience. The impairments are\ndeemed temporary based on the direct relationship of the change in fair value to movements in interest rates, the life of the investments and their high credit quality. Given the high credit quality of the securities which are backed by the U.S. government's guarantees, the high credit quality and\nstrong financial performance of the municipal securities, and the corporate securities which are all reputable institutions in good financial standing, the risk of credit loss is minimal. Management believes that these unrealized losses are a direct result of the current rate environment and the\nCompany has the ability and intent to hold the securities until maturity or the valuation recovers.\nThe Bank did not have any securities that were classified as having other-than-temporary impairment in its investment portfolio at March 31, 2021.\nThe following is a summary of the amortized cost and fair value of debt securities at March 31, 2021, by remaining period to contractual maturity (ignoring earlier call dates, if any). Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because certain security issuers have the\nright to call or prepay their obligations.

Accordingly, as with most financial institutions in the market area, the ultimate collectability of a substantial portion of the Company's loan portfolio is\nsusceptible to changes in market conditions in this area.\nReal estate mortgage loan portfolios (one-to-four family) serviced for Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”) and other third parties are not included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The unpaid principal balances of these loans aggregated $16.8\nmillion and $18.3 million at March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nAt March 31, 2021 the Bank pledged $42.8 million in total real estate mortgage loans as collateral for advances from the FHLB-NY.\nThe Bank is participating as a lender in the Paycheck Protection Program (\"PPP\"), which opened on April 3, 2020. As part of the CARES Act, the Small Business Administration (\"SBA\") is authorized to temporarily guarantee loans under this new 7(a) loan program. Under the PPP,\nsmall businesses and other entities and individuals can apply for loans from existing SBA lenders and other approved regulated lenders that enroll in the program, subject to numerous limitations and eligibility criteria. Since the PPP loans are fully guaranteed by the SBA, there are no additional\nALLL reserves required. As of March 31, 2021, the Bank has approved and funded approximately 304 applications totaling $42.9 million of loans under the PPP. The Bank has begun to receive debt forgiveness payments on PPP loans closed during the first round of the program.\nConsistent with regulatory guidance and the provisions of the CARES Act, loans less than 30 days past due at December 31, 2019 that were granted COVID-19 related payment deferrals will continue to be considered current and not be reported as TDRs. For the fiscal year ended\nMarch 31, 2021, the Bank received 83 applications for payment deferrals on approximately $90.4 million of loans. This total includes 61 commercial loans totaling $83.5 million and 22 residential loans totaling $6.9 million. As of March 31, 2021, we have 15 loans remaining that are on\ndeferment with outstanding principal balances totaling $8.3 million. The Bank has been working with the borrowers to determine if there is a risk of any losses associated with repayment and if any additional reserves would have to be allocated to this portfolio.\n75\nThe following is an analysis of the allowance for loan losses based upon the method of evaluating loan impairment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021:\n$ in thousands One-to-four family Multifamily Commercial Real Estate Business Consumer Unallocated Total\nAllowance for loan losses:\nBeginning Balance $ 1,055 $ 1,011 $ 812 $ 1,567 $ 212 $ 289 $ 4,946\nCharge-offs — — — (24) (54) — (78)\nRecoveries 88 — — 278 6 — 372\nProvision for (Recovery of) Loan Losses (85) (131) 95 34 1 (14) (100)\nEnding Balance $ 1,058 $ 880 $ 907 $ 1,855 $ 165 $ 275 $ 5,140\nAllowance for Loan Losses Ending Balance: collectively evaluated for\nimpairment $ 1,026 $ 880 $ 907 $ 1,729 $ 165 $ 275 $ 4,982\nAllowance for Loan Losses Ending Balance: individually evaluated for\nimpairment 32 — — 126 — — 158\nLoan Receivables Ending Balance $ 78,213 $ 106,400 $ 148,809 $ 147,680 $ 2,447 $ — $ 483,549\nEnding Balance: collectively evaluated for impairment 74,387 106,031 147,891 139,925 2,447 — 470,681\nEnding Balance: individually evaluated for impairment 3,826 369 918 7,755 — — 12,868\nThe following is an analysis of the allowance for loan losses based upon the method of evaluating loan impairment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020:\n$ in thousands One-to-four family Multifamily Commercial Real Estate Business Consumer Unallocated Total\nAllowance for loan losses:\nBeginning Balance $ 1,274 $ 885 $ 766 $ 1,330 $ 154 $ 237 $ 4,646\nCharge-offs (12) — — (69) (102) — (183)\nRecoveries 302 — — 160 2 — 464\nProvision for (Recovery of) Loan Losses (509) 126 46 146 158 52 19\nEnding Balance $ 1,055 $ 1,011 $ 812 $ 1,567 $ 212 $ 289 $ 4,946\nAllowance for Loan Losses Ending Balance: collectively evaluated for\nimpairment $ 899 $ 1,011 $ 812 $ 1,557 $ 212 $ 289 $ 4,780\nAllowance for Loan Losses Ending Balance: individually evaluated for\nimpairment 156 — — 10 — — 166\nLoan Receivables Ending Balance $ 107,528 $ 89,887 $ 142,410 $ 85,659 $ 3,248 $ — $ 428,732\nEnding Balance: collectively evaluated for impairment 102,902 89,512 142,410 82,210 3,248 — 420,282\nEnding Balance: individually evaluated for impairment 4,626 375 — 3,449 — — 8,450\n76\nThe following is a summary of nonaccrual loans at March 31, 2021 and 2020.\n$ in thousands March 31, 2021 March 31, 2020\nLoans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis:\nGross loans receivable:\nOne-to-four family $ 3,524 $ 3,582\nMultifamily 369 375\nCommercial real estate 918 —\nBusiness 2,290 2,797\nConsumer 90 22\nTotal nonaccrual loans $ 7,191 $ 6,776\nNonaccrual loans generally consist of loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued as a result of such loans becoming 90 days or more delinquent as to principal and/or interest payments. Interest income on nonaccrual loans is recorded when received based upon the\ncollectability of the loan. TDR loans consist of modified loans where borrowers have been granted concessions in regards to the terms of their loans due to financial or other difficulties, which rendered them unable to repay their loans under the original contractual terms.\nAt March 31, 2021, other non-performing assets totaled $60 thousand, which consisted of other real estate owned comprised of one foreclosed residential property, compared to $120 thousand comprised of two foreclosed residential properties at March 31, 2020. Other real estate\nloans is included in other assets in the consolidated statements of financial condition. There were no held-for-sale loans at March 31, 2021 or March 31, 2020.\nThe Bank utilizes an internal loan classification system as a means of reporting problem loans within its loan categories. Loans may be classified as \"Pass,\" “Special Mention,” “Substandard,” “Doubtful,” and “Loss.” Loans rated Pass have demonstrated satisfactory asset quality,\nearning history, liquidity, and other adequate margins of creditor protection. They represent a moderate credit risk and some degree of financial stability. Loans are considered collectible in full, but perhaps require greater than average amount of loan officer attention. Borrowers are capable of\nabsorbing normal setbacks without failure. Loans rated Special Mention have potential weaknesses that deserve management's close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the Bank's credit position at\nsome future date. Loans rated Substandard are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are\ncharacterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Loans rated Doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified Substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in\nfull, based on currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. Loans classified as Loss are those considered uncollectible with insignificant value and are charged off immediately to the allowance for loan losses.\nOne-to-four family residential loans and consumer and other loans are rated non-performing if they are delinquent in payments ninety or more days, a troubled debt restructuring with less than six months contractual performance or past maturity. All other one-to-four family\nresidential loans and consumer and other loans are performing loans.\nAs of March 31, 2021, and based on the most recent analysis performed in the current quarter, the risk category by class of loans is as follows:\n$ in thousands Multifamily Commercial Real Estate Business\nCredit Risk Profile by Internally Assigned Grade:\nPass $ 101,212 $ 142,168 $ 137,447\nSpecial Mention — 5,531 1,585\nSubstandard 5,188 1,110 8,648\nTotal $ 106,400 $ 148,809 $ 147,680\nOne-to-four family Consumer\nCredit Risk Profile Based on Payment Activity:\nPerforming $ 74,689 $ 2,356\nNon-Performing 3,524 91\nTotal $ 78,213 $ 2,447\n77\nAs of March 31, 2020, the risk category by class of loans was as follows:\n$ in thousands Multifamily Commercial Real Estate Business\nCredit Risk Profile by Internally Assigned Grade:\nPass $ 89,512 $ 141,793 $ 80,016\nSpecial Mention — 617 2,184\nSubstandard 375 — 3,459\nTotal $ 89,887 $ 142,410 $ 85,659\nOne-to-four family Consumer\nCredit Risk Profile Based on Payment Activity:\nPerforming $ 103,946 $ 3,225\nNon-Performing 3,582 23\nTotal $ 107,528 $ 3,248\nThe following table presents an aging analysis of the recorded investment of past due financing receivable as of March 31, 2021.\n$ in thousands 30-59 Days Past Due 60-89 Days Past Due 90 or More Days Past Due Total Past Due Current Total Loans Receivable\nOne-to-four family $ 1,188 $ — $ 2,950 $ 4,138 $ 74,075 $ 78,213\nMultifamily 798 — — 798 105,602 106,400\nCommercial real estate 5,263 — — 5,263 143,546 148,809\nBusiness 671 400 271 1,342 146,338 147,680\nConsumer 2 33 91 126 2,321 2,447\nTotal $ 7,922 $ 433 $ 3,312 $ 11,667 $ 471,882 $ 483,549\nThe following table presents an aging analysis of the recorded investment of past due financing receivable as of March 31, 2020.\n$ in thousands 30-59 Days Past Due 60-89 Days Past Due 90 or More Days Past Due Total Past Due Current Total Loans Receivable\nOne-to-four family $ 1,410 $ — $ 3,202 $ 4,612 $ 102,916 $ 107,528\nMultifamily 490 — — 490 89,397 89,887\nCommercial real estate 6,621 — — 6,621 135,789 142,410\nBusiness 1,360 3 700 2,063 83,596 85,659\nConsumer 103 1 23 127 3,121 3,248\nTotal $ 9,984 $ 4 $ 3,925 $ 13,913 $ 414,819 $ 428,732\nAt March 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no loans 90 or more days past due and accruing interest.\nThe following tables present information on impaired loans with the associated allowance amount, if applicable, at March 31, 2021 and 2020. Management determined the specific allowance based on the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan’s effective\ninterest rate, except when the remaining source of repayment for the loan is the operation or liquidation of the collateral. In those cases, the current fair value of the collateral, less selling costs was used to determine the specific allowance recorded. When the ultimate collectability of the total\nprincipal of an impaired loan is in doubt and the loan is on nonaccrual status, all payments are applied to principal under the cost recovery method. When the ultimate collectability of the total principal of an impaired loan is not in doubt and the loan is on nonaccrual status, contractual interest\nis credited to interest income when received under the cash basis method. Interest income of $161 thousand and $119 thousand for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 respectively, would have been recorded on impaired loans had they performed in accordance with their original terms.\n78\nImpaired Loans by Class\nAt March 31,\n2021 2020\n$ in thousands Recorded Investment Unpaid Principal Balance Associated Allowance Recorded Investment Unpaid Principal Balance Associated Allowance\nWith no specific allowance recorded:\nOne-to-four family $ 3,750 $ 4,409 $ — $ 3,819 $ 4,566 $ —\nMultifamily 369 369 — 375 376 —\nCommercial real estate 918 918 — — — —\nBusiness 2,332 2,527 — 2,797 2,917 —\nWith an allowance recorded:\nOne-to-four family 76 72 32 807 803 156\nBusiness 5,423 5,423 126 652 652 10\nTotal $ 12,868 $ 13,718 $ 158 $ 8,450 $ 9,314 $ 166\nThe following table presents information on average balances on impaired loans and the interest income recognized for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.\nFor the years ended March 31,\n2021 2020\n$ in thousands Average Balance Interest Income recognized Average Balance Interest Income recognized\nWith no specific allowance recorded:\nOne-to-four family $ 4,119 $ 64 $ 4,153 $ 65\nMultifamily 1,791 16 1,795 48\nCommercial real estate 697 10 238 —\nBusiness 2,153 102 2,385 47\nWith an allowance recorded:\nOne-to-four family 503 — 868 —\nMultifamily — — — —\nBusiness 3,355 — 970 —\nTotal $ 12,618 $ 192 $ 10,409 $ 160\nIn certain circumstances, loan modifications involve a troubled borrower to whom the Bank may grant a modification. In cases where the Bank grants any significant concessions to a troubled borrower, the Bank accounts for the modification as a TDR under ASC Subtopic 310-40 and\nthe related allowance under ASC Section 310-10-35. Situations around these modifications may include extension of maturity date, reduction in the stated interest rate, rescheduling of future cash flows, reduction in the face amount of the debt or reduction of past accrued interest. Loans\nmodified in TDRs are placed on nonaccrual status until the Company determines that future collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured, which generally requires that the borrower demonstrate performance according to the restructured terms for a period of at least six months.\nThere was one loan modification made during the twelve months ended March 31, 2021.

Total TDR loans at March 31, 2021 were $7.5\n79\nmillion, $1.8 million of which were non-performing as they were either not consistently performing in accordance with their modified terms or not performing in accordance with their modified terms for at least six months. At March 31, 2020, total TDR loans were $3.9 million, of which $2.2\nmillion were non-performing.\nTransactions With Certain Related Persons\nFederal law requires that all loans or extensions of credit to executive officers and directors must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with the general public and must not involve more\nthan the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.\nThe aggregate amount of loans outstanding to related parties was $60 thousand at March 31, 2021 and $70 thousand at March 31, 2020. During fiscal year 2021, there were no advances and principal repayments totaled $10 thousand.\nFurthermore, loans above the greater of $25,000, or 5% of Carver Federal’s capital and surplus (up to $500,000), to Carver Federal’s directors and executive officers must be approved in advance by a majority of the disinterested members of Carver Federal’s Board of Directors.\nNOTE 5.

LEASES\nOn April 1, 2019, the Company adopted Topic 842 and all subsequent ASUs that modified Topic 842. The Company has operating leases related to its administrative offices, seven retail branches and four ATM centers. Two of the operating leases are for branch locations where the\nCompany had entered into a sale and leaseback transaction. The gain had been calculated utilizing the profit on sale in excess of the present value of the minimum lease payments, and the profit on the sale was deferred from gain recognition to be amortized into income over the terms of the\nleases in accordance with ASC 840. ASC 842 does not require previous sale and leaseback transactions accounted for under ASC 840 to be reassessed. Because the transactions had no off-market terms, the Company recorded a $5.3 million cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings to\nrecognize the total deferred gain balance at the adoption date. The implementation of the new standard resulted in the recognition of $20.0 million right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and corresponding operating lease liabilities upon adoption. As of March 31, 2021, operating ROU lease assets and\nrelated lease liabilities totaled $15.3 million and $16.0 million, respectively.\nAs the implicit rates of the Company's existing leases are not readily determinable, the discount rate used in determining the lease liability obligation for each individual lease was the FHLB-NY fixed-rate advance rates based on the remaining lease terms as of April 1, 2019.\nAs of March 31, 2021, the Company had $121 thousand and $114 thousand of ROU asset and lease liability, respectively, for finance leases related to equipment.

ADVANCES FROM THE FHLB-NY AND OTHER BORROWED MONEY\nFederal Home Loan Bank Advances. As a member of the FHLB-NY, the Bank may have outstanding FHLB-NY borrowings in a combination of term advances and overnight funds of up to 30% of its total assets, or approximately $203.0 million at March 31, 2021. Borrowings are\nsecured by the Bank's investment in FHLB-NY stock and by a blanket security agreement. This agreement requires the Bank to maintain as collateral certain qualifying assets (principally mortgage loans and securities) not otherwise pledged. The Bank had no outstanding advances from the\nFHLB-NY at March 31, 2021. At March 31, 2021, the Bank's collateral included its investment in FHLB-NY capital stock totaling $552 thousand, and a blanket assignment of pledged qualifying mortgage loans of $42.8 million and mortgage-backed and investment securities with a market\nvalue of $9.0 million. The Bank has sufficient collateral at the FHLB-NY to be able to borrow $42.7 million from the FHLB-NY at March 31, 2021.\nSubordinated Debt Securities. On September 17, 2003, Carver Statutory Trust I issued 13,000 shares, liquidation amount $1,000 per share, of floating rate capital securities. Gross proceeds from the sale of these trust preferred debt securities of $13 million, and proceeds from the sale\nof the trust's common securities of $0.4 million, were used to purchase approximately $13.4 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's floating rate junior subordinated debt securities due 2033. The trust preferred debt securities are redeemable at par quarterly at the option of the\nCompany beginning on or after September 17, 2008, and have a mandatory redemption date of September 17, 2033. Cash distributions on the trust preferred debt securities are cumulative and payable at a floating rate per annum resetting quarterly with a margin of 3.05% over the three-month\nLIBOR. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, the Company applied for and was granted regulatory approval to settle all outstanding debenture interest payments through September 2016. Such payments totaling $2.5 million were made in September 2016. Interest on the debentures\nhas been deferred beginning with the December 2016 payment, per the terms of the agreement, which permit such deferral for up to twenty consecutive quarters, as the Company is prohibited from making payments without prior regulatory approval. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year\n2021, the Company applied for and was granted regulatory approval to settle all outstanding debenture interest payments through June 2021. Full payment was made on June 16, 2021.\nThe accrued interest payable on subordinated debt securities was $3.1 million and the interest expense was $562 thousand for the year ended March 31, 2021. The accrued interest payable on subordinated debt securities was $2.5 million and the interest expense was $815 thousand for\nthe year ended March 31, 2020.\nPaycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (PPPLF). The Federal Reserve established the PPPLF to support the PPP program by extending credit to eligible financial institutions that originate PPP loans, taking the loans as collateral at face value. The interest rate on PPPLF\nadvances is fixed at 0.35% and the maturity date is equal to the maturity date of the PPP loans pledged to secure the extension of credit. The accrued interest payable on PPPLF advances was $73 thousand and the interest expense was $85 thousand for the year ended March 31, 2021.\n83\nThe following table sets forth certain information regarding Carver Federal's borrowings as of and for the years ended March 31:\n$ in thousands 2021 2020\nAmounts outstanding at the end of year:\nSubordinated debt securities 13,403 13,403\nPPPLF 23,705 —\nRate paid at year end:\nSubordinated debt securities 3.23 % 3.89 %\nPPPLF 0.35 % — %\nMaximum amount of borrowing outstanding at any month end:\nFHLB advances $ — $ 23,000\nSubordinated debt securities 13,403 13,403\nPPPLF 28,293 —\nApproximate average amounts outstanding for year:\nFHLB advances $ — $ 8,115\nSubordinated debt securities 13,403 13,403\nPPPLF 24,453 —\nApproximate weighted average rate paid during year:\nFHLB advances — % 2.15 %\nSubordinated debt securities 4.19 % 6.08 %\nPPPLF 0.35 % — %\nNOTE 10.

The capital raise triggered a change in control under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Generally, Section 382 limits the utilization of an entity's net operating loss carryforwards, general business credits, and\nrecognized built-in losses upon a change in ownership. The Company is currently subject to an annual limitation of approximately $870 thousand, but has accumulated availability of $8.5 million as of March 31, 2021. The total cumulative availability over the carryover period (20 years) is\n$18.1 million. The Company has a net deferred tax asset (“DTA”) of approximately $23.7 million. Based on management's calculations, the Section 382 limitation has resulted in previous reductions of the deferred tax asset of $5.8 million. A valuation allowance for net deferred tax asset of\n$23.7 million has been recorded. The valuation allowance was initially recorded during fiscal year 2011, and has remained through March 31, 2020, as management concluded, and continues to conclude, that it is “more likely than not” that the Company will not be able to fully realize the\nbenefit of its deferred tax assets. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, that was passed during the Company's fiscal year 2018, now permits a corporation to receive refunds for AMT credits even if there is no taxable income. As a result, at March 31, 2018, the valuation allowance was reduced by $340\nthousand, the amount of the Company's AMT credits. The amount of the AMT credits recorded as a deferred tax asset was $0 as of March 31, 2020. The AMT credit was $143 thousand as of March 31, 2020, which the Company requested to be refunded from its recently filed fiscal year 2020\nfederal tax return.\nAt March 31, 2021, the Company had net operating carryforwards for federal purposes of approximately $51.2 million, for state purposes of approximately $70.9 million and for city purposes of approximately $58.5 million which are available to offset future federal, state and city\nincome and which expire over varying periods from March 2030 through March 2040. Federal net operating carryforwards of $17.4 million do not expire.\nThe Company has no uncertain tax positions. The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to federal, New York State and New York City income taxation. The Company is no longer subject to examination by taxing authorities for years before March 31, 2017. A tax position is\nrecognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination; with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination.\nFor tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded.\nNOTE 11.

For details of restricted shares and stock options, please refer to Note 14. \"Employee Benefit and Stock Compensation Plans.\"\nNOTE 12. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nConversion and Stock Offering. On October 24, 1994, the Bank issued in an initial public offering 2,314,375 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 (the “Common Stock”), at a price of $10 per share resulting in net proceeds of $21.5 million. As part of the initial public offering, the Bank\nestablished a liquidation account at the time of conversion, in an amount equal to the surplus and reserves of the Bank at September 30, 1994. In the unlikely event of a complete liquidation of the Bank (and only in such event), eligible depositors who continue to maintain accounts shall be\nentitled to receive a distribution from the liquidation account. The total amount of the liquidation account may be decreased if the balances of eligible deposits decreased as measured on the annual determination dates. The Bank is not permitted to pay dividends to the Company on its capital\nstock if the effect thereof would cause its net worth to be reduced below either: (i) the amount required for the liquidation account, or (ii) the amount required for the Bank to comply with applicable minimum regulatory capital requirements. In 2011 the stockholders approved a 1-for-15 reverse\nstock split pursuant to which each 15 shares of the Company’s Common Stock would be converted into one share of Common Stock. The 1-for-15 reverse stock split was effective as of October 27, 2011, resulting in a reduction in the number of outstanding shares of the Company’s Common\nStock from 2,492,415 to 166,161, an increase of the conversion price of the Series C Preferred Stock and the Series D Preferred Stock and the exchange ratio of the Series B Preferred Stock from $0.5451 to $8.1765, and a corresponding decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock\nissued to the Investors and Treasury. During the year ended March 31, 2012, all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock were converted to Common Stock and all outstanding shares of Series C preferred Stock were converted to Series D Preferred Stock. As of March 31, 2021, there\nwere 3,333,268 shares of Company common stock outstanding.\nSeries D Preferred Stock ranks senior to the Common Stock. The holders of Series D Preferred Stock are entitled to receive dividends, on an as-converted basis, simultaneously to the payment of any dividends on the Company's common stock. Dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock are\nnot cumulative. If the Company's board of directors does not declare a dividend with respect to any dividend period, the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock will have no right to receive any dividend for that period. The Company may not declare, pay or set apart for payment any dividend\nor make any distribution on common stock, unless at the time of such dividend or distribution the Company simultaneously pays a non-cumulative dividend or makes a distribution on each outstanding share of Series D Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis. The holders of Series D\npreferred Stock are generally not entitled to vote, except with respect to amendments to the Company's certificate of incorporation that would change the rights and preferences of the Series D Preferred Stock, the creation or increase of any class of securities senior to the Series D Preferred\nStock, the consummation of certain mergers, consolidations or other transactions where the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock are not converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving entity, and as otherwise required by applicable law.\n.\nThe Series D Preferred Stock shall automatically convert into shares of Common Stock only upon the following transfers to third parties (“Eligible Transfers”):\n•a transfer in a widespread public distribution;\n•a transfer in which no transferee (together with its affiliates and other transferees acting in concert with it) acquires more than 2% of the Company’s common stock or any other class or series of the Company’s voting stock; or\n•a transfer to a transferee that (together with its affiliates and other transferees acting in concert with it) owns or controls more than 50% of the Company’s common stock, without regard to the transfer.\n86\nThe conversion price of the Series D Preferred Stock is $8.1765, and is subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits, subdivisions or combinations, dividends and distributions, issuance of certain rights, spin-offs, self-tenders and exchange offers as set forth under the agreement. The\nSeries D Preferred Stock is not convertible at the option of the holders. As of March 31, 2021, there were 17,601 shares of Series D Preferred Stock outstanding.\nOn August 6, 2002, the Company announced a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to 15,442 shares of its outstanding common stock. As of March 31, 2021, 11,744 shares of its common stock have been repurchased in open market transactions. As a result of the Company's\nparticipation in the TARP CDCI, the United States Department of the Treasury's (the \"U.S. Treasury\") prior approval was required to make further repurchases.\nOn August 6, 2020, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with the U.S. Treasury to repurchase 2,321,286 shares of the common stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share, owned by the U.S. Treasury for an aggregate purchase price of $2.5 million. The\nstock repurchase provided for in the Securities Purchase Agreement was completed on August 6, 2020. Upon completion of the repurchase pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, the U.S. Treasury was no longer a stockholder in the Company. In connection with the repurchase,\nMorgan Stanley provided a grant to the Company of $2.5 million to fund the repurchase transaction.\nIn June 2020, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., an institutional investor, notified the Company of their intention to effect a series of transfers of up to all its holdings of Series D Preferred Stock. The conversion and subsequent sale of shares were completed on July 2, 2020: 13,519\nSeries D Preferred Stock shares were converted into 1,653,397 shares of Common Stock, which were subsequently sold in the open market. The conversion and sale had no impact on the Company's total capital.\nOn July 9, 2020, the Company received notice that Morgan Stanley International Holdings Inc., an institutional investor, relinquished its ownership of 180,573 shares of Company common stock and 13,523 shares of Company Preferred Series D Stock to the Company at no cost to the\nCompany.\nOn October 15, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with Banc of America Strategic Investments Corporation, under which it issued and sold 147,227 shares of its common stock, par value $0.01, at a price of $6.62 per share. The shares were issued on October 15, 2020, in a\nprivate placement exempt from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Regulation D of the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.\nOn January 22, 2021, Prudential Insurance Company of America, an institutional investor, notified the Company of its intention to cancel 475 of its holdings of Series D Preferred Stock and convert them into 58,093 shares of Common Stock. The conversion had no impact on the\nCompany's total capital.\nOn February 1, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with Wells Fargo Central Pacific Holdings, Inc., under which it sold: (i) 157,806 shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at a purchase price of $7.75 per share, and (ii) 3,177 shares of a new series of\npreferred stock, Series E non-cumulative non-voting participating preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, at a purchase price of $1,000 per share, in a private placement for gross proceeds of approximately $4.4 million. Upon the completion of certain eligible transfers of the Series E\npreferred stock by Wells Fargo Central Pacific Holdings, Inc., the Series E preferred stock would be convertible into common stock at a conversion price of $7.96 per share. The issuance of the shares is exempt from registration pursuant to the exemption provided under Rule 506 of Regulation\nD promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The offering was made only to accredited investors as that term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Act.\nSeries E Preferred Stock is perpetual and has no maturity date. The Company may redeem the shares of Series E Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, on any date on or after February 1, 2026. The holders of Series E Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive, if declared by the\nCompany's board of directors, noncumulative cash dividends on each date that dividends or other distributions are payable. The holders of the Series E Preferred Stock will not have voting rights except for any vote required by law or by the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, or for\neffecting or validating: (i) any increase or decrease in the authorized number of shares of Series E Preferred Stock or issuance of shares of Series E Preferred Stock after the original issue date; (ii) any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or\nBylaws of the Company that would adversely affect the voting powers, preferences, privileges or special rights of the Series E Preferred Stock; (iii) any amendment or alteration of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company to authorize or create, or increase the authorized\namount of any shares of any class or series or any securities convertible into shares of any class or series of capital stock of the Company ranking senior to Series E Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the\nCompany; or (iv) a merger or consolidation of the Company with\n87\nanother entity (whether or not a corporation), unless in each case (A) the shares of Series E Preferred Stock remain outstanding and (B) such shares remaining outstanding or such preference securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and\nlimitations and restrictions, and limitations and restrictions thereof as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and restrictions and limitations thereof, of the Series E Preferred Stock immediately prior to such\nconsummation.\nOn February 16, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with J.P. Morgan Chase Community Development Corporation, under which it sold: (i) 112,612 shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at a purchase price of $8.88 per share, and (ii) 5,000 shares of a new\nseries of preferred stock, Series F non-cumulative non-voting non-convertible preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, at a purchase price of $1,000 per share, in a private placement for gross proceeds of approximately $6.0 million.

The operations and profitability of the Bank are significantly affected by legislation and the policies of the various regulatory agencies. In July 2013, the FDIC and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that revised their leverage and risk-\nbased capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule, which became effective for the Bank on\nJanuary 1, 2015, established a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio, a minimum leverage ratio and increases in the Tier 1 and Total risk-based capital ratios. The rule also limits a banking organization's capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking\norganization does not hold a \"capital conservation buffer\" consisting of 2.5% of CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in annually beginning\nJanuary 1, 2016. On January 1, 2019, the full capital conservation buffer requirement of 2.5% became effective, making its minimum CET1 plus buffer 7%, its minimum Tier 1 capital plus buffer 8.5% and its minimum total capital plus buffer 10.5%.\nIn accordance with the recently enacted Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, the federal banking agencies have adopted, effective January 1, 2020, a final rule whereby financial institutions and financial institution holding companies that have less than\n$10 billion in total consolidated assets and meet other qualifying criteria, including a leverage ratio of greater than 9%, will be eligible to opt into a “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” framework. Qualifying community banking organizations that elect to use the community bank leverage\nratio framework and that maintain a leverage ratio of greater than 9% will be considered to have satisfied the generally applicable risk-based and leverage capital requirements in the agencies’ capital rules and will be considered to have met the “well capitalized” ratio requirements under the\nPrompt Corrective Action statutes. The CARES Act and implementing rules temporarily reduced the Community Bank Leverage Ratio to 8%, to be gradually increased back to 9% by 2022. The CARES Act also provides that, during the same time period, if a qualifying community banking\norganization falls no more than 1% below the community bank leverage ratio, it will have a two quarter grace period to satisfy the community bank leverage ratio. The agencies reserved the authority to disallow the use of the Community Bank Leverage Ratio by a financial institution or\nholding company based on the risk profile of the organization.\n88\nCarver Federal, as a matter of prudent management, targets as its goal the maintenance of capital ratios which exceed these minimum requirements and that are consistent with Carver Federal's risk profile. In assessing an institution's capital adequacy, the OCC takes into consideration\nnot only these numeric factors but also qualitative factors, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where necessary. Regardless of Basel III's minimum requirements, Carver, as a result of the previously described Formal Agreement, was issued\nan Individual Minimum Capital Ratio (\"IMCR\") letter by the OCC, which requires the Bank to maintain minimum regulatory capital levels of 9% for its Tier 1 leverage ratio and 12% for its total risk-based capital ratio. At March 31, 2021, the Bank's capital level exceeded the regulatory\nrequirements and its IMCR requirements with a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 10.01%, Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 14.41%, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 14.41%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of 15.56%.\nThe table below presents the Bank's regulatory capital ratios at March 31, 2021 and 2020.\nMarch 31, 2021 March 31, 2020\n($ in thousands) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nTier 1 leverage capital\nRegulatory capital $ 66,644 10.01 % $ 63,683 11.25 %\nIndividual minimum capital requirement 59,946 9.00 % 50,948 9.00 %\nMinimum capital requirement 26,643 4.00 % 22,643 4.00 %\nExcess 40,001 6.01 % 41,040 7.25 %\nCommon equity Tier 1\nRegulatory capital $ 66,644 14.41 % $ 63,683 15.23 %\nMinimum capital requirement 32,383 7.00 % 29,268 7.00 %\nExcess 34,261 7.41 % 34,415 8.23 %\nTier 1 risk-based capital\nRegulatory capital $ 66,644 14.41 % $ 63,683 15.23 %\nMinimum capital requirement 39,323 8.50 % 35,540 8.50 %\nExcess 27,321 5.91 % 28,143 6.73 %\nTotal risk-based capital\nRegulatory capital $ 71,989 15.56 % $ 68,904 16.48 %\nIndividual minimum capital requirement 55,514 12.00 % 50,174 12.00 %\nMinimum capital requirement 48,575 10.50 % 43,902 10.50 %\nExcess 23,414 5.06 % 25,002 5.98 %\nNOTE 13.

The balance at March 31, 2020 included $1.9 million of unrealized gains for the year ended March 31, 2020.\nNOTE 14. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT AND STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS\nSavings Incentive Plan. Carver has a savings incentive plan, pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Code, for all eligible employees of the Bank. The Bank matches contributions to the 401(k) Plan equal to 100% of pre-tax contributions made by each employee up to a maximum of 3% of\ntheir pay, subject to IRS limitations. All such matching contributions are fully vested and non-forfeitable at all times regardless of the years of service with the Bank. The 401(k) match was temporarily suspended effective October 1, 2020.\nCompensation expense recognized for the savings incentive plan was $118 thousand and $254 thousand, respectively, for fiscal 2021 and 2020.\nStock Option Plans. In September 2006, Carver stockholders approved the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the \"2006 Incentive Plan\") which provides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock to employees and directors who are selected to receive awards\nby the Committee. The 2006 Incentive Plan authorizes Carver to grant awards with respect to 20,000 shares, but no more than 10,000 shares of restricted stock may be granted. Options are granted at a price not less than fair market value of Carver common stock at the time of the grant for a\nperiod not to exceed 10 years. Shares generally vest in 20% increments over 5 years, however, the Committee may specify a different vesting schedule. At March 31, 2021, there were 3,733 options outstanding under the 2006 Incentive Plan and 3,733 were exercisable. All options are\nexercisable immediately upon a participant's disability, death or a change in control, as defined in the 2006 Incentive Plan, if the person is employed on that date. If the person is terminated (voluntary or involuntarily) from the Bank, all unvested shares are forfeited. Pursuant to the plan, the\nBank recognized $1 thousand and $3 thousand as expense for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nIn September 2014, Carver stockholders approved the Carver Bancorp, Inc. 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the \"2014 Incentive Plan\") which provides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock to executive officers and directors who are selected to receive\nawards by the Committee. The 2014 Incentive Plan authorizes Carver to grant awards with respect to 250,000 shares. All of the shares may be issued pursuant to stock options (all of which may be incentive stock options) or all of which may be issued pursuant to restricted stock awards or\nrestricted stock units. Unless the Committee determines otherwise, the award agreements will specify that no award will vest more rapidly than 25% per year over a four-year period, with the first installment vesting one year after the date of grant, subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of\nspecific events. During fiscal 2021 51,000 restricted stock awards were issued and 31,000 restricted stock awards were issued.in fiscal 2020. At March 31, 2021, there were 3,000 options outstanding under the 2014 Incentive Plan and 750 were exercisable. All options are exercisable\nimmediately upon a participant's disability, death or change in control, as defined in the 2014 Incentive Plan, if the person is employed on that date. If the person is terminated (voluntary or involuntarily) from the Bank, all unvested shares are forfeited. Pursuant to the plan, the Bank recognized\n$88 thousand as expense for fiscal year 2021 and $24 thousand in fiscal year 2020.\nInformation regarding nonvested shares of restricted stock awards outstanding for the years ended March 31 is as follows:\n2021 2020\nWeighted Average Weighted Average\nShares Grant Price Shares Grant Price\nOutstanding, beginning of year 32,100 $ 3.09 1,950 $ 4.76\nGranted 51,000 5.84 31,000 3.04\nVested (10,350) 3.02 (850) 4.95\nForfeited — — — —\nOutstanding, end of year 72,750 $ 5.00 32,100 $ 3.09\nUnrecognized compensation expense on unvested restricted shares as of March 31, 2021 totaled $257 thousand.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nCredit Related Commitments. The Bank is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers and in connection with its overall investment strategy. These instruments involve, to varying degrees,\nelements of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. In accordance with GAAP, these instruments are not recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Such instruments primarily include lending obligations, including commitments to originate mortgage and consumer loans and to fund\nunused lines of credit.\nThe Bank's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does\nfor on-balance-sheet instruments.\n91\nThe following table reflects the Bank's outstanding commitments as of March 31:\n$ in thousands 2021 2020\nCommitments to fund mortgage loans $ 2,179 $ 5,557\nCommitments to fund commercial and consumer loans — 4,500\nLines of credit 1,677 2,702\nCommitment to fund private equity investment 253 253\n$ 4,109 $ 13,012\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since some of these\ncommitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Bank evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the\nBank upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the counterparty.\nMortgage Representation & Warranty Liabilities\nDuring the period 2004 through 2009, the Bank originated 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and sold the loans to the Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”). The loans were sold to FNMA with the standard representations and warranties for loans sold to the\nGovernment Sponsored Entities (GSE's). The Bank may be required to repurchase these loans in the event of breaches of these representations and warranties. In the event of a repurchase, the Bank is typically required to pay the unpaid principal balance as well as outstanding interest and fees.\nThe Bank then recovers the loan or, if the loan has been foreclosed, the underlying collateral. The Bank is exposed to any losses on repurchased loans after giving effect to any recoveries on the collateral. The Bank has not received a request to repurchase any of these loans since the second\nquarter of fiscal 2015, and there have not been any additional requests from FNMA for loans to be reviewed.\nThe following table presents information on open requests from FNMA. The amounts presented are based on outstanding loan principal balances.\n$ in thousands Loans sold to FNMA\nOpen claims as of March 31, 2020 (1) $ 1,952\nGross new demands received —\nLoans repurchased/made whole —\nDemands rescinded —\nAdvances on open claims —\nPrincipal payments received on open claims (265)\nOpen claims as of March 31, 2021 (1) $ 1,687\n(1)The open claims include all open requests received by the Bank where either FNMA has requested loan files for review, where FNMA has not formally rescinded the repurchase request or where the Bank has not agreed to repurchase the loan. The amounts reflected in this table are the unpaid principal balance and\ndo not incorporate any losses the Bank would incur upon the repurchase of these loans.\nThe table below summarizes changes in our representation and warranty reserves during fiscal 2021.\n$ in thousands March 31, 2021\nRepresentation and warranty repurchase reserve, March 31, 2020 (1) $ 226\nNet adjustment to reserve for repurchase losses (2) (45)\nRepresentation and warranty repurchase reserve, March 31, 2021 (1) $ 181\n(1) Reported in consolidated statements of financial condition as a component of other liabilities.\n(2) Component of other non-interest expense.\nThe Bank also has, in the normal course of business, commitments for services and supplies.\nLegal Proceedings. From time to time, the Company and the Bank or one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries are parties to various legal proceedings incident to their business. At March 31, 2021, certain claims, suits, complaints and investigations (collectively “proceedings”) involving\nthe Company and the Bank or a subsidiary, arising in the ordinary course of business,\n92\nhave been filed or are pending. The Company is unable at this time to determine the ultimate outcome of each proceeding, but believes, after discussions with legal counsel representing the Company and the Bank or the subsidiary in these proceedings, that it has meritorious defenses to each\nproceeding and appropriate measures have been taken to defend the interests of the Company, Bank or subsidiary. There were no legal proceedings pending or known to be contemplated against us that in the opinion of management, would be expected to have a material adverse effect on the\nfinancial condition or results of operations of the Company or the Bank.\nNOTE 16. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nFair value is an “exit” price, representing the amount that would be received when selling an asset, or paid when transferring a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants. Fair value is thus a market-based measurement that should be determined based on\nassumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. Fair value measurements are categorized in a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\n• Level 1— Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\n• Level 2— Inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.\n• Level 3— Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.\nA financial instrument’s categorization within this valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe following table presents, by valuation hierarchy, assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, and that are included in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at these\n93\ndates:\nFair Value Measurements at March 31, 2021, Using\nQuoted Prices in Active Markets for Significant Other Observable Inputs Significant Unobservable Inputs\n$ in thousands Identical Assets (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total Fair Value\nMortgage servicing rights $ — $ — $ 147 $ 147\nInvestment securities\nAvailable-for-sale:\nMortgage-backed securities:\nGovernment National Mortgage Association — 1,026 — 1,026\nFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation — 27,785 — 27,785\nFederal National Mortgage Association — 14,610 — 14,610\nU.S. Government Agency securities — 18,631 — 18,631\nCorporate bonds — 4,481 — 4,481\nMuni securities — 16,610 — 16,610\nAsset-backed securities — 3,364 — 3,364\nTotal available-for-sale securities — 86,507 — 86,507\nTotal assets $ — $ 86,507 $ 147 $ 86,654\nFair Value Measurements at March 31, 2020, Using\nQuoted Prices in Active Markets for Significant Other Observable Inputs Significant Unobservable Inputs\n$ in thousands Identical Assets (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total Fair Value\nMortgage servicing rights $ — $ — $ 145 $ 145\nInvestment securities\nAvailable-for-sale:\nMortgage-backed securities:\nGovernment National Mortgage Association — 3,587 — 3,587\nFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation — 9,538 — 9,538\nFederal National Mortgage Association — 22,168 — 22,168\nU.S. Government Agency securities — 26,481 — 26,481\nCorporate bonds — 4,055 — 4,055\nTotal available-for-sale securities — 65,829 — 65,829\nTotal assets $ — $ 65,829 $ 145 $ 65,974\nInstruments for which unobservable inputs are significant to their fair value measurement (i.e., Level 3) include mortgage servicing rights (\"MSR\") and other investments. Level 3 assets accounted for 0.02% and 0.03% of the Company's total assets measured at fair value at March 31,\n2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe Company reviews and updates the fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Changes from one quarter to the next that are related to the observable inputs to a fair value measurement may result in a reclassification from one hierarchy level to another.\nBelow is a description of the methods and significant assumptions utilized in estimating the fair value of available-for-sale securities and MSR:\nWhere quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.\nIf quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flows. These pricing models primarily use market-based or independently sourced\nmarket parameters as inputs, including, but not limited to, yield curves, interest rates, equity or debt prices, and credit spreads. In addition to market information, models also incorporate transaction details, such as\n94\nmaturity and cash flow assumptions. Securities valued in this manner would generally be classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy and primarily include such instruments as mortgage-related securities and corporate debt.\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, there were no transfers of investments into or out of each level of the fair value hierarchy.\nIn certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to the valuation, securities are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. In valuing certain securities, the determination of fair value may require benchmarking to similar instruments or\nanalyzing default and recovery rates. Quoted price information for the MSRs is not available. Therefore, MSRs are valued using market-standard models to model the specific cash flow structure. Key inputs to the model consist of principal balance of loans being serviced, servicing fees and\ndiscount and prepayment rates.\nThe methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market\nparticipants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\nThe following table includes a rollforward of assets classified by the Company within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020:\nBeginning balance, April 1, Total Realized/Unrealized Gains/(Losses) Transfers to/(from) Ending balance, Change in Unrealized Gains/(Losses) Related\n$ in thousands 2020 Recorded in Income (1) Issuances / (Settlements) Level 3 March 31, 2021 to Instruments Held at March 31, 2021\nMortgage Servicing Rights 145 2 — — 147 2\nBeginning balance, April 1, Total Realized/Unrealized Transfers to/(from) Ending balance, Change in Unrealized Gains/(Losses) Related\n$ in thousands 2019 Gains/(Losses) Recorded in Income (1) Issuances / (Settlements) Level 3 March 31, 2020 to Instruments Held at March 31, 2020\nMortgage Servicing Rights 180 (35) — — 145 (33)\n(1) Includes net servicing cash flows and the passage of time.\nFor Level 3 assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements were as follows:\n$ in thousands Fair Value at March 31, 2021 Valuation Technique Significant Unobservable Inputs Significant Unobservable Input Value\nMortgage Servicing Rights 147 Discounted Cash Flow Weighted Average Constant Prepayment Rate (1) 13.33 %\nOption Adjusted Spread (\"OAS\") applied to Treasury curve 1200 basis points\n$ in thousands Fair Value at March 31, 2020 Valuation Technique Significant Unobservable Inputs Significant Unobservable Input Value\nMortgage Servicing Rights 145 Discounted Cash Flow Weighted Average Constant Prepayment Rate (1) 15.64 %\nOption Adjusted Spread (\"OAS\") applied to Treasury curve 1200 basis points\n(1) Represents annualized loan repayment rate assumptions\nCertain assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Such instruments are subject to fair value adjustments under certain circumstances (e.g. when there is evidence of impairment). The following table presents assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a\nnon-recurring basis as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, and that are included in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at these dates:\n95\nFair Value Measurements at March 31, 2021, Using\nQuoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical\n$ in thousands Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Fair Value\nImpaired loans $ — $ — $ 5,341 $ 5,341\nOther real estate owned $ — $ — $ 60 $ 60\nFair Value Measurements at March 31, 2020, Using\nQuoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical\n$ in thousands Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Fair Value\nImpaired loans $ — $ — $ 1,293 $ 1,293\nOther real estate owned $ — $ — $ 120 $ 120\nFor Level 3 assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements were as follows:\n$ in thousands Fair Value at March 31, 2021 Valuation Technique Significant Unobservable Inputs Significant Unobservable Input Value\nImpaired loans $ 5,341 Appraisal of collateral Appraisal adjustments 7.5% cost to sell\nOther real estate owned 60 Appraisal of collateral Appraisal adjustments 7.5% cost to sell\n$ in thousands Fair Value at March 31, 2020 Valuation Technique Significant Unobservable Inputs Significant Unobservable Input Value\nImpaired loans $ 1,293 Appraisal of collateral Appraisal adjustments 7.5% cost to sell\nOther real estate owned 120 Appraisal of collateral Appraisal adjustments 7.5% cost to sell\nThe fair values of collateral dependent impaired loans are determined using various valuation techniques, including consideration of appraised values and other pertinent real estate market data.\nOther real estate owned represents property acquired by the Bank in settlement of loans less costs to sell (i.e., through foreclosure, repossession or as an in-substance foreclosure). These assets are recorded at the lower of their cost or fair value. At the time of acquisition of the real\nestate owned, the real property value is adjusted to its current fair value. Any subsequent adjustments will be to the lower of cost or fair value.\nNOTE 17. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nDisclosures regarding the fair value of financial instruments are required to include, in addition to the carrying value, the fair value of certain financial instruments, both assets and liabilities recorded on and off-balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value.\nAccounting guidance defines financial instruments as cash, evidence of ownership of an entity, or a contract that conveys or imposes on an entity the contractual right or obligation to either receive or deliver cash or another financial instrument. The fair value of a financial instrument is\ndiscussed below. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, estimated fair values have been determined by the Bank using the best available data and estimation methodology suitable for each such category of financial instruments. For those loans and deposits with floating interest\nrates, it is presumed that estimated fair values generally approximate their recorded carrying value. The Bank's primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact the Bank's fair value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing\nliabilities, other than those which are short-term in maturity.\nThe carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Bank's financial instruments and estimation methodologies at March 31 are as follows:\n96\nMarch 31, 2021\nQuoted Prices in Active\nCarrying Estimated Markets for Identical Assets Significant Other Observable Significant Unobservable Inputs\n$ in thousands Amount Fair Value (Level 1) Inputs (Level 2) (Level 3)\nFinancial Assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 75,591 $ 75,591 $ 75,591 $ — $ —\nSecurities available-for-sale 86,507 86,507 — 86,507 —\nSecurities held-to-maturity 7,807 8,140 — 8,140 —\nLoans receivable 478,409 487,806 — — 487,806\nAccrued interest receivable 2,640 2,640 — 2,640 —\nMortgage servicing rights 147 147 — — 147\nFinancial Liabilities:\nDeposits $ 556,559 $ 557,049 $ 402,843 $ 154,206 $ —\nOther borrowed money 37,108 37,150 — 37,150 —\nAccrued interest payable 3,212 3,212 — 3,212 —\nMarch 31, 2020\nQuoted Prices in Active\nCarrying Estimated Markets for Identical Assets Significant Other Observable Significant Unobservable Inputs\n$ in thousands Amount Fair Value (Level 1) Inputs (Level 2) (Level 3)\nFinancial Assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 47,540 $ 47,540 $ 47,540 $ — $ —\nSecurities available-for-sale 65,829 65,829 — 65,829 —\nSecurities held-to-maturity 10,151 10,564 — 10,564 —\nLoans receivable 423,786 438,017 — — 438,017\nAccrued interest receivable 2,052 2,052 — 2,052 —\nMortgage servicing rights 145 145 — — 145\nOther assets - Interest-bearing deposits 981 981 — 981 —\nFinancial Liabilities:\nDeposits $ 488,815 $ 489,309 $ 291,951 $ 197,358 $ —\nOther borrowed money 13,403 13,386 — 13,386 —\nAccrued interest payable 2,695 2,695 — 2,695 —\nNOTE 18. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES\nThe Company's subsidiary, Carver Statutory Trust I, is not consolidated with Carver Bancorp, Inc. for financial reporting purposes. Carver Statutory Trust I was formed in 2003 for the purpose of issuing $13 million aggregate liquidation amount of floating rate Capital Securities due\nSeptember 17, 2033 (“Capital Securities”) and $0.4 million of common securities (which are the only voting securities of Carver Statutory Trust I), which are 100% owned by Carver Bancorp, Inc., and using the proceeds to acquire Junior Subordinated Debentures issued by Carver Bancorp,\nInc. Carver Bancorp, Inc. has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the Capital Securities along with all obligations of Carver Statutory Trust I under the trust agreement relating to the Capital Securities.\nThe Bank's subsidiary, Carver Community Development Corporation (“CCDC”), was formed to facilitate its participation in local economic development and other community-based initiatives. Per the NMTC Award's Allocation Agreement between the CDFI Fund and CCDC,\nCCDC is permitted to form and sub-allocate credits to subsidiary Community Development Entities (“CDEs”) to facilitate investments in separate development projects. In June 2006, CCDC received a NMTC award of $59 million. CCDC received a second NMTC award of $65 million in\nMay 2009, and a third award of $25 million in August 2011. During the period from December 2009 to September 2012, CCDC transferred rights to investors in NMTC projects (entities CDEs 13-21). CCDC has a contingent obligation to reimburse the investors for any losses or shortfalls\nincurred as a result of the NMTC projects not being in compliance with certain regulations that would void the\n97\ninvestors' ability to otherwise utilize tax credits stemming from the award. The NMTC compliance period was completed for all these entities, and CDEs 2-21 have been dissolved.\nCCDC established various special purpose entities (CDEs 22-25) through which its investments in NMTC eligible activities will be conducted. As of March 31, 2021, there have been no activities in these entities.\nThe variable interest entities (“VIEs”) are consolidated, as required, where Carver has controlling financial interest in these entities and is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Carver is normally deemed to have a controlling financial interest and be the primary beneficiary if it has\nboth of the following characteristics:\n(a) the power to direct activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entities economic performance; and\n(b) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could benefit from the activities that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nAs none of the Bank's VIEs meet the above criteria, there are no consolidated VIEs at March 31, 2021.\nThe Bank's unconsolidated VIEs, in which the Company holds significant variable interests or has continuing involvement through servicing a majority of assets in a VIE at March 31, 2021 are presented below:\nInvolvement with SPE (000's) Funded Exposure Unfunded Exposure Total\nRecognized Gain (Loss) Significant unconsolidated VIE Total Involvement with SPE\n(000's) Total Rights transferred assets asset Debt Investments Equity Investments Funding Commitments Maximum exposure to loss\nCarver Statutory Trust 1(1) $ — $ — $ 13,400 $ 13,400 $ 16,110 $ 400 $ — $ — $ 16,510\n1 Carver Statutory Trust debt investment includes deferred interest of $3.1 million, which was paid on June 16, 2021.\nNOTE 19. NON-INTEREST REVENUE AND EXPENSE\nTopic 606 does not apply to revenue associated with financial instruments, including revenue from loans and securities. In addition, certain non-interest income streams such as gains on sales of residential mortgage and SBA loans, income associated with servicing assets, and loan fees,\nincluding residential mortgage originations to be sold and prepayment and late fees charged across all loan categories are also not in scope of the new guidance. Topic 606 is applicable to non-interest revenue streams, such as depository fees, service charges and commission revenues.\nHowever, the recognition of these revenue streams did not change significantly upon adoption of Topic 606. Non-interest revenue streams in-scope of Topic 606 are discussed below.\nDepository fees and charges\nDepository fees and charges primarily relate to service fees on deposit accounts and fees earned from debit cards and check cashing transactions. Service fees on deposit accounts consist of ATM fees, NSF fees, account maintenance charges and other deposit related fees. The revenue is\nrecognized monthly when the Bank's performance obligations are complete, or as incurred for transaction-based fees in accordance with the fee schedules for the Bank's deposit products and services.\nLoan fees and service charges\nLoan fees and service charges primarily relate to program management fees and fees earned in accordance with the Bank's standard lending fees (such as inspection and late charges). These standard lending fees are earned on a monthly basis upon receipt.\nOther non-interest income\nOther non-interest income includes correspondent banking fees, and income associated with an advertising services agreement covering marketing and use of the Bank's office space with a third party. The revenue is recognized on a monthly basis.\nInterchange income\n98\nThe Company earns interchange fees from debit card holder transactions conducted through various payment networks. Interchangee fees from cardholder transactions are recognized daily, concurrently with the transaction processing services provided by an outsource technology\nsolution and are presented on a net basis.\nThe following table presents non-interest income, segregated by revenue streams in-scope and out-of-scope of Topic 606, for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020:\nYears Ended March 31,\n$ in thousands 2021 2020\nNon-interest income\nIn-scope of Topic 606\nDepository fees and charges $ 2,637 $ 3,147\nLoan fees and service charges 288 307\nOther non-interest income 1,279 55\nNon-interest income (in-scope of Topic 606) 4,204 3,509\nNon-interest income (out-of-scope of Topic 606) 1,994 230\nTotal non-interest income $ 6,198 $ 3,739\nThe following table sets forth other non-interest income and expense totals exceeding 1% of the aggregate of total interest income and non-interest income for any of the years presented:\nYears Ended March 31,\n$ in thousands 2021 2020\nOther non-interest income:\nGrant income $ 500 $ —\nCorrespondent banking fees 1,235 —\nOther 276 184\nTotal non-interest income $ 2,011 $ 184\nOther non-interest expense:\nAdvertising $ 380 $ 281\nLegal expense 498 611\nInsurance and surety 766 621\nAudit expense 378 537\nOutsourced service 100 304\nData lines / internet 432 412\nRetail expenses 825 733\nDirector's fees 366 331\nOther 1,649 1,776\nTotal non-interest expense $ 5,394 $ 5,606\nNOTE 20.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nOn May 6, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with Spectrum Communications Indemnity Inc., in which Spectrum would provide the Company with an unsecured and subordinated long-dated, below-market-rate loan in the amount of $1.5 million to finance eligible loans\noffered through the Bank's community investment initiatives loan program.\nOn May 13, 2021, the Company received a non-objection letter from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia to make a total payment of approximately $3.2 million in settlement of deferred interest on the subordinated debt associated with its trust preferred securities due. Payment\nin full was sent to the trustee on June 16, 2021 for distribution to all securities holders the following day.\nOn June 7, 2021, the Bank became aware of a possible fraud incident involving the unauthorized use of a borrower’s account through a third-party vendor’s online cash management system. The Bank’s preliminary investigation of this matter indicates that unauthorized wires totaling\n$2.1 million were fraudulently withdrawn from the borrower’s money market account\n101\nat the Bank from May 12, 2021 through June 1, 2021. The preliminary investigation indicates that an unauthorized person or entity was provided access to the borrower’s account through a third party online banking system. The Bank contacted the appropriate regulatory and law enforcement\nagencies, as well as its insurance provider. The total exposure to the Bank as a result of this incident is $2.1 million. However, the Bank is pursuing all available sources of recovery and other means of mitigating the potential loss. If any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable\ninsurance limits, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n102\nITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.\nNone.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\n(a) Evaluation of Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures are the controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods\nspecified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and\ncommunicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nThe Company maintains controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and\nforms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. As of March 31, 2021, the Company's management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Accounting Officer), has evaluated the effectiveness of the\nCompany's disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and\nprocedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must necessarily reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is\nrequired to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\nBased on the foregoing evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2021.\n(b) Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company's system of internal control is designed under the supervision of management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\nOfficer, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company's financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes policies and\nprocedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP,\nand that receipts and expenditures are made only in accordance with the authorization of management and the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Bank; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the\nCompany's assets that could have a material effect on the Company's financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk\nthat the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.\nThe management of Carver Bancorp, Inc., with participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2021. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by\nthe Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in the Internal Control -- Integrated Framework (2013). Based on the assessment under COSO, management determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2021.\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to\nrules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management’s report in this annual report.\n103\n(c) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have not been any changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nITEM 9B.

(the “Company”) is registered under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).\nThe summary of the general terms and provisions of the Company’s capital stock registered under Section 12(b) set forth below does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified by reference to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the “Certificate”)\nand Bylaws (as amended, the “Bylaws,” and together with the Certificate, the “Charter Documents”), each of which is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission of which this Exhibit is a part. For\nadditional information, please read the Company’s Charter Documents and the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (as amended from time to time, the “DGCL”).\nCommon Stock\nGeneral\nWe are currently authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”), and 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share. The Common Stock is listed on NASDAQ under the symbol \"CARV.\".\nVoting\nOur stockholders of record are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted on by stockholders, except that if any stockholder holds more than 10% of our outstanding voting stock, that stockholder is entitled to only 1/100 of a vote for each share held in excess of 10% of\nour outstanding voting stock.\nDividends\nThe payment of dividends is within the discretion of our board of directors, subject to applicable regulatory restrictions. On October 29, 2010, our board of directors announced that, based on highly uncertain economic conditions and the desire to preserve capital, the Company was suspending\npayment of the quarterly cash dividend on the Common Stock. Additionally, there are limitations imposed on the Company by board resolutions which require, among other things, written approval of the Federal Reserve Bank prior to the declaration or payment of dividends, any increase in\ndebt by the Company, or the redemption of Company common stock, and the effect on operations resulting from such limitations. We may not pay any dividends on our Common Stock if we do not simultaneously pay equivalent dividends on all outstanding shares of preferred stock.\nOther Rights\nOur stockholders have no conversion, preemptive or other subscription rights and there are no sinking fund or redemption provisions applicable to the Common Stock. If we liquidate, dissolve or wind up our affairs, common stockholders are entitled to share proportionately in the assets\navailable for distribution to common stockholders. All of the outstanding shares of Common Stock are fully paid and non-assessable.\nPreferred Stock\nOur Certificate permits us to issue up to 2,000,000 shares of one or more series of preferred stock and authorize our board of directors to designate the preferences, limitations and relative rights of any such series of preferred stock. We have 17,601 shares of Series D Convertible Non-\nCumulative Non-Voting Participating Preferred Stock (the \"Series D Preferred Stock\") that are issued and outstanding, 3,177 shares of Series E Non-Cumulative Non-Voting Participating Preferred Stock (the \"Series E Preferred Stock\") that are issued and outstanding, and 5,000 shares of\nSeries F Non-Cumulative Non-Voting Participating Preferred Stock (the \"Series F Preferred Stock\") that are issued and outstanding. Our Series D Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and Series F Preferred Stock are not registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act.\nAlthough the creation and authorization of preferred stock does not, in and of itself, have any effect on the rights of the holders of our Common Stock, the issuance of one or more series of preferred stock may affect the holders of Common Stock in a number of respects, including the\nfollowing: by subordinating our common stock to the preferred stock with respect to dividend rights, liquidation preferences, and other rights, preferences, and privileges; by diluting the voting power of our Common Stock; by diluting the earnings per share of our Common Stock; and by\nissuing Common Stock, upon the conversion of the\npreferred stock, at a price below the fair market value or original issue price of the Common Stock that is outstanding prior to such issuance.\nAnti-Takeover Provisions\nOur Certificate provides for a classified board of directors serving staggered three-year terms, which may make it more difficult for stockholders to elect a majority to our board of directors. In addition, directors may not be removed by stockholders except for cause and only upon the approval\nof 80% of the total votes eligible to be cast. Our Certificate also provides that a stockholder who owns more than 10% of our outstanding voting stock is entitled to cast 1/100th of a vote with respect to each such share held in excess of 10% of our outstanding voting stock.\nWe are prohibited, under certain circumstances, from engaging in a “business combination” with:\n• a stockholder who owns 10% or more of our outstanding voting stock (otherwise known as an “interested stockholder”);\n• an affiliate of an interested stockholder; or\n• an associate of an interested stockholder,\nfor two years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder. A “business combination” includes a merger or sale of more than 5% of our assets. However, the above provisions do not apply if:\n• the business combination is approved by our stockholders by an affirmative vote of at least 80% of the total votes eligible to be cast and by at least 50% of the total number of votes eligible to be cast by persons other than the interested stockholder and affiliates and associates of the\ninterested stockholder; or\n• the business combination is approved by a majority of directors who are not affiliates of, associates of, or otherwise affiliated with the interested stockholder and who were members of the board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder became an interested\nstockholder (or who were recommended by a majority of such directors in office at the time of their nominations), and the business combination satisfies certain requirements as to the fairness of consideration to stockholders other than the interested stockholder.\nThese provisions of our Certificate could prohibit or delay mergers or other change in control attempts, and thus may discourage attempts to acquire us. Furthermore, because we are a savings and loan holding company, any transaction involving a change of control is subject to regulatory\nreview and approval.\nExhibit 21.1\nCARVER BANCORP, INC.\nSubsidiaries of Registrant\nOwnership Percentage State of Incorporation Description\nCarver Bancorp, Inc.
