Highlights include:\n\n  * **_Sales of_**** _$980 million_**** _with Growth-over-Market of 6%_****_1_**\n  * ** _Net income of_**** _$39 million_**** _and adjusted net income of $63 million_**\n  * ** _Adjusted EBITDA of_**** _$119 million_**\n  * ** _Launched 30 new products in the quarter and 71 year-to-date_**\n  * ** _New business wins of $4.9 billion year-to-date_**\n  * ** _Net cash of $229 million at quarter end_**\n\n\n\nVisteon reported solid net sales of $980 million in a challenging production environment. We delivered 6% outperformance relative to customer vehicle production, driven by strong demand for digital cockpit and electrification products. Our market outperformance was offset by lower customer production and reduced customer recoveries resulting from improved semiconductor supply.\n\nGross margin in the third quarter was $131 million. Net income attributable to Visteon was $39 million or $1.40 per diluted share and adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure defined below, was $63 million or $2.26 per diluted share. Net income, as compared to the prior year, includes the favorable impact of strong operational performance and lower net engineering, partially offset by restructuring expense incurred in the third quarter of 2024. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure defined below, was $119 million in the third quarter and reflects the Company’s strong focus on operational execution, commercial excellence, and cost discipline.\n\nFor the first nine months, cash from operations was $224 million, capital expenditures were $96 million and adjusted free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure defined below, was $135 million. The company ended the third quarter with cash of $553 million and debt of $324 million. Our strong balance sheet, with a net cash position of $229 million, provides the flexibility to deliver on our capital allocation priorities.\n\nVisteon launched 30 new products in the third quarter, with launches across each of its product lines. Key third quarter launches include an infotainment display system on the Tata Punch, highlighting our continued momentum in India; SmartCore(TM) on an electric SUV for Lynk & Co for the European market and the Renault Grand Koleos hybrid for the Korean market; a digital cluster on the Nissan Qashqai, a popular SUV in Europe; and a wireless BMS for the all-electric Jeep Wagoneer.\n\nVisteon secured $4.9 billion in new business through the first nine months of the year, including $2.5 billion of wins with OEMs in Asia excluding China. Our success in diversifying into adjacent end-markets also continued, with further momentum with two-wheeler and commercial vehicle OEMs. Third quarter wins included a large, curved display for multiple mass market vehicles in Europe for a global OEM, SmartCore™ and display wins for a SUV model for an Indian OEM and for an electric vehicle for a domestic China OEM. We also had a follow-on win for a digital cluster with a two-wheeler OEM in India.\n\n“Visteon delivered solid sales and growth-over-market in the third quarter, demonstrating our ability to navigate a challenging customer production environment,” said President and CEO Sachin Lawande. \"Demand from our customers remains robust for our diverse product portfolio targeting automotive megatrends of digitalization and electrification. Our continued success in securing new business wins and our momentum with two-wheeler and commercial vehicle OEMs provide a strong foundation for future growth.\"\n\nBased on our year-to-date performance and outlook for the fourth quarter, Visteon is updating its full-year 2024 guidance and anticipates sales in the range of $3.85 – $3.90 billion, adjusted EBITDA in the range of $465 – $480 million, and adjusted free cash flow in the range of $165 – $185 million.\n\n**About Visteon**\n\nVisteon is advancing mobility through innovative technology solutions that enable a software-defined and electric future.

excluded items may vary significantly in timing or amounts and/or may obscure trends useful in evaluating and comparing the Company's operating activities across reporting periods. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to the Company adjusted to eliminate the impact of depreciation and amortization, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, net interest expense, net income attributable to non-controlling interests, net restructuring expense, equity in net (income)/loss of non-consolidated affiliates, gain on non-consolidated affiliate transactions, and other gains and losses not reflective of the Company's ongoing operations.

Highlights include:\n\n  * **_Sales of_**** _$1,014 million_**** _with Growth-over-Market of_**** _9%_****_1_**\n  * ** _Net income of_**** _$71 million_**\n  * ** _Record Adjusted EBITDA of_**** _$136 million_**\n  * ** _Launched 41 new products across 17 OEMs in the first half_**\n  * ** _Won $3.1 billion in new business in the first half_**\n  * ** _Net cash of $181 million at quarter end_**\n\n\n\nVisteon reported net sales of $1,014 million compared to $983 million in the second quarter of the prior year. The increase in net sales was primarily due to strong performance of digital cockpit and electrification products, partially offset by lower customer production, and lower customer recoveries resulting from improved semiconductor supply. Visteon’s sales outperformed customer vehicle production volumes by 9%.\n\nGross margin in the second quarter was $147 million, and net income attributable to Visteon was $71 million or $2.54 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure defined below, was a record $136 million in the second quarter, an increase of $46 million compared to the prior year. The increase in adjusted EBITDA reflects the favorable impact of higher volumes and strong operational performance, lower engineering and SG&A costs, and the non-recurrence of a $15 million recall charge in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 13.4% of sales, an increase of 420 basis points compared to the prior year.\n\nFor the first six months, cash from operations was $126 million, capital expenditures were $68 million and adjusted free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure defined below, was $62 million. The company ended the second quarter with cash of $508 million and debt of $327 million. Our strong balance sheet, with a net cash position of $181 million, will allow us to balance organic investments, selective M&A, and capital returns to shareholders.\n\nVisteon's products launched on 41 vehicle models, diversified across 17 different OEMs, in the first half of the year. A key second quarter launch included a digital cluster for the Toyota Camry in the North American and Japanese markets. We also launched a center information display for the Mazda MX-30 crossover and a digital cluster for the Porsche Macan SUV. Our momentum in Rest of Asia continues, with launches across various Asian customers in key markets in the region.\n\nThe company won $3.1 billion of new business in the first half of the year, including nearly $1.8 billion of display wins. Visteon continues to successfully diversify its customer base, with over $1.8 billion of wins with Rest of Asia OEMs in the first half. Second quarter wins included several significant display wins, including a large, curved OLED display for a luxury vehicle platform for a Japanese OEM and a dual display for a SUV for another Japanese OEM. Visteon also won an audio infotainment and dual display system for a SUV with an Indian OEM.\n\n“Visteon delivered robust sales in the second quarter, driven by strong demand for our powertrain agnostic digital cockpit products and ramp up of electrification products.

In addition, the Company uses adjusted EBITDA (i) as a factor in incentive compensation decisions, (ii) to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company's business strategies, and (iii) because the Company's credit agreements use similar measures for compliance with certain covenants.\n\n**VISTEON CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES****RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES** _(In millions except per share amounts)__(Unaudited)_\n\n**_Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow_** : Free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow are presented as supplemental measures of the Company's liquidity that management believes are useful to investors in analyzing the Company's ability to service and repay its debt.
