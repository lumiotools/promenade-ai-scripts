Why? Significant shifts in our medium- and long-term strategy now drive our\ndozens of fragmented\nshort-term results.\npockets of profitable\ngrowth where TRNR’s To judge those results properly, shareholders must have a clear understanding of what\nwe’re aiming to achieve and why it makes sense.\npublic listing has\nexceptional and\nSpecifically, stockholders should bear in mind two key points.\nimmediate value\nFirst: with the acquisition of CLMBR’s assets earlier this year, Interactive Strength began\nwhat we expect to be a roughly 24-month transformation as a business that is expected\nto result in a scaled and profitable company.\nClose watchers of our company will have noted the update to our business model and\ngrowth strategy in August’s second-quarter 10-Q filing in the Management’s Discussion &\nAnalysis section, reflecting an important shift in TRNR’s focus.\nTo reiterate, we’re moving away from only scaling a single, direct-to-consumer,\nconnected-fitness platform and brand - FORME. We are moving toward building a\nportfolio of specialty fitness brands and equipment, through acquiring already-scaled\nand/or partially-scaled businesses in complementary niches of the larger health and\nwellness market. CLMBR was the first such asset, and we are actively working on\nacquiring others.\nOver the coming months, we’ll offer more detail with respect to the market and economic\nanalyses and thinking that underpins this strategy shift. For now, suffice to say that it has\nbecome clear that, within the larger health and wellness market globally, there are many\nattractive assets that could add profitability and growth when a part of a larger business,\nwhich is where TRNR’s public listing has exceptional and immediate value. We are also\nfinding exciting organic growth in verticals like golf, medical/physical therapy and\ncorporate wellness.\nUsing our listing, as well as the distribution and manufacturing partnerships derived from\nour early focus on FORME, Interactive Strength has a much faster path to scaled,\nprofitable growth than through pursuing D2C home fitness alone.\nSecond: our third quarter 2024 performance is the first quarter to begin to validate the\nnew value proposition summarized above.\nQ3 2024 | TRNR SHAREHOLDER LETTER 3\nThe graphs on the first page of this letter illustrate that this quarter’s performance,\ncombined with our guidance for the fourth quarter, reflect our positive expectations for\ngrowth. We acknowledge that our financial results overall remain subscale, so far. We\nhad higher expectations in the first half of this year for both top and bottom line growth.\nWe are not yet EBITDA positive, and we don’t expect to be until some point in 2025.\nYet also: as of the second quarter of 2024, we have our arms fully around the CLMBR\nacquisition; we have stabilized our NASDAQ listing compliance; and we are performing in\nInteractive Strength now\nline with our guidance.\nhas the ability to\nimprove both top and More importantly, TRNR is starting to show the power of its new business model. Each\nbottom-line set of charted data trends in the right direction, across a variety of key metrics. This\nclearly illustrates that Interactive Strength now has the ability to improve both top and\nperformance - in Q3’s\nbottom-line performance - in Q3’s case, both year-on-year and over the past two\ncase, both year-on-year\nsequential quarters.\nand over the past two\nsequential quarters I’m particularly pleased we managed to improve gross margins and profits as well as\ncontrol operating costs. As we layer in additional revenues from CLMBR and continue to\nbuild out the FORME platform, and as we acquire additional, higher-revenue businesses,\nthis operating discipline will lay the foundation for our expected EBITDA profitability in\n2025.\nTHIRD QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS\nPERFORMANCE\nThe company made\nprogress in terms of\nTRNR’s business began to experience the step-change we flagged earlier in the year on\nboth results and its top line, and disciplined operations also helped control costs and improve gross\noperations in Q3 margins.\nHighlights include:\nRevenues of just over $2 million, in line Net loss and earnings per diluted share of\nwith guidance for the quarter and a 10x $7 million and $1.50 for the quarter, vs.\nimprovement YOY for Q3 as well as over a $10 million and $29.35 in Q3 2023.\n3x improvement sequentially.\nAdjusted EBITDA loss of $2.3 million for Stockholder Equity of $5.8 million, well in\nQ3, a 30% improvement YOY and nearly a excess of the $2.5 million needed for\n20% improvement from Q2 2024. NASDAQ listing compliance.\nQ3 2024 | TRNR SHAREHOLDER LETTER 4\nOPERATIONS\nAs noted in prior quarters, we believe the company has significant potential\ninternationally, particularly for CLMBR. This expectation was borne out in Q3 with TRNR\nnotching exclusive distribution deals in Germany, the Gulf Region and Indonesia; and\nsecuring key certifications for CLMBR with regulators and distributors.\nHighlights include:\nAchieved RSG Group’s “global vendor” Earned preferred vendor partner status\ncertification status - which will help with Crunch Fitness and an invitation to\naccelerate our ability to sell CLMBR Crunch’s 2024 franchise convention,\ninternationally into the company’s network further cementing our relationship with\nof gyms including Gold’s Gym, John Reed the Crunch brand.\nand McFit.\nPassed EU compliance requirements for Secured exclusive distribution deal and\nselling CLMBR across the EU, unlocking six-figure order in Gulf Region with\nTRNR’s ability to fulfill existing orders in MefitPro.\nGermany, Austria and Switzerland.\nWon an exclusive deal for CLMBR to be Regained compliance with NASDAQ\ndistributed in Indonesia with Primafit, a listing requirements for shareholder equity\nleading distributor of best-in-class brands and won its listing appeal with the\nin that major regional market. exchange.\nSecured exclusive distribution for CLMBR\nin Germany, the world’s largest fitness\nmarket outside the US.\nOUTLOOK\nBased on deliveries in the quarter so far and the current order book, the Company\nexpects to generate $2.4 million in revenue at the midpoint during the fourth quarter, and\nto improve our Adjusted EBITDA loss to be below $2.0 million.\nThe major driver of expected revenue is whether orders to customers in Europe are\ndelivered in the fourth quarter, as determined by the timing of receiving the required\ncertifications.\nQ3 2024 | TRNR SHAREHOLDER LETTER 5\nDescription of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States,\nor GAAP, we believe the following non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance.\nThe Company's non-GAAP financial measure in this press release consist of Adjusted EBITDA, which we define as net\n(loss) income, adjusted to exclude: other expense (income), net; income tax expense (benefit); depreciation and\namortization expense; stock-based compensation expense; loss on debt extinguishment; vendor settlements;\ntransaction related expenses; and IPO readiness costs and expenses.\nThe Company believes the above adjusted financial measures help facilitate analysis of operating performance and the\noperating leverage in our business. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors for period-to-\nperiod comparisons of our business and in understanding and evaluating our operating results for the following reasons:\n● Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company's operating\nperformance without regard to items such as stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization\nexpense, other expense (income), net, and provision for income taxes that can vary substantially from company to\ncompany depending upon their financing, capital structures, and the method by which assets were acquired;\n● Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP\nfor planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of our core operating\nresults and the effectiveness of our business strategy, and in evaluating our financial performance; and\n● Adjusted EBITDA provides consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, facilitate period-to-\nperiod comparisons of our core operating results, and may also facilitate comparisons with other peer companies,\nmany of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results.\n● Our use of Adjusted EBITDA, or any other non-GAAP financial measures we may use in the future, is presented for\nsupplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered as a substitute for, or in isolation from, our\nfinancial results presented in accordance with GAAP. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations\nas analytical tools. Some of these limitations are, or may in the future be, as follows:\n● Although depreciation and amortization expense are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized\nmay have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements\nfor such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;\n● Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, which has recently been, and will continue to be for\nthe foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for our business and an important part of our compensation\nstrategy;\n● Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect: (1) changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (2) interest\nexpense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt, which reduces\ncash available to us; or (3) tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us;\n● Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect impairment charges for fixed assets and capitalized content, and gains (losses)\non disposals for fixed assets;\n● Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect gains associated with debt extinguishments.\n● Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect gains associated with vendor settlements.\n● Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect IPO readiness costs and expenses that do not qualify as equity issuance costs.\n● Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect non cash fair value gains (losses) on convertible notes, warrants and unrealized\ncurrency gains (losses).\nFurther, the non-GAAP financial measures presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other\ncompanies due to differences in the way that these measures are calculated. For example, the expenses and other items that\nwe exclude in our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from the expenses and other items, if any, that other companies\nmay exclude from Adjusted EBITDA when they report their operating results. Because companies in our industry may calculate\nsuch measures differently than we do, their usefulness as comparative measures is limited. Because of these limitations,\nAdjusted EBITDA should be considered along with other operating and financial performance measures presented in\naccordance with GAAP.\nQ3 2024 | TRNR SHAREHOLDER LETTER 6\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of\n1995.
