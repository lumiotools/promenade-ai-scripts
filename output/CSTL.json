(Nasdaq: CSTL), a company improving health through innovative tests that guide patient care, today announced its financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024. \n\n“We are thrilled with our third quarter performance, which reflects the continued success of our growth initiatives and the dedication of our team,” said Derek Maetzold, president and chief executive officer of Castle Biosciences. “We believe these outstanding third quarter results demonstrate the strength of our business model and the trust our patients and clinicians place in us. Moreover, we are especially proud of our operating results, which show our ability to translate growth into profitability. This performance is a testament to our team's hard work – that is, the people who call Castle home – and our focus on creating value for our patients, clinicians and stockholders. \n\n“Our third quarter results were strong across our therapeutic areas, with significant test adoption growth for our core products, which we believe was driven in part by expanded clinical evidence supporting their use. We were particularly excited about the recent publication of a new study which confirmed the use of DecisionDx®-SCC in identifying which patients with high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) will have a low or high likelihood of benefiting from adjuvant radiation therapy (ART). Importantly, this was the second study this year to demonstrate this utility of our test, as well as the second largest study ever published that evaluates the effectiveness of ART in SCC. Another DecisionDx-SCC related publication from earlier this year, Arron et al., was the largest study to date evaluating the effectiveness of ART in SCC. \n\n“Looking forward, we are encouraged by the strength of our execution and the fundamentals of our business. As such, we are raising our full-year 2024 total revenue guidance to $320-330 million, up from the previously provided guidance of $275-300 million, following our strong year-to-date performance and continued momentum in our business.\" \n\n**Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2024, Financial and Operational Highlights**\n\n  * Revenues were $85.8 million, a 39% increase compared to $61.5 million in the third quarter of 2023.

Specifically, the data demonstrated the ability of DecisionDx-SCC to provide clinically impactful risk stratification in high-risk SCC patient sub-populations (i.e., patients with suppressed immune systems in this study) to guide potential treatment intensification, such as ART. In the study, patients with lower-stage BWH T1-T2a SCC tumors were further stratified into distinct groups of those with more favorable and less favorable survival by the DecisionDx-SCC test, including in the T2a immunosuppressed patient subset which showed a higher rate of metastasis.

This is the second study to demonstrate the ability of DecisionDx-SCC to identify patients who are either more likely or less likely to benefit from ART, confirmed in an independent cohort of high-risk SCC patients. The first was demonstrated in a study by [Arron et al.](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fpii%2FS0360301624006850&esheet=54145951&newsitemid=20241104938614&lan=en-US&anchor=Arron+et+al.&index=2&md5=b4c1a46d8d045983e3dd4f3f9f1f59ac) published in May 2024.

Specifically, data from this study showed that DecisionDx-Melanoma can identify patients with T1 tumors with a low risk of sentinel lymph node (SLN) positivity who can safely forgo SLNB (negative predictive value of 98.4%), while maintaining very high survival rates in low-risk patients who did not have an SLNB (three-year recurrence free survival rate of 99.5%).

Specifically, data from this study showed that DecisionDx-Melanoma can identify patients with a low risk of SLN positivity who can safely forgo SLNB (negative predictive value of 100.0%). The results of this study demonstrate that DecisionDx-Melanoma can allow for more precise and personalized management of melanoma patients, improving patient selection for the SLNB surgical procedure and reducing unnecessary procedures and their associated healthcare costs.

Adjusted Revenues and Adjusted Gross Margin reflect adjustments to GAAP net revenues to exclude net positive and/or net negative revenue adjustments recorded in the current period associated with changes in estimated variable consideration related to test reports delivered in previous periods. Adjusted Gross Margin further excludes acquisition-related intangible asset amortization. Adjusted EBITDA excludes from net income (loss): interest income, interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, change in fair value of contingent consideration and acquisition related transaction costs. \n\nWe use Adjusted Revenues, Adjusted Gross Margin and Adjusted EBITDA internally because we believe these metrics provide useful supplemental information in assessing our revenue and operating performance reported in accordance with GAAP, respectively. We believe that Adjusted Revenues, when used in conjunction with our test report volume information, facilitates investors’ analysis of our current-period revenue performance and average selling price performance by excluding the effects of revenue adjustments related to test reports delivered in prior periods, since these adjustments may not be indicative of the current or future performance of our business. We believe that providing Adjusted Revenues may also help facilitate comparisons to our historical periods. Adjusted Gross Margin is calculated using Adjusted Revenues and therefore excludes the impact of revenue adjustments related to test reports delivered in prior periods, which we believe is useful to investors as described above. We further exclude acquisition-related intangible asset amortization in the calculation of Adjusted Gross Margin. We believe that excluding acquisition-related intangible asset amortization may facilitate gross margin comparisons to historical periods and may be useful in assessing current-period performance without regard to the historical accounting valuations of intangible assets, which are applicable only to tests we acquired rather than internally developed. We believe Adjusted EBITDA may enhance an evaluation of our operating performance because it excludes the impact of prior decisions made about capital investment, financing, investing and certain expenses we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, even when the same or similarly titled terms are used to identify such measures, limiting their usefulness for comparative purposes. \n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or used as substitutes for net revenues, gross margin or net income (loss) reported in accordance with GAAP; should be considered in conjunction with our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP; have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP; are unaudited; and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. In addition, from time to time in the future, there may be other items that we may exclude for purposes of these non-GAAP financial measures, and we may in the future cease to exclude items that we have historically excluded for purposes of these non-GAAP financial measures. Likewise, we may determine to modify the nature of adjustments to arrive at these non-GAAP financial measures. Because of the non-standardized definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, the non-GAAP financial measure as used by us in this press release and the accompanying reconciliation tables have limits in their usefulness to investors and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are presented in the tables at the end of this release. \n\n**About Castle Biosciences**\n\nCastle Biosciences (Nasdaq: CSTL) is a leading diagnostics company improving health through innovative tests that guide patient care.

Adjusted Revenues and Adjusted Gross Margin reflect adjustments to GAAP net revenues to exclude net positive and/or\nnet negative revenue adjustments recorded in the current period associated with changes in estimated variable consideration related to test reports delivered in previous periods. Adjusted\nGross Margin further excludes acquisition-related intangible asset amortization. Adjusted EBITDA excludes from net income (loss): interest income, interest expense, income tax expense\n(benefit), depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, change in fair value of contingent consideration and acquisition-related transaction costs.\nWe use Adjusted Revenues, Adjusted Gross Margin and Adjusted EBITDA internally because we believe these metrics provide useful supplemental information in assessing our revenue and\noperating performance reported in accordance with GAAP, respectively. We believe that Adjusted Revenues, when used in conjunction with our test report volume information, facilitates\ninvestors’ analysis of our current-period revenue performance and average selling price performance by excluding the effects of revenue adjustments related to test reports delivered in prior\nperiods, since these adjustments may not be indicative of the current or future performance of our business. We believe that providing Adjusted Revenues may also help facilitate comparisons\nto our historical periods. Adjusted Gross Margin is calculated using Adjusted Revenues and therefore excludes the impact of revenue adjustments related to test reports delivered in prior\nperiods, which we believe is useful to investors as described above. We further exclude acquisition-related intangible asset amortization in the calculation of Adjusted Gross Margin. We believe\nthat excluding acquisition-related intangible asset amortization may facilitate gross margin comparisons to historical periods and may be useful in assessing current-period performance\nwithout regard to the historical accounting valuations of intangible assets, which are applicable only to tests we acquired rather than internally developed. We believe Adjusted EBITDA may\nenhance an evaluation of our operating performance because it excludes the impact of prior decisions made about capital investment, financing, investing and certain expenses we believe are\nnot indicative of our ongoing performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, even when the same\nor similarly titled terms are used to identify such measures, limiting their usefulness for comparative purposes.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or used as substitutes for net revenues, gross margin, or net income (loss) reported in accordance with GAAP;\nshould be considered in conjunction with our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP; have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP; are unaudited; and are not\nprepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. In addition, from time to time in the future, there may be other items that we may exclude for purposes of these non-\nGAAP financial measures, and we may in the future cease to exclude items that we have historically excluded for purposes of these non-GAAP financial measures. Likewise, we may determine\nto modify the nature of adjustments to arrive at these non-GAAP financial measures. Because of the non-standardized definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, the non-GAAP financial\nmeasure as used by us in this press release and the accompanying reconciliation tables have limits in their usefulness to investors and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not\nbe directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these\nnon-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are presented in the tables at the end of this presentation.\nIndustry and Market Data\nThis presentation includes certain information and statistics obtained from third-party sources.

Adjusted Revenues and Adjusted Gross Margin reflect adjustments to GAAP net revenues to exclude net\npositive and/or net negative revenue adjustments recorded in the current period associated with changes in estimated variable consideration related to test reports delivered in\nprevious periods. Adjusted Gross Margin further excludes acquisition-related intangible asset amortization.\nWe use Adjusted Revenues and Adjusted Gross Margin internally because we believe these metrics provide useful supplemental information in assessing our revenue and\noperating performance reported in accordance with GAAP, respectively. We believe that Adjusted Revenues, when used in conjunction with our test report volume information,\nfacilitates investors’ analysis of our current-period revenue performance and average selling price performance by excluding the effects of revenue adjustments related to\ntest reports delivered in prior periods, since these adjustments may not be indicative of the current or future performance of our business. We believe that providing Adjusted\nRevenues may also help facilitate comparisons to our historical periods. Adjusted Gross Margin is calculated using Adjusted Revenues and therefore excludes the impact\nof revenue adjustments related to test reports delivered in prior periods, which we believe is useful to investors as described above. We further exclude acquisition-related\nintangible asset amortization in the calculation of Adjusted Gross Margin. We believe that excluding acquisition-related intangible asset amortization may facilitate gross margin\ncomparisons to historical periods and may be useful in assessing current-period performance without regard to the historical accounting valuations of intangible assets, which\nare applicable only to tests we acquired rather than internally developed. However, these non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used\nby other companies, even when the same or similarly titled terms are used to identify such measures, limiting their usefulness for comparative purposes.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or used as substitutes for net revenues, gross margin, or net loss reported in accordance\nwith GAAP; should be considered in conjunction with our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP; have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP; are\nunaudited; and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. In addition, from time to time in the future, there may be other items that we\nmay exclude for purposes of these non-GAAP financial measures, and we may in the future cease to exclude items that we have historically excluded for purposes of these non-\nGAAP financial measures. Likewise, we may determine to modify the nature of adjustments to arrive at these non-GAAP financial measures. Because of the nonstandardized\ndefinitions of non-GAAP financial measures, the non-GAAP financial measure as used by us in this press release and the accompanying reconciliation tables have limits in their\nusefulness to investors and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. Accordingly,\ninvestors should not place undue reliance on non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP\nfinancial measures are presented in the tables at the end of this release.\nIndustry and Market Data\nThis presentation includes certain information and statistics obtained from third-party sources.

We believe our $95.0 million of cash and cash equivalents and $184.8 million of marketable investment securities as of September 30,\n2024, and anticipated revenue from our test reports, will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements through at least the 12-month period\nfollowing the date that these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were issued.\nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024; the condensed consolidated statements of operations, the\ncondensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) and the condensed consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity, each\nfor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023; and the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are unaudited. The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have\nbeen prepared on the same basis as the audited annual financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which\ninclude only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair statement of our consolidated financial position as of September 30, 2024, the\nresults of our consolidated operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and our consolidated cash flows for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The financial data and other information disclosed in these notes related to the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are also unaudited. The results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are\nnot necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024, any other interim periods, or any future year or\nperiod. The balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 included herein was derived from the audited financial statements as of that date. Certain\ndisclosures have been condensed or omitted from the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements. These unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report\non Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 28, 2024 (the\n“2023 10-K”).\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated\nfinancial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates\ninclude revenue recognition, the valuation of stock-based compensation, assessing future tax exposure and the realizability of deferred tax\nassets, the useful lives and recoverability of long-lived assets, the goodwill impairment test, the valuation of acquired intangible assets and the\nvaluation of contingent consideration and other contingent liabilities. We base these estimates on historical and anticipated results, trends, and\nvarious other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. These estimates\nform the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and recorded revenues and expenses that are not readily\napparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.\n8\nTable of Contents\nCASTLE BIOSCIENCES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(UNAUDITED)\nCash and Cash Equivalents including Concentrations of Credit Risk\nCash equivalents consist of short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Our cash equivalents consist of\nmoney market funds, which are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), that are primarily invested in short-term U.S.\ngovernment obligations. Cash deposits at financial institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided by the FDIC. Management\nbelieves that we are not exposed to significant credit risk on our cash deposits due to the financial position of the financial institutions in which\ndeposits are held.\nMarketable Investment Securities\nAll debt securities are recognized in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (‘‘FASB’’) Accounting Standards Codification\n(‘‘ASC’’) Topic 320, Investments-Debt Securities (‘‘ASC 320’’). Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of\npurchase and re-evaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. All debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are\nrecorded at fair value in accordance with ASC 320. We recognize the unrealized gains and losses related to changes in fair value as a separate\ncomponent of accumulated other comprehensive loss within total stockholders’ equity, net of any related deferred income tax effects, on our\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets. Premiums or discounts from par value are amortized to interest income over the life of the underlying\ninvestment. Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are calculated at the individual security level and included in interest\nincome in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Impairments of available-for-sale debt securities, if any, are recorded in our\nunaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. See Notes 5 and 11 for further details.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), we follow a five-step process to recognize revenues:\n(1) identify the contract with the customer, (2) identify the performance obligations, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the\ntransaction price to the performance obligations and (5) recognize revenues when the performance obligations are satisfied. We have\ndetermined that we have a contract with the patient when the treating clinician orders the test. Our contracts generally contain a single\nperformance obligation, which is the delivery of the test report, and we satisfy our performance obligation at a point in time upon the delivery of\nthe test report to the treating clinician, at which point we can bill for the report. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the amount of\nconsideration to which we expect to be entitled, or the transaction price, and considers the effects of variable consideration. See Note 3 for\nfurther details.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\nWe classify accounts receivable balances that are expected to be paid more than one year from the consolidated balance sheet date as\nnoncurrent assets. The estimated timing of payment utilized as a basis for classification as noncurrent is determined by analyses of historical\npayor-specific payment experience, adjusted for known factors that are expected to change the timing of future payments.\nWe accrue an allowance for credit losses against our accounts receivable based on management’s current estimate of amounts that will not be\ncollected. Management’s estimates are typically based on historical loss information adjusted for current conditions. We generally do not perform\nevaluations of customers’ financial condition and generally do not require collateral. Historically, our credit losses have not been significant given\nour application of the constraint to variable consideration. The allowance for credit losses was zero as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023. Adjustments for implicit price concessions attributable to variable consideration, as discussed below, are incorporated into the\nmeasurement of the accounts receivable balances and are not part of the allowance for credit losses.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line\nmethod over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally between five and ten years. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the\nstraight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the term of the lease. Our leasehold improvements primarily\nrelate to our office and laboratory facilities in Friendswood, Texas, Phoenix, Arizona and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and are generally being\ndepreciated through the end of the lease terms in 2025 and 2033, respectively. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred,\nand material improvements are capitalized. Interest costs incurred during the construction of major capital projects are capitalized until the\nunderlying asset is ready for its intended use, at which\n9\nTable of Contents\nCASTLE BIOSCIENCES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(UNAUDITED)\npoint the capitalized interest costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the underlying asset. When\nassets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheet and any\nresulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations in the period realized.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business\ncombination. In accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other, our goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on\nan annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may be impaired. We perform annual impairment reviews of our\ngoodwill balance during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. We may perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is necessary to perform\na quantitative impairment test. If we determine that a quantitative impairment test is necessary, we apply the guidance in Accounting Standards\nUpdate (“ASU”) No. 2017-04, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, by comparing the fair\nvalue of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including the goodwill. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, we recognize an impairment\nloss for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value, up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. We did not\nincur any goodwill impairment losses in any of the periods presented.\nFactors that could result in a future impairment of goodwill include declines in the price of our common stock, increased competition, changes in\nmacroeconomic developments, unfavorable government or regulatory developments and changes in coverage or reimbursement conditions.\nAccrued Compensation\nWe accrue for liabilities under discretionary employee and executive bonus plans. Our estimated compensation liabilities are based on progress\nagainst corporate objectives approved by our board of directors, compensation levels of eligible individuals and target bonus percentage levels.\nOur board of directors reviews and evaluates the performance against these objectives and ultimately determines the actual achievement levels\nattained. We also accrue for liabilities under employee sales incentive bonus plans with accruals based on performance achieved to date\ncompared to established targets. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we accrued approximately $17.9 million and $21.7 million,\nrespectively, for liabilities associated with these bonus plans. These amounts are classified as current or noncurrent accrued liabilities in the\nunaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets based on the expected timing of payment.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense for equity instruments issued to employees is measured based on the grant-date fair value of the awards.\nThe fair value of employee stock options and offerings under the 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) are estimated on the date of\ngrant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing valuation model. For restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance-based restricted stock units\n(“PSUs”), the fair value is equal to the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. For awards with graded vesting and only service\nconditions, we recognize compensation costs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards. For options and RSUs, the\nrequisite service period is generally the award’s vesting period (typically four years). PSUs vest upon the achievement of certain performance\nconditions and the provision of service with us through a specified period. Accruals of compensation cost for PSUs are based on the probable\noutcome of the performance conditions and are reassessed each reporting period. We recognize compensation cost for PSUs separately for\neach vesting tranche on a ratable basis over the requisite service period. The requisite service period for PSUs is based on an analysis of\nvesting requirements and performance conditions for the particular award. Certain employees are entitled to acceleration of vesting of a portion\nof their awards upon retirement, subject to age, service and notice requirements. In these cases, the requisite service period takes into\nconsideration the employee’s retirement eligibility, and is reassessed at each reporting date. For the ESPP, the requisite service period is\ngenerally the period of time from the offering date to the purchase date. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) is defined as a change in equity during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-\nowner sources. Comprehensive income (loss) is made up of net income (loss) plus net\n10\nTable of Contents\nCASTLE BIOSCIENCES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(UNAUDITED)\nunrealized gain (loss) on marketable investment securities, which is our only other item of other comprehensive income (loss).\nAccounting Pronouncements Yet to be Adopted\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740)—Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”),\nwhich is intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 provide for\nenhanced income tax information primarily through changes to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. ASU 2023-09 is\neffective for the Company prospectively to all annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently\nevaluating the impact this update will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280)—Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosure,\nwhich require public companies disclose significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis and to provide\nin interim periods all disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. The guidance is\neffective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December\n15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance is applied retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements, unless it is\nimpracticable. We are currently evaluating the impact this update will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nWe have evaluated all other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and do not believe that these accounting\npronouncements will have any material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures upon adoption.\n3. Revenue\nAll of our revenues from contracts with customers are associated with the provision of testing services. Our revenues are primarily attributable to\nour DecisionDx®-Melanoma test for cutaneous melanoma. We also provide a test for patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma,\nDecisionDx®-SCC, a test for use in patients with suspicious pigmented lesions, MyPath® Melanoma, a test for uveal melanoma, DecisionDx®-\nUM, a test for patients diagnosed with Barrett’s esophagus, the TissueCypher® Barrett’s Esophagus Test and a pharmacogenomics testing\nservice focused on mental health, IDgenetix®. We previously offered a second test for patients with suspicious pigmented lesions, DiffDx®-\nMelanoma, which we suspended in February 2023. Information on the disaggregation of revenues is included below.\nOnce we satisfy our performance obligations and bill for the service, the timing of the collection of payments may vary based on the payment\npractices of the third-party payor and the existence of contractually established reimbursement rates. The payments for our services are\nprimarily made by third-party payors, including Medicare and commercial health insurance carriers. Certain contracts contain a contractual\ncommitment of a reimbursement rate that differs from our list prices. However, absent a positive coverage policy, with or without a contractually\ncommitted reimbursement rate, with a commercial carrier or governmental program, our diagnostic tests may or may not be paid by these\nentities. In addition, patients do not enter into direct agreements with us that commit them to pay any portion of the cost of the tests in the event\nthat their insurance provider declines to reimburse us. We may pursue, on a case-by-case basis, reimbursement from such patients in the form\nof co-payments and co-insurance, in accordance with the contractual obligations that we have with the insurance carrier or health plan. These\nsituations may result in a delay in the collection of payments.\nThe Medicare claims that are covered by Medicare are generally paid at a rate established on Medicare’s Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule or by\nthe respective Medicare contractor within 30 days from receipt. Medicare claims that were either submitted to Medicare prior to the local\ncoverage determination or other coverage commencement date or are not covered but meet the definition of being medically reasonable and\nnecessary pursuant to the controlling Section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act are generally appealed and may ultimately be paid at the\nfirst (termed ‘‘redetermination’’), second (termed ‘‘reconsideration’’) or third level of appeal (de novo hearing with an Administrative Law Judge). A\nsuccessful appeal at any of these levels may result in prompt payment.\nIn the absence of Medicare coverage, contractually established reimbursements rates or other coverage, we have concluded that our contracts\ninclude variable consideration because the amounts paid by Medicare or commercial health insurance carriers may be paid at less than our\nstandard rates or not paid at all, with such differences considered implicit price concessions. Variable consideration attributable to these price\nconcessions is measured at\n11\nTable of Contents\nCASTLE BIOSCIENCES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(UNAUDITED)\nthe expected value using the ‘‘most likely amount’’ method under ASC 606. The amounts are estimated using historical average collection rates\nby test type and payor category taking into consideration the range of possible outcomes, the predictive value of our past experiences, the time\nperiod of when uncertainties expect to be resolved and the amount of consideration that is susceptible to factors outside of our influence, such\nas the judgment and actions of third parties. Such variable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent it is probable that a\nsignificant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainties with respect to the amount are\nresolved. Variable consideration may be constrained and excluded from the transaction price in situations where there is no contractually agreed\nupon reimbursement coverage or in the absence of a predictable pattern and history of collectability with a payor. Accordingly, in such situations\nrevenues are recognized on the basis of actual cash collections. Variable consideration for Medicare claims that are not covered by Medicare,\nincluding those claims undergoing appeal, is deemed to be fully constrained due to factors outside our influence (e.g., judgment or actions of\nthird parties) and the uncertainty of the amount to be received is not expected to be resolved for a long period of time. Variable consideration is\nevaluated each reporting period and adjustments are recorded as increases or decreases in revenues. Included in revenues for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $0.6 million of net negative revenue adjustments and $0.9 million of net positive revenue\nadjustments, respectively, associated with changes in estimated variable consideration. Included in revenues for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023 were $1.3 million and $3.1 million of net negative revenue adjustments, respectively, associated with changes in\nestimated variable consideration. These amounts include (i) adjustments for actual collections versus estimated amounts and (ii) cash\ncollections and the related recognition of revenue in current period for tests delivered in prior periods due to the release of the constraint on\nvariable consideration.\nBecause our contracts with customers have an expected duration of one year or less, we have elected the practical expedient in ASC 606 to not\ndisclose information about our remaining performance obligations. Any incremental costs to obtain contracts are recorded as selling, general and\nadministrative expenses as incurred due to the short duration of our contracts. Contract balances consisted solely of accounts receivable (both\ncurrent and noncurrent) as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nDisaggregation of Revenues\nThe table below provides the disaggregation of revenue by type (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nDermatologic(1) $ 65,060 $ 51,151 $ 193,223 $ 130,097\nNon-Dermatologic(2) 20,722 10,342 52,535 23,571\nTotal net revenues $ 85,782 $ 61,493 $ 245,758 $ 153,668\n(1) Consists of DecisionDx-Melanoma, DecisionDx-SCC and our Diagnostic Gene Expression Profile offering (MyPath Melanoma and DiffDx-Melanoma).\n(2) Consists of TissueCypher Barrett’s Esophagus Test, DecisionDx-UM and IDgenetix.\n12\nTable of Contents\nCASTLE BIOSCIENCES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(UNAUDITED)\nPayor Concentration\nWe rely upon reimbursements from third-party government payors (primarily Medicare) and private-payor insurance companies to collect\naccounts receivable related to sales of our tests.\nOur significant third-party payors and their related revenues as a percentage of total revenues and accounts receivable balances are as follows:\nPercentage of Revenues\nPercentage of Percentage of\nNine Months Ended Accounts Receivable Accounts Receivable\nSeptember 30, (current) as of (noncurrent) as of\n2024 2023 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nMedicare 47 % 49 % 21 % 20 % * *\nPayor A 15 % 14 % 18 % 19 % 16 % 15 %\nPayor B * * 14 % 10 % 11 % 11 %\n* Less than 10%\nThere were no other third-party payors that individually accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue or accounts receivable for the periods\nshown in the table above.\n4. Earnings (Loss) Per Share\nBasic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) for the period by the weighted-average number of common shares\noutstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share reflects the additional dilution from potential issuances of common stock, such\nas stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options, vesting of RSUs and PSUs or purchases under the ESPP. The treasury stock\nmethod is used to calculate the potential dilutive effect of these common stock equivalents. Contingently issuable PSU awards are included in\nthe computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share when the applicable performance criteria would be met and the common shares would be\nissuable if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period. However, potentially dilutive shares are excluded from the\ncomputation of diluted loss per share when their effect is antidilutive.\n13\nTable of Contents\nCASTLE BIOSCIENCES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(UNAUDITED)\nThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share for the following three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands, except per share data):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator:\nNet income (loss) $ 2,269 $ (6,905) $ 8,655 $ (54,886)\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding, basic 27,840 26,834 27,659 26,725\nAssumed exercise of stock options 457 — 447 —\nAssumed vesting of RSUs 1,041 — 663 —\nAssumed vesting of PSUs 42 — 55 —\nAssumed issuance of shares under the ESPP 21 — 14 —\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding, diluted 29,401 26,834 28,838 26,725\nEarnings (loss) per share:\nBasic $ 0.08 $ (0.26) $ 0.31 $ (2.05)\nDiluted $ 0.08 $ (0.26) $ 0.30 $ (2.05)\nDue to the Company reporting a net loss attributable to common stockholders for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, all\npotentially dilutive securities are antidilutive and are excluded from the computations of diluted loss per share.\nThe table below provides the weighted-average number of potential common shares associated with outstanding securities not included in our\ncalculation of diluted earnings (loss) per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 because to do so would be\nantidilutive. With regard to the PSUs, we assume that the associated performance targets will be met at the target level of performance for\npurposes of calculating diluted net income per common share until such time that it is probable that actual performance will be above or below\ntarget (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nStock options 2,430 3,302 2,466 3,339\nRSUs and PSUs 474 3,422 553 3,403\nESPP 155 371 207 320\nTotal 3,059 7,095 3,226 7,062\nIn addition, in connection with our acquisition of AltheaDx, Inc. (“AltheaDx”) in April 2022, we may be required to issue shares of our common\nstock to satisfy the contingent consideration obligations, pending the outcome of certain commercial and regulatory milestones, as required by\nthe definitive agreement to acquire AltheaDx. For purposes of calculating diluted earnings (loss) per share, no such shares were assumed to\nhave been issued because none of the applicable conditions have been met to date. See Note 11 for additional information.\n14\nTable of Contents\nCASTLE BIOSCIENCES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(UNAUDITED)\n5. Marketable Investment Securities\nThe following tables present our available-for-sale debt securities (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024\nUnrealized\nEstimated Fair\nAmortized Cost Gains Losses Value\nU.S. government securities $ 184,353 $ 473 $ — $ 184,826\nTotal $ 184,353 $ 473 $ — $ 184,826\nDecember 31, 2023\nUnrealized\nEstimated Fair\nAmortized Cost Gains Losses Value\nU.S. government securities $ 144,122 $ 143 $ (7) $ 144,258\nTotal $ 144,122 $ 143 $ (7) $ 144,258\nAlthough available to be sold to meet operating needs or otherwise, securities are generally held through maturity. We classify all investments as\ncurrent assets, as these are readily available for use in current operations. The cost of securities sold is determined based on the specific\nidentification method for purposes of recording gains and losses.\nThere were no realized gains or losses on sales of investments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nWe evaluated our investment portfolio under the available-for-sale debt securities impairment model guidance and determined our investment\nportfolio is comprised of low-risk, investment grade securities. As of September 30, 2024, unrealized losses on our available-for-sale investments\nare not attributed to credit risk. We believe that an allowance for credit losses is unnecessary because the unrealized losses on certain of our\nmarketable investment securities are due to market factors. No credit-related or noncredit-related impairment losses were recorded for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The allowance for credit losses was zero as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023.\nAs of September 30, 2024, all of our available-for-sale debt securities had contractual maturities of one year or less. Accrued interest receivable\nis included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023, the accrued interest receivable balance was immaterial.\nAdditional information relating to the fair value of marketable investment securities can be found in Note 11.\n6.

The 2024 LSA provides for (i) on the Closing Date, $10.0 million aggregate principal amount of term loans (discussed in the ‘‘2024\nTerm Loan’’ section below), and (ii) from the Closing Date until March 31, 2025, an additional line of credit of $25.0 million with the same interest\nrate and maturity as the term debt available (discussed in the ‘‘2024 Credit Line’’ section below) at our option.\nThe obligations under the 2024 LSA are secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding intellectual property, the real property held by us,\nand are subject to certain other exceptions and limitations. We have the right to prepay the 2024 LSA in whole, subject to a prepayment fee of\napproximately 1.50% if prepaid prior to March 26, 2026. Amounts repaid under the 2024 LSA may not be reborrowed.\nIn addition, the 2024 LSA contains customary conditions of borrowing, events of default and covenants, including covenants that restrict our\nability to dispose of assets, merge with or acquire other entities, incur indebtedness and make distributions to holders of our capital stock.\nShould an event of default occur, including the occurrence of a\n17\nTable of Contents\nCASTLE BIOSCIENCES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(UNAUDITED)\nmaterial adverse change, we could be liable for immediate repayment of all obligations under the 2024 LSA. Should we seek to amend the terms\nof the 2024 LSA, the consent of the Lender would be required. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of the covenants.\nThe 2024 LSA bears interest at a floating rate equal to the greater of (a) the WSJ Prime Rate plus 0.25% or (b) 6.00% per annum. The Term\nLoans are interest only from the Closing Date through November 30, 2025, which may be extended at our option through November 30, 2026 as\nlong as no event of default under the 2024 LSA has occurred. After the end of the interest only period, we are required to pay equal monthly\ninstallments of principal through the maturity date of November 1, 2028.\nWe are also obligated to make an additional final payment of 2.00% of the aggregate original principal amounts of Term Loans advanced by the\nLender, due at the earlier of the maturity date or date the Term Loans are repaid in full.\n2024 Term Loan\nOn March 26, 2024, we drew $10.0 million in Term Loans under the terms and provisions of the 2024 LSA. We are obligated to make a final\npayment of $0.2 million under the terms of the 2024 LSA final payment provisions. A discount on debt equal to this obligation was recorded on\nthe draw date and is being amortized as additional interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the debt. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, no payment on principal has been made. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average effective interest rate for all\noutstanding debt under the 2024 Term Loan was 8.60%.\n2024 Credit Line\nWe have a $25.0 million line of credit under the terms and provisions of the 2024 LSA available from the Closing Date until March 31, 2025.\nAmounts repaid under the 2024 Credit Line may not be reborrowed. As of September 30, 2024, no draws had been made on the line of credit.\nInterest Expense on Long-Term Debt\nThe table below shows the components of interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 (in thousands):\nThree Months\nEnded September Nine Months Ended\n30, 2024 September 30, 2024\nInterest expense on long term debt $ 229 $ 470\nLess: Capitalized interest (37) (49)\nTotal $ 192 $ 421\nThere was no interest expense on long term debt or capitalized interest for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n10. Leases\nLease Amendment\nOn August 1, 2024 (“the Modification Date”) we amended our lease agreement for our Pittsburgh facilities to take early possession of additional\nsquare footage under an expansion provision in the original contract at an earlier date than provided for under the original agreement. The\nexpansion option provided us with 23,821 additional square feet, most of which will be dedicated laboratory space, in exchange for an\nincremental increase in our fixed monthly payments. The amendment did not change the end date under the original lease term, or provide any\nadditional options not already provided for under the original agreement. We evaluated the amendment under ASC Topic 842, Leases, and\ndetermined that it constituted a modification to an existing contract and assessed the classification remained an operating lease. Following the\nmodification, our obligations for the remaining lease term increased and we used $1.3 million of lease incentives for leasehold improvements. As\nof September 30, 2024, we had no remaining credits for leasehold improvements under this contract. In our remeasurement, we recognized an\nadditional $0.6 million in operating lease assets in exchange for an equal amount of additional lease liabilities.\n18\nTable of Contents\nCASTLE BIOSCIENCES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(UNAUDITED)\nDiscount Rate\nWe remeasured our lease obligations using our incremental borrowing rate as of the Modification Date. The incremental borrowing rate is the\nrate of interest we would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar\neconomic environment. As of the Modification Date, we had outstanding borrowings under the “2024 LSA” and referred to the interest rate of\nsuch debt for use as our incremental borrowing rate.\n11. Fair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most\nadvantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the\ninputs to valuation techniques used in measuring fair value. There are three levels to the fair value hierarchy based on the reliability of inputs, as\nfollows:\nLevel 1 – Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 3 – Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring us to develop our own assumptions.\nFinancial instruments measured at fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires management to\nmake judgments and consider factors specific to the asset or liability. The use of different assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may\nhave a material effect on estimated fair values. Accordingly, the fair value estimates disclosed, or amounts recorded, may not be indicative of the\namount that we or holders of the instruments could realize in a current market exchange.\nThe tables below provide information, by level within the fair value hierarchy, of our financial assets and liabilities that are accounted for at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nAs of September 30, 2024\nQuoted Prices in Significant\nActive Markets for Significant Other Unobservable\nIdentical Items Observable Inputs Inputs\n(Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total\nAssets\nMoney market funds(1) $ 89,571 $ — $ — $ 89,571\nU.S. government securities(2) $ 184,826 $ — $ — $ 184,826\nLiabilities\nContingent consideration(3) $ — $ — $ — $ —\n19\nTable of Contents\nCASTLE BIOSCIENCES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(UNAUDITED)\nAs of December 31, 2023\nQuoted Prices in Significant\nActive Markets for Significant Other Unobservable\nIdentical Items Observable Inputs Inputs\n(Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total\nAssets\nMoney market funds(1) $ 89,308 $ — $ — $ 89,308\nU.S. government securities(2) $ 144,258 $ — $ — $ 144,258\nLiabilities\nContingent consideration(3) $ — $ — $ — $ —\n(1) Classified as “Cash and cash equivalents” in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n(2) Classified as “Marketable investment securities” in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n(3) Current portion, if any, classified as “Other accrued and current liabilities” in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nContingent Consideration\nIn connection with our acquisition of AltheaDx, we agreed to pay contingent consideration of up to $75.0 million of commercial milestone\npayments based on the achievement of certain net revenue targets relating to the years ending December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024 (“AltheaDx\nEarnout Payments”). The portion of the AltheaDx Earnout Payments associated with the commercial milestones for the year ended December\n31, 2023 was $37.5 million and was not paid since the applicable commercial milestones were not met. The AltheaDx Earnout Payments\nincluded a 2022 catch-up provision for additional payment of up to $17.5 million that expired in 2023. Therefore, as of September 30, 2024, we\nhave a potential payment obligation of up to $20.0 million with respect to the remaining commercial milestones for 2024. If the settlement of the\nremaining portion of the AltheaDx Earnout Payments would have occurred on September 30, 2024, no amounts would have been due because\nno commercial milestones had been achieved as of such date.\nThe contingent consideration was classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement due to the use of significant unobservable inputs and a Monte\nCarlo simulation to determine its fair value. The Monte Carlo simulation uses projections of the commercial milestones for the applicable period\nas well as the corresponding targets and approximate timing of payment based on the terms of the arrangement. The valuation of the AltheaDx\ncontingent consideration was zero as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and no gains or losses were recorded associated with\nchanges in fair value during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThe contingent consideration liability is remeasured at fair value at each reporting period taking into account any updated assumptions or\nchanges in circumstances. Any changes in the fair value are recorded as gains or losses in our unaudited condensed consolidated statement of\noperations.\n12. Commitments and Contingencies\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We believe there is no threatened\nlitigation or litigation pending that could have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of\noperations or cash flows. On February 1, 2024, we received a Subpoena from the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of\nInspector General, seeking documents and information concerning claims submitted for payment under federal healthcare programs. The\nSubpoena requested that we produce documents relating primarily to interactions with medical providers and billing to government-funded\nhealthcare programs for our tests. The time period covered by the Subpoena is January 1, 2015 through February 1, 2024. We are continuing to\ncooperate with the government’s request and are in the process of responding to the Subpoena. We are unable to predict what action, if any,\nmight be taken in the future by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, or any other governmental authority\nas a result of the matters related to this Subpoena. No claims have been made against us at this time. Any potential claims could subject us to\nsignificant liability for damages and harm our reputation. Our insurance and indemnities may not cover all claims that may be asserted against\nus. We are unable to predict the outcome and are unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss, if any, that could result\nfrom any unfavorable outcome.\n20\nTable of Contents\nCASTLE BIOSCIENCES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(UNAUDITED)\n13.

We considered the\nadoption of the Retirement Policy to be a modification of existing awards under ASC Topic 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation. The\nmodification did not result in any incremental compensation cost. However, the adoption of the policy resulted in a new estimate of the requisite\nservice period for certain awards, which we reassess at each balance sheet date. In connection with the Retirement Policy, we accelerated the\nrecognition of compensation expense of $0.4 million and $0.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, and accelerated the recognition of compensation expense of $0.8 million and $1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023, respectively.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe ESPP provides for certain automatic increases in the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance, which resulted in an\nadditional 274,105 shares becoming available under the ESPP effective January 1, 2024.

We also offer a proprietary pharmacogenomics (“PGx”) test to guide optimal drug treatment for\npatients diagnosed with depression, anxiety and other mental health conditions.\nCurrently, our revenue is primarily generated by our DecisionDx-Melanoma risk stratification test for cutaneous melanoma (“CM”), which is\nsupplemented by revenue generated from our DecisionDx-SCC risk stratification test for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (“SCC”), our\nTissueCypher risk stratification test for BE and our DecisionDx-UM risk stratification test for UM.\nAll five of our MAAA tests have been granted Advanced Diagnostic Laboratory Test (“ADLT”) status by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid\nServices (“CMS”) which means each test has demonstrated that (i) when combined with an empirically derived algorithm, it yields a result that\npredicts the probability a specific individual patient will develop a certain condition or conditions, or will respond to a particular therapy or\ntherapies; and (ii) it provides new clinical diagnostic information that cannot be obtained from any other test or combination of tests. We believe\nthis designation not only demonstrates our focus on developing and validating innovative tests but also enables our Medicare reimbursement\nrate to be set, over the long term, by the median private payor rate, which we believe provides a fair exchange of value. Further information\nabout Medicare coverage and ADLT status with respect to each of our tests is set forth below.\nTest Overview\nOur Dermatologic Tests\nDecisionDx-Melanoma is our proprietary risk stratification gene expression profile (“GEP”) test that is designed to predict the risk of metastasis\nor recurrence for patients diagnosed with invasive CM. In a typical year, we estimate approximately 130,000 patients are diagnosed with invasive\nCM in the United States, representing an estimated\n25\nTable of Contents\nU.S. total addressable market (“TAM”) of approximately $540 million. We estimate that approximately 50% of patients diagnosed with CM are 65\nyears of age or older.\nDecisionDx‑SCC is our proprietary GEP test for use in patients with SCC, with one or more risk factors (also referred to as “high-risk” SCC). We\nestimate that 20% of SCC patients, or 200,000 annually in the United States, are classified as high risk, representing an estimated U.S. TAM of\napproximately $820 million.\nMyPath Melanoma is our proprietary GEP test for use in patients with a melanocytic lesion and uncertainty related to the malignancy of the\nlesion. We estimate approximately 300,000 patients each year present with a diagnostically ambiguous lesion, representing an estimated U.S.\nTAM of approximately $600 million. We began offering MyPath Melanoma following our acquisition of the Myriad MyPath Laboratory in May 2021\nat which point we offered both our MyPath Melanoma test and our DiffDx-Melanoma test under an offering that we referred to as our Diagnostic\nGEP offering. However, following an internal assessment of the clinical value of offering both tests, we made the decision to suspend the clinical\noffering of DiffDx-Melanoma in February 2023 and now the focus of this offering is MyPath Melanoma.\nOur Gastroenterology Test\nTissueCypher is our proprietary risk stratification spatial omics test designed to predict future development of high-grade dysplasia and/or\nesophageal cancer in patients with non-dysplastic, indefinite dysplasia or low-grade dysplasia BE. We estimate a U.S. TAM of approximately $1\nbillion.\nOur Uveal Melanoma Test\nDecisionDx-UM is a proprietary, risk stratification GEP test that is designed to predict the risk of metastasis for patients with UM. We believe\nDecisionDx-UM is the standard of care in the management of newly diagnosed UM in the majority of ocular oncology practices in the United\nStates. We estimate a U.S. TAM of approximately $10 million.\nOur Mental Health Test\nIDgenetix is a PGx test that guides personalized mental health medication selection and management for patients with depression, anxiety and\nother mental health conditions. We estimate a U.S. TAM of approximately $5 billion.\nCommercial Expansion Efforts\nIn September 2022, we established a new commercial sales team dedicated to our Diagnostic GEP offering and added additional outside\nterritories for our TissueCypher test, which were fully integrated into our commercial operations by the end of the second quarter of 2023.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we continued to expand our dermatologic and gastrointestinal commercial sales forces through\nterritory and headcount expansions with focus being on our DecisionDx-Melanoma, DecisionDx-SCC, and TissueCypher tests.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we further expanded our sales and marketing team for our TissueCypher test. We will\ncontinue to assess market response in determining further commercial expansions and commercial team structure.\nReimbursement\nThe primary source of revenue for our products is reimbursement from third-party payors, which includes government payors, such as Medicare,\nand commercial payors, such as insurance companies. Achieving broad coverage and reimbursement of our current products by third-party\npayors and continued Medicare coverage are key components of our financial success.\nWe bill third-party payors and patients for the tests we perform. We have received Medicare coverage for our DecisionDx-Melanoma,\nDecisionDx-SCC, MyPath Melanoma, DecisionDx-UM, TissueCypher and IDgenetix tests which meet certain criteria for Medicare and Medicare\nAdvantage beneficiaries.\nThe Medicare rates discussed below are prior to giving effect to applicable sequestration in effect from time to time as described in further detail\nunder “Government Regulation and Product Approval—Healthcare Reform” included in Item 1, Business, of the 2023 10-K.\n26\nTable of Contents\nDecisionDx-Melanoma\nDecisionDx-Melanoma tests are processed from our Phoenix laboratory and since the second quarter of 2022, have been covered under\n“foundational” local coverage determinations (“LCD”) finalized by Medicare Administrative Contractors (“MACs”) Palmetto GBA MolDX\n(“Palmetto”) and Noridian Health Solutions (“Noridian”).\nDecisionDx-Melanoma has met ADLT status, as determined by the CMS, since 2019. Since 2022, the rate for DecisionDx-Melanoma is set\nannually based upon the median private payor rate for the first half of the second preceding calendar year. For example, the rate for 2023 was\nset using median private payor rate data from January 1, 2021 to June 30, 2021. Our rate for 2023 was $7,193 per test and is $7,193 for 2024.\nDecisionDx-UM\nDecisionDx-UM tests are processed from our Phoenix laboratory and are covered under LCDs finalized by MAC administrators Palmetto and\nNoridian in July 2017.\nDecisionDx-UM has met the criteria of “existing advanced diagnostic laboratory test” status, also referred to as “existing ADLT” status, as\ndetermined by the CMS, since May 2019. Our rate is set annually based upon the median private payor rate for the first half of the second\npreceding calendar year. For example, the rate for 2023 was set using median private payor rate data from January 1, 2021 to June 30, 2021.\nOur rate for 2023 was $7,776 per test and is $7,776 for 2024.\nMyPath Melanoma and DiffDx-Melanoma\nMyPath Melanoma was covered under a test-specific LCD policy through Noridian that became effective in June 2019. Effective August 6, 2023,\nPalmetto and Noridian issued LCDs that converted the test-specific MyPath Melanoma LCD to a “foundational” LCD and provided coverage for\nboth MyPath Melanoma and DiffDx-Melanoma.\nMyPath Melanoma was approved as a “new ADLT” in September 2019. The rate for our MyPath Melanoma test is set annually based upon the\nmedian private payor rate for the first half of the second preceding calendar year. Our 2023 rate was set at $1,755 per test, based on data\nsubmitted by the predecessor owner of the Myriad MyPath Laboratory relating to the first half of 2021. Our 2024 rate is set at $1,950 per test.\nIn the second quarter of 2022, we obtained a Proprietary Laboratory Analyses (“PLA”) code for DiffDx-Melanoma. In 2023, DiffDx-Melanoma\nwent through the CMS gapfill process which concluded in September 2023 with CMS posting a final MAC-specific gapfill rate of $1,950 per test.\nOur rate for 2024 is $1,950 per test.\nDiagnostic GEP Offering\nOur Diagnostic GEP offering included MyPath Melanoma and DiffDx-Melanoma. We began offering MyPath Melanoma following our acquisition\nof the Myriad MyPath Laboratory on May 28, 2021. Our internal data indicates that we have improved the technical performance of MyPath\nMelanoma and that it is comparable to the technical performance of DiffDx-Melanoma. As such, following an internal assessment of the clinical\nvalue of offering both tests, we made the decision to suspend the clinical offering of DiffDx-Melanoma in February 2023.\nDecisionDx‑SCC\nWe issue our DecisionDx-SCC tests from our Pittsburgh and Phoenix labs, with a majority of tests being issued from our Pittsburgh lab.\nOn June 2, 2023, Novitas Solutions (“Novitas”), the MAC responsible for administering claims for test reports issued by our Pittsburgh laboratory,\nposted a finalized oncology biomarker LCD pursuant to which the DecisionDx-SCC test would no longer be covered by Medicare effective July\n17, 2023. However, on July 6, 2023, Novitas suspended the final version of the LCD and announced its intent to post a new proposed LCD for\ncomment and presentation at an open meeting. On July 27, 2023, Novitas posted a nearly identical proposed oncology biomarker LCD that\ncontinues to intend to rely upon evidentiary reviews sourced from three databases: ClinGen, OncoKB and NCCN. The proposed LCD also\nrecommends non-coverage for our DecisionDx-SCC test. The comment period for the proposed LCD ended on September 9, 2023. On July 26,\n2024, Novitas posted a note that it had been granted an extension by CMS. We cannot predict whether this LCD will be finalized as proposed or\nwhat the timing of any final LCD might be.\nPalmetto’s MolDX program oversees MAAA tests that are reported from our Phoenix laboratory and Noridian is the MAC responsible for\nadministering claims for test reports issued by our Phoenix laboratory. On June 8, 2023, both Palmetto and Noridian posted a preliminary draft\nLCD recommending no coverage for DecisionDx-SCC. The comment period for the draft LCDs ended on July 22, 2023. On July 4, 2024, the\nLCD was finalized as proposed with a future effective date of August 18, 2024.\n27\nTable of Contents\nDecisionDx-SCC was reimbursed at a rate of $3,873 per test under a PLA code from second quarter of 2022 through June 30, 2023 when CMS\ndetermined DecisionDx-SCC meets the criteria for “new ADLT” status. Effective July 1, 2023 and through March 31, 2024, CMS set the initial\nperiod rate equal to the list price of $8,500 per test. Effective April 1, 2024 and through December 31, 2025, the published CLFS rate for\nDecisionDx-SCC will be based on the median private payor rates received between July 1, 2023 and November 30, 2023. We submitted the\nmedian private payor data to CMS during the data reporting period in December 2023. Effective April 1, 2024, the updated CLFS rate will\ncontinue at $8,500 through December 31, 2025. Future rates will be set annually based upon the median private payor rate for the first half of\nthe second preceding calendar year. ADLT status determines the process by which the rate is set and is not an indication of Medicare coverage.\nTissueCypher\nTissueCypher is processed in our Pittsburgh laboratory and falls under the Medicare jurisdiction managed by Novitas.\nOn March 24, 2022, CMS determined that TissueCypher meets the criteria for “new ADLT” status. ADLT status exempts TissueCypher from what\nis called the “14-day rule,” which simplifies the billing process for Medicare patients. Effective January 1, 2023, the published CLFS rate for\nTissueCypher was set at $4,950 per test, which will remain effective through December 31, 2024. This rate is based on the median private payor\nrates received between April 1, 2022 and August 31, 2022. Thereafter, the rate will be set annually based upon the median private payor rate for\nthe first half of the second preceding calendar year.\nIDgenetix\nIDgenetix is currently covered under a Noridian LCD policy and accompanying billing and coding article developed by MolDX.\nOur IDgenetix multi-gene panel was reimbursed by Medicare at approximately $1,500 per test from April 2022 through February 2023, when\nMolDX notified us that as part of its annual CPT code updates, IDgenetix should shift billing to a different generic gene sequencing CPT code\n(the “New CPT Code”) and continue using the IDgenetix Z-Code beginning in March 2023. The New CPT Code was set at $917 per test while\nthe test went through CMS’s Gapfill pricing process. We believed the new CPT Code, in conjunction with the IDgenetix Z-Code, did not describe\nall of the components of the IDgenetix test and thus, was not appropriate for IDgenetix. We subsequently obtained a test-specific PLA CPT code\nwhich became effective October 1, 2023. In November 2023, CMS posted its final CLFS determination which crosswalks our PLA CPT code to\nan existing PLA code at a rate of $1,336 per test effective January 1, 2024.\nGovernment Regulation and Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests\nOn April 29, 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) published a final rule on the regulation of Laboratory Developed Tests (“LDTs”)\nwhich amends the FDA's regulations to make explicit that LDT's are devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”). The\nFDA issued a policy to phase out, over the course of four years, its general enforcement discretion approach to LDTs and also issued targeted\nenforcement discretion policies for certain categories of LDTs. The FDA is continuing enforcement discretion for currently marketed tests offered\nas LDTs (that were first marketed before May 6, 2024) that are approved by the New York State Department of Health Clinical Laboratory\nEvaluation Program (“NYS CLEP”). Our proprietary tests, outlined above, are all NYS CLEP approved. We believe this final ruling will have no\nmaterial impact on our existing test offerings given all of our tests were marketed before May 6, 2024.\nDelivered Test Reports\nThe number of test reports we deliver is a key indicator that we use to assess our business. A test report is generated when we receive a sample\nin our laboratory, and then the relevant test information is entered into our Laboratory Information Management System, the laboratory portion of\nthe test is performed, including proprietary algorithmic analysis of the combined biomarkers, and a report is then generated which is delivered to\nthe clinician who ordered the test.\n28\nTable of Contents\nThe number of test reports delivered by us during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and for the year ended December 31,\n2023 are presented in the table below:\nProprietary Dermatologic GEP Tests\nDecisionDx- Diagnostic GEP Dermatologic\nMelanoma DecisionDx-SCC offering (1) Total DecisionDx-UM TissueCypher(2) IDgenetix Grand Total\nQ1 2024 8,384 3,577 998 12,959 422 3,429 4,078 20,888\nQ2 2024 9,585 4,277 1,099 14,961 456 4,782 4,903 25,102\nQ3 2024 9,367 4,195 933 14,495 397 6,073 5,045 26,010\nFor the nine months\nended September\n30, 2024 27,336 12,049 3,030 42,415 1,275 14,284 14,026 72,000\nQ1 2023 7,583 2,411 980 10,974 409 1,383 2,150 14,916\nQ2 2023 8,597 2,681 953 12,231 461 1,447 2,681 16,820\nQ3 2023 8,559 2,820 1,011 12,390 399 2,829 2,791 18,409\nFor the nine months\nended September\n30, 2023 24,739 7,912 2,944 35,595 1,269 5,659 7,622 50,145\nQ4 2023 8,591 3,530 1,018 13,139 405 3,441 3,299 20,284\nFor year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 33,330 11,442 3,962 48,734 1,674 9,100 10,921 70,429\n(1) Includes MyPath Melanoma and DiffDx-Melanoma. We offered both MyPath Melanoma and DiffDx-Melanoma under our Diagnostic GEP offering until February 2023 when we\nsuspended the offering of DiffDx-Melanoma, as discussed above.\n(2) We temporarily paused accepting additional orders in July 2023, resumed accepting new orders in a phased approach in September 2023, and completed processing of our\npre-existing backlog orders in October 2023. We have continued accepting new orders since September 2023.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our test report volume increased by 41.3% and 43.6%, respectively, compared to the\nsame period in 2023. Our dermatologic test report volume increased by 17% and 19.2% for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024, respectively, compared to the prior period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have experienced higher test\nreport volumes for all of our tests compared to the prior period in 2023. For a discussion of how we recognize revenue derived from our tests,\nrefer to — “Components of Results of Operations—Net Revenues” below.\nIn August 2024, we amended our Pittsburgh commercial real estate lease to add 23,821 square feet to our existing facilities, most of which will\nbe used as dedicated lab space for processing our TissueCypher test. As of September 30, 2024, substantially all leasehold improvements for\nthis added space were complete and the added lab space was ready for use. We expect the additional space will allow us to continue\ndeveloping our business through our TissueCypher product line.\nFor our DecisionDx-SCC product line, we continue to see opportunities for leverage, where many of the clinicians ordering our DecisionDx-\nMelanoma are the same clinicians who order our DecisionDx-SCC test. During each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\napproximately 75% of all clinicians ordering DecisionDx-SCC had also ordered our DecisionDx-Melanoma test during that same period.\nInformation About Certain Metrics\nThe following provides additional information about certain metrics we have disclosed in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations.\nTest Reports Delivered\nTest reports delivered represent the number of completed test reports delivered by us during the reporting period indicated. The period in which\na test report is delivered does not necessarily correspond with the period in which the related revenue, if any, is recognized, due to the timing\nand amount of adjustments for variable consideration under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers (“ASC 606”). We\n29\nTable of Contents\nuse this metric to evaluate the growth in adoption of our tests and to measure against our internal performance objectives. We believe this metric\nis useful to investors in evaluating the volume of our business activity from period-to-period that may not be discernible from our reported\nrevenues under ASC 606.\nOther Events\nImpact of Macroeconomic Conditions\nMacroeconomic conditions, including uncertainties associated with the Israel-Hamas war, the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia, the\nU.S. presidential election, economic slowdowns, public health crises, labor shortages, recessions or market corrections, supply chain\ndisruptions, inflation and monetary policy shifts, liquidity concerns at, and failures of, banks and other financial institutions or other disruptions in\nthe banking system or financing markets, changes to interest rates and financial and credit market fluctuations, volatility in the capital markets\nand other evolving macroeconomic developments, continue to have direct and indirect impacts on our business and could in the future materially\nimpact our results of operations and financial condition. We continue to actively monitor the impact of these macroeconomic factors on our\nresults of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The extent of the impact of these factors on our operational performance and financial\ncondition, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected timeframe, will depend on future developments,\nwhich are uncertain and cannot be predicted; however, any continued or renewed disruption resulting from these factors could negatively impact\nour business.\nOur Financial Results\nOur net income may fluctuate significantly from period to period, depending on the timing of our planned development activities, the growth of\nour sales and marketing activities and the timing of revenue recognition under ASC 606. We expect our expenses will increase substantially over\ntime as we:\n• execute clinical studies to generate evidence supporting our current and future product candidates;\n• execute our commercialization strategy for our current and future commercial products;\n• continue our ongoing and planned development of new products in our pipeline;\n• seek to discover and develop additional product candidates;\n• hire additional scientific and research and development staff; and\n• add additional operational, financial and management information systems and personnel.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nWe believe there are several important factors that have impacted, and that we expect will continue to impact, our operating performance and\nresults of operations, including:\n• Report volume. We believe that the number of reports we deliver to clinicians is an important indicator of the growth of adoption among\nthe healthcare provider community. Our revenue and costs are affected by the volume of testing and mix of customers. Our performance\ndepends on our ability to retain and broaden adoption with existing prescribing clinicians, as well as attract new clinicians. Our report\nvolume could be negatively impacted by developments related to evolving macroeconomic developments, as discussed above.\n• Reimbursement. We believe that expanding reimbursement is an important indicator of the value of our products. Payors require\nextensive evidence of clinical utility, clinical validity, patient outcomes and health economic benefits in order to provide reimbursement for\ndiagnostic products. Our revenue depends on our ability to demonstrate the value of our products to these payors.\n• Gross margin. We believe that our gross margin is an important indicator of the operating performance of our business. Higher gross\nmargins reflect the average selling price of our tests, as well as the operating efficiency of our laboratory operations.\n• Expansion of our sales force and marketing programs. We believe the expansion of our direct sales force and marketing\norganization to educate clinicians and pathologists on the value of our molecular testing products will significantly impact our\nperformance.\n• Integrating acquisitions. Revenue growth, operational results and advances to our business strategy depends on our ability to\nintegrate any acquisitions into our existing business and effectively scale their operations. The integration of acquired assets may impact\nour revenue growth, increase the cost of\n30\nTable of Contents\noperations or may require management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our existing business.\n• New product development. A significant aspect of our business is our investment in research and development activities, including\nactivities related to the development of new products. In addition to the development of new product candidates, we believe these\nstudies are critical to gaining clinician adoption of new products and driving favorable coverage decisions by payors for such products.\nComponents of the Results of Operations\nNet Revenues\nWe generate revenues from the sale of our products. Currently, our revenues are primarily derived from the sale of DecisionDx-Melanoma,\nDecisionDx-SCC, TissueCypher and DecisionDx-UM. We bill third-party payors and patients for the tests we perform.\nUnder ASC 606, we recognize revenue at the amount we expect to be entitled, subject to a constraint for variable consideration, in the period in\nwhich our tests are delivered to the treating clinicians. We have determined that our contracts contain variable consideration under ASC 606\nbecause the amounts paid by third-party payors may be paid at less than our standard rates or not paid at all, with such differences considered\nimplicit price concessions. Variable consideration is recognized only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not\noccur in future periods when the uncertainties are resolved. Variable consideration is evaluated each reporting period and adjustments are\nrecorded as increases or decreases in revenues. Variable consideration for Medicare claims that are not covered by Medicare, including those\nclaims undergoing appeal, is deemed to be fully constrained due to factors outside our influence (e.g., judgment or actions of third parties) and\nthe uncertainty of the amount to be received is not expected to be resolved for a long period of time. For these fully constrained claims, we\ngenerally recognize revenue in the period the uncertainty is favorably resolved, if at all. Due to potential future changes in Medicare coverage\npolicies and appeal cycles, insurance coverage policies, contractual rates and other trends in the reimbursement of our tests, our revenues may\nfluctuate significantly from period to period. Our ability to recognize revenue for a test is dependent on the development of reimbursement\nexperience and obtaining coverage decisions. For tests with limited reimbursement experience or no coverage, we recognize revenues on the\nbasis of actual cash collections.\nOur ability to increase our revenues will depend on our ability to further penetrate our target markets, and, in particular, generate sales through\nour direct sales force, maintain Medicare coverage for our currently marketed products, develop and commercialize additional tests, including\nthrough acquisitions, obtain reimbursement from additional third-party payors and increase our reimbursement rate for tests performed.\nCost of Sales (exclusive of amortization of acquired intangible assets)\nThe components of our cost of sales are material and service costs associated with testing samples, personnel costs (including salaries,\nbonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation expense), electronic medical record set up costs, order and delivery systems, shipping\ncharges to transport samples, third-party test fees, and allocated overhead including rent, information technology costs, equipment and facilities\ndepreciation and utilities. Costs associated with testing samples are recorded when the test is processed regardless of whether and when\nrevenues are recognized with respect to that test. As a result, our cost of sales as a percentage of revenues may vary significantly from period to\nperiod because we do not recognize all revenues in the period in which the associated costs are incurred. We expect cost of sales in absolute\ndollars to increase as the number of tests we perform increases. Additionally, we expect cost of sales to increase with the expansion of\nlaboratory capacity and staffing in advance of the anticipated growth of our more recently launched tests and tests acquired through acquisitions.\nFor example, we commenced operations in a newly expanded laboratory facility in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the second quarter of 2023 and\nsubsequently amended the lease in August of 2024, adding 23,821 square feet to our existing facilities.\nGross margin and gross margin percentage are key indicators we use to assess our business. See the table in “—Results of Operations—\nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023” and “—Results of Operations—Comparison of the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023” for details.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses include costs incurred to develop our tests, collect clinical samples and conduct clinical studies to develop\nand support our products. These costs consist of personnel costs (including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation\nexpense), prototype materials, laboratory supplies, consulting costs, regulatory costs, electronic medical records set up costs, costs associated\nwith setting up and\n31\nTable of Contents\nconducting clinical studies and allocated overhead, including rent, information technology, equipment depreciation and utilities. We expense all\nresearch and development costs in the periods in which they are incurred. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in\nabsolute dollars as we continue to invest in research and development activities related to developing enhanced and new products.\nWe expect to use a portion of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable investment securities to further support and accelerate our\nresearch and development activities, including important studies that are underway to support our DecisionDx-Melanoma test. For instance, in\nFebruary 2023, we announced the publication of data from the DECIDE study presenting DecisionDx-Melanoma test results influenced 85% of\nclinicians’ decisions regarding the SLNB surgical procedure. Additionally, use of the tests’ results within current guideline recommendations led\nto a significant reduction in SLNB procedures performed, demonstrating the clinical value of the test to guide risk-aligned patient care. Also, in\n2021, we initiated our large prospective, multi-center clinical study to develop, validate and bring to market a pipeline genomic test, or tests,\naimed at predicting response to systemic therapy in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and related inflammatory skin\nconditions. Since December 31, 2023, we continue to maintain active clinical study test sites and a consistent number of patients enrolled in this\nstudy. Assuming we are successful in validating a genomic test, or tests, for one or more of these uses, then we expect to launch this pipeline\ntest by the end of 2025.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses include executive, selling and marketing, legal, finance and accounting, human resources\nand billing functions. These expenses consist of personnel costs (including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation expense),\ndirect marketing expenses, audit and legal expenses, consulting costs, payor outreach programs and allocated overhead, including rent,\ninformation technology, equipment depreciation, and utilities. Other administrative and professional services expenses within SG&A are\nexpected to increase with the scale of our business, but selling and marketing-related expenses are expected to increase significantly, consistent\nwith our growth strategy.\nAmortization of Acquired Intangible Assets\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets is primarily associated with developed technology obtained through acquisitions, such as our\nacquisitions of Cernostics in December 2021 and AltheaDx in April 2022.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists primarily of earnings on cash and cash equivalents, primarily money market funds, and marketable investment\nsecurities, primarily short-term U.S. government obligations.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense is primarily attributable to long-term debt and finance leases.\nIncome Tax Expense\nRevisions in our estimate of annual pre-tax income, relating to uncertainty in continued Medicare coverage for our DecisionDx-SCC test and\nupdated information, are sources of variability in our effective tax rates from period to period. As of December 31, 2023, we had federal net\noperating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of $197.1 million, of which $92.0 million will begin to expire in 2029 if not utilized to offset federal taxable\nincome, and $105.1 million may be carried forward indefinitely. As of December 31, 2023, we also had state NOL carryforwards of $114.3 million,\nwhich begin to expire in 2028 if not utilized to offset state taxable income.\n32\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentages):\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023 Change\n(unaudited)\nNet revenues $ 85,782 $ 61,493 $ 24,289 39.5 %\nOperating expenses\nCost of sales (exclusive of amortization of acquired intangible\nassets) 15,609 11,319 4,290 37.9 %\nResearch and development 12,323 12,923 (600) (4.6)%\nSelling, general and administrative 50,499 44,619 5,880 13.2 %\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets 2,272 2,272 — — %\nTotal operating expenses, net 80,703 71,133 9,570 13.5 %\nOperating income (loss) 5,079 (9,640) 14,719 152.7 %\nInterest income 3,404 2,769 635 22.9 %\nInterest expense (201) (2) (199) NM\nIncome (loss) before income taxes 8,282 (6,873) 15,155 220.5 %\nIncome tax expense 6,013 32 5,981 NM\nNet income (loss) $ 2,269 $ (6,905) $ 9,174 132.9 %\nNM = Not meaningful\nThe following table indicates the amount of stock-based compensation expense (non-cash) reflected in the line items above (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023 Change\n(unaudited)\nCost of sales (exclusive of amortization of acquired intangible assets) $ 1,464 $ 1,245 $ 219\nResearch and development 2,345 2,682 (337)\nSelling, general and administrative 9,218 9,116 102\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ 13,027 $ 13,043 $ (16)\nThe following table provides a disaggregation of net revenues by type (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023 Change\n(unaudited)\nDermatologic(1) $ 65,060 $ 51,151 $ 13,909\nNon-Dermatologic(2) 20,722 10,342 10,380\nTotal net revenues $ 85,782 $ 61,493 $ 24,289\n(1) Consists of DecisionDx-Melanoma, DecisionDx-SCC and our Diagnostic GEP offering.\n(2) Consists of TissueCypher, DecisionDx-UM and IDgenetix.\n33\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents the calculation of gross margin (in thousands, except percentages):\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023 Change\n(unaudited)\nNet revenues $ 85,782 $ 61,493 $ 24,289\nLess: Cost of sales (exclusive of amortization of acquired intangible assets) 15,609 11,319 4,290\nLess: Amortization of acquired intangible assets 2,272 2,272 —\nGross margin $ 67,901 $ 47,902 $ 19,999\nGross margin percentage 79.2 % 77.9 % 1.3 %\nNet Revenues\nNet revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by $24.3 million, or 39.5%, to $85.8 million compared to the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, due to a $13.9 million increase in revenue from our dermatologic tests and a $10.4 million increase in\nrevenue from our non-dermatologic tests.\nThe $13.9 million increase in net revenues for our Dermatologic tests was primarily attributable to our DecisionDx-SCC test, which was due to\nhigher test report volumes and a higher realized average selling price (“ASP”), as well our DecisionDx-Melanoma test which had higher test\nreport volumes though a slightly lower ASP. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September\n30, 2023, test report volumes for our DecisionDx-SCC and DecisionDx-Melanoma tests increased by 48.8% and 9.4%, respectively. Increases in\nrealized ASP for our DecisionDx-SCC test were primarily attributable to an increase in our Medicare reimbursement rate for this test, beginning\nin July 2023.\nThe $10.4 million increase in net revenues from our non-dermatologic tests was largely attributable to a 114.7% increase in test report volumes\nfor our TissueCypher test, and, to a lesser extent, to our IDgenetix test which also had higher test report volumes. Increases in our TissueCypher\ntest report volumes reflect growth through our sales force efforts as well as the impacts of a temporary pause in accepting new orders from July\n2023 through September 2023, during which time our lab operations team successfully implemented certain process improvements,\nautomations, and operational enhancements for this test to support future growth. Net revenue from our non-dermatologic tests as a percentage\nof total net revenue increased from 16.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 24.2% for the three months ended September 30,\n2024.\nCost of Sales (exclusive of amortization of acquired intangible assets)\nCost of sales (exclusive of amortization of acquired intangible assets) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by $4.3 million,\nor 37.9%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher personnel costs and higher expense for supplies\nand lab services. Increases in personnel costs reflect a higher headcount, due to additions made to support business growth in response to\ngrowing test report volumes, as well as merit and annual inflationary wage adjustment for existing employees. Higher expense for supplies and\nlab services also reflects higher test report volumes.\nDue to the nature of our business, a significant portion of our cost of sales expenses represents fixed costs associated with our testing\noperations. Accordingly, our cost of sales expense will not necessarily increase or decrease commensurately with the change in net revenues\nfrom period to period. We expect our cost of sales expenses (exclusive of amortization of acquired intangible assets) to continue to increase in\nfuture periods as we hire additional laboratory personnel and related resources to support expected operational growth and higher test volumes.\nGross Margin\nOur gross margin percentage was 79.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 77.9% for the same period in 2023. The\nincrease was primarily due to higher revenues which were attributable to increases in both test report volumes and average selling prices,\npartially offset by higher personnel costs, higher expense for supplies, and higher expense incurred through our expanded laboratory capacity\nand higher test report volumes.\n34\nTable of Contents\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses decreased by $0.6 million, or 4.6%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023, and primarily reflect slightly lower expense for clinical studies and personnel costs.\nWe expect to continue incurring research and development expenses through our continued investments in our ongoing pipeline initiatives and\nas we seek opportunities to build evidentiary support and new tests where commercial opportunities exist.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nThe following table provides a breakdown of SG&A expenses (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023 Change\n(unaudited)\nSales and marketing $ 29,835 $ 28,496 $ 1,339\nGeneral and administrative 20,664 16,123 4,541\nTotal selling, general and administrative expense $ 50,499 $ 44,619 $ 5,880\nSales and marketing expenses increased by $1.3 million, or 4.7%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflecting higher travel and transportation costs incurred through our business development\nactivities as well as slightly higher marketing costs and relatively consistent personnel costs. Stock-based compensation expense included in\nsales and marketing was $4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $4.4 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $4.5 million, or 28.2%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023, and was primarily due to higher personnel costs, higher professional fees and higher information\ntechnology related costs. Higher personnel cost reflects headcount expansions in our administrative support functions as well as merit and\nannual inflationary wage adjustment for existing employees. Stock-based compensation expense included in general and administrative expense\nwas $5.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $4.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nAmortization of Acquired Intangible Assets\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $2.3 million and remains consistent as\ncompared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nInterest Income\nInterest income increased by $0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30,\n2023, primarily as a result of higher average balances of marketable investment securities and slightly higher interest rates.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased by $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, primarily due to interest incurred on our long-term debt where we had no debt outstanding during the comparative period.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense was $6.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and was due to revisions in estimated pre-tax income,\nreflecting uncertainty in continued Medicare coverage for our DecisionDx-SCC test and updated information, as well as stock-based\ncompensation, permanent differences, changes in valuation allowance, research and development tax credit and state income taxes. We\nrecorded a minimal amount in income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n35\nTable of Contents\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nStock-based compensation expense, which is allocated among cost of sales, research and development expense and SG&A expense, was\n$13.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We expect material increases in stock-based\ncompensation expense in future periods, attributable to both existing awards outstanding and anticipated additional grants to our current and\nfuture employees. As of September 30, 2024, we had 710 employees, compared to 587 as of September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024,\nthe total unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to outstanding awards was $77.6 million, which is expected to be recognized over\na weighted-average period of 2.2 years.\nComparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentages):\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023 Change\n(unaudited)\nNet revenues $ 245,758 $ 153,668 $ 92,090 59.9 %\nOperating expenses\nCost of sales (exclusive of amortization of acquired intangible\nassets) 44,022 32,559 11,463 35.2 %\nResearch and development 40,268 40,624 (356) (0.9)%\nSelling, general and administrative 150,082 136,062 14,020 10.3 %\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets 6,766 6,742 24 0.4 %\nTotal operating expenses, net 241,138 215,987 25,151 11.6 %\nOperating income (loss) 4,620 (62,319) 66,939 107.4 %\nInterest income 9,544 7,504 2,040 27.2 %\nInterest expense (485) (9) (476) NM\nIncome (loss) before income taxes 13,679 (54,824) 68,503 125.0 %\nIncome tax expense 5,024 62 4,962 NM\nNet income (loss) $ 8,655 $ (54,886) $ 63,541 115.8 %\nNM = Not meaningful\nThe following table indicates the amount of stock-based compensation expense (non-cash) reflected in the line items above (in thousands):\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023 Change\n(unaudited)\nCost of sales (exclusive of amortization of acquired intangible assets) $ 4,179 $ 3,719 $ 460\nResearch and development 7,611 7,755 (144)\nSelling, general and administrative 27,091 27,943 (852)\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ 38,881 $ 39,417 $ (536)\n36\nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides a disaggregation of net revenues by type (in thousands):\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023 Change\n(unaudited)\nDermatologic(1) $ 193,223 $ 130,097 $ 63,126\nNon-Dermatologic(2) 52,535 23,571 28,964\nTotal net revenues $ 245,758 $ 153,668 $ 92,090\n(1) Consists of DecisionDx-Melanoma, DecisionDx-SCC and our Diagnostic GEP offering.\n(2) Consists of TissueCypher, DecisionDx-UM and IDgenetix.\nThe following table presents the calculation of gross margin (in thousands, except percentages):\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023 Change\n(unaudited)\nNet revenues $ 245,758 $ 153,668 $ 92,090\nLess: Cost of sales (exclusive of amortization of acquired intangible assets) 44,022 32,559 11,463\nLess: Amortization of acquired intangible assets 6,766 6,742 24\nGross margin $ 194,970 $ 114,367 $ 80,603\nGross margin percentage 79.3 % 74.4 % 4.9 %\nNet Revenues\nNet revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by $92.1 million, or 59.9%, to $245.8 million compared to the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, due to a $63.1 million increase in revenue from our dermatologic tests and a $29.0 million increase in\nrevenue from our non-dermatologic tests.\nThe $63.1 million increase from our dermatologic tests was primarily due to a higher ASP for DecisionDx-SCC test, where we began receiving\nMedicare reimbursement at a higher rate beginning in July 2023, a 52.3% increase in DecisionDx-SCC test report volumes, and a 10.5%\nincrease in DecisionDx-Melanoma test report volumes.\nThe $29.0 million increase in revenue from our non-dermatologic tests was largely attributable to a 152% increase in tests report volumes for our\nTissueCypher test, and, to a much lesser extent, a higher realized ASP. Increases in our TissueCypher test report volumes reflect growth through\nour sales force efforts as well as the impacts of a temporary pause in accepting new orders from July 2023 through September 2023, during\nwhich time our lab operations team successfully implemented certain process improvements, automations, and operational enhancements for\nthis test to support future growth. Our IDgenetix and DecisionDx-UM tests also contributed to the increase in non-dermatologic revenues, with\nboth tests having higher test report volumes as well as higher ASPs. Net revenue from our non-dermatologic tests as a percentage of total net\nrevenue increased from 15.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 21.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nCost of Sales (exclusive of amortization of acquired intangible assets)\nCost of sales (exclusive of amortization of acquired intangible assets) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by $11.5 million,\nor 35.2%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher personnel costs and expense for supplies and lab\nservices. Increases in personnel costs reflect a higher headcount, due to additions made to support business growth in response to growing test\nreport volumes, as well as merit and annual inflationary wage adjustment for existing employees. Higher expense for supplies and lab services\nalso reflects higher test report volumes.\nDue to the nature of our business, a significant portion of our cost of sales expenses represents fixed costs associated with our testing\noperations.

The increase was primarily due to higher revenues, partially offset by higher personnel costs, higher expense for supplies\nand lab services and higher expense incurred through our expanded laboratory capacity and higher test report volumes.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses decreased by $0.4 million, or 0.9%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflecting lower clinical studies costs, lower organizational development costs, and lower expense\nfor laboratory supplies, partially offset by higher personnel costs.\nWe expect to continue incurring research and development expenses through our continued investments in our ongoing pipeline initiatives and\nas we seek opportunities to build evidentiary support and new tests where commercial opportunities exist.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nThe following table provides a breakdown of SG&A expenses (in thousands):\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023 Change\n(unaudited)\nSales and marketing $ 93,054 $ 86,693 $ 6,361\nGeneral and administrative 57,028 49,369 7,659\nTotal selling, general and administrative expense $ 150,082 $ 136,062 $ 14,020\nSales and marketing expenses increased by $6.4 million, or 7.3%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months\nended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to higher personnel costs, higher expense incurred through organizational and\nbusiness development activities and higher marketing expense. Increases in personnel costs reflect a higher headcount as well as merit and\nannual inflationary wage adjustment for existing employees. Higher test report volumes is a result of our continued investments in human capital\nfor our sales organization. Stock-based compensation expense included in sales and marketing expense was $13.5 million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, compared to $14.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $7.7 million, or 15.5%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to higher personnel costs, professional fees and information technology-\nrelated costs.

We\nrecorded a minimal amount in income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nStock-based compensation expense, which is allocated among cost of sales, research and development expense and SG&A expense, totaled\n$38.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $39.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We\nexpect material increases in stock-based compensation expense in future periods, attributable to both existing awards outstanding and\nanticipated additional grants to our current and future employees. As of September 30, 2024, we had 710 employees compared to 587 as of\nSeptember 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the total unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to outstanding awards was\n$77.6 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.2 years.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, marketable investment securities, cash generated from the sale of our\nproducts and our line-of-credit under the 2024 Loan and Security Agreement (the “2024 LSA”). All of our marketable investment securities are\nconsidered investment grade, are readily available for use in current operations and have contractual maturities of one year or less. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had marketable investment securities of $184.8 million and $144.3 million, respectively. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $95.0 million and $98.8 million, respectively. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, we had a $25 million credit-line available under the 2024 LSA.\nOur liquidity has been primarily derived from the revenue generated from the sale of our products and proceeds from our initial public offering of\ncommon stock in July 29, 2019 (the “IPO”) and our follow-on public offerings of common stock in June and December of 2020. We believe that\nour existing cash and cash equivalents, marketable investment securities and anticipated cash generated from sales of our products will be\nsufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. However, we have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be\nwrong, and could result in us depleting our capital resources sooner than expected.\nAs mentioned above, we expect to use a portion of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable investment securities to further support and\naccelerate our research and development activities, including the clinical studies noted above in “—Components of the Results of Operations—\nResearch and Development.”\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nOur primary uses of capital are, and we expect will continue to be, compensation and related expenses, clinical research and development\nservices, laboratory operations, equipment and related supplies, legal and other regulatory expenses, general administrative costs and, from\ntime to time, expansion of our laboratory and office facilities in support of our growth, such as the construction of our future corporate\nheadquarters. We anticipate that a substantial portion of our cash requirements in the foreseeable future will relate to the further\ncommercialization of our currently marketed products, the development of our future product candidates in our pipeline and the potential\ncommercialization of these pipeline products, should their development be successful, and the construction of our future corporate headquarters.\nIn July 2023, following approval by our board of directors, we entered into a definitive agreement to purchase a plot of land located in\nFriendswood, Texas for a purchase price of $7.6 million, subject to certain adjustments, for the purpose of developing a commercial office\nbuilding to be used as our future corporate headquarters. In February 2024, we closed on the purchase of the land for cash consideration of $7.2\nmillion. The development project will include a four-story headquarters building, which will encompass approximately 80,000 square feet of Class\nA office space. Construction began in May 2024 and is expected to continue through early 2026, at which time the building\n39\nTable of Contents\nis expected to be ready for occupancy and use. Over the duration of this project, we expect to make significant capital expenditures in form of\npayments to the developer under a percentage of completion basis. As of September 30, 2024, the development project is expected to cost a\ntotal of approximately $40 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have made minimal capital expenditures in the\nplanning and early development phases of this project. We intend to use the proceeds from the 2024 Term Loan, the 2024 Credit Line and our\nexisting cash and cash equivalents to pay for this project.\nIn connection with our acquisition of AltheaDx, we agreed to pay contingent consideration of up $75.0 million, payable 50% in cash and 50% in\ncommon stock, based on the achievement of certain commercial milestones relating to the years ending December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024.\nThe portion of the AltheaDx Earnout Payments associated with the commercial milestones for the year ended December 31, 2023 was\n$37.5 million and was not paid since the applicable commercial milestones were not met. The AltheaDx Earnout Payments included a 2022\ncatch-up provision for additional payment of up to $17.5 million that expired in 2023. Therefore, as of September 30, 2024, we have a potential\npayment obligation of up to $20.0 million with respect to the remaining commercial milestones for 2024. The number of shares of our common\nstock that may be issued in connection with the commercial milestone payment for 2024 is subject to limitations. As of September 30, 2024, we\nbelieve it to be unlikely that the remaining commercial milestones will be met and that future payments will be due.\nSince our inception, we have generally incurred significant losses and negative operating cash flows. For the year ended December 31, 2023,\nwe had a net loss of $57.5 million, used $5.6 million in operating cash flows, and had an accumulated deficit of $218.4 million. For the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, we had net income of $8.7 million and positive operating cash flows of $40.5 million. Our ability to maintain\nprofitability will heavily depend on us maintaining Medicare coverage for our currently marketed products, on the successful commercialization of\nthe products we plan to launch in the future, and our ability to manage operating expenses. We expect to incur additional expenses in the future\nas we invest in the commercialization of our existing products and the development and commercialization of our current pipeline products and\nfuture product candidates. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, marketable investment securities and anticipated cash\ngenerated from the sale of our commercial products will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. We believe we will\nmeet longer-term expected cash requirements and obligations through a combination of existing cash and cash equivalents, marketable\ninvestment securities and anticipated cash generated from sales of our products and issuances of equity securities or debt offerings. However,\nwe have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we\nexpect. There are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing genomic tests, including, among others, the uncertainty of:\n• successful commencement and completion of clinical study protocols;\n• successful identification and acquisition of tissue samples;\n• the development and validation of genomic classifiers; and\n• acceptance of new genomic tests by clinicians, patients and third-party payors including competitor actions.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of product candidates, we are\nunable to estimate our exact working capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on and could increase significantly as a\nresult of, many factors, including those listed above as well as those listed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in the 2023 10-K and Part II, Item 1A,\n“Risk Factors” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our other filings with the SEC.\nIn the event additional funding is required, we expect that we would use a combination of equity and debt financings, which may not be available\nto us when needed, on terms that we deem to be favorable or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or\nconvertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or\nother preferences that adversely affect the rights of common stockholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may\ninvolve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making\nacquisitions or capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Any disruptions to, or volatility in, the credit and financial markets or any deterioration\nin overall economic conditions may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to obtain, more costly and/or more dilutive. If we\nare unable to raise additional funds through debt or equity financing or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit,\nreduce or terminate our product discovery and development activities or future commercialization efforts.\n40\nTable of Contents\nLong-Term Debt\nWe had no debt as of December 31, 2023. Our long-term debt as of September 30, 2024 is presented in the table below (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(Unaudited)\nTerm debt $ 10,200\nUnamortized discount (185)\nTotal long-term debt 10,015\nLess: Current portion of long-term debt —\nTotal $ 10,015\n2024 Loan and Security Agreement\nOn March 26, 2024 (the ‘‘Closing Date’’), we entered into the ‘2024 LSA, by and between the Company, its wholly owned subsidiary, Castle\nNarnia Real Estate Holding 1, LLC and Silicon Valley Bank, a division of First-Citizens Bank & Trust Company (the “Lender’’). The 2024 LSA\nprovides for (i) on the Closing Date, $10.0 million aggregate principal amount of term loans (discussed in the ‘‘2024 Term Loan’’ section below),\nand (ii) from the Closing Date until March 31, 2025, an additional line of credit of $25.0 million with the same interest rate and maturity as the\nterm debt available (discussed in ‘‘—2024 Credit Line’’ below) at our option.\nThe obligations under the 2024 LSA are secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding intellectual property, the real property held by the\nCompany, and are subject to certain other exceptions and limitations. We have the right to prepay the 2024 LSA in whole, subject to a\nprepayment fee of approximately 1.50% if paid prior to March 26, 2026. Amounts repaid under the 2024 LSA may not be reborrowed.\nIn addition, the 2024 LSA contains customary conditions of borrowing, events of default and covenants, including covenants that restrict our\nability to dispose of assets, merge with or acquire other entities, incur indebtedness and make distributions to holders of our capital stock.\nShould an event of default occur, including the occurrence of a material adverse change, we could be liable for immediate repayment of all\nobligations under the 2024 LSA. Should we seek to amend the terms of the 2024 LSA, the consent of the Lender would be required. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, we were in compliance with this covenant.\nThe 2024 LSA bears interest at a floating rate equal to the greater of (a) the WSJ Prime Rate plus 0.25% or (b) 6.00% per annum. The Term\nLoans are interest only from the Closing Date through November 30, 2025, which may be extended at our option through November 30, 2026 as\nlong as no event of default under the 2024 LSA has occurred. After the end of the interest only period, we are required to pay equal monthly\ninstallments of principal through the maturity date of November 1, 2028.\nWe are also obligated to make an additional final payment of 2.00% of the aggregate original principal amounts of Term Loans advanced by the\nLender, due at the earlier of the maturity date or date the Term Loans are repaid in full.\n2024 Term Loan\nOn March 26, 2024, we drew $10.0 million in Term Loans under the terms and provisions of the 2024 LSA. We are obligated to make a final\npayment of $0.2 million under the terms of the 2024 LSA final payment provisions. A discount on debt equal to this obligation was recorded on\nthe draw date and is being amortized as additional interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the debt. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the effective interest rate for all outstanding debt under the 2024 Term Loan was 8.60%.\n2024 Credit Line\nWe have a $25.0 million line of credit under the terms and provisions of the 2024 LSA available from the Closing Date until March 31, 2025.\nAmounts repaid under the 2024 Credit Line may not be reborrowed. As of September 30, 2024, no draws had been made on the line of credit.\nLeases\nWe have entered into various operating and finance leases, which are primarily associated with our laboratory facilities and office space.\n41\nTable of Contents\nTotal undiscounted future minimum payment obligations under our operating leases and finance leases as of September 30, 2024 totaled\napproximately $24.0 million, of which $0.8 million is payable through the remainder of 2024 and $23.2 million is payable through early 2034. The\nleases expire on various dates through 2034 and provide certain options to renew for additional periods.\nWe expect our lease obligations may increase in the future as we expand our facilities, operations and headcount in support of the anticipated\ngrowth in our portfolio of commercial products and pipeline tests.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for each of the periods presented (in thousands):\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\n(unaudited)\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 40,501 $ (24,213)\nNet cash used in investing activities (55,907) (8,511)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 11,524 999\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents (3,882) (31,725)\nCash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 98,841 122,948\nCash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 94,959 $ 91,223\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $40.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and was primarily attributable to\nnon-cash stock-based compensation expense of $38.9 million, depreciation and amortization of $10.2 million, net income of $8.7 million,\ndeferred income taxes of $3.7 million and decreases in inventory of $1.4 million, partially offset by increases in accounts receivable of $11.9\nmillion, increases in accretion of discounts on marketable investment securities of $5.1 million, decreases in accounts payable of $3.8 million,\nincreases in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $1.7 million and decreases in accrued compensation of $1.3 million.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $24.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and was primarily attributable to the net\nloss of $54.9 million, increases in accounts receivable of $13.8 million, increases in accretion of discounts on marketable investment securities of\n$3.9 million, decreases in accrued compensation of $2.0 million and increases in inventory of $1.8 million, partially offset by non-cash stock-\nbased compensation expense of $39.4 million, depreciation and amortization of $9.1 million, a change in accounts payable of $2.7 million and a\nchange in other accrued and current liabilities of $1.4 million.\nThe $64.7 million increase in cash inflows from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months\nended September 30, 2023 is primarily due to increases in collections from customers attributable to higher net revenues partially offset by\nincreases in operating expenditures. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 net revenues increased by 59.9% compared to the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 which outpaced the 11.6% increase in net operating expenses for the same period. In part, the cash\nprovided during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflects the payment of annual cash bonuses to our employees as well as certain\nhealth care benefit payments totaling $20.8 million, that are not expected to recur during the remainder of 2024. In comparison, we paid\n$17.7 million during the same period in 2023 towards annual cash bonuses and certain health care benefits.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $55.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and consisted primarily of purchases of\nmarketable investment securities of $158.4 million and purchases of property and equipment of $20.8 million, partially offset by the maturity of\nmarketable investment securities of $123.3 million. Net cash used in investing activities was $8.5 million for the nine months ended September\n30, 2023 and consisted primarily of purchases of marketable investment securities of $136.7 million and purchases of property and equipment of\n$9.8 million, partially offset by the maturity of marketable investment securities of $138.0 million.\n42\nTable of Contents\nThe $47.4 million increase in cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months\nended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to purchasing $21.7 million more in marketable investment securities and collecting $14.7 million\nfewer proceeds from maturing marketable investment securities. We also increased our purchases of property and equipment by $10.9 million\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to our purchase of land\nfor cash consideration of $7.2 million on February 9, 2024.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $11.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and consisted primarily of\n$10.0 million of proceeds from issuance of long-term debt and $2.3 million of proceeds from contributions to our 2019 Employee Stock Purchase\nPlan (the “ESPP”) and $1.6 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by the $2.4 million payment of employee taxes\nattributable to the vesting of Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”).\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and primarily consisted of $2.0 million\nof proceeds from contributions to the ESPP and $0.2 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by the $1.1 million\npayment of employee taxes attributable to the vesting of RSUs.\nInflation\nIn 2021, the rate of inflation in the United States began to increase but has continued to subside since the second half of 2022. We do not\nbelieve that inflation has had a material impact on our financial results during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. We are\nunable to predict if the rate of inflation will increase in future periods.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to the information discussed under “Critical Accounting\nEstimates” included in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2023 10-K.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily relate to interest rates fluctuations. We had cash\nand cash equivalents of $95.0 million as of September 30, 2024, which include bank deposits and money market funds. We had marketable\ninvestment securities of $184.8 million as of September 30, 2024, which include U.S. government securities. Due to the nature of these\ninstruments, we believe that we have no material exposure to interest rate risk.\nWe had long-term debt of $10.0 million as of September 30, 2024, consisting of an outstanding term loan which bears interest at a floating rate\nthat fluctuates with the WSJ Prime Rate, subject to an interest rate floor of 6.00%. In September 2024, the U.S. Federal Reserve lowered\ninterest rates by 50 basis points, lowering the target for key lending rates by half a percent and the WSJ Prime Rate decreased by 50 basis\npoints thereafter.\nA hypothetical 10% change in interest rates during any of the periods presented would not have had a material impact on our financial\nstatements.\nInflation Risk\nOur exposure to inflationary pressures is primarily in personnel and related costs. The extent of any future impacts from inflation on our business\nand our results of operations will be dependent upon how long the elevated inflation levels persist and if the rate of inflation were to further\nincrease, neither of which we are able to predict. If elevated levels of inflation were to persist or if the rate of inflation were to accelerate, the\npurchasing power of our cash and cash equivalents may be eroded, our expenses could increase faster than anticipated and we may utilize our\ncapital resources sooner than expected. Further, given the complexities of the reimbursement landscape in which we operate, our payors may\nbe unwilling or unable to increase reimbursement rates to compensate for inflationary impacts.\n43\nTable of Contents\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to\nensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed,\nsummarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our\nmanagement, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance\nof achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and\nprocedures.\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon the evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer\nconcluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)\nthat occurred during the third quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\n44\nTable of Contents\nPART II—OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings.\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Legal proceedings, including litigation,\ngovernment investigations and enforcement actions could result in material costs, occupy significant management resources and entail civil and\ncriminal penalties, even if we ultimately prevail. On February 1, 2024, we received a Subpoena from the Department of Health and Human\nServices, Office of Inspector General, seeking documents and information concerning claims submitted for payment under federal healthcare\nprograms. The Subpoena requested that we produce documents relating primarily to interactions with medical providers and billing to\ngovernment-funded healthcare programs for our tests. The time period covered by the Subpoena is January 1, 2015 through February 1, 2024.\nWe are continuing to cooperate with the government’s request and is in the process of responding to the Subpoena. We are unable to predict\nwhat action, if any, might be taken in the future by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, or any other\ngovernmental authority as a result of the matters related to this Subpoena. No claims have been made against us at this time. This inquiry, and\nany potential resulting claim asserted against us, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, expensive to address and divert management’s\nattention and other resources. Any potential claims could subject us to significant liability for damages and harm our reputation. Our insurance\nand indemnities may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us. We are unable to predict the outcome and are unable to make a\nmeaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss, if any, that could result from any unfavorable outcome.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors and other\ncautionary statements described under the heading “Item 1A. Risk Factors” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results.\nAdditional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect\nour business, financial condition or future results. There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those described in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 other than the updates to the risk factors or new risk factors set forth below. New\nrisk factors that were not included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 have been marked with an asterisk\n(*).\nWe may disclose changes to risk factors or additional risk factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position\nWe may need to raise additional capital to fund our existing operations, commercialize new products or expand our operations.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, marketable investment securities and anticipated cash generated from sales of our products\nwill be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. If our available cash and cash equivalents, marketable investment\nsecurities and anticipated cash generated from sales of our products are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements including because of\nlower demand for our products, lower than currently expected rates of reimbursement from third-party payors or other risks described in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K, we may finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations,\nstrategic alliances and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements. In March 2024, we entered into the 2024 LSA, by and between us, our\nwholly owned subsidiary, Castle Narnia Real Estate Holding 1, LLC and the Lender. The 2024 LSA provides for (i) on the Closing Date, $10.0\nmillion aggregate principal amount of term loans, and (ii) from the Closing Date until March 31, 2025, an additional $25.0 million available at our\noption. We drew $10.0 million in Term Loans on the Closing Date. We expect to use the proceeds for the purpose of developing a commercial\noffice building to be used as our future corporate headquarters, and the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes.\nWe may consider raising additional capital in the future to expand our business, to pursue strategic investments, to take advantage of financing\nopportunities or for other reasons, including to:\n• increase our sales and marketing efforts for the DecisionDx-Melanoma, DecisionDx-SCC, MyPath Melanoma, DecisionDx-UM,\nTissueCypher and IDgenetix tests and address competitive developments among these or future commercial products;\n• fund ongoing evidence development for our existing products as well as additional pipeline programs;\n• expand our laboratory testing facility and related testing capacity;\n45\nTable of Contents\n• expand our technologies into other types of dermatological, ocular, gastrointestinal or mental health disorders;\n• acquire, license or invest in technologies;\n• acquire or invest in complementary businesses or assets; and\n• finance capital expenditures and general and administrative expenses.\nOur present and future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n• our ability to achieve revenue growth;\n• our rate of progress in establishing payor coverage and reimbursement arrangements with third-party payors;\n• our rate of progress in, and cost of the sales, marketing, coverage and reimbursement activities associated with, establishing adoption of\nour lead product, DecisionDx-Melanoma, among our other products;\n• the cost of expanding our laboratory operations and offerings, including our sales, marketing, coverage and reimbursement efforts;\n• our rate of progress in, and cost of research and development activities associated with, diagnostic products in research and early\ndevelopment;\n• the potential cost of, and delays in, the development of new products as a result of changes in regulatory oversight applicable to our\nproducts;\n• acquisitions of businesses, assets, products or technologies;\n• the duration and effects of elevated inflation;\n• the effects on our operations of general political and economic conditions and evolving macroeconomic developments, including\ngeopolitical and macroeconomic developments, such as the ongoing conflict between Ukraine by Russia and related sanctions or the\nIsrael-Hamas war, public health crises, economic slowdowns, labor shortages, recessions or market corrections, supply chain\ndisruptions, inflation and monetary policy shifts, bank failures or other disruptions in the banking system or financing markets, rising\ninterest rates and tightening of credit markets resulting from the conflict or other evolving macroeconomic developments; and\n• the effect of competing technological and market developments.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and\nthe terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt\nfinancing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take\nspecific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making acquisitions or capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we\nmay have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or products, or grant licenses on terms\nthat may not be favorable to us.\nAny disruptions to, or volatility in, the credit and financial markets or any deterioration in overall economic conditions may make any necessary\ndebt or equity financing more difficult to obtain, more costly and/or more dilutive. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt\nfinancings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our commercialization, research and\ndevelopment efforts or grant rights to third parties to market and/or develop products that we would otherwise prefer to market and develop\nourselves.\n46\nTable of Contents\nThe terms of the Loan and Security Agreement place restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility. If we raise additional capital\nthrough debt financing, the terms of any new debt could further restrict our operating and financial flexibility.*\nIn March 2024, we entered into the 2024 LSA with the Lender, which provides for (i) on the Closing Date, $10.0 million aggregate principal\namount of term loans, and (ii) from the Closing Date until March 31, 2025, an additional $25.0 million available at our option. The 2024 LSA\nincludes customary affirmative and negative covenants, as well as standard events of default, including an event of default based on the\noccurrence of a material adverse event. The negative covenants include, among others, restrictions on us transferring collateral, incurring\nadditional indebtedness, engaging in mergers or acquisitions, paying cash dividends or making other distributions, making investments, creating\nliens, selling assets and making any payment on subordinated debt, in each case subject to certain exceptions. These restrictive covenants\ncould limit our flexibility in operating our business and our ability to pursue business opportunities that we or our stockholders may consider\nbeneficial. In addition, the Lender could declare a default upon the occurrence of any event that it interprets could have a material adverse effect,\nas defined in the 2024 LSA. Upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default, the Lender may declare all outstanding obligations\nimmediately due and payable and take such other actions as set forth in the 2024 LSA. Any declaration by the Lender of an event of default\ncould significantly harm our business and prospects and could cause the price of our common stock to decline. We may not have enough\navailable cash or be able to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings to repay these outstanding obligations at the time any event\nof default occurs. Further, if we raise any additional capital through debt financing, the terms of such additional debt could further restrict our\noperating and financial flexibility.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur products are currently marketed as LDTs, and any changes in regulations or the FDA’s enforcement discretion for LDTs, or\nviolations of regulations by us, could adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe diagnostics industry is highly regulated, and we cannot assure you that the regulatory environment in which we operate will not change\nsignificantly and adversely in the future. In many instances, there are no significant regulatory or judicial interpretations of these laws and\nregulations. Although the FDA has statutory authority to assure that medical devices are safe and effective for their intended uses, the FDA has\ngenerally exercised its enforcement discretion and not enforced applicable regulations with respect to in vitro diagnostics (“IVD”) that are\ndesigned, manufactured and used within a single laboratory. These tests are referred to as LDTs. We currently market our products as LDTs.\nOn April 29, 2024, the FDA published final regulations under 21 CFR Part 809 under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FD&C Act”)\nto make explicit that IVD products are devices under the FD&C Act, removing much of the FDA’s historical enforcement discretion for most LDTs.\nIn conjunction with this final rule, the FDA proposed to phase out its general enforcement discretion approach for LDTs so that IVDs\nmanufactured by a laboratory would generally fall under the same enforcement approach as other IVDs. This final rule also provides that FDA\nintends to exercise enforcement discretion and generally not enforce premarket review and quality system requirements (except for\nrequirements under Part 820, subpart M (records)) for currently marketed IVDs offered as LDTs that were first marketed prior to April 29, 2024\nand intends to exercise enforcement discretion and generally not enforce premarket review requirements for LDTs approved by the NYS CLEP.\nWe believe that our tests will continue to be subject to FDA enforcement discretion in their current forms. Additionally, pursuant to the final rule,\nthe FDA will gradually end its general enforcement discretion approach in five stages over a four-year period for other LDTs not approved by\nNYS CLEP or not already on market. Each stage of the proposed phaseout period would subject LDTs to a set of regulatory requirements. For\nexample, the first stage of the phaseout would require LDT developers to comply with medical device reporting requirements and correction and\nremoval reporting requirements by May 6, 2025. LDTs that are considered higher risk IVDs would be subject to premarket review requirements\nwithin three and a half years, and LDTs that are considered moderate or low risk IVDs would be subject to premarket submission requirements\nwithin four years after the FDA publishes the final rule. While the enforcement policy is phased out, the FDA could still decide to pursue\nenforcement action at any time against LDTs that it deems to be violative of its regulations when appropriate.\nAll of our existing tests were marketed prior to April 29, 2024 and are conducted in labs licensed by the New York State Department of Health. If\nthe FDA were to determine that our tests, or modifications thereof, are not within the scope of the FDA's enforcement discretion policy for LDTs\nfor any reason, including based on these final rules or new rules, regulations, policies or guidance, or due to changes in statute, our existing\ntests may become subject to extensive FDA requirements, or our business may otherwise be adversely affected and lead to potential adverse\n47\nTable of Contents\neffects on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, under the terms of this FDA final rule, any future\nCastle tests developed and commercialized are likely to be subject to extensive FDA requirements which may adversely impact our business,\nprospects, results of operations and financial conditions. In addition, we would be required to obtain 510(k) or premarket approval (“PMA”) for\ncertain of our tests by October 1, 2027. We would also be subject to device registration and listing requirements, medical device reporting\nrequirements and the requirements of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation. We may be required to conduct clinical trials prior to continuing to\nsell our existing products or launching any other products we may develop. This may increase the cost of conducting, or otherwise harm, our\nbusiness.\nEven if the FDA does not modify its policy of enforcement discretion, the FDA may disagree that we are marketing our LDTs within the scope of\nits policy of enforcement discretion and may impose significant regulatory requirements. While we believe that we are currently in material\ncompliance with applicable laws and regulations as historically enforced by the FDA, we cannot assure you that the FDA will agree with our\ndetermination. A determination that we have violated these laws and regulations, or a public announcement that we are being investigated for\npossible violations, could adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may be required to obtain premarket clearance under Section 510(k) of the FDCA or a PMA for any future test we wish to offer. The process\nfor submitting a 510(k) premarket notification and receiving FDA clearance usually takes from three to 12 months, but it can take significantly\nlonger and clearance is never guaranteed. The process for submitting and obtaining FDA approval of a PMA is much more costly, lengthy and\nuncertain. It generally takes from one to three years or even longer, and approval is not guaranteed. PMA approval typically requires extensive\nclinical data and can be significantly longer, more expensive and more uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process. Despite the time, effort and\nexpense expended, there can be no assurance that a particular device ultimately will be cleared or approved by the FDA through either the\n510(k) clearance process or the PMA process on a timely basis, or at all. Moreover, there can be no assurance that any cleared or approved\nlabeling claims will be consistent with our current claims or adequate to support continued adoption of and reimbursement for our products. If\npremarket review is required for some or all of our products, the FDA may require that we stop selling our products pending clearance or\napproval, which would negatively impact our business. Even if our products are allowed to remain on the market prior to clearance or approval,\ndemand or reimbursement for our products may decline if there is uncertainty about our products, if we are required to label our products as\ninvestigational by the FDA, or if the FDA limits the labeling claims we are permitted to make for our products. As a result, we could experience\nsignificantly increased development costs and a delay in generating additional revenue from our products, or from other pipeline products.\nFurthermore, it could reduce our revenues or increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or\nfinancial condition.\nRisks Related to Reimbursement and Government Regulation\nWe generally have limited reimbursement coverage for our products, and if third-party payors, including government and commercial\npayors, do not provide sufficient coverage of, or adequate reimbursement for, our products, our commercial success, including\nrevenue, will be negatively affected.\nOur revenue depends on achieving broad coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products from third-party payors, including both\ngovernment and commercial third-party payors. If third-party payors do not provide coverage of, or do not provide adequate reimbursement for, a\nsubstantial portion of the list price of our products, we may need to seek additional payment from the patient beyond any co-payments and\ndeductibles, which may adversely affect demand for our products. Coverage determinations by a third-party payor may depend on a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, a third-party payor’s determination of whether our products are appropriate, medically necessary or cost-\neffective. If we are unable to provide third-party payors with sufficient evidence of the clinical utility and validity of our products, they may not\nprovide coverage, or may provide limited coverage, which will adversely affect our revenues and our ability to succeed. To the extent that more\ncompetitors enter our markets, the availability of coverage and the reimbursement rate for our products may decrease as we encounter pricing\npressure from these competitors.\nSince each third-party payor makes its own decision as to whether to establish a policy to cover our products, enter into a contract with us and\nset the amount it will reimburse for a product, these negotiations are a time-consuming and costly process, and they do not guarantee that the\nthird-party payor will provide coverage or adequate reimbursement for our products. In addition, the determinations by a third-party payor\nwhether to cover our products and the amount it will reimburse for them are often made on an indication-by-indication basis.\n48\nTable of Contents\nIn cases where there is no coverage policy or we do not have a contracted rate for reimbursement as a participating provider, the patient is\ntypically responsible for a greater share of the cost of the product, which may result in further delay of our revenue, increase our collection costs\nor decrease the likelihood of collection.\nOur claims for reimbursement from third-party payors may be denied upon submission, and we may need to take additional steps to receive\npayment, such as appealing the denials. Such appeals and other processes are time-consuming and expensive and may not result in payment.\nThird-party payors may perform audits of historically paid claims and attempt to recoup funds years after the funds were initially distributed if the\nthird-party payors believe the funds were paid in error or determine that our products were medically unnecessary. If a third-party payor audits\nour claims and issues a negative audit finding, and we are not able to overturn the audit findings through appeal, the recoupment may result in a\nmaterial adverse effect on our revenue. Additionally, in some cases commercial third-party payors for whom we are not a participating provider\nmay elect at any time to review claims previously paid and determine the amount they paid was too much. In these situations, the third-party\npayor will typically notify us of their decision and then offset whatever amount they determine they overpaid against amounts they owe us on\ncurrent claims. We cannot predict when, or how often, a third-party payor might engage in these reviews and we may not be able to dispute\nthese retroactive adjustments.\nUnder ASC 606, we recognize revenue at the amount we expect to be entitled, subject to a constraint for variable consideration, in the period in\nwhich our tests are delivered to the treating clinician. We have determined that our contracts contain variable consideration under ASC 606\nbecause the amounts paid by third-party payors may be paid at less than our standard rates or not paid at all, with such differences considered\nimplicit price concessions. Variable consideration is recognized only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not\noccur in future periods when the uncertainties are resolved.\nVariable consideration is evaluated each reporting period and adjustments are recorded as increases or decreases in revenues. Variable\nconsideration for Medicare claims that are not covered by Medicare, including those claims undergoing appeal, is deemed to be fully constrained\ndue to factors outside our influence (e.g., judgment or actions of third parties) and the uncertainty of the amount to be received is not expected to\nbe resolved for a long period of time. For these fully constrained claims, we generally recognize revenue in the period the uncertainties are\nresolved, if favorable. Due to potential future changes in Medicare coverage policies and appeal cycles, insurance coverage policies, contractual\nrates and other trends in the reimbursement of our tests, our revenues may fluctuate significantly from period to period.\nAlthough we are an in-network participating provider with some commercial third-party payors, including several Blue Cross Blue Shield plans,\nand certain large, national commercial third-party payors, including Aetna, other commercial third-party payors have issued non-coverage\npolicies that currently categorize our tests as experimental or investigational. If we are not successful in obtaining coverage from third-party\npayors, in reversing existing non-coverage policies, or if other third-party payors issue similar non-coverage policies, this could have a material\nadverse effect on our business and operations.\nThe process to obtain Medicare coverage is lengthy, time-consuming, has changed over time, may change in the future and requires significant\ndedication of resources, and as we develop or acquire new products, we may be unsuccessful in receiving Medicare coverage for those\nproducts or in maintaining our current Medicare coverage. On a periodic basis, CMS requests bids for its MAC services, and MAC jurisdictions\nhave changed in the past. A change in our MAC, or future changes in the MolDX program, the elimination of the program, or a change in the\nadministrator of that program, may affect our ability to maintain Medicare coverage and reimbursement for products for which we have coverage,\nobtain Medicare coverage for products for which we do not yet have coverage, or obtain Medicare coverage for any products we may launch in\nthe future, or delay payments for our tests. Additionally, MACs that currently provide coverage for our products may periodically reevaluate their\ncoverage decisions and decide to withdraw coverage based on a number of factors that we may not be able to predict or control. Accordingly,\ncurrent Medicare coverage of our tests or a history of coverage by Medicare is no guarantee of future Medicare coverage. We have received\npositive coverage decisions and receive Medicare reimbursement for our DecisionDx-Melanoma, DecisionDx-UM, MyPath Melanoma tests, and\nIDgenetix. Our DecisionDx-SCC and TissueCypher tests receive Medicare reimbursement as well. If coverage for one or more of our products is\nwithdrawn, our business could be adversely impacted.\nOn June 2, 2023, Novitas the MAC responsible for administering claims for test reports issued by our Pittsburgh laboratory, posted a finalized\noncology biomarker LCD pursuant to which the DecisionDx-SCC test would no longer be covered by Medicare effective July 17, 2023. However,\non July 6, 2023, Novitas suspended the final version of the LCD and announced its intent to post a new proposed LCD for comment and\npresentation at an open meeting. On July 27, 2023, Novitas posted a nearly identical proposed oncology biomarker LCD that continues to intend\nto\n49\nTable of Contents\nrely upon evidentiary reviews sourced from three databases: ClinGen, OncoKB and NCCN. The proposed LCD also recommends non-coverage\nfor our DecisionDx-SCC test. The comment period for the proposed LCD ended on September 9, 2023. On July 26, 2024, Novitas posted a note\nthat it had been granted an extension by CMS. We cannot predict whether this LCD will be finalized as proposed or what the timing of any final\nLCD might be.\nPalmetto’s MolDX program oversees MAAA tests that are reported from our Phoenix laboratory and Noridian is the MAC responsible for\nadministering claims for test reports issued by our Phoenix laboratory. On June 8, 2023, both Palmetto and Noridian posted a preliminary draft\nLCD recommending no coverage for DecisionDx-SCC. The comment period for the draft LCDs ended on July 22, 2023. On July 4, 2024, the\nLCD was finalized as proposed with a future effective date of August 18, 2024.\nUnder Medicare, payment for products like ours is generally made under the CLFS with payment amounts assigned to specific procedure billing\ncodes. Medicare reimbursement rates for our tests are subject to change and may decrease from those currently in effect. For example, in\nFebruary 2023, MolDX notified us that IDgenetix should shift billing to a different multi-test generic gene sequencing CPT code and continue\nusing the IDgenetix Z-Code beginning in March 2023. As a result of this change, the Medicare reimbursement rate for the IDgenetix multi-gene\npanel decreased from approximately $1,500 to $917 per test. We subsequently obtained a test-specific PLA CPT code which became effective\nOctober 1, 2023. In November 2023, CMS posted its final CLFS determination which crosswalks our PLA CPT code to an existing PLA code at a\nrate of $1,336 per test effective January 1, 2024.\nIn April 2014, Congress passed the Protecting Access to Medicare Act (“PAMA”) which included substantial changes to the way in which clinical\nlaboratory services are paid under Medicare. Under PAMA, certain laboratories are required to report to CMS commercial third-party payor\npayment rates and volumes for each test they perform. CMS uses this data to calculate a weighted median payment rate for each test, which will\nbe used to establish revised Medicare CLFS reimbursement rates for the test. Laboratories that fail to report the required payment information\nmay be subject to substantial civil monetary penalties. We bill Medicare for our products, and therefore we are subject to reporting requirements\nunder PAMA.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate reimbursement rates from commercial third-party payors, this may adversely affect our\nMedicare rate. It is unclear what impact new pricing structures, such as those adopted under PAMA, may have on our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe U.S. federal government continues to show significant interest in pursuing healthcare reform and reducing healthcare costs. Similarly,\ncommercial third-party payors may seek to reduce costs by limiting coverage or reducing reimbursement for our products. Any government-\nadopted reform measures or changes to commercial third-party payor coverage and reimbursement policies could cause significant pressure on\nthe pricing of, and reimbursement for, healthcare products and services, including our products, which could decrease demand for our products,\nand adversely affect our sales and revenue.\nIn addition, some third-party payors have implemented, or are in the process of implementing, laboratory benefit management programs, often\nusing third-party benefit managers to manage these programs. The stated goals of these programs are to help improve the quality of outpatient\nlaboratory services, support evidence-based guidelines for patient care and lower costs. The impact on laboratories, such as ours, of active\nlaboratory benefit management by third parties is unclear, and we expect that it could have a negative impact on our revenue in the short term. It\nis possible that third-party payors will resist reimbursement for the products that we offer, in favor of less expensive products, may require pre-\napproval for our products or may impose additional pricing pressure on and substantial administrative burden for reimbursement for our\nproducts.\nWe expect to continue to focus substantial resources on increasing coverage and reimbursement for our current products and any future\nproducts we may develop. We believe it may take several years to achieve broad coverage and adequate contracted reimbursement with a\nmajority of third-party payors for our products.\nHowever, we cannot predict whether, under what circumstances, or at what payment levels third-party payors will cover and reimburse our\nproducts. If we fail to establish and maintain broad adoption of, and coverage and reimbursement for, our products, our ability to generate\nrevenue could be harmed and our future prospects and our business could suffer.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.\nUse of Proceeds from IPO of Common Stock\nOn July 29, 2019, we completed our IPO, pursuant to which we issued and sold 4,600,000 shares of our common stock, including 600,000\nshares associated with the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares, at a price to the public of $16.00 per share.\n50\nTable of Contents\nThe offer and sale of all of the shares of our common stock in the IPO were registered under the Securities Act pursuant to our Registration\nStatements on Form S-1, as amended (File Nos. 333-232369 and 333-232796), which were declared or became effective on July 24, 2019.\nThere has been no material change in our planned use of the net proceeds from the IPO as described in the final prospectus filed with the SEC\non July 26, 2019 relating to our Registration Statements on Form S-1 (File Nos. 333-232369 and 333-232796).\nSince the effective date of our registration statement through September 30, 2024, we have not used any of the net proceeds from the IPO.\nPending such uses, we have invested, and plan to continue to invest, the balance of the net proceeds from the IPO in cash and cash equivalent\nsecurities or highly liquid investment securities.\nItem 3.

(Nasdaq: CSTL), a company improving health through innovative tests that guide patient care, will share new data highlighting the clinical performance of its DecisionDx-Melanoma and MyPath Melanoma tests at the American Society of Dermatopathology (ASDP) 61 st Annual Meeting, being held Nov. 7-10, in Chicago. \n\n“At Castle, we focus strongly on continued evidence development to demonstrate where our tests might be able to add value to clinical decision-making,” said Rebecca Critchley-Thorne, Ph.D., vice president of research and development at Castle Biosciences. “Our data to be presented at ASDP support the ability of our tests to provide accurate risk-stratification in patients with confirmed or suspected melanoma, which can help clinicians make more informed treatment and management decisions in the care of their patients.” \n\nCastle’s posters at ASDP will be presented by study author Etan Marks, D.O., board-certified dermatopathologist, laboratory director and primary investigator at Advanced Dermatology and Cosmetic Surgery in Delray Beach, Florida, during a two-hour poster defense session on Saturday, Nov. 9, from 3:30-5:30 p.m. Central time in the Chicago Ballroom (5 th floor). \n\n_DecisionDx-Melanoma_\n\n  * Poster 231: **The integrated 31-gene expression profile test stratifies recurrence risk within cutaneous melanoma subtypes**\n\n\n\n_MyPath Melanoma_\n\n  * Poster 232: **Appropriate statistical methods to assess cross-study diagnostic 23-gene expression profile test performance for cutaneous melanocytic neoplasms**\n\n\n\n**About DecisionDx®-Melanoma**\n\nDecisionDx-Melanoma is a gene expression profile risk stratification test. It is designed to inform two clinical questions in the management of cutaneous melanoma: a patient’s individual risk of sentinel lymph node positivity and a patient's personal risk of melanoma recurrence and/or metastasis. By integrating tumor biology with clinical and pathologic factors using a validated proprietary algorithm, DecisionDx-Melanoma is designed to provide a comprehensive and clinically actionable result to guide risk-aligned patient care. DecisionDx-Melanoma has been shown to be associated with improved patient survival and has been studied in more than 10,000 patient samples. DecisionDx-Melanoma’s clinical value is supported by more than 50 peer-reviewed and published studies, providing confidence in disease management plans that incorporate the test’s results. Through Sept. 30, 2024, DecisionDx-Melanoma has been ordered approximately 183,000 times for patients diagnosed with cutaneous melanoma.

Of the approximately two million suspicious pigmented lesions biopsied annually in the U.S., Castle estimates that approximately 300,000 of those cannot be confidently classified as either benign or malignant through traditional histopathology methods. For these cases, the treatment plan can also be uncertain. Obtaining accurate, objective ancillary testing can mean the difference between a path of overtreatment or the risk of undertreatment. Interpreted in the context of other clinical, laboratory and histopathologic information, MyPath Melanoma is designed to reduce uncertainty and provide confidence for dermatopathologists and help dermatologists deliver more informed patient management plans.

These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in\nthe forward-looking statements, including, without limitation: our estimates and assumptions underlying our estimated U.S. total addressable market for our commercially available tests; our\nassumptions or expectations regarding continued reimbursement for our DecisionDx-SCC test at the current rate and reimbursement for our other products and subsequent coverage\ndecisions, our estimated total addressable markets for our products and product candidates and the related expenses, capital requirements and potential needs for additional financing, the\nanticipated cost, timing and success of our product candidates, and our plans to research, develop and commercialize new tests and our ability to successfully integrate new businesses, assets,\nproducts or technologies acquired through acquisitions, the effects of macroeconomic events and conditions, including inflation and monetary supply shifts, labor shortages, liquidity concerns\nat, and failures of, banks and other financial institutions or other disruptions in the banking system or financing markets and recession risks, supply chain disruptions, outbreaks of contagious\ndiseases and geopolitical events (such as the ongoing Israel-Hamas War and Ukraine-Russia conflict), among others, on our business and our efforts to address its impact on our business;\nsubsequent study or trial results and findings may contradict earlier study or trial results and findings or may not support the results discussed in this presentation, including with respect to the\ndiagnostic and prognostic tests discussed in this presentation; actual application of our tests may not provide the anticipated benefits to patients; and the risks set forth under the heading\n“Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024, each filed or to be filed\nwith the SEC, and in our other filings with the SEC.

Adjusted Revenues and Adjusted Gross Margin reflect adjustments to GAAP net revenues to exclude net positive and/or\nnet negative revenue adjustments recorded in the current period associated with changes in estimated variable consideration related to test reports delivered in previous periods. Adjusted\nGross Margin further excludes acquisition-related intangible asset amortization. Adjusted EBITDA excludes from net income (loss): interest income, interest expense, income tax expense\n(benefit), depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, change in fair value of contingent consideration and acquisition-related transaction costs.\nWe use Adjusted Revenues, Adjusted Gross Margin and Adjusted EBITDA internally because we believe these metrics provide useful supplemental information in assessing our revenue and\noperating performance reported in accordance with GAAP, respectively. We believe that Adjusted Revenues, when used in conjunction with our test report volume information, facilitates\ninvestors’ analysis of our current-period revenue performance and average selling price performance by excluding the effects of revenue adjustments related to test reports delivered in prior\nperiods, since these adjustments may not be indicative of the current or future performance of our business. We believe that providing Adjusted Revenues may also help facilitate comparisons\nto our historical periods. Adjusted Gross Margin is calculated using Adjusted Revenues and therefore excludes the impact of revenue adjustments related to test reports delivered in prior\nperiods, which we believe is useful to investors as described above. We further exclude acquisition-related intangible asset amortization in the calculation of Adjusted Gross Margin. We believe\nthat excluding acquisition-related intangible asset amortization may facilitate gross margin comparisons to historical periods and may be useful in assessing current-period performance\nwithout regard to the historical accounting valuations of intangible assets, which are applicable only to tests we acquired rather than internally developed. We believe Adjusted EBITDA may\nenhance an evaluation of our operating performance because it excludes the impact of prior decisions made about capital investment, financing, investing and certain expenses we believe are\nnot indicative of our ongoing performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, even when the same\nor similarly titled terms are used to identify such measures, limiting their usefulness for comparative purposes.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or used as substitutes for net revenues, gross margin, or net income (loss) reported in accordance with GAAP;\nshould be considered in conjunction with our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP; have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP; are unaudited; and are not\nprepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. In addition, from time to time in the future, there may be other items that we may exclude for purposes of these non-\nGAAP financial measures, and we may in the future cease to exclude items that we have historically excluded for purposes of these non-GAAP financial measures. Likewise, we may determine\nto modify the nature of adjustments to arrive at these non-GAAP financial measures. Because of the non-standardized definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, the non-GAAP financial\nmeasure as used by us in this press release and the accompanying reconciliation tables have limits in their usefulness to investors and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not\nbe directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these\nnon-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are presented in the tables at the end of this presentation.\nIndustry and Market Data\nThis presentation includes certain information and statistics obtained from third-party sources.
