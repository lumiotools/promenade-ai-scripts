By providing matching donations and volunteer grants, we empower our teams to make a meaningful difference in areas like disaster relief, diversity & inclusion, environment and health & well-being. See the difference our employees are making as they Engage for Good:\n\nOur team in Essex, Vermont proudly hosted the inaugural KDP Drive for a Cure Golf Classic in partnership with the American Cancer Society. Talent Development Manager Kristi Walkins, a breast cancer survivor, shared her powerful story before heading out to the course, where she won both the Women’s Longest Drive and Closest to the Pin competitions. Through their generous donation and volunteer support, our employees united to drive meaningful change in the fight against cancer.\n\nIn partnership with Good360, our team in Sacramento, CA assembled 4,500 daily sanitation kits and wrote letters of encouragement to benefit local organizations. These kits include vital hygiene products such as soap, shampoo, conditioner, ear plugs, sleep masks and disposable washcloths, offering essential support to individuals in need.\n\nThe Controller Finance Team came together in McKinney, Texas to lend a hand at Grace Bridge, a local nonprofit dedicated to providing necessities to those in need. Nearly 70 employees sorted and packed canned goods for individuals and families facing food insecurity. As part of the Engage for Good initiative, participants also earned charitable grant dollars for the nonprofit of their choice, amplifying the impact of their service.\n\nWe’re incredibly proud of our team members who bring heart, purpose and dedication to every community initiative. Their unwavering support fuels the Engage for Good program, allowing us to create a lasting impact in the communities where we live and work.\n\n##  Related Stories \n\n[ Our Stories  Our Impact at Scale: Funding Granted to Mott’s Apple Farmers by the State of New York  Read More  ](https://keurigdrpepper.com/our-impact-at-scale-funding-granted-to-motts-apple-farmers-by-the-state-of-new-york/)\n\n[ Our Stories  Remarks by CEO Tim Cofer on the Agreement to Acquire GHOST  Read More  ](https://keurigdrpepper.com/remarks-by-ceo-tim-cofer-on-the-agreement-to-acquire-ghost/)\n\n[ Our Stories  Behind the Scenes of the GHOST Acquisition  Read More  ](https://keurigdrpepper.com/behind-the-scenes-of-the-ghost-acquisition/)\n\n[ Our Stories  Keurig Dr Pepper Ireland Facility to Reduce its Carbon Emissions by 100%  Read More  ](https://keurigdrpepper.com/keurig-dr-pepper-ireland-facility-to-reduce-its-carbon-emissions-by-100/)\n\n[ Our Stories  Regional Tastes – Looking Deeper into KDP’s Portfolio  Read More  ](https://keurigdrpepper.com/regional-tastes-looking-deeper-into-kdps-portfolio/)\n\n[ Our Stories  Keurig Dr Pepper Announces Multi-Year Sponsorship of the Men's and Women's Mexican National Teams in the U.S.  Read More  ](https://keurigdrpepper.com/keurig-dr-pepper-announces-multi-year-sponsorship-of-the-mens-and-womens-mexican-national-teams-in-the-u-s/)\n\nPrevNext\n\n[ View More News ](https://keurigdrpepper.com/featured-news/)\n\n##  Search \n\n[ ](#)\n\nwhat are you looking for?

Specifically, through our Apple Pollinator Program, we partner with the IPM Institute and Cornell University’s Danforth Lab to promote safe pest management practices and habitat conservation techniques with apple farmers in upstate New York. The goal of the three-year program is to create a pathway for apple farmers to protect their harvest while also benefiting the local ecosystem and supporting native pollinators. This work assists apple farmers who supply to Mott’s, part of KDP’s family of brands and a provider of applesauce products. We are proud of the program’s results to date, and we know that opportunities to scale our impact are crucial to meeting our goals and restoring and protecting natural resources.\n\nThat’s why we applaud the state of New York for [awarding funding](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/during-climate-week-nyc-governor-hochul-announces-record-level-funding-awarded-new-york-farms) to a group of 10 apple farmers to support their efforts around regenerative agriculture. The grants will further enable these farmers to implement practices that support soil health on their farms, including cover cropping, improved pollinator habitats and buffer strips of vegetation in and around their orchards. Importantly, it will provide additional resources, beyond those provided by KDP, to implement practices that come at a cost to farmers to implement. This includes funding habitat enhancements identified in our Apple Pollinator Program, as well as broader conservation farming practices. Through collaborative action, KDP is proud to help take impact to the next level.\n\n“We are always looking for ways to support farmers to make the transition to more sustainable farming practices, which can result in increased costs for farmers,” said Whitney Kakos, Director of Supply Chain Sustainability at Keurig Dr Pepper. “I’m excited that this group of Mott’s farmers will now benefit from a combination of public and private funding to support their work and make their farms – part of our shared supply chain – more resilient in the future.”\n\nFor more information on how KDP is supporting apple farmers and native bee populations, please watch our video below.\n\n##  Related Stories \n\n[ Our Stories  Engage for Good: How Our Teams are Making a Difference  Read More  ](https://keurigdrpepper.com/engage-for-good-how-our-teams-are-making-a-difference/)\n\n[ Our Stories  Remarks by CEO Tim Cofer on the Agreement to Acquire GHOST  Read More  ](https://keurigdrpepper.com/remarks-by-ceo-tim-cofer-on-the-agreement-to-acquire-ghost/)\n\n[ Our Stories  Behind the Scenes of the GHOST Acquisition  Read More  ](https://keurigdrpepper.com/behind-the-scenes-of-the-ghost-acquisition/)\n\n[ Our Stories  Keurig Dr Pepper Ireland Facility to Reduce its Carbon Emissions by 100%  Read More  ](https://keurigdrpepper.com/keurig-dr-pepper-ireland-facility-to-reduce-its-carbon-emissions-by-100/)\n\n[ Our Stories  Regional Tastes – Looking Deeper into KDP’s Portfolio  Read More  ](https://keurigdrpepper.com/regional-tastes-looking-deeper-into-kdps-portfolio/)\n\n[ Our Stories  Keurig Dr Pepper Announces Multi-Year Sponsorship of the Men's and Women's Mexican National Teams in the U.S.  Read More  ](https://keurigdrpepper.com/keurig-dr-pepper-announces-multi-year-sponsorship-of-the-mens-and-womens-mexican-national-teams-in-the-u-s/)\n\nPrevNext\n\n[ View More News ](https://keurigdrpepper.com/featured-news/)\n\n##  Search \n\n[ ](#)\n\nwhat are you looking for?

GHOST Energy is one of the fastest-growing RTD energy brands and is characterized by its unique brand identity, distinctive flavors and packaging and strong consumer appeal. During the Company’s Q3 earnings call today, CEO Tim Cofer expanded on the deal, noting the following:\n\n![](https://keurigdrpepper.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Photo-1-1024x576.jpg)\n\n“We have reached an agreement to purchase a majority stake in GHOST this year, to be followed by the acquisition of the remainder of the business in the first half of 2028. This transaction strengthens our position in the attractive energy drink category and accelerates our portfolio evolution towards consumer-preferred and growth-accretive spaces.\n\nGHOST is young, versatile, and founder-led, with a nearly half a billion-dollar portfolio anchored by its leading energy drink, while also spanning supplements and an emerging presence in other LRB (liquid refreshment beverages) categories. The brand more than quadrupled in size over the last three years and remains one of the fastest growing in the energy category, thanks to its unique brand identity, distinctive flavors and packaging, cross-occasion appeal, and strong consumer engagement, including on-premise.\n\n![](https://keurigdrpepper.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Photo-2-1024x576.jpg)\n\nGHOST will complement KDP’s existing energy portfolio and substantially enhance our presence in the category. We see significant potential to further scale GHOST in collaboration with its founders, Dan Lourenco and Ryan Hughes, who will continue to lead the brand as part of KDP’s U.S. Refreshment Beverages unit. I’ve been very impressed with Dan and Ryan and their tremendous success to date. More importantly, I share their vision for strong growth in the years to come. Together, we plan to take GHOST to new heights as we build out KDP’s platform-based approach to the energy category.\n\nNow at $23 billion in size, energy remains one of the fastest growing, scaled categories in beverages, and enjoys multiple structural growth characteristics. These beverages satisfy a near-universal consumer need for energy and alertness, which is increasingly relevant in a world with significant demands on our time and attention. They appeal to consumers across all ages and demographics, including over-indexing to Genzennials. There is significant headroom for household penetration to grow versus other leading beverage categories. And, the category is still in the development stage of price pack architecture and channel diversity. All of these elements translate to a large total addressable market that we believe the category will grow into – and on which KDP is well-positioned to capitalize.\n\nAs energy drink consumption becomes more prevalent, the category is evolving to serve distinct consumer need states and occasions. This landscape lends itself nicely to a portfolio approach, which we have successfully employed in premium water to become the #2 share player. We are now using a similar playbook in energy, having accelerated our push into the category over the last 24 months with GHOST, C4, and Black Rifle energy. In addition to today’s GHOST announcement, we just signed a distribution agreement with Nutrabolt for Bloom RTD Energy. Bloom is a highly promising, emerging and distinctive beverage brand with a female-oriented skew. Together, each of these brands can work in complementary ways to address consumer needs, while driving greater scale in the category and across our DSD infrastructure.\n\n![]()\n\nBeyond its strategic merits, the GHOST transaction is another good example of how we approach efficient capital deployment. Through an elegant deal structure, we are capturing the growth opportunity and paving the way for compelling financial returns, while retaining manageable balance sheet leverage and aligning long-term incentives.\n\nOur chosen structure retains GHOST’s leadership team, reinforcing a unique element of KDP’s white space expansion strategy: our founder network. We work to keep visionary entrepreneurs at the helm of the brands they created while adding substantial scale and resources from KDP. In energy drinks, we have seen the value of this arrangement firsthand through our close relationship with Nutrabolt’s innovative leader, Doss Cunningham. With alignment and support from energy leaders like Doss, Dan and Ryan of GHOST, and others, we are building a formidable energy platform that will drive win-win outcomes for all involved.”\n\n##  Related Stories \n\n[ Our Stories  Engage for Good: How Our Teams are Making a Difference  Read More  ](https://keurigdrpepper.com/engage-for-good-how-our-teams-are-making-a-difference/)\n\n[ Our Stories  Our Impact at Scale: Funding Granted to Mott’s Apple Farmers by the State of New York  Read More  ](https://keurigdrpepper.com/our-impact-at-scale-funding-granted-to-motts-apple-farmers-by-the-state-of-new-york/)\n\n[ Our Stories  Behind the Scenes of the GHOST Acquisition  Read More  ](https://keurigdrpepper.com/behind-the-scenes-of-the-ghost-acquisition/)\n\n[ Our Stories  Keurig Dr Pepper Ireland Facility to Reduce its Carbon Emissions by 100%  Read More  ](https://keurigdrpepper.com/keurig-dr-pepper-ireland-facility-to-reduce-its-carbon-emissions-by-100/)\n\n[ Our Stories  Regional Tastes – Looking Deeper into KDP’s Portfolio  Read More  ](https://keurigdrpepper.com/regional-tastes-looking-deeper-into-kdps-portfolio/)\n\n[ Our Stories  Keurig Dr Pepper Announces Multi-Year Sponsorship of the Men's and Women's Mexican National Teams in the U.S.  Read More  ](https://keurigdrpepper.com/keurig-dr-pepper-announces-multi-year-sponsorship-of-the-mens-and-womens-mexican-national-teams-in-the-u-s/)\n\nPrevNext\n\n[ View More News ](https://keurigdrpepper.com/featured-news/)\n\n##  Search \n\n[ ](#)\n\nwhat are you looking for?

This deal is one of many ways KDP is delivering on its vision of a beverage for every need, anytime and anywhere. We reached out to KDP’s Chief Strategy Officer, Justin Whitmore, to learn more about how KDP fills in the white spaces in its portfolio and works with exciting new partners._\n\n**First, tell us about your team and your role at the company.**\n\nOur Enterprise Strategy team is always looking for new growth opportunities. A key focus of our work is shaping KDP’s “now and next beverage portfolio,” one of our strategic pillars. Every day, we look for compelling brands led by innovative entrepreneurs that compete in durable and attractive categories.\n\nWe identify high-potential trademarks through a process grounded in consumer insights, a deep understanding of the liquid refreshment beverage and coffee landscape, and the expertise of our business segment and functional leaders.\n\nOur work plays a crucial role in our enterprise capital allocation processes, where we apply a flexible buy/build/partner approach to identify the best options for beverage consumers. At times, we choose to innovate or renovate a product on our own; other times, we partner with another company, or we pursue an M&A opportunity like this one.\n\n**What drew you to GHOST?**\n\nWe have been competing in and closely examining the energy category for several years, and during this time, GHOST has emerged as a standout brand. It’s one of the fastest-growing names in the sector, featuring engaging packaging, a variety of exciting flavors, and a strong lifestyle positioning that resonates with consumers. Our investment creates a unique opportunity to leverage KDP’s capabilities and resources to enable broad reach and availability to a whole new wave of GHOST consumers.\n\nEqually as important, I believe the relationships we build with the founders and innovators of our partner businesses differentiate KDP’s portfolio shaping approach. We first met Dan and Ryan over a year ago, and we’ve been in conversation ever since–not only about the brand but also their insights on the category and evolving consumer preferences. We see an opportunity to create something special by combining their entrepreneurial spirit and vision with the power of KDP.\n\n**You mentioned GHOST’s founders, Daniel Lourenco and Ryan Hughes. How do you think about working with owners and entrepreneurs?**\n\nWe love partnering with the current and next generation of innovators to provide consumers with exactly what they want. The KDP model thrives when we connect with partners at the right moment in their journey and put an accelerator on distribution, production, merchandising, display activity and brand management, among many other capabilities.\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all partnership. Some partners come into KDP with their own sales and field teams, while others leverage our expertise to enhance in-store execution and displays. Our goal is to offer a seamless experience for our partners that extends all the way to the shopper’s cart.\n\nWe also keep founders engaged in the ongoing success of their brands by utilizing various deal structures to create win-win arrangements.\n\n**What role will GHOST play in your energy portfolio?**\n\nThe energy category continues to evolve to meet distinct consumer needs and occasions, and we see an opportunity to adopt a platform approach. Our strategy focuses on brands that complement each other, address specific consumer needs, generate scale across the category, and leverage our omni-channel route-to-market capabilities.\n\nFor example, we can offer consumers C4 Energy, a leading trademark in performance energy, known for its strong functional efficacy. GHOST has cultivated a lifestyle positioning with bold, flavor-forward products that are popular in gaming, social settings, and music festivals. Black Rifle Energy presents a compelling option for everyday consumers, particularly in convenience stores across the country.\n\nI’m also excited to share that we recently signed a sales and distribution deal for Bloom’s ready-to-drink energy beverages, which will have a female-forward positioning. We were impressed by the standout launch it had at Target this summer.\n\nOverall, we feel optimistic about the portfolio approach we are taking within the energy category, and we see a bright future ahead for KDP and our partners.\n\n##  Related Stories \n\n[ Our Stories  Engage for Good: How Our Teams are Making a Difference  Read More  ](https://keurigdrpepper.com/engage-for-good-how-our-teams-are-making-a-difference/)\n\n[ Our Stories  Our Impact at Scale: Funding Granted to Mott’s Apple Farmers by the State of New York  Read More  ](https://keurigdrpepper.com/our-impact-at-scale-funding-granted-to-motts-apple-farmers-by-the-state-of-new-york/)\n\n[ Our Stories  Remarks by CEO Tim Cofer on the Agreement to Acquire GHOST  Read More  ](https://keurigdrpepper.com/remarks-by-ceo-tim-cofer-on-the-agreement-to-acquire-ghost/)\n\n[ Our Stories  Keurig Dr Pepper Ireland Facility to Reduce its Carbon Emissions by 100%  Read More  ](https://keurigdrpepper.com/keurig-dr-pepper-ireland-facility-to-reduce-its-carbon-emissions-by-100/)\n\n[ Our Stories  Regional Tastes – Looking Deeper into KDP’s Portfolio  Read More  ](https://keurigdrpepper.com/regional-tastes-looking-deeper-into-kdps-portfolio/)\n\n[ Our Stories  Keurig Dr Pepper Announces Multi-Year Sponsorship of the Men's and Women's Mexican National Teams in the U.S.  Read More  ](https://keurigdrpepper.com/keurig-dr-pepper-announces-multi-year-sponsorship-of-the-mens-and-womens-mexican-national-teams-in-the-u-s/)\n\nPrevNext\n\n[ View More News ](https://keurigdrpepper.com/featured-news/)\n\n##  Search \n\n[ ](#)\n\nwhat are you looking for?
