PCIe Gen 7 doubles data transfer speeds, enabling continued scaling of compute fabrics inside accelerated server platforms, general-purpose servers, CXL systems and disaggregated infrastructure. Building on its widely deployed PAM4 technology and utilizing its industry-leading accelerated infrastructure silicon platform, Marvell has developed the industry's most comprehensive interconnect portfolio addressing all high-bandwidth optical and copper connections in AI data centers. This innovative portfolio empowers cloud data center operators to optimize their infrastructure for their specific architectures and workloads to meet the exponential demands of AI.\n\nMarvell pioneered PAM4 technology over a decade ago and leads the industry in PAM4 interconnect shipments. Today, most of the optical interconnects used in data center backend and frontend networks are based on PAM4 technology. As compared to PCIe Gen 5, which was based on NRZ modulation, PCIe Gen 6 and 7 require the use of PAM4 modulation. With its recent [PCIe Gen 6 retimer announcement](https://www.marvell.com/company/newsroom/marvell-expands-connectivity-portfolio-pcie-retimer-scale-compute-fabrics-accelerated-infrastructure.html) and this PCIe Gen 7 demonstration, Marvell extends its industry-leading PAM4-based optical and copper interconnect portfolio beyond Ethernet and InfiniBand into copper and optical PCIe, CXL and proprietary compute fabric links.\n\nThe increasing performance of processors and accelerators combined with the growing size of AI clusters is prompting the need for greater bandwidth speed and capacity. PCIe Gen 7 will enable larger volumes of data to be exchanged between processors to reduce the cost, time and energy required for training or inference. PCIe is the industry standard for inside-server-system connections between CPUs, GPUs, AI accelerators, and other server components. AI models are doubling their computation requirements every six months and are now the primary driver of the PCIe roadmap, with PCIe Gen 7 becoming a requirement.\n\n\"AI workloads are driving the evolution of server interconnects, and our PCIe Gen 7 technology is engineered to meet the performance and scalability needs of next-generation AI data centers,\" said Venu Balasubramonian, vice president of product marketing, Connectivity Business Unit at Marvell. \"Our leadership in PAM4 SerDes technology in advanced process nodes enables us to deliver superior performance, low latency, and industry-leading performance, power and latency, providing a critical foundation for accelerated infrastructure.\"\n\nPCIe Gen 7, operating at 128 gigatransfers per second (GT/s) per lane, enables AI and ML workloads to scale across compute fabrics. It delivers the high performance, low latency, and energy efficiency needed to power next-generation AI clusters, high-performance computing (HPC) systems, and cloud data centers.\n\nMarvell PCIe Gen 7 SerDes is designed using 3nm fabrication technology enabling lower power consumption while delivering superior reach and link margins, that are critical for emerging AI super clusters. SerDes and parallel interconnects serve as high-speed pathways for exchanging data between chips. A rack in a hyperscale data center can contain up to tens of thousands of SerDes links.\n\n**Extending PAM4 Leadership** Leveraging its PAM4 SerDes technology leadership and its comprehensive data infrastructure IP, Marvell has created a state-of-the-art connectivity platform that enables leading cloud data center operators to optimize their infrastructure for their unique architectures and workloads. In 2023, Marvell introduced the [Marvell® Nova DSP](https://www.marvell.com/products/pam-dsp.html), the industry's first 1.6T PAM4 DSP. Marvell has also introduced integrated PAM4 DSPs ([Marvell® Perseus](https://www.marvell.com/products/pam-dsp.html)) and DSPs optimized for efficiency ([Marvell® Spica Gen2-T](https://www.marvell.com/products/pam-dsp.html)) to serve the broadening spectrum of cloud data center link types and use cases. PAM4 technology is also the foundation of the [Marvell® Alaska® A DSP](https://www.marvell.com/products/ethernet-phys.html) chips optimized for active electrical cable (AEC) applications.\n\n**Marvell at the 2024 OCP Global Summit** Join Marvell in booth B1 at the 2024 OCP Global Summit, October 15-17, in San Jose, California. \n\n**About Marvell** To deliver the data infrastructure technology that connects the world, we're building solutions on the most powerful foundation: our partnerships with our customers.

          "content": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\nTo our Stockholders\nMarvell executed well in fiscal 2024 as we delivered total revenue of $5.5 billion and continued\nto transform the company to capitalize on the semiconductor industry’s most compelling growth\nopportunities. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is driving a generational change in data center\narchitecture, and Marvell is one of the key enablers of this shift.\nAs customers increasingly allocate spend to ensure their infrastructure supports AI workloads,\nthe demand for Marvell’s data center products — including custom silicon, optical connectivity,\nand switching — has surged. As a result, our Data Center revenue grew from about one-third of\nMarvell’s total revenue at the start of the year to more than half as we exited the fiscal fourth\nquarter. AI-related revenue more than tripled from approximately 3% in FY23 to more than 10%\nof total company revenue in FY24.\n“AI is the most data-\nhungry workload the In addition to the growth of our Data Center business, in fiscal year 2024 our Automotive\nrevenue grew annually as we continued to win new business across a broad swath of\nworld has ever seen,\nautomotive OEMs. These customers rely on a growing number of Ethernet-connected\nand it requires leading- endpoints to increase bandwidth and connect an array of computing functions within their\nvehicles and to the cloud.\nedge solutions to\nWhile our Data Center and Automotive businesses grew in fiscal year 2024, our Carrier\nrapidly move, store,\nInfrastructure end market experienced a global softening in demand as customers slowed their\nprocess, and secure 5G deployments and reduced Capex. At the same time, Marvell’s Enterprise Networking\nbusiness experienced the impact of a global slowdown in IT spending. Despite these cyclical\nmassive amounts of\ntrends, our Carrier and Enterprise businesses serve large and enduring end markets that are\ndata. This essential to the global economy, and we expect customer demand for our leading-edge\nproducts to resume.\naccelerated\ninfrastructure will Controlling our destiny\nIn a year marked by shifts and disruptions in the semiconductor industry, we focused on\nenable a generational\ncontrolling our destiny by reallocating our resources to accelerate our product roadmaps and\nchange in data center seize opportunities related to AI in the Data Center. We also committed to reduce operating\nexpenses and improve non-GAAP gross margin throughout the year, and we delivered on those\narchitecture, and\ncommitments. In addition, we paid down debt and refinanced remaining portions with more\nMarvell is strongly favorable terms. We drove significant improvement in cash flow in the second half of the fiscal\nyear and restarted our share repurchase program. Overall, Marvell returned $357 million to\npositioned at the Stockholders in fiscal year 2024 through dividends and stock repurchases. In addition, Marvell’s\nBoard of Directors recently authorized adding $3 billion to the company’s existing stock\ncenter of it.”\nrepurchase program, which had approximately $300 million remaining at the end of fiscal year\n2024. This $3 billion increase is the largest repurchase authorization in our history.\nMarvell’s transformation continues to pay off\nAI has been the catalyst necessitating the extraordinary capabilities of Accelerated Computing\nand, more specifically, Accelerated Infrastructure. AI demands new levels of computational\nmuscle, provided by GPUs and multiple types of customized accelerators. These accelerators\nrepresent a stark departure from traditional computing architectures that for decades were\ncharacterized by standard servers and CPUs. In fact, AI requires the power of thousands and\neven tens of thousands of computing systems in one or more connected data centers. AI is the\nmost data-hungry workload the world has ever seen, and it requires leading-edge solutions to\nrapidly move, store, process, and secure the massive amounts of data that these systems use\nand produce.\nMarvell Technology, Inc. 2024 Proxy Statement\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThis is where Marvell plays a critical role. We specialize in building the Accelerated Infrastructure — the connectivity and compute — that are\nnecessary for Accelerated Computing. In many ways, Marvell was built for this opportunity. Our portfolio includes optical connectivity solutions\nthat provide ultra-high bandwidth and low latency. Bolstered by Marvell’s acquisitions of Inphi and Innovium in 2020 and 2021, respectively, we\nhave solidified our position as a leader in high-speed connectivity and electro-optics. In fact, this aspect of our Data Center business was a key\nreason that our AI-related revenue surpassed a $200 million quarterly run rate by the end of fiscal year 2024.\nIn addition, Marvell has established itself as a leader in providing cutting-edge compute platforms that enable customers to push the boundaries\nof AI and cloud workloads in unique ways. Following Marvell’s acquisition of Cavium in 2018, we made a commitment to be a leader in\naccelerated compute silicon and recognized the need to have an advanced-node platform and an experienced team of people capable of\ncollaborating with customers to develop tailored solutions that meet their unique needs. To this end, in 2019 we acquired Avera Semiconductor,\nthe ASIC business of GLOBALFOUNDRIES, which expanded Marvell’s custom development capability. Subsequently, in 2021, we introduced\nour custom compute strategy and platform with products that are currently transitioning into production and are expected to fuel significant\ngrowth in fiscal years 2025 and 2026.\nWhile we have built our strategic capabilities through a series of highly successful acquisitions, concurrently, we have excelled at organic\ninnovation and become an industry leader in process technology, executing multiple 5nm designs in recent years and are now deeply engaged\nwith cloud customers on many 3nm opportunities. In March 2024 we extended our collaboration with TSMC to develop the industry’s first\ntechnology platform to produce 2nm semiconductors optimized for the demands of AI.\nBeing recognized as a Great Place to Work\nAt Marvell, we know that our people are the essence of our company. Not only are our employees our most important competitive advantage,\nthey bring to life a workplace and culture that we can all be proud of as they engage with each other and our customers, partners, investors and\nother stakeholders.\nMarvell’s culture and workplace continues to garner external recognition. Among several honors over the past year, we were excited to be\ncertified as a Great Place to Work® in the US. This recognition is particularly meaningful because it is based solely on the feedback provided by\nour current employees about their experience working at Marvell. In addition, Marvell was named one of Glassdoor’s “Best Places to Work in\n2023,” and Forbes and Fortune recognized our company on their lists of “World’s Best Employers in 2023” and “Best Workplaces to Work in the\nBay Area 2023,” respectively. The tech recruiting platform Built In also named Marvell one of the top 100 Best Large Places to Work in the San\nFrancisco Bay Area.\nWhile we are proud of this recognition, we always seek ways to improve. For instance, in fiscal 2024, Marvell increased its mental health care\nofferings for our employees with a focus on individual care that suits their personal preferences and lifestyles. We also expanded our family\nplanning and health care benefits, such as increased adoption and surrogacy reimbursements and fertility coverage in the US, along with\nextended family leave at our sites globally.\nOur commitment to treating people with respect and acting with integrity guides everything we do as a company. Integral to that is our focus on\ncreating an inclusive, diverse and open culture. A particular area of emphasis has been on helping women develop in their careers at Marvell\nand in the semiconductor industry as a whole. We have an inclusion network called Women@Marvell that is active in all regions of the world,\nwith more than 20 chapters and 700 members. In fiscal 2024, we launched two highly successful mentoring programs for women globally at\nMarvell.\nOur commitment to transparency and openness at Marvell is reinforced through various channels of employee feedback. One significant\nmethod is our Ethical Culture Survey, which was last conducted in 2023 and involved all employees. The insights gained from this survey\nhighlighted Marvell’s deep commitment to having a collaborative and respectful culture and doing the right thing. We also have high ethical\nstandards governing the way we conduct our business externally, including the expectations we have of our suppliers and business partners.\nMaking a difference\nAt Marvell, we are not only committed to doing our part to transform the world with innovative technologies, we also aspire to make a difference\nby virtue of the way we contribute to our communities and the environment. When it comes to environmental sustainability, in fiscal year 2024\nwe developed a plan to reduce companywide greenhouse gas emissions, and our plan was validated by the Science Based Targets initiative.\nWe have also continued to work with our customers and suppliers to drive positive actions related to climate change.\nIn addition, we are committed to giving back to the communities where we operate and to broader causes that our employees deem important\nand worthwhile. For example, as a company, we offer employer-matching contributions and provide paid time off for employees who volunteer\nfor causes they believe in.\nLooking to the future\nThis is a very exciting time to be in the semiconductor industry as technology continues to transform the world. As I’ve described, we are\ncurrently experiencing a massive transformation that is fundamentally changing data center architectures. At Marvell, we anticipated this change\nand spent the past several years preparing for it through organic growth and strategic acquisitions. Now those efforts are paying off, and in an\nincreasingly big way. In fact, because of AI and the need for Accelerated Infrastructure, our opportunity is even bigger than we expected. We\nhave been very thoughtful in building our portfolio and capabilities, and now Marvell is meeting the AI opportunity with leading solutions to\nenable Accelerated Computing with the power and efficiency of Accelerated Infrastructure.\nIn closing, I want to extend my heartfelt gratitude to Rick Hill, who, in fiscal year 2024, retired as Chairman of the Marvell Board — a position he\nheld since April 2016. Rick played a pivotal role in Marvell’s multi-year transformation, including the recruitment of me and other members of our\nmanagement team. Anyone who has benefited from Marvell’s success and growth in recent years can be grateful for his many contributions to\nthis company, and I am honored to follow him in the role of Chairman.\nMarvell Technology, Inc. 2024 Proxy Statement\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFinally, I want to thank all of you who have invested in Marvell for the confidence you have had in our company. We are proud of the many\nthings we have achieved and more confident than ever that our future has the potential to be truly extraordinary.\nMatt Murphy\nChairman and CEO\nThis letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws that involve risks and uncertainties.

All rights reserved. 20\nDiscussion of Non-GAAP financial measures\nNon-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition and divestiture-related costs, restructuring and other related\ncharges (including, but not limited to, asset impairment charges, employee severance costs, and facilities related charges), resolution of legal matters, and certain expenses and benefits that are driven primarily\nby discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to Marvell’s core business. Although Marvell excludes the amortization of all acquired intangible assets from these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase price accounting arising from acquisitions, and that such amortization\nof intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to Marvell’s\nrevenues earned during the periods presented and are expected to contribute to Marvell’s future period revenues as well.\nMarvell uses a non-GAAP tax rate to compute the non-GAAP tax provision. This non-GAAP tax rate is based on Marvell’s estimated annual GAAP income tax forecast, adjusted to account for items excluded from\nMarvell’s non-GAAP income, as well as the effects of significant non-recurring and period specific tax items which vary in size and frequency, and excludes tax deductions and benefits from acquired tax loss and\ncredit carryforwards and changes in valuation allowance on acquired deferred tax assets. Marvell’s non-GAAP tax rate is determined on an annual basis and may be adjusted during the year to take into account\nevents that may materially affect the non-GAAP tax rate such as tax law changes; acquisitions; significant changes in Marvell’s geographic mix of revenue and expenses; or changes to Marvell’s corporate\nstructure. For the second quarter of fiscal 2025, a non-GAAP tax rate of 7.0% has been applied to the non-GAAP financial results.\nMarvell believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides important supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to Marvell’s\nfinancial condition and results of operations. While Marvell uses non-GAAP financial measures as a tool to enhance its understanding of certain aspects of its financial performance, Marvell does not consider\nthese measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Consistent with this approach, Marvell believes that disclosing non-GAAP financial measures to the\nreaders of its financial statements provides such readers with useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for GAAP financial measures, allows for greater transparency in the review of its financial and\noperational performance.\nExternally, management believes that investors may find Marvell’s non-GAAP financial measures useful in their assessment of Marvell’s operating performance and the valuation of Marvell. Internally, Marvell’s\nnon-GAAP financial measures are used in the following areas:\n▪ Management’s evaluation of Marvell’s operating performance;\n▪ Management’s establishment of internal operating budgets;\n▪ Management’s performance comparisons with internal forecasts and targeted business models; and\n▪ Management’s determination of the achievement and measurement of certain performance-based equity awards (adjustments may vary from award to award).\nNon-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with the operations of Marvell’s business as determined in accordance with GAAP. As a result, you should not\nconsider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Marvell’s results as reported under GAAP. The exclusion of the above items from our GAAP financial metrics does not necessarily mean that\nthese costs are unusual or infrequent.\n© 2024 Marvell.

(NASDAQ: MRVL), a leader in data infrastructure semiconductor solutions, today reported financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025.\n\nNet revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was $1.273 billion, $23.0 million above the mid-point of the Company's guidance provided on May 30, 2024. GAAP net loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was $(193.3) million, or $(0.22) per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was $266.2 million, or $0.30 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $306.4 million.\n\n\"Marvell's second quarter revenue grew 10% sequentially, above the mid-point of guidance driven by strong demand from AI. We saw strong growth from our electro-optics products and our custom AI programs began to ramp,\" said Matt Murphy, Marvell's Chairman and CEO. \"Next quarter, we expect our combined enterprise networking and carrier end markets to return to growth, while our data center end market growth accelerates. As a result, for the third quarter of fiscal 2025, we expect all our end markets to grow sequentially, with consolidated revenue forecasted to grow 14% sequentially at the mid-point, accompanied by a significant increase in operating leverage.\"\n\n**Third Quarter of Fiscal 2025 Financial Outlook**\n\n  * Net revenue is expected to be $1.450 billion +/- 5%.\n  * GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 47.2%.\n  * Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 61%.\n  * GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $693 million.\n  * Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $465 million.\n  * Basic weighted-average shares outstanding are expected to be 867 million.\n  * Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding are expected to be 875 million.\n  * GAAP diluted loss per share is expected to be $(0.09) +/- $0.05 per share.\n  * Non-GAAP diluted income per share is expected to be $0.40 +/- $0.05 per share.\n\n\n\nGAAP diluted EPS is calculated using basic weighted-average shares outstanding when there is a GAAP net loss, and calculated using diluted weighted-average shares outstanding when there is a GAAP net income. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is calculated using diluted weighted-average shares outstanding.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nMarvell will conduct a conference call on Thursday, August 29, 2024 at 1:45 p.m. Pacific Time to discuss results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. Interested parties may join the conference call without operator assistance by registering and entering their phone number at https://emportal.ink/4bYingS to receive an instant automated call back.

The call will be webcast and can be accessed at the Marvell Investor Relations website at <http://investor.marvell.com/>. A replay of the call can be accessed by dialing 1-888-660-6345 or 1-646-517-4150, passcode 45397# until Thursday, September 5, 2024.\n\n**Discussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nNon-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition and divestiture-related costs, restructuring and other related charges (including, but not limited to, asset impairment charges, employee severance costs, and facilities related charges), resolution of legal matters, and certain expenses and benefits that are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to Marvell's core business. Although Marvell excludes the amortization of all acquired intangible assets from these non-GAAP financial measures, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase price accounting arising from acquisitions, and that such amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to Marvell's revenues earned during the periods presented and are expected to contribute to Marvell's future period revenues as well.\n\nMarvell uses a non-GAAP tax rate to compute the non-GAAP tax provision. This non-GAAP tax rate is based on Marvell's estimated annual GAAP income tax forecast, adjusted to account for items excluded from Marvell's non-GAAP income, as well as the effects of significant non-recurring and period specific tax items which vary in size and frequency, and excludes tax deductions and benefits from acquired tax loss and credit carryforwards and changes in valuation allowance on acquired deferred tax assets. Marvell's non-GAAP tax rate is determined on an annual basis and may be adjusted during the year to take into account events that may materially affect the non-GAAP tax rate such as tax law changes; acquisitions; significant changes in Marvell's geographic mix of revenue and expenses; or changes to Marvell's corporate structure. For the second quarter of fiscal 2025, a non-GAAP tax rate of 7.0% has been applied to the non-GAAP financial results.\n\nMarvell believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides important supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to Marvell's financial condition and results of operations. While Marvell uses non-GAAP financial measures as a tool to enhance its understanding of certain aspects of its financial performance, Marvell does not consider these measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Consistent with this approach, Marvell believes that disclosing non-GAAP financial measures to the readers of its financial statements provides such readers with useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for GAAP financial measures, allows for greater transparency in the review of its financial and operational performance.\n\nExternally, management believes that investors may find Marvell's non-GAAP financial measures useful in their assessment of Marvell's operating performance and the valuation of Marvell. Internally, Marvell's non-GAAP financial measures are used in the following areas:\n\n  * Management's evaluation of Marvell's operating performance;\n  * Management's establishment of internal operating budgets;\n  * Management's performance comparisons with internal forecasts and targeted business models; and\n  * Management's determination of the achievement and measurement of certain performance-based equity awards (adjustments may vary from award to award).\n\n\n\nNon-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with the operations of Marvell's business as determined in accordance with GAAP. As a result, you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Marvell's results as reported under GAAP. The exclusion of the above items from our GAAP financial metrics does not necessarily mean that these costs are unusual or infrequent.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), which are subject to the \"safe harbor\" created by those sections.

All rights reserved. 20\nDiscussion of Non-GAAP financial measures\nNon-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of the inventory fair value adjustment associated with acquisitions, amortization of acquired intangible assets,\nacquisition and divestiture-related costs, restructuring and other related charges (including, but not limited to, asset impairment charges, employee severance costs, and facilities related charges), resolution of\nlegal matters, and certain expenses and benefits that are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to Marvell’s core business. Although Marvell excludes the\namortization of all acquired intangible assets from these non-GAAP financial measures, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of\npurchase price accounting arising from acquisitions, and that such amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized.\nInvestors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to Marvell’s revenues earned during the periods presented and are expected to contribute to Marvell’s future period revenues as well.\nMarvell uses a non-GAAP tax rate to compute the non-GAAP tax provision. This non-GAAP tax rate is based on Marvell’s estimated annual GAAP income tax forecast, adjusted to account for items excluded from\nMarvell’s non-GAAP income, as well as the effects of significant non-recurring and period specific tax items which vary in size and frequency, and excludes tax deductions and benefits from acquired tax loss and\ncredit carryforwards and changes in valuation allowance on acquired deferred tax assets. Marvell’s non-GAAP tax rate is determined on an annual basis and may be adjusted during the year to take into account\nevents that may materially affect the non-GAAP tax rate such as tax law changes; acquisitions; significant changes in Marvell’s geographic mix of revenue and expenses; or changes to Marvell’s corporate\nstructure. For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, a non-GAAP tax rate of 7.0% has been applied to the non-GAAP financial results.\nMarvell believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides important supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to Marvell’s\nfinancial condition and results of operations. While Marvell uses non-GAAP financial measures as a tool to enhance its understanding of certain aspects of its financial performance, Marvell does not consider\nthese measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Consistent with this approach, Marvell believes that disclosing non-GAAP financial measures to the\nreaders of its financial statements provides such readers with useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for GAAP financial measures, allows for greater transparency in the review of its financial and\noperational performance.\nExternally, management believes that investors may find Marvell’s non-GAAP financial measures useful in their assessment of Marvell’s operating performance and the valuation of Marvell. Internally, Marvell’s\nnon-GAAP financial measures are used in the following areas:\n§ Management’s evaluation of Marvell’s operating performance;\n§ Management’s establishment of internal operating budgets;\n§ Management’s performance comparisons with internal forecasts and targeted business models; and\n§ Management’s determination of the achievement and measurement of certain performance-based equity awards (adjustments may vary from award to award).\nNon-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with the operations of Marvell’s business as determined in accordance with GAAP. As a result, you should not\nconsider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Marvell’s results as reported under GAAP. The exclusion of the above items from our GAAP financial metrics does not necessarily mean that\nthese costs are unusual or infrequent.\n© 2024 Marvell.
