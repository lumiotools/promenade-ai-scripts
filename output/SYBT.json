CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)\n(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Stock Yards Bancorp, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Stock\nYards Bank & Trust Company. The condensed consolidated financial statements in this report have not been audited by the Company’s independent registered\npublic accounting firm, but in the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position and the result of operations for the\ninterim periods have been made. All such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature and all intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nTo prepare the condensed consolidated financial statements, management must make estimates and assumptions that may require difficult, complex or\nsubjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in\nfacts and circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates, and the results of operations for the three and nine month periods ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 do not necessarily indicate the results that Bancorp will achieve for the year ended December 31, 2024, or any other interim period.\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and with the rules and\nregulations for Form 10-Q as adopted by the SEC. Accordingly, the condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and notes\nrequired by GAAP for complete financial statements and should be read in conjunction with Bancorp’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, which\ncontain the latest audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.\nAdoption of New Accounting Guidance – Bancorp continually monitors potential accounting pronouncements and evaluates the impact that adoption of new\nguidance will have on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-02, “Investments – Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit\nStructures Using the Proportional Amortization Method.” The amendments in this update permit reporting entities to elect to account for their tax equity\ninvestments using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met, regardless of the tax credit program from which the related income tax\ncredits are received. The amendments also allow for making the election to apply the proportional amortization method on a tax-credit-program-by-tax-credit-\nprogram basis, as opposed to applying this method at the reporting entity level or to individual investments. Further, the amendments of this ASU remove\ncertain guidance for Qualified Affordable Housing Project investments and require the application of the delayed equity contribution guidance to all tax equity\ninvestments. The amendments of this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and must be applied on either a modified\nretrospective or a retrospective basis.\nBancorp adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2024 using the modified retrospective basis. The impact of adoption was measured as of January 1, 2024 and\nresulted in a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. This adjustment ultimately increased total stockholders equity by $2.5 million and\nincluded the write-off of DTAs for qualified tax credit investments. Also as a result of adoption, Bancorp began booking related tax credit amortization expense\nas a component of income tax expense effective January 1, 2024, which had previously been recorded as a component of non-interest expenses. No prior\nperiods presented were impacted as a result of adopting ASU 2023-02.\nAccounting Standards Updates – Generally, if an issued but not yet effective ASU with an expected immaterial impact to Bancorp has been disclosed in prior\nSEC filings, it will not be re-disclosed.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.” The amendments in\nthis update improve financial reporting by requiring disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis for all public entities to\nenable investors to develop more decision-useful financial analyses. The amendments in this update do not change how a public entity identifies its operating\nsegments, aggregates those operating segments, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. The amendments of this ASU are\neffective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Adoption of this ASU\nis not expected to have a material impact on Bancorp’s consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.” The amendments in this update\naddress investor requests for more transparency about income tax information through improvements to income tax disclosures, primarily related to effective\ntax rate reconciliation and information related to income taxes paid, among certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of such disclosures. The\namendments of this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 and are to be applied on a prospective basis. Adoption of this ASU is\nnot expected to have a material impact on Bancorp’s consolidated financial statements.\n11\nTable of Contents\n(2) Investment Securities\nDebt securities purchased in which Bancorp has the intent and ability to hold to their maturity are classified as HTM securities. All other investment securities\nare classified as AFS securities.\nAFS Debt Securities\nThe following table summarizes the amortized cost, unrealized gains and losses, and fair value of Bancorp’s AFS debt securities portfolio:\n(in thousands) Amortized Unrealized\nSeptember 30, 2024 cost Gains Losses Fair value\nU.S. Treasury and other U.S. Government obligations $ 19,999 $ - $ (33) $ 19,966\nGovernment sponsored enterprise obligations 90,295 127 (3,527) 86,895\nMortgage backed securities - government agencies 714,538 253 (82,543) 632,248\nObligations of states and political subdivisions 130,055 5 (10,863) 119,197\nOther 3,719 - (193) 3,526\nTotal available for sale debt securities $ 958,606 $ 385 $ (97,159) $ 861,832\nDecember 31, 2023\nU.S. Treasury and other U.S. Government obligations $ 119,931 $ - $ (3,662) $ 116,269\nGovernment sponsored enterprise obligations 104,677 157 (4,987) 99,847\nMortgage backed securities - government agencies 789,145 83 (101,189) 688,039\nObligations of states and political subdivisions 136,579 5 (13,094) 123,490\nOther 3,821 - (287) 3,534\nTotal available for sale debt securities $ 1,154,153 $ 245 $ (123,219) $ 1,031,179\nHTM Debt Securities\nThe following table summarizes the amortized cost, unrecognized gains and losses, and fair value of Bancorp’s HTM debt securities portfolio:\n(in thousands) Carrying Unrecognized\nSeptember 30, 2024 value Gains Losses Fair value\nU.S. Treasury and other U.S. Government obligations $ 153,692 $ - $ (1,539) $ 152,153\nGovernment sponsored enterprise obligations 25,726 - (1,478) 24,248\nMortgage backed securities - government agencies 195,494 3 (19,468) 176,029\nTotal held to maturity debt securities $ 374,912 $ 3 $ (22,485) $ 352,430\nDecember 31, 2023\nU.S. Treasury and other U.S. Government obligations $ 203,259 $ - $ (4,932) $ 198,327\nGovernment sponsored enterprise obligations 26,918 - (2,457) 24,461\nMortgage backed securities - government agencies 209,660 1 (23,930) 185,731\nTotal held to maturity debt securities $ 439,837 $ 1 $ (31,319) $ 408,519\nAll investment securities classified as HTM by Bancorp as of September 30, 2024 are obligations of the U.S. Government and/or are issued by U.S.\nGovernment-sponsored agencies and have an implicit or explicit government guarantee. Therefore, no ACL has been recorded for Bancorp’s HTM securities as\nof September 30, 2024. Further, as of September 30, 2024, none of Bancorp’s HTM securities were in non-accrual or past due status.\n12\nTable of Contents\nDebt Securities by Contractual Maturity\nA summary of AFS and HTM debt securities by contractual maturity as of September 30, 2024 follows:\nAFS Debt Securities HTM Debt Securities\n(in thousands) Amortized cost Fair value Carrying value Fair value\nDue within one year $ 25,215 $ 25,144 $ 151,741 $ 150,265\nDue after one year but within five years 35,528 34,296 2,644 2,565\nDue after five years but within 10 years 94,000 84,166 24,542 23,092\nDue after 10 years 89,325 85,978 491 479\nMortgage backed securities - government agencies 714,538 632,248 195,494 176,029\nTotal $ 958,606 $ 861,832 $ 374,912 $ 352,430\nActual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because some issuers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties.\nThe investment portfolio includes MBS, which are guaranteed by agencies such as FHLMC, FNMA and GNMA. These securities differ from traditional debt\nsecurities primarily in that they may have uncertain principal payment dates and are priced based on estimated prepayment rates on the underlying collateral.\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no holdings of debt securities of any one issuer, other than the U.S. government and its agencies, in\nan amount greater than 10% of stockholders’ equity.\nAccrued interest on the investment securities portfolio (AFS and HTM) totaled $4 million and $6 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. Accrued interest receivable on the investment securities portfolios is included in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nSecurities with a carrying value of $834 million and $991 million were pledged at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, to secure accounts\nof commercial depositors in cash management accounts, public deposits and uninsured cash balances for certain WM&T accounts.\nBased on an evaluation of available information including security type, counterparty credit quality, past events, current conditions, and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts that are relevant to collectability, Bancorp has concluded that it expects to receive all contractual cash flows from each security held in its\nAFS and HTM debt securities portfolio. As such, no allowance or impairment was recorded with respect to investment securities as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023.\n13\nTable of Contents\nUnrealized and Unrecognized Loss Analysis on Debt Securities\nDebt securities with unrealized and unrecognized losses at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, aggregated by investment category and length of time\nsecurities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position follows:\nAFS Debt Securities\nLess than 12 months 12 months or more Total\n(in thousands) Fair Unrealized Fair Unrealized Fair Unrealized\nSeptember 30, 2024 value losses value losses value losses\nU.S. Treasury and other U.S. Government\nobligations $ - $ - $ 19,966 $ (33) $ 19,966 $ (33)\nGovernment sponsored enterprise\nobligations 5,916 (16) 77,159 (3,511) 83,075 (3,527)\nMortgage-backed securities - government\nagencies - - 607,428 (82,543) 607,428 (82,543)\nObligations of states and political\nsubdivisions 7,751 (69) 100,646 (10,794) 108,397 (10,863)\nOther - - 3,526 (193) 3,526 (193)\nTotal AFS debt securities $ 13,667 $ (85) $ 808,725 $ (97,074) $ 822,392 $ (97,159)\nDecember 31, 2023\nU.S. Treasury and other U.S. Government\nobligations $ - $ - $ 116,269 $ (3,662) $ 116,269 $ (3,662)\nGovernment sponsored enterprise\nobligations - - 83,675 (4,987) 83,675 (4,987)\nMortgage-backed securities - government\nagencies 16,346 (95) 661,195 (101,094) 677,541 (101,189)\nObligations of states and political\nsubdivisions 6,326 (64) 105,179 (13,030) 111,505 (13,094)\nOther - - 3,534 (287) 3,534 (287)\nTotal AFS debt securities $ 22,672 $ (159) $ 969,852 $ (123,060) $ 992,524 $ (123,219)\nHTM Debt Securities\nLess than 12 months 12 months or more Total\n(in thousands) Fair Unrecognized Fair Unrecognized Fair Unrecognized\nSeptember 30, 2024 value losses value losses value losses\nU.S. Treasury and other U.S. Government\nobligations $ - $ - $ 152,153 $ (1,539) $ 152,153 $ (1,539)\nGovernment sponsored enterprise\nobligations 402 (4) 23,825 (1,474) 24,227 (1,478)\nMortgage-backed securities - government\nagencies - - 175,821 (19,468) 175,821 (19,468)\nTotal HTM debt securities $ 402 $ (4) $ 351,799 $ (22,481) $ 352,201 $ (22,485)\nDecember 31, 2023\nU.S. Treasury and other U.S. Government\nobligations $ - $ - $ 198,327 $ (4,932) $ 198,327 $ (4,932)\nGovernment sponsored enterprise\nobligations 455 (1) 23,967 (2,456) 24,422 (2,457)\nMortgage-backed securities - government\nagencies - - 185,504 (23,930) 185,504 (23,930)\nTotal HTM debt securities $ 455 $ (1) $ 407,798 $ (31,318) $ 408,253 $ (31,319)\n14\nTable of Contents\nApplicable dates for determining when securities are in unrealized and unrecognized loss positions are September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As such, it\nis possible that a security had a market value lower than its amortized cost on other days during the past 12 months, but is not in the “Less than 12 months”\ncategory of the preceding table.\nFor debt securities with unrealized and unrecognized loss positions, Bancorp evaluates the securities to determine whether the decline in the fair value below\nthe amortized cost basis (impairment) is due to credit-related factors or non-credit related factors. Any impairment that is not credit-related is recognized in\nAOCI, net of tax. Credit-related impairment is recognized as an ACL for debt securities on the balance sheet, limited to the amount by which the amortized cost\nbasis exceeds the fair value, with a corresponding adjustment to earnings. Accrued interest receivable is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. Both the\nACL and the adjustment to net income may be reversed if conditions change. However, if Bancorp intends to sell an impaired debt security or more likely than\nnot will be required to sell such a security before recovering its amortized cost basis, the entire impairment amount would be recognized in earnings with a\ncorresponding adjustment to the security’s amortized cost basis. Because the security’s amortized cost basis is adjusted to fair value, there is no ACL in this\nsituation.\nIn evaluating debt securities in unrealized and unrecognized loss positions for impairment and the criteria regarding its intent or requirement to sell such\nsecurities, Bancorp considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its\nagencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and the results of reviews of the issuers’ financial condition, among other factors.\nUnrealized and unrecognized losses on Bancorp’s investment securities portfolio have not been recognized as an expense because the securities are of high\ncredit quality, and the decline in fair values is attributable to changes in the prevailing interest rate environment since the purchase date. Fair value is expected\nto recover as securities reach maturity and/or the interest rate environment returns to conditions similar to when these securities were purchased. These\ninvestments consisted of 465 and 498 separate investment positions as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. By dollar value,\napproximately 97% and 98% of the debt securities portfolio was in an loss position as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

These potential weaknesses may result in\ndeterioration of repayment prospects for the loan or of Bancorp's credit position at some future date.\nSubstandard – Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the paying capacity of the obligor or of collateral pledged, if any. Loans so\nclassified have well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize ultimate repayment of the debt. Default is a distinct possibility if the deficiencies are not corrected.\nSubstandard non-performing – Loans classified as substandard non-performing have all the characteristics of substandard loans and have been placed on non-\naccrual status. Loans are usually placed on non-accrual status when prospects for recovering both principal and accrued interest are considered doubtful or\nwhen a default of principal or interest has existed for 90 days or more.\nDoubtful – Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses\nmake collection or repayment in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. A loan is typically\ncharged off once it is classified as doubtful.\nManagement considers the guidance in ASC 310-20 when determining whether a modification, extension, or renewal of loan constitutes a current period\norigination. Current period renewals of credit are re-underwritten at the point of renewal and considered current period originations for purposes of the table\nbelow. Bancorp has elected not to disclose revolving loans that have converted to term loans, as activity relating to this disclosure, which is included in the\ntables is currently immaterial to Bancorp’s loan portfolio and is expected to be in the future.\n22\nTable of Contents\nAs of September 30, 2024, the risk rating of loans based on year of origination was as follows:\nRevolving\nloans\n(in thousands) Term Loans Amortized Cost Basis by Origination Year amortized\nSeptember 30, 2024 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 Prior cost basis Total\nCommercial real estate -

Bancorp’s annual goodwill impairment test is conducted as of\nSeptember 30 of each year or more often as situations dictate.\nAt September 30, 2024, Bancorp performed its annual qualitative assessment to determine if it was more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting\nunits exceeded their carrying value, including goodwill. The qualitative assessment indicated that it was not more-likely-than-not that the carrying value of the\nreporting units exceeded their fair value.\n29\nTable of Contents\n(5) Core Deposit and Customer List Intangible Assets\nBancorp recorded initial CDI assets of $13 million, $4 million, $2 million and $3 million in association with the acquisitions of CB in 2022, KB in 2021, KSB\nin 2019 and TBOC in 2013, respectively.\nChanges in the net carrying amount of CDIs follows:\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nBalance at beginning of period $ 10,601 $ 13,442 $ 11,944 $ 14,958\nAmortization (672) (749) (2,015) (2,265)\nBalance at end of period $ 9,929 $ 12,693 $ 9,929 $ 12,693\nAs a result of the CB acquisition, Bancorp also recorded initial intangible assets totaling $12 million associated with the customer list of the acquired WM&T\nbusiness.

The tax benefit of these investments exceeds the amortization\nexpense associated with them, resulting in a positive impact on net income. The investments in such partnerships are recorded in other assets on the\nconsolidated balance sheets, while the corresponding contribution requirements are recorded in other liabilities. For additional information, see the footnote\ntitled “Income Taxes.”\nBancorp enters into interest rate swap transactions with borrowers who desire to hedge exposure to rising interest rates, while at the same time entering into an\noffsetting interest rate swap, with substantially matching terms, with another approved independent counterparty. These are undesignated derivative instruments\nand are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value.

Ohio state taxes are based on bank\ncapital levels and are recorded as other non-interest expense.\nOn April 10, 2023, the IRS issued a proposed regulation that would potentially classify section 831(b) captive activity as a “listed transaction,” and disallow the\nrelated tax benefits, both prospectively and retroactively, for a period to be determined. While the proposed regulation has not been finalized, it is expected to\nbe finalized by June 30, 2025. Bancorp elected not to renew the insurance captive effective August 2023 and it was dissolved as of December 31, 2023. The tax\nbenefits associated with the Captive will not be experienced going forward.\nGAAP provides guidance on financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, in tax returns. If recognized, tax\nbenefits would reduce tax expense and accordingly, increase net income. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease in the future for\nvarious reasons including adding amounts for current year tax positions, expiration of open income tax returns due to statutes of limitation, changes in\nmanagement’s judgment about the level of uncertainty, status of examination, litigation and legislative activity and addition or elimination of uncertain tax\npositions. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was immaterial to Bancorp’s consolidated\nfinancial statements. Federal income tax returns are subject to examination for the years after 2019 and state income tax returns are subject to examination for\nthe years after 2018.\n32\nTable of Contents\nBancorp periodically invests in certain partnerships that generate federal income tax credits. The tax benefit of these investments exceeds the amortization\nexpense associated with them, resulting in a positive impact on net income. In addition to income tax benefits, these investments also serve as an economical\nmeans of achieving CRA goals. The investments in such partnerships are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, while the corresponding\ncontribution requirements are recorded in other liabilities. While contributions are made periodically over the life of the respective investments, which can be\nup to 10 years depending on the type of investment, the majority of contributions associated with a respective investment are made within the first few years\nafter entering the partnership.\nBancorp’s investments in tax credit partnerships, including the related unfunded contributions, totaled $177 million and $175 million as of September 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023, respectively, and are included in other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of September 30, 2024, Bancorp’s expected payments for unfunded contributions related to investments in tax credit partnerships, which are accrued and\nincluded in other liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, were as follows:\n(dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024\nRemainder of 2024 $ 34,012\n2025 66,473\n2026 36,261\n2027 7,179\n2028 893\nThereafter 13,725\nTotal unfunded contributions $ 158,543\nEffective January 1, 2024, Bancorp adopted ASU 2023-02, “Investments – Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax\nCredit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method.” As a result, all of Bancorp’s investments in tax credit partnerships are now accounted for\nunder the proportional amortization method, with related amortization expense recorded within income tax expense on the condensed consolidated income\nstatements. Prior to 2024, Bancorp used both the effective yield and the proportional amortization methods to account for these investments, with related\namortization expense recorded as a component of non-interest expenses on the condensed consolidated income statements.\nThe following table presents tax credits and other tax benefits recognized in addition to amortization expense related to Bancorp’s investment in tax credit\npartnerships for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nProportional amortization method:\nTax credits and other tax benefits recognized $ 2,448 $ (85) $ 9,570 $ 614\nAmortization expense in provision for income taxes 1,927 1,114 7,753 1,910\nAmortization expense in other non-interest expense - 323 - 970\nEffective yield method:\nTax credits and other tax benefits recognized $ - $ 399 $ - $ 1,198\nAmortization expense in provision for income taxes - - - -\nAmortization expense in other non-interest expense - - - -\nThere were no impairment losses related to Bancorp’s investments in tax credit partnerships during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023.\n33\nTable of Contents\n(8) Deposits\nThe composition of deposits follows:\n(in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nNon-interest bearing demand deposits $ 1,508,203 $ 1,548,624\nInterest bearing deposits:\nInterest bearing demand 2,361,192 2,480,357\nSavings 420,772 438,834\nMoney market 1,259,484 1,219,656\nTime deposits of $250 thousand or more 329,805 279,474\nOther time deposits 846,617 703,803\nTotal time deposits (1) 1,176,422 983,277\nTotal interest bearing deposits 5,217,870 5,122,124\nTotal deposits $ 6,726,073 $ 6,670,748\n(1) Includes $203 thousand and $597 thousand in brokered deposits as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n(9) Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase\nSSUAR represent a funding source of Bancorp and are primarily used by commercial customers in conjunction with collateralized corporate cash management\naccounts. Such repurchase agreements are considered financing agreements and mature within one business day from the transaction date. At September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, all of these financing arrangements had overnight maturities and were secured by government sponsored enterprise obligations\nand government agency mortgage-backed securities that were owned and controlled by Bancorp.\nInformation concerning SSUAR follows:\n(dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nOutstanding balance at end of period $ 149,852 $ 152,991\nWeighted average interest rate at end of period 2.08% 2.23%\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nAverage outstanding balance during the period $ 156,865 $ 127,063 $ 156,392 $ 120,740\nAverage interest rate during the period 2.38% 1.86% 2.25% 1.58%\nMaximum outstanding at any month end during the period $ 175,211 $ 127,931 $ 179,428 $ 138,347\n34\nTable of Contents\n(10) Subordinated Debentures\nAs a result of its acquisition of Commonwealth Bancshares, Inc. on March 7, 2022, Bancorp became the 100% successor owner of the following\nunconsolidated trust subsidiaries: Commonwealth Statutory Trust III, Commonwealth Statutory Trust IV and Commonwealth Statutory Trust V. The sole assets\nof the trust subsidiaries represent the proceeds of offerings loaned in exchange for subordinated debentures with similar terms to the TPS. The TPS are treated\nas part of Tier I Capital. The subordinated notes and related interest expense are included in Bancorp’s consolidated financial statements. The subordinated\nnotes are currently redeemable at Bancorp’s option on a quarterly basis. Bancorp chose not to redeem the subordinated notes on October 1, 2024 and carried\nthe notes at the costs noted below at September 30, 2024:\nCarrying Origination Maturity\nFace Value Interest Rate\n(dollars in thousands) Value Date Date\nCommonwealth Statutory Trust III $ 3,093 $ 3,093 12/19/2003 1/7/2034 SOFR + 2.85%\nCommonwealth Statutory Trust IV 12,372 12,372 12/15/2005 12/30/2035 SOFR + 1.35%\nCommonwealth Statutory Trust V 11,341 11,341 6/28/2007 9/15/2037 SOFR + 1.40%\nTotal $ 26,806 $ 26,806\nAs part of the purchase accounting adjustments associated with the CB acquisition, the carrying values of the subordinated notes were adjusted to fair value at\nacquisition date. The related discounts on the subordinated notes have been amortized and recognized as a component of interest expense in Bancorp’s\nconsolidated financial statements. The discounts became fully amortized during the first quarter of 2024.\n(11) FHLB Advances and Other Borrowings\nFHLB advances outstanding at September 30, 2024 consist of a rolling $300 million three-month advance that matures in November 2024, which Bancorp\nutilizes in conjunction with interest rate swaps in an effort to hedge cash flows, and a $25 million cash management advance with an overnight maturity. FHLB\nadvances outstanding at December 31, 2023 consisted of a rolling $200 million three-month advance that matured in early January 2024, which was also\nutilized in conjunction with the previously mentioned interest rate swaps.\nFor the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, gross proceeds and repayments related to FHLB advances totaled $2.5 billion and $2.4 billion,\nrespectively. Net proceeds and repayments related to FHLB advances (excluding those with maturities of 90 days or less) totaled $725 million and $600 million\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2023, gross proceeds and repayments totaled $2.2 billion and\n$1.9 billion, respectively. Net proceeds and repayments (excluding those with maturities of 90 days or less) for the nine month period ended September 30,\n2023 totaled $700 million and $400 million.\nInformation regarding FHLB advances follows. The average interest rate information provided includes the benefit associated with the related interest rate\nswaps:\n(dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nOutstanding balance at end of period $ 325,000 $ 200,000\nWeighted average interest rate at end of period 4.10% 4.11%\nFHLB advances are collateralized by certain CRE and residential real estate mortgage loans under blanket mortgage collateral pledge agreements, as well as\nFHLB stock. Bancorp views these advances as an effective lower-costing funding option compared to other alternatives, such as brokered deposits, to fund loan\ngrowth. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amount of available credit from the FHLB totaled $1.21 billion and $1.33 billion, respectively.\nBancorp also had unsecured available FFP lines with correspondent banks totaling $80 million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively.\n35\nTable of Contents\n(12) Commitments and Contingent Liabilities\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Bancorp had various commitments outstanding that arose in the normal course of business which are\nproperly not reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Total off-balance sheet commitments to extend credit follows:\n(in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCommercial and industrial $ 887,664 $ 897,673\nConstruction and development 614,099 606,668\nHome equity lines of credit 403,649 381,110\nCredit cards 90,061 83,700\nOverdrafts 57,177 55,124\nStandby letters of credit 34,720 33,778\nOther 88,046 100,447\nFuture loan commitments 238,626 298,164\nTotal off balance sheet commitments to extend credit $ 2,414,042 $ 2,456,664\nMost commitments to extend credit are an agreement to lend to a customer either unsecured or secured, as long as collateral is available as agreed upon and\nthere is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Since some\nof the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not represent future cash requirements. Bancorp uses\nthe same credit and collateral policies in making commitments and conditional guarantees as for on-balance sheet instruments. Bancorp evaluates each\ncustomer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained is based on management’s credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral\nheld varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, securities, equipment and real estate. However, should the commitments be drawn upon and should\nour customers default on their resulting obligation to us, our maximum exposure to credit loss, without consideration of collateral, is represented by the\ncontractual amount of those instruments.\nThe ACL for off balance sheet credit exposures, which is separate from the ACL for loans and recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets,\nwas $6.3 million and $5.9 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. While no provision expense for off balance sheet exposures\nwas recorded for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 due to increased line of credit utilization during the quarter, provision expense for off\nbalance sheet credit exposures of $475,000 was recorded for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, driven largely by increased\navailability within the C&D portfolio.\nProvision for credit loss expense for off balance sheet credit exposures of $475,000 and $1.1 million was recorded for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, the result of increased availability stemming from the addition of new lines of credit.\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by Bancorp to guarantee the performance of a customer to a first party beneficiary. Those\nguarantees are primarily issued to support commercial transactions. Standby letters of credit generally have maturities of one to two years.\nCertain commercial customers require confirmation of Bancorp’s letters of credit by other banks since Bancorp does not have a rating by a national rating\nagency. Terms of the agreements range from one month to a year with certain agreements requiring between one and six months’ notice to cancel. If an event of\ndefault on all contracts had occurred at September 30, 2024, Bancorp would have been required to make payments of approximately $3 million, or the\nmaximum amount payable under those contracts. No payments have ever been required because of default on these contracts. These agreements are normally\nsecured by collateral acceptable to Bancorp, which limits credit risk associated with the agreements.\nBancorp periodically invests in certain partnerships that generate federal income tax credits, which result in contribution commitments. Such commitments are\nrecorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. While contributions are made periodically over the life of the respective investments, which can\nbe up to 10 years depending on the type of investment, the majority of contributions associated with a respective investment are made within the first few years\nafter entering the partnership. Bancorp invested in several larger tax credit partnerships during 2023, which have served as an economical means of fulfilling\nCRA goals. As of September 30, 2024, tax credit contribution commitments of $159 million were recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance\nsheets.\nAs of September 30, 2024, in the normal course of business, there were pending legal actions and proceedings in which claims for damages are asserted.\nManagement, after discussion with legal counsel, believes the ultimate result of these legal actions and proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on\nthe consolidated financial position or results of operations of Bancorp.\n36\nTable of Contents\n(13) Assets and Liabilities Measured and Reported at Fair Value\nFair value represents the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous\nmarket for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels of inputs that may be used\nto measure fair values:\nLevel 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement\ndate.\nLevel 2 – Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that\nare not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3 – Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing\nan asset or liability.\nAuthoritative guidance requires maximization of use of observable inputs and minimization of use of unobservable inputs in fair value measurements. Where\nthere exists limited or no observable market data, Bancorp derives its own estimates by generally considering characteristics of the asset/liability, the current\neconomic and competitive environment and other factors. For this reason, results cannot be determined with precision and may not be realized on an actual sale\nor immediate settlement of the asset or liability.\nBancorp used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate fair value of each type of financial instrument:\nAFS debt securities - Except for Bancorp’s U.S Treasury securities, the fair value of AFS debt securities is typically determined by matrix pricing, which is a\nmathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities, but rather by\nrelying on the securities’ relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level 2 inputs). Bancorp’s U.S. Treasury securities are based on quoted market\nprices (Level 1 inputs).\nMortgage loans held for sale - The fair value of mortgage loans held for sale is determined using quoted secondary market prices (Level 2 inputs).\nMortgage banking derivatives – Mortgage banking derivatives used in the ordinary course of business consist primarily of interest rate lock loan\ncommitments and mandatory forward sales contracts. The fair value of the Bancorp’s derivative instruments is primarily measured by obtaining pricing from\nbroker-dealers recognized to be market participants. The pricing is derived from observable market inputs that can generally be verified and do not typically\ninvolve significant judgement by Bancorp (Level 2 inputs).\nInterest rate swap agreements – Interest rate swaps are valued using valuations received from the relevant dealer counterparty. These valuations consider\nmultiple observable market inputs, including interest rate yield curves, time value and volatility factors (Level 2 inputs).\n37\nTable of Contents\nCarrying values of assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis follows:\nFair Value Measurements Using: Total\nSeptember 30, 2024 (in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fair Value\nAssets:\nAvailable for sale debt securities:\nU.S. Treasury and other U.S. Government obligations $ 19,966 $ — $ — $ 19,966\nGovernment sponsored enterprise obligations — 86,895 — 86,895\nMortgage backed securities - government agencies — 632,248 — 632,248\nObligations of states and political subdivisions — 119,197 — 119,197\nOther — 3,526 — 3,526\nTotal available for sale debt securities 19,966 841,866 — 861,832\nMortgage loans held for sale — 4,822 — 4,822\nRate lock loan commitments — 377 — 377\nMandatory forward contracts — 7 — 7\nInterest rate swap assets — 2,489 — 2,489\nTotal assets $ 19,966 $ 849,561 $ — $ 869,527\nLiabilities:\nInterest rate swap liabilities $ — $ 5,661 $ — $ 5,661\nFair Value Measurements Using: Total\nDecember 31, 2023 (in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fair Value\nAssets:\nAvailable for sale debt securities:\nU.S. Treasury and other U.S. Government obligations $ 116,269 $ — $ — $ 116,269\nGovernment sponsored enterprise obligations — 99,847 — 99,847\nMortgage backed securities - government agencies — 688,039 — 688,039\nObligations of states and political subdivisions — 123,490 — 123,490\nOther — 3,534 — 3,534\nTotal available for sale debt securities 116,269 914,910 — 1,031,179\nMortgage loans held for sale — 6,056 — 6,056\nRate lock loan commitments — 174 — 174\nInterest rate swap assets — 5,133 — 5,133\nTotal assets $ 116,269 $ 926,273 $ — $ 1,042,542\nLiabilities:\nInterest rate swap liabilities $ — $ 5,378 $ — $ 5,378\nMandatory forward contracts — 43 — 43\nTotal liabilities $ — $ 5,421 $ — $ 5,421\nThere were no transfers into or out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during 2024 or 2023.\n38\nTable of Contents\nDiscussion of assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis follows:\nCollateral dependent loans – For collateral-dependent loans where Bancorp has determined that the liquidation or foreclosure of the collateral is\nprobable, or where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and the Company expects repayment of the loan to be provided substantially through\nthe operation or sale of the collateral, the ACL is measured based on the difference between the estimated fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost\nbasis of the loan as of the measurement date. For real estate loans, fair value of the loan’s collateral is determined by third party or internal appraisals,\nwhich are then adjusted for the estimated selling and closing costs related to liquidation of the collateral. For this asset class, the actual valuation methods\n(income, comparable sales, or cost) vary based on the status of the project or property. The unobservable inputs may vary depending on the individual\nassets with no one of the three methods being the predominant approach. Bancorp reviews the third party appraisal for appropriateness and adjusts the\nvalue to consider selling and closing costs, which typically range from 8% to 10% of the appraised value. For non-real estate loans, fair value of the loan’s\ncollateral may be determined using an appraisal, net book value per the borrower’s financial statements, or aging reports, adjusted or discounted based on\nmanagement’s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation and management’s expertise or knowledge of the client\nand client’s business.\nOREO – OREO is primarily comprised of real estate acquired in partial or full satisfaction of loans. OREO is recorded at its estimated fair value less\nestimated selling and closing costs at the date of transfer, with any excess of the related loan balance over the fair value less expected selling costs charged\nto the ACL. Subsequent changes in fair value are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount and are recorded against earnings. Bancorp obtains the\nvaluation of OREO with material balances from third party appraisers. For this asset class, the actual valuation methods (income, sales comparable, or\ncost) vary based on the status of the project or property. The unobservable inputs may vary depending on the individual assets with no one of the three\nmethods being the predominant approach. Bancorp reviews the appraisal for appropriateness and adjusts the value to consider selling and closing costs,\nwhich typically range from 8% to 10% of the appraised value.\nCarrying values of assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis follows:\nLosses recorded\nThree months Nine months\nFair Value Measurements Using: Total ended ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nSeptember 30, 2024 (in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fair Value 2024 2024\nCollateral dependent loans $ — $ — $ 7,165 $ 7,165 $ 245 $ 245\nOther real estate owned — — 10 10 — —\nLosses recorded\nThree months Nine months\nFair Value Measurements Using: Total ended ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nDecember 31, 2023 (in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fair Value 2023 2023\nCollateral dependent loans $ — $ — $ 13,561 $ 13,561 $ 1,377 $ 1,377\nOther real estate owned — — 10 10 250 250\nThere were no liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n39\nTable of Contents\nFor Level 3 assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements are presented below.\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(dollars in thousands) Fair Value Valuation Technique Unobservable Inputs Weighted Average\nCollateral dependent loans $ 7,165 Appraisal Appraisal discounts 21.0%\nOther real estate owned 10 Appraisal Appraisal discounts 93.0\nDecember 31, 2023\n(dollars in thousands) Fair Value Valuation Technique Unobservable Inputs Weighted Average\nCollateral dependend loans $ 13,561 Appraisal Appraisal discounts 18.0%\nOther real estate owned 10 Appraisal Appraisal discounts 93.0\n40\nTable of Contents\n(14) Disclosure of Financial Instruments Not Reported at Fair Value\nGAAP requires disclosure of the fair value of financial assets and liabilities, including those financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured and\nreported at fair value on a recurring basis or nonrecurring basis.

Because no market\nexists for a significant portion of Bancorp’s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience,\ncurrent economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve\nuncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Therefore, calculated fair value estimates in many\ninstances cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, may not be realizable in a current sale of the instrument. Changes\nin assumptions could significantly impact estimates.\n41\nTable of Contents\n(15) Mortgage Banking Activities\nMortgage banking activities primarily include residential mortgage originations and servicing.

There was no valuation\nallowance recorded for MSRs as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, as fair value exceeded carrying value. The fair value of MSRs at September\n30, 2024 was determined using discount rates ranging from 10.0% to 13.0%, prepayment speeds ranging from 6.4% to 11.2%, depending on the characteristics\nof the specific rights (rate, maturity, etc.), and a weighted average default rate of 0.6%. The fair value of MSRs at December 31, 2023 was determined using\ndiscount rates ranging from 10.0% to 13.0%, prepayment speeds ranging from 6.0% to 11.1%, depending on the characteristics of the specific rights, and a\nweighted average default rate of 0.6%.\nTotal outstanding principal balances of loans serviced for others were $1.84 billion and $1.93 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively.\nMortgage banking derivatives used in the ordinary course of business consist primarily of mandatory forward sales contracts and interest rate lock loan\ncommitments. Mandatory forward contracts represent future loan commitments to deliver loans at a specified price and date and are used to manage interest\nrate risk on loan commitments and mortgage loans held for sale. Interest rate lock loan commitments represent commitments to fund loans at a specific rate.\nThese derivatives involve underlying items, such as interest rates, and are designed to transfer risk. Substantially all of these instruments expire within 90 days\nfrom the date of issuance. Notional amounts are amounts on which calculations and payments are based, but which do not represent credit exposure, as credit\nexposure is limited to the amount required to be received or paid.\nMandatory forward contracts also contain an element of risk in that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of such agreements. In the event the\ncounterparties fail to deliver commitments or are unable to fulfill their obligations, the Bank could potentially incur significant additional costs by replacing the\npositions at then current market rates. The Bank manages its risk of exposure by limiting counterparties to those banks and institutions deemed appropriate by\nmanagement. The Bank does not expect any counterparty to default on their obligations and therefore, the Bank does not expect to incur any cost related to\ncounterparty default.\nBancorp is exposed to interest rate risk on loans held for sale and rate lock loan commitments. As market interest rates fluctuate, the fair value of mortgage\nloans held for sale and rate lock commitments may decline or increase. To offset this interest rate risk the Bank enters into derivatives, such as mandatory\nforward contracts to sell loans. The fair value of these mandatory forward contracts will fluctuate as market interest rates fluctuate, and the change in the value\nof these instruments is expected to largely, though not entirely, offset the change in fair value of loans held for sale and rate lock commitments. The objective of\nthis activity is to minimize the exposure to losses on rate lock loan commitments and loans held for sale due to market interest rate fluctuations. The net effect\nof derivatives on earnings will depend on risk management activities and a variety of other factors, including: market interest rate volatility; the amount of rate\nlock commitments that close; the ability to fill the forward contracts before expiration; and the time period required to close and sell loans.\nThe following table includes the notional amounts and fair values of mortgage loans held for sale and mortgage banking derivatives:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nNotional Notional\n(in thousands) Fair Value Fair Value\nAmount Amount\nIncluded in Mortgage loans held for sale:\nMortgage loans held for sale, at fair value $ 4,671 $ 4,822 $ 5,965 $ 6,056\nIncluded in other assets:\nRate lock loan commitments $ 10,545 $ 377 $ 4,345 $ 174\nMandatory forward contracts 13,500 7 - -\nIncluded in other liabilities\nMandatory forward contracts $ - $ - $ 6,750 $ (43)\n43\nTable of Contents\n(16) Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nThe following table illustrates activity within the balances of AOCI, net of tax, by component:\nNet unrealized Net unrealized Minimum\ngains (losses) gains (losses) pension\non available for on cash liability\nsale debt\n(in thousands) securities flow hedges adjustment Total\nThree months ended September 30, 2024\nBalance, beginning of period $ (97,760) $ 2,721 $ 59 $ (94,980)\nNet current period other comprehensive income (loss) 24,827 (5,120) - 19,707\nBalance, end of period $ (72,933) $ (2,399) $ 59 $ (75,273)\nThree months ended September 30, 2023\nBalance, beginning of period $ (109,741) $ 2,213 $ 112 $ (107,416)\nNet current period other comprehensive income (loss) (22,586) 2,097 - (20,489)\nBalance, end of period $ (132,327) $ 4,310 $ 112 $ (127,905)\nNet unrealized Net unrealized Minimum\ngains (losses) gains (losses) pension\non available for on cash liability\nsale debt\n(in thousands) securities flow hedges adjustment Total\nNine months ended September 30, 2024\nBalance, beginning of period $ (92,678) $ (179) $ 59 $ (92,798)\nNet current period other comprehensive income (loss) 19,745 (2,220) - 17,525\nBalance, end of period $ (72,933) $ (2,399) $ 59 $ (75,273)\nNine months ended September 30, 2023\nBalance, beginning of period $ (115,648) $ - $ 112 $ (115,536)\nNet current period other comprehensive income (loss) (16,679) 4,310 - (12,369)\nBalance, end of period $ (132,327) $ 4,310 $ 112 $ (127,905)\n(17) Preferred Stock\nBancorp has one class of preferred stock (no par value; 1,000,000 shares authorized), the relative rights, preferences and other terms of the class or any series\nwithin the class will be determined by the Board of Directors prior to any issuance.

In 2018, shareholders approved an additional 500,000 shares for issuance under the plan.\nShareholders approved an additional 1 million shares for issuance under the plan at Bancorp’s 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders on April 25, 2024. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, there were 979,000 shares available for future awards. The 2005 Stock Incentive Plan expired in April 2015 and SARs granted under this\nplan expire as late as 2025. The 2015 Stock Incentive Plan has no defined expiration date.\nSAR Grants – SARs granted have a vesting schedule of 20% per year and expire ten years after the grant date unless forfeited due to employment termination.\nFair values of SARs are estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, a leading formula for calculating such value. This model\nrequires the input of assumptions, changes to which can materially impact the fair value estimate. The following assumptions were used in SAR valuations at\nthe grant date in each year:\nAssumptions 2024 2023\nDividend yield 2.29% 2.24%\nExpected volatility 28.43% 27.20%\nRisk free interest rate 4.16% 3.84%\nExpected life (in years) 7.1 7.1\nDividend yield and expected volatility are based on historical information for Bancorp corresponding to the expected life of SARs granted. Expected volatility\nis the volatility of underlying shares for the expected term calculated on a monthly basis. The risk free interest rate is the implied yield currently available on\nU.S. Treasury issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the awards. The expected life of SARs is based on actual experience of past like-term\nSARs. Bancorp evaluates historical exercise and post-vesting termination behavior when determining the expected life.\nRSA Grants – RSAs granted to officers vest over five years. Dividends associated with RSA grants are deferred until shares are vested. Fair value of RSAs is\nequal to the market value of the shares on the date of grant.\nPSU Grants – PSUs vest based upon service and a three-year performance period, which begins January 1 of the first year of the performance period. Because\ngrantees are not entitled to dividend payments during the performance period, the fair value of these PSUs is estimated based upon the market value of the\nunderlying shares on the date of grant, adjusted for non-payment of dividends. Grants require a one-year post-vesting holding period and therefore the fair\nvalue of such grants incorporates a liquidity discount related to the holding period of 5.8% and 5.2% for 2024 and 2023.\nRSU Grants – RSUs are only granted to non-employee directors, are time-based and vest 12 months after grant date. Because grantees are entitled to deferred\ndividend payments at the end of the vesting period, therefore the fair value of the RSUs equals market value of underlying shares on the date of grant.\nIn the first quarters of 2024 and 2023, Bancorp awarded 9,550 and 8,668 RSUs to non-employee directors of Bancorp with a grant date fair value of $500,000\nand $550,000, respectively.\nBancorp utilized cash of $203,000 and $175,000 during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, for the purchase of shares upon the vesting of\nRSUs.\n46\nTable of Contents\nBancorp has recognized stock-based compensation expense for SARs, RSAs and PSUs within compensation expense and RSUs for directors within other non-\ninterest expense, as follows:\nThree months ended September 30, 2024\nStock\nAppreciation Restricted Restricted Performance\n(in thousands) Rights Stock Awards Stock Units Stock Units Total\nExpense $ 72 $ 420 $ 125 $ 305 $ 922\nDeferred tax benefit (15) (88) (27) (64) (194)\nTotal net expense $ 57 $ 332 $ 98 $ 241 $ 728\nThree months ended September 30, 2023\nStock\nAppreciation Restricted Restricted Performance\n(in thousands) Rights Stock Awards Stock Units Stock Units Total\nExpense $ 105 $ 399 $ 126 $ 402 $ 1,032\nDeferred tax benefit (22) (84) (26) (84) (216)\nTotal net expense $ 83 $ 315 $ 100 $ 318 $ 816\nNine months ended September 30, 2024\nStock\nAppreciation Restricted Restricted Performance\n(in thousands) Rights Stock Awards Stock Units Stock Units Total\nExpense $ 212 $ 1,258 $ 374 $ 1,028 $ 2,872\nDeferred tax benefit (45) (264) (79) (216) (604)\nTotal net expense $ 167 $ 994 $ 295 $ 812 $ 2,268\nNine months ended September 30, 2023\nStock\nAppreciation Restricted Restricted Performance\n(in thousands) Rights Stock Awards Stock Units Stock Units Total\nExpense $ 310 $ 1,204 $ 392 $ 1,313 $ 3,219\nDeferred tax benefit (65) (253) (82) (276) (676)\nTotal net expense $ 245 $ 951 $ 310 $ 1,037 $ 2,543\nDetail of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense follows:\nStock\n(in thousands) Appreciation Restricted Restricted Performance\nYear ended Rights Stock Awards Stock Units Stock Units Total\nRemainder of 2024 $ 95 $ 432 $ 126 $ 261 $ 914\n2025 336 1,528 1 1,043 2,908\n2026 286 1,244 — 1,043 2,573\n2027 216 915 — — 1,131\n2028 126 485 — — 611\n2029 11 72 — — 83\nTotal estimated future expense $ 1,070 $ 4,676 $ 127 $ 2,347 $ 8,220\n47\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes SARs activity and related information:\nWeighted\nWeighted Weighted average\naverage Aggregate average remaining\nExercise exercise intrinsic fair contractual\n(in thousands, except per share and life\ndata) SARs price price value(1) value life (in years)\nOutstanding, January 1, 2023 435 $19.37 - $74.92 $ 35.60 $ 12,784 $ 6.02 5.1\nGranted 29 60.76 - 60.76 60.76 — 16.81\nExercised (24) 19.37 - 19.37 19.37 681 3.58\nForfeited — — — — —\nOutstanding, December 31, 2023 440 $19.44 - $74.92 $ 38.11 $ 6,297 $ 6.86 4.7\nOutstanding, January 1, 2024 440 $19.44 - $74.92 $ 38.11 $ 6,297 $ 6.86 4.7\nGranted 42 47.95 - 54.92 49.20 — 13.75\nExercised (80) 45.76 - 64.71 24.21 3,027 3.75\nForfeited — — — — —\nOutstanding, September 30, 2024 402 $22.96 - $74.92 $ 42.05 $ 8,028 $ 8.20 5.1\nVested and exercisable 302 $22.96 - $60.76 $ 38.75 $ 7,011 $ 6.59 4.1\nUnvested 100 37.30 - 74.92 51.96 1,017 13.01 3.5\nOutstanding, September 30, 2024 402 $22.96 - $74.92 $ 42.05 $ 8,028 $ 8.20 5.1\nVested in the current year 46 $36.65 - $60.76 $ 46.89 $ 696 $ 9.62\n(1) – Aggregate intrinsic value for SARs is defined as the amount by which the current market price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise or grant price.\nThe following table summarizes activity for RSAs granted:\nGrant date\nweighted\n(in thousands, except per share data) RSAs average cost\nUnvested at January 1, 2023 96 $ 47.26\nShares awarded 38 63.04\nRestrictions lapsed and shares released (33) 43.77\nShares cancelled (3) 53.38\nUnvested at December 31, 2023 98 $ 54.23\nUnvested at January 1, 2024 98 $ 54.23\nShares awarded 46 52.06\nRestrictions lapsed and shares released (32) 49.30\nShares cancelled (7) 53.53\nUnvested at September 30, 2024 105 $ 54.83\n48\nTable of Contents\nShares expected to be awarded for PSUs granted to executive officers of Bancorp, the three-year performance period for which began January 1 of the award\nyear, are as follows:\nVesting Shares\nGrant period Fair expected to\nyear in years value be awarded\n2022 3 $ 48.48 20,770\n2023 3 54.33 13,402\n2024 3 41.84 86,136\n49\nTable of Contents\n(20) Derivative Financial Instruments\nPeriodically, Bancorp enters into interest rate swap transactions with borrowers who desire to hedge exposure to rising interest rates, while at the same time\nentering into an offsetting interest rate swap, with substantially matching terms, with another approved independent counterparty. These are undesignated\nderivative instruments and are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. Because of matching terms of offsetting contracts and collateral provisions\nmitigating any non-performance risk, changes in fair value subsequent to initial recognition have an insignificant effect on earnings. Exchanges of cash flows\nrelated to undesignated interest rate swap agreements were offsetting and therefore had no effect on Bancorp’s earnings or cash flows.\nInterest rate swap agreements derive their value from underlying interest rates. These transactions involve both credit and market risk. Notional amounts are\namounts on which calculations, payments and the value of the derivative are based. Notional amounts do not represent direct credit exposures. Direct credit\nexposure is limited to the net difference between the calculated amounts to be received and paid, if any. Bancorp is exposed to credit-related losses in the event\nof non-performance by counterparties to these agreements. Bancorp mitigates the credit risk of its financial contracts through credit approvals, collateral and\nmonitoring procedures, and does not expect any counterparties to fail their obligations.\nBancorp had outstanding undesignated interest rate swap contracts as follows:\nReceiving Paying\nSeptember 30, December 31, September 30, December 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNotional amount $ 237,193 $ 201,555 $ 237,193 $ 201,555\nWeighted average maturity (years) 5.3 6.0 5.3 6.0\nFair value $ 2,489 $ 5,133 $ 2,496 $ 5,142\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, Bancorp entered into an interest rate swap to hedge cash flows of a $100 million rolling fixed-rate three-month FHLB\nborrowing. The swap began February 6, 2023 and matures February 6, 2028. During the third quarter of 2023, Bancorp entered into two additional interest rate\nswaps to hedge cash flows of two $50 million rolling fixed-rate three-month FHLB borrowings. These swaps began August 7, 2023, with one maturing August\n6, 2026 and the other maturing August 6, 2028. During the third quarter of 2024, Bancorp entered into another interest rate swap to hedge cash flows of a $100\nmillion rolling fixed-rate three-month FHLB borrowing. The swap began on August 6, 2024 and matures on August 6, 2029.\nWhile Bancorp expects to utilize fixed-rate three-month FHLB advances with respect to these interest rate swaps, brokered CDs or other fixed rate advances\nmay be utilized for the same three-month terms instead should those sources be more favorable. For purposes of hedging, rolling fixed rate advances are\nconsidered to be floating rate liabilities.\nInterest rate swaps involve exchange of Bancorp’s floating rate interest payments for fixed rate swap payments on underlying principal amounts. These swaps\nwere designated and qualified, for cash-flow hedge accounting. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedging instruments, the\neffective portion of gains or losses is reported as a component of AOCI and is subsequently reclassified into earnings as an adjustment to interest expense in\nperiods for which the hedged forecasted transaction impacts earnings.\nThe following table details Bancorp’s derivative positions designated as a cash flow hedges, and the related fair values:\nFair value\n(dollars in thousands) Pay fixed September 30,\nNotional Amount Maturity Date Receive (variable) index swap rate 2024\n$ 100,000 2/6/2028 USD SOFR 3.27% $ 248\n50,000 8/6/2026 USD SOFR 4.38% (782)\n50,000 8/6/2028 USD SOFR 3.97% (1,243)\n100,000 8/6/2029 USD SOFR 3.58% (1,389)\n$ 300,000 $ (3,166)\n50\nTable of Contents\n(21) Regulatory Matters\nBancorp and the Bank are subject to capital regulations in accordance with Basel III, as administered by banking regulators. Regulatory agencies measure\ncapital adequacy within a framework that makes capital requirements, in part, dependent on the individual risk profiles of financial institutions. Failure to meet\nminimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct\nmaterial effect on Bancorp’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Holding\nCompany and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of Bancorp’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet\nitems, as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators\nregarding components, risk weightings and other factors.\nBanking regulators have categorized the Bank as well-capitalized. To meet the definition of well-capitalized, a bank must have a minimum 6.5% Common\nEquity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio, 8.0% Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio, 10.0% Total Risk-Based Capital ratio and 5.0% Tier 1 Leverage ratio.\nAdditionally, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers,\nBancorp and the Bank must hold a 2.5% capital conservation buffer composed of Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital above the minimum risk-based\ncapital requirements for the Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio, Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio and Total Risk-Based Capital ratio necessary to be\nconsidered adequately-capitalized. At September 30, 2024, the adequately-capitalized minimums, including the capital conservation buffer, were a 7.0%\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio, 8.5% Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio and 10.5% Total Risk-Based Capital ratio. As all of Bancorp’s capital\nratios were above the adequately-capitalized minimums, including the buffer, the Company was not subject to any such restrictions.\nAs a result of the CB acquisition, Bancorp became the 100% successor owner of the following unconsolidated trust subsidiaries: Commonwealth Statutory\nTrust III, Commonwealth Statutory Trust IV and Commonwealth Statutory Trust V. The sole assets of the trust subsidiaries represent the proceeds of offerings\nloaned in exchange for subordinated debentures with similar terms to the TPS. The TPS are treated as part of Tier 1 Capital. The subordinated note and related\ninterest expense are included in Bancorp’s consolidated financial statements.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, subordinated notes totaled $27 million.\nBancorp continues to exceed the regulatory requirements for all calculations.

Commercial banking provides a full range of loan and deposit products to individual\nconsumers and businesses. Commercial banking also includes Bancorp’s mortgage banking and investment products sales activity. WM&T provides\ninvestment management, financial & retirement planning and trust & estate services, as well as retirement plan management for businesses and corporations in\nall markets in which Bancorp operates. The magnitude of WM&T revenue distinguishes Bancorp from other community banks of similar asset size.\nFinancial information for each business segment reflects that which is specifically identifiable or allocated based on an internal allocation method. Income\ntaxes are allocated based on the effective federal income tax rate adjusted for any tax-exempt activity. All tax-exempt activity and provision have been\nallocated fully to the commercial banking segment. Measurement of performance of business segments is based on the management structure of Bancorp and is\nnot necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Information presented is also not necessarily indicative of the segments’\noperations if they were independent entities.\nThe majority of the net assets of Bancorp are involved in the commercial banking segment. As of September 30, 2024, goodwill totaling $194 million was\nrecorded on Bancorp’s consolidated balance sheets, of which $172 million is attributed to the commercial banking segment and $22 million is attributed to\nWM&T. The portion of total goodwill attributed to WM&T relates entirely to the CB acquisition. With the exception of goodwill attributed to WM&T through\nthe CB acquisition, assets assigned to WM&T consist primarily of a CLI asset associated with the WM&T business added through the CB acquisition, net\npremises and equipment and a receivable related to fees earned that have not been collected.\nSelected financial information by business segment follows:\nThree months ended September 30, 2024 Three months ended September 30, 2023\nCommercial Commercial\n(in thousands) Banking WM&T Total Banking WM&T Total\nNet interest income $ 64,711 $ 268 $ 64,979 $ 61,155 $ 160 $ 61,315\nProvision for credit losses 4,325 — 4,325 2,775 — 2,775\nWealth management and trust services — 10,931 10,931 — 10,030 10,030\nAll other non-interest income 13,866 — 13,866 12,866 — 12,866\nNon-interest expenses 42,996 5,456 48,452 41,788 4,914 46,702\nIncome before income tax expense 31,256 5,743 36,999 29,458 5,276 34,734\nIncome tax expense 6,393 1,246 7,639 6,497 1,145 7,642\nNet income $ 24,863 $ 4,497 $ 29,360 $ 22,961 $ 4,131 $ 27,092\nSegment assets $ 8,403,147 $ 34,133 $ 8,437,280 $ 7,867,626 $ 35,804 $ 7,903,430\nNine months ended September 30, 2024 Nine months ended September 30, 2023\nCommercial Commercial\n(dollars in thousands) Banking WM&T Total Banking WM&T Total\nNet interest income $ 186,295 $ 776 $ 187,071 $ 184,895 $ 421 $ 185,316\nProvision for credit losses 7,050 — 7,050 7,750 — 7,750\nWealth management and trust services — 32,497 32,497 — 29,703 29,703\nAll other non-interest income 39,226 — 39,226 38,100 — 38,100\nNon-interest expenses 128,604 17,918 146,522 121,265 16,551 137,816\nIncome before income tax expense 89,867 15,355 105,222 93,980 13,573 107,553\nIncome tax expense 19,045 3,332 22,377 20,804 2,945 23,749\nNet income $ 70,822 $ 12,023 $ 82,845 $ 73,176 $ 10,628 $ 83,804\nSegment assets 8,403,147 $ 34,133 $ 8,437,280 $ 7,867,626 $ 35,804 $ 7,903,430\n53\nTable of Contents\n(23) Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nAll of Bancorp’s revenue from contracts with customers in the scope of ASC 606 is recognized within non-interest income.

Revenue sources within the scope of ASC 606 are discussed below:\nBancorp earns fees from its deposit customers for transaction-based, account management and overdraft services. Transaction-based fees, which include\nservices such as ATM use fees and stop payments fees, are recognized at the time the transaction is executed, as that is when the company fulfills the\nperformance obligation. Account management fees are earned over the course of a month and charged in the month in which the services are provided.\nTreasury management transaction fees are recognized at the time the transaction is executed, as that is when the company fulfills the performance obligation.\nAccount analysis fees are earned over the course of a month and charged in the month in which the services are provided. Treasury management fees are\nwithdrawn from customers’ account balances.\nWM&T provides customers fiduciary and investment management services as agreed upon in asset management contracts. The contracts require WM&T to\nprovide a series of distinct services for which fees are earned over time. The contracts are cancellable upon demand with fees typically based upon the asset\nvalue of investments. Revenue is accrued and recognized monthly based upon month-end asset values and collected from the customer predominately in the\nfollowing month except for a small percentage of fees collected quarterly. Incentive compensation related to WM&T activities is considered a cost of obtaining\nthe contract. Contracts between WM&T and customers do not permit performance-based fees and accordingly, none of the fee income earned by WM&T is\nperformance-based. Trust fees receivable were $4.5 million and $4.2 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n54\nTable of Contents\nNet investment products sales commissions and fees represent the Bank’s share of transaction fees and wrap fees resulting from investment services and\nprograms provided through an agent relationship with a third party broker-dealer. Transaction fees are assessed at the time of the transaction. Those fees are\ncollected and recognized on a monthly basis. Trailing fees are based upon market values and are assessed, collected and recognized on a quarterly basis.\nBecause the Bank acts as an agent in arranging the relationship between the customer and third party provider, and does not control the services rendered,\ninvestment product sales commissions and fees are reported net of related costs, including nominal incentive compensation, and trading activity charges of\n$707,000 and $663,000 for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nDebit and credit card revenue primarily consists of debit and credit card interchange income. Interchange income represents fees assessed within the payment\ncard system for acceptance of card-based transactions. Interchange fees are assessed as the performance obligation is satisfied, which is at the point in time the\ncard transaction is authorized. Revenue is collected and recognized daily through the payment network settlement process.\nBancorp did not establish any contract assets or liabilities as a result of adopting ASC 606, nor were any recognized during the three and nine month periods\nended September 30, 2024.\n55\nTable of Contents\n(24) Leases\nBancorp has operating leases for various locations with terms ranging from approximately three months to 24 years, several of which include options to extend\nthe leases in five-year increments. Options reasonably expected to be exercised are included in determination of the right-of-use asset. Bancorp elected to use a\npractical expedient to expense short-term lease obligations associated with leases with original terms of 12 months or less. Bancorp elected not to separate non-\nlease components from lease components for its operating leases. The right-of-use lease asset and operating lease liability are recorded in premises and\nequipment and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.\nBalance sheet, income statement and cash flow detail regarding operating leases follows:\n(dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nBalance Sheet\nOperating lease right-of-use asset $ 29,468 $ 21,007\nOperating lease liability 30,953 22,487\nWeighted average remaining lease term (years) 11.2 9.8\nWeighted average discount rate 3.73% 2.84%\nMaturities of lease liabilities:\nOne year or less $ 1,012 $ 3,365\nYear two 3,855 2,864\nYear three 3,666 2,543\nYear four 3,674 2,536\nYear five 3,712 2,547\nGreater than five years 22,590 12,059\nTotal lease payments $ 38,509 $ 25,914\nLess imputed interest 7,556 3,427\nTotal $ 30,953 $ 22,487\nThree months ended Three months ended\n(in thousands) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nIncome Statement\nComponents of lease expense:\nOperating lease cost $ 1,057 $ 815\nVariable lease cost 88 96\nLess sublease income 26 25\nTotal lease cost $ 1,119 $ 886\nNine months ended Nine months ended\n(in thousands) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nIncome Statement\nComponents of lease expense:\nOperating lease cost $ 3,215 $ 2,492\nVariable lease cost 257 235\nLess sublease income 77 75\nTotal lease cost $ 3,395 $ 2,652\nNine months ended Nine months ended\n(in thousands) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nCash flow Statement\nSupplemental cash flow information:\nOperating cash flows from operating leases $ 3,567 $ 3,111\nAs of September 30, 2024, Bancorp had not entered into any lease agreements that had yet to commence.\n56\nTable of Contents\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nStock Yards Bancorp, Inc. (“Bancorp” or “the Company”), is a FHC headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky and is engaged in the business of banking through\nits wholly owned subsidiary, Stock Yards Bank & Trust Company (“SYB” or “the Bank”). Bancorp, which was incorporated in 1988 in Kentucky, is registered\nwith, and subject to supervision, regulation and examination by, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. As Bancorp has no significant\noperations of its own, its business and the business of SYB are essentially the same. The operations of SYB are fully reflected in the consolidated financial\nstatements of Bancorp. Accordingly, references to “Bancorp” in this document may encompass both the holding company and the Bank. All significant inter-\ncompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.\nSYB, established in 1904, is a state-chartered non-member financial institution that provides services in Louisville, central, eastern and northern Kentucky, as\nwell as the Indianapolis, Indiana and Cincinnati, Ohio markets through 72 full service banking center locations. The Bank is registered with, and subject to\nsupervision, regulation and examination by the FDIC and the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions.\nAs a result of its acquisition of KB on May 31, 2021, Bancorp became the 100% successor owner of a Nevada-based insurance captive taxed under Section\n831(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. On April 10, 2023, the IRS issued a proposed regulation that would potentially classify section 831(b) captive activity as\na “listed transaction,” and possibly disallow the related tax benefits, both prospectively and retroactively, for a period to be determined. While the regulation\nhas not been finalized, it is expected to be finalized in 2025. Bancorp elected not to renew the Captive in August of 2023 and ultimately dissolved the Captive\nin December of 2023.\nAs a result of its acquisition of Commonwealth Bancshares, Inc. on March 7, 2022, Bancorp became the 100% successor owner of three unconsolidated\nDelaware trust subsidiaries: Commonwealth Statutory Trust III, Commonwealth Statutory Trust IV and Commonwealth Statutory Trust V. The sole assets of\nthe trust subsidiaries represent the proceeds of offerings exchanged for subordinated debentures with similar terms to the TPS.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial\nstatements and accompanying Footnotes presented in Part 1 Item 1 “Financial Statements” and other information appearing in Bancorp’s Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. To the extent that this discussion describes prior performance, the descriptions relate only to the periods\nlisted, which may not be indicative of Bancorp’s future financial outcomes. In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking\nstatements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause results to differ materially from management’s expectations.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis document contains statements relating to future results of Bancorp that are considered “forward-looking” as defined by Section 27A of the Securities Act\nof 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The forward-looking statements are principally, but not\nexclusively, contained in Part I Item 2 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\nForward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause actual results, performance, or achievements to\nbe materially different from future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by the statement. These statements are often, but not always,\nmade through the use of words or phrases such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “can,” “conclude,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “foresee,” “goal,”\n“intend,” “may,” “might,” “outlook,” “possible,” “plan,” “predict,” “project,” “potential,” “seek,” “should,” “target,” “will,” “will likely,” “would,” or other\nsimilar expressions. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our\nindustry, management’s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control.\nForward-looking statements detail management’s expectations regarding the future and are based on information known to management only as of the date the\nstatements are made and management undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date\nforward-looking statements are made, except as required by applicable regulation.\n57\nTable of Contents\nThere is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those\nexpressed or implied in forward-looking statements include, among other things:\n● Changes in, or forecasts of, future political and economic conditions, inflation or recession and efforts to control related developments;\n● changes in laws and regulations or the interpretation thereof;\n● accuracy of assumptions and estimates used in establishing the ACL for loans, ACL for off-balance sheet credit exposures and other estimates;\n● impairment of investment securities;\n● impairment of goodwill, MSRs, other intangible assets and/or DTAs;\n● ability to effectively navigate an economic slowdown or other economic or market disruptions;\n● changes in fiscal, monetary, and/or regulatory policies;\n● changes in tax polices including but not limited to changes in federal and state statutory rates;\n● behavior of securities and capital markets, including changes in interest rates, market volatility and liquidity;\n● ability to effectively manage capital and liquidity;\n● long-term and short-term interest rate fluctuations, as well as the shape of the U.S. Treasury yield curve;\n● the magnitude and frequency of changes to the FFTR implemented by the Federal Open Market Committee of the FRB;\n● competitive product and pricing pressures;\n● projections of revenue, expenses, capital expenditures, losses, EPS, dividends, capital structure, etc.;\n● integration of acquired financial institutions, businesses or future acquisitions;\n● changes in the credit quality of Bancorp’s customers and counterparties, deteriorating asset quality and charge-off levels;\n● changes in technology instituted by Bancorp, its counterparties or competitors;\n● changes to or the effectiveness of Bancorp’s overall internal control environment;\n● adequacy of Bancorp’s risk management framework, disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting;\n● changes in applicable accounting standards, including the introduction of new accounting standards;\n● changes in investor sentiment or behavior;\n● changes in consumer/business spending or savings behavior;\n● ability to appropriately address social, environmental and sustainability concerns that may arise from business activities;\n● occurrence of natural or man-made disasters or calamities, including health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases, pandemics or outbreaks of\nhostilities, and Bancorp’s ability to deal effectively with disruptions caused by the foregoing;\n● ability to maintain the security of its financial, accounting, technology, data processing and other operational systems and facilities;\n● ability to withstand disruptions that may be caused by any failure of its operational systems or those of third parties;\n● ability to effectively defend itself against cyberattacks or other attempts by unauthorized parties to access information of Bancorp, its vendors or its\ncustomers or to disrupt systems; and\n● other risks and uncertainties reported from time-to-time in Bancorp’s filings with the SEC, including Part I Item 1A “Risk Factors” of Bancorp’s\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nIssued but Not Yet Effective Accounting Standards Updates\nFor disclosure regarding the impact to Bancorp’s financial statements of issued-but-not-yet-effective ASUs, see the footnote titled “Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies” of Part I Item 1 “Financial Statements.”\n58\nTable of Contents\nBusiness Segment Overview\nBancorp is divided into two reportable segments: Commercial Banking and WM&T:\nCommercial Banking provides a full range of loan and deposit products to individual consumers and businesses in all its markets through retail lending,\nmortgage banking, deposit services, online banking, mobile banking, private banking, commercial lending, commercial real estate lending, treasury\nmanagement services, merchant services, international banking, correspondent banking and other banking services. The Bank also offers securities\nbrokerage services via its banking center network through an arrangement with a third party broker-dealer in the Commercial Banking segment.\nWM&T provides investment management, financial & retirement planning and trust & estate services, as well as retirement plan management for\nbusinesses and corporations in all markets in which Bancorp operates. The magnitude of WM&T revenue distinguishes Bancorp from other community\nbanks of similar asset size.\nOverview – Operating Results (FTE)\nThe following table presents an overview of Bancorp’s financial performance for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data) Variance\nThree months ended September 30, 2024 2023 $/bp %\nNet income $ 29,360 $ 27,092 $ 2,268 8%\nDiluted earnings per share $ 1.00 $ 0.92 $ 0.08 9%\nROA 1.39% 1.38% 1 bp 1%\nROE 12.83% 13.26% (43) bps -3%\nAdditional discussion follows under the section titled “Results of Operations.”\nGeneral highlights for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023:\n● Net income totaled $29.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, resulting in diluted EPS of $1.00, compared to net income of $27.1\nmillion for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which resulted in diluted EPS of $0.92.\n● Total loans increased $661 million, or 12%, compared to September 30, 2023, driven by growth in all categories over the past 12 months. Average\nloans increased $688 million, or 13%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of the prior year.\n● Bancorp’s ACL on loans increased $7 million, or 9%, compared to September 30, 2023, attributed mainly to the significant loan growth experienced\nover the last 12 months, and to a lesser extent, deterioration in the FRB unemployment forecast. Provision for credit losses on loans totaled $4.3\nmillion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n● Deposit balances climbed $323 million, or 5%, compared to September 30, 2023, driven in large part by growth in time deposits tied to the success of\npromotional rate offerings, which have more than offset deposit contraction within the non-interest bearing deposit portfolio.\n● Net interest income (FTE) totaled $65.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing an increase of $3.6 million, or 6%,\ncompared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n○ Interest income experienced a $16.8 million, or 19%, increase over this period associated with the benefits of higher rates and average\nearning asset growth, which outpaced the $13.1 million, or 48%, increase in interest expense driven by the rising cost of funds and growth in\ninterest-bearing liabilities.\n○ As a result of deposit pricing pressure/competition, Bancorp has continued to experience a significant shift in the deposit mix, as non-interest\nbearing deposits and lower-yielding deposits have migrated to higher-yielding options, particularly time deposits, driving a substantial\nincrease in the overall cost of deposits.\n○ NIM decreased 1 bp to 3.33% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of the prior year.\n● Non-interest income increased $1.9 million, or 8%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September\n30, 2023, attributed largely to strong WM&T and treasury management fees in addition to general increases across virtually all of Bancorp’s\ndiversified non-interest revenue streams.\n59\nTable of Contents\n● Non-interest expenses increased $1.8 million, or 4%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September\n30, 2023, driven mainly by higher compensation expenses associated with annual merit-based salary increases and higher bonus levels in addition to\nincreased technology and communication expense attributed to various security and compliance-related software upgrades. Further, modifications to\nthe corporate credit card reward program (reducing program expense) and a significant decline in fraudulent check and card losses served to partially\noffset general increases in other non-interest expense categories.\n● Bancorp’s efficiency ratio (FTE) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 53.92% compared to 54.57% for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. This improvement was the result of strong growth in net interest income and non-interest income, which outpaced growth in non-\ninterest expenses.\n● As of September 30, 2024, Bancorp continued to be “well-capitalized,” the highest regulatory capital rating for financial institutions, with capital\nratios experiencing growth compared to both December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023. Total stockholders’ equity to total assets was 11.07% as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to 10.50% and 10.21% at December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Tangible common equity to\ntangible assets was 8.79% at September 30, 2024, compared to 8.09% and 7.69% at December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively.\nThe following table presents an overview of Bancorp’s financial performance for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data) Variance\nNine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 $/bp %\nNet income $ 82,845 $ 83,804 $ (959) -1%\nDiluted earnings per share $ 2.82 $ 2.86 $ (0.04) -1%\nROA 1.34% 1.46% (12) bps -8%\nROE 12.53% 14.07% (154) bps -11%\nAdditional discussion follows under the section titled “Results of Operations.”\nGeneral highlights for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023:\n● Net income totaled $82.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulting in diluted EPS of $2.82, compared to net income of $83.8\nmillion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which resulted in diluted EPS of $2.86.\n● Total loans increased $661 million, or 12%, compared to September 30, 2023, driven by growth in all categories over the past 12 months. Average\nloans increased $649 million, or 12%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of the prior year.\n● Bancorp’s ACL on loans increased $7 million, or 9%, compared to September 30, 2023, attributed mainly to the significant loan growth experienced\nover the last 12 months. Provision for credit losses on loans totaled $6.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to\nprovision of $6.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n● Deposit balances climbed $323 million, or 5%, compared to September 30, 2023, driven in large part by growth in time deposits tied to the success of\npromotional rate offerings, which have more than offset deposit contraction within the non-interest bearing deposit portfolio. Average deposits\nincreased $270 million, or 4%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of the prior year.\n● Net interest income (FTE) totaled $187.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing an increase of $1.6 million, or 1%,\ncompared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n○ Interest income experienced a $50.9 million, or 20%, increase over this period associated with the benefits of higher rates and average\nearning asset growth, narrowly outpacing the $49.4 million, or 75%, increase in interest expense driven by the rising cost of funds and\ngrowth in interest-bearing liabilities.\n○ As a result of deposit pricing pressure/competition, Bancorp has continued to experience a significant shift in the deposit mix, as non-interest\nbearing deposits and lower-yielding deposits have migrated to higher-yielding options, particularly time deposits, driving a substantial\nincrease in the overall cost of deposits. Further, continued loan growth and deposit balance fluctuations necessitated more borrowing activity\nthroughout the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period of the prior year, contributing to the overall increase in interest\nexpense.\n○ NIM decreased 18 bps, or 5%, to 3.26% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of the prior year.\n60\nTable of Contents\n● Non-interest income increased $3.9 million, or 6%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30,\n2023, attributed largely to strong WM&T fees, treasury management fees and card income.\n● Non-interest expenses increased $8.7 million, or 6%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September\n30, 2023, driven mainly by higher compensation and employee benefit expenses associated with annual merit-based salary increases and higher bonus\nlevels, FTE growth and higher health insurance claims activity, in addition to increased technology and communication expense, attributed to various\nsecurity and compliance-related software upgrades.\n● Bancorp’s efficiency ratio (FTE) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 56.56% compared to 54.35% for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The increase in this ratio is the result of non-interest expense growth outpacing net interest income and non-interest income\nexpansion, as net interest income was hampered by rising funding costs.\nResults of Operations\nNet Interest Income - Overview\nAs is the case with most banks, Bancorp’s primary revenue sources are net interest income and fee income from various financial services provided to\ncustomers. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on loans, investment securities and other interest earning assets less interest\nexpense on deposit accounts and other interest bearing liabilities. Loan volume and interest rates earned on those loans are critical to overall profitability.\nSimilarly, deposit volume is crucial to funding loans and rates paid on deposits directly impact profitability. New business volume is influenced by numerous\neconomic factors including market interest rates, business spending, liquidity, consumer confidence and competitive conditions within the marketplace. The\ndiscussion that follows is based on FTE net interest income data.\nComparative information regarding net interest income follows:\n(dollars in thousands) Variance\nAs of and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 2023 $/bp %\nNet interest income $ 64,979 $ 61,315 $ 3,664 6%\nNet interest income (FTE)* 65,064 61,437 3,627 6%\nNet interest spread (FTE)* 2.57% 2.67% (10) bps -4%\nNet interest margin (FTE)* 3.33% 3.34% (1) bp 0%\nAverage interest earning assets $ 7,783,997 $ 7,305,205 $ 478,792 7%\nAverage interest bearing liabilities 5,701,063 5,076,486 624,577 12%\nFive year Treasury note rate at period end 3.58% 4.60% (102) bps -22%\nAverage five year Treasury note rate 3.80% 4.31% (51) bps -12%\nPrime rate at period end 8.00% 8.50% (50) bps -6%\nAverage Prime rate 8.44% 8.43% 1 bp 0%\nOne month term SOFR at period end 4.85% 5.32% (47) bps -9%\nAverage one month term SOFR 5.22% 5.29% (7) bps -1%\n*See table titled, \"Average Balance Sheets and Interest Rates (FTE)\" for detail of Net interest income (FTE).\n61\nTable of Contents\n(dollars in thousands) Variance\nAs of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 $/bp %\nNet interest income $ 187,071 $ 185,316 $ 1,755 1%\nNet interest income (FTE)* 187,344 185,757 1,587 1%\nNet interest spread (FTE)* 2.52% 2.87% (35) bps -12%\nNet interest margin (FTE)* 3.26% 3.44% (18) bps -5%\nAverage interest earning assets $ 7,670,807 $ 7,210,748 $ 460,059 6%\nAverage interest bearing liabilities 5,611,573 4,934,485 677,088 14%\nFive year Treasury note rate at period end 3.58% 4.60% 102 bps -22%\nAverage five year Treasury note rate 4.13% 3.94% 19 bps 5%\nPrime rate at period end 8.00% 8.50% (50) bps -6%\nAverage Prime rate 8.48% 8.10% 38 bps 5%\nOne month term SOFR at period end 4.85% 5.32% (47) bps -9%\nAverage one month term SOFR 5.29% 4.98% 31 bps 6%\n*See table titled, \"Average Balance Sheets and Interest Rates (FTE)\" for detail of Net interest income (FTE).\nNIM and net interest spread calculations above exclude the sold portion of certain participation loans, which totaled $2 million and $4 million at September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These sold loans are on Bancorp’s balance sheet as required by GAAP because Bancorp retains some form of\neffective control; however, Bancorp receives no interest income on the sold portion. These participation loans sold are excluded from NIM and spread analysis,\nas Bancorp believes it provides a more accurate depiction of loan portfolio performance.\nAt September 30, 2024, Bancorp’s loan portfolio consisted of approximately 69% fixed and 31% variable rate loans. At inception, most of Bancorp’s fixed rate\nloans are generally priced in relation to the five year treasury. Bancorp’s variable rate loans are typically indexed to either Prime or SOFR, repricing as those\nrates change. At September 30, 2024, approximately 60% and 40% of Bancorp’s variable rate loan portfolio was indexed to Prime and SOFR, respectively.\nPrime rate, the five year Treasury note rate and one month term SOFR are included in the preceding tables to provide a general indication of the interest rate\nenvironment in which Bancorp has operated during the past 12 months. The FRB increased the FFTR a total of 100 bps in 2023 via four separate 25 bps rate\nhikes, two of which occurred during the first quarter of 2023. These increases took the FFTR to a range of 5.25% - 5.50%, and Prime to 8.50%, in July of 2023,\nwhere each remained until September 18, 2024. On September 18, 2024, the FRB reduced the FFTR 50 bps, representing the first rate reduction in over four\nyears. This action lowered the FFTR to a range of 4.75% - 5.00% and Prime to 8.00% as of September 30, 2024.\nThe current economic outlook remains volatile, regularly changing as new economic data becomes available and the FRB’s efforts to control or moderate\ninflation continue. Recent projections indicate the potential for multiple rate reductions to occur over the course of the next several months. While Bancorp has\nexperienced NIM compression as a result of pricing pressure/competition for both loans and deposits, changing levels of liquidity and a flattening yield curve,\nNIM expansion has been experienced for two consecutive quarters as the result of lower funding costs and an improved yield curve.\nNet Interest Income (FTE) – Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023\nNet interest spread (FTE) and NIM (FTE) were 2.57% and 3.33%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.68% and 3.34% for the same\nperiod in 2023, respectively. NIM during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was significantly impacted by the following:\n● The higher interest rate environment that has served to benefit interest-earning assets has simultaneously driven NIM compression, as the cost of\ndeposits and other funding sources has risen. While the FFTR was reduced to a range of 4.75% - 5.00% effective September 18, 2024, it had\npreviously remained at a range of 5.25% - 5.50% since mid-2023, resulting in an inverted interest rate yield curve for an extended period of time.\nAlthough it has flattened/improved some during the first nine months of 2024, continued action by the FRB may create a challenging interest rate\nenvironment over the next several quarters.\n● Pricing pressure/competition for deposits, which has driven a significant increase in the cost of funds and shift in Bancorp’s deposit mix, as depositors\nseek higher yielding deposit alternatives. While the cost of funding is expected to moderate in tandem with anticipated rate decreases, lower liquidity\nlevels within the banking industry generally may continue to drive pricing pressure/competition for deposits.\n62\nTable of Contents\n● Significant loan growth over the past 12 months has positively impacted interest income and average interest-earning asset growth, which Bancorp\nelected to fund with deposit and non-deposit sources, namely a combination of scheduled investment security maturities and FHLB borrowings.\nNet interest income (FTE) increased $3.6 million, or 6%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, as significant\naverage loan growth and the benefit of higher rates upon average interest earning assets managed to outpace rising funding costs stemming from intense pricing\npressure/competition for deposits and increased borrowing activity.\nTotal average interest earning assets increased $479 million, or 7%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period of 2023,\nattributed to substantial average loan growth that was partially offset by a decline in average investment securities driven by scheduled maturities and normal\namortization. However, as a result of a higher interest rate environment, the average rate earned on total average interest earning assets climbed 57 bps to\n5.41%.\n● Average total loan balances increased $688 million, or 13%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023,\nwith significant growth driven by contributions from every loan category.\n● Average investment securities declined $235 million, or 14%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023,\nmainly the result of significant scheduled maturities within the treasury portfolio, and to a lesser extent, normal amortization activity. The funding\nprovided by this activity has benefitted interest-earning asset yields and overall NIM, as the low-yielding treasury securities shifted into higher-\nyielding interest-bearing cash and helped fund Bancorp’s substantial loan growth.\n● Average FFS and interest bearing due from bank balances increased $24 million, or 19%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which was\nlargely the result of the previously mentioned liquidity provided by the investment securities portfolio.\nTotal interest income (FTE) increased $16.8 million, or 19%, to $106 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period\nof 2023.\n● Interest and fee income (FTE) on loans increased $17.4 million, or 22%, to $95.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared\nto the same period of 2023, driven by the higher rate environment and significant average loan growth. The yield on the overall loan portfolio\nincreased 51 bps to 6.17% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.66% for the same period of the prior year.\n● Consistent with the decline in average investment securities, there was a $1.1 million, or 13%, decrease in interest income (FTE) on the portfolio for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. The corresponding yield on the portfolio was 2.07% for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.04% for the prior year period, the increase being attributed to the maturity of low-yielding treasury\nsecurities during the latter part of the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n● Interest income on FFS and interest bearing due from bank balances increased $306,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, stemming\nmainly average balance growth. The yield on these assets decreased 2 bps to 5.20% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the\nsame period of 2023.\nTotal average interest bearing liabilities increased $625 million, or 12%, to $5.70 billion for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 compared with\nthe same period in 2023.\n● Average interest bearing deposits increased $538 million, or 12%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in\n2023. Bancorp experienced a $324 million, or 41%, increase in average time deposits and a $192 million, or 18%, increase in average money market\ndeposits as a result of depositors seeking higher-yielding deposit products in the current environment.\n● Average FHLB advances increased $60 million, or 15%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of the prior\nyear. Bancorp currently utilizes a $300 million term advance in conjunction with four separate interest rate swaps of varying maturities in an effort to\nsecure longer-term funding at a more favorable rate. Bancorp has also utilized overnight borrowings more heavily in the current year to fund loan\ngrowth and manage deposit fluctuations.\n63\nTable of Contents\n● Average SSUAR increased $30 million, or 23%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of the prior year, as\ncustomers were attracted to the collateralized protection provided by this product.\nTotal interest expense increased $13.1 million, or 48%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, driven by a\nsignificant rise in rates paid on deposits and increased borrowing activity. As a result, the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased 68 bps to 2.84% for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023.\n● Total interest bearing deposit expense increased $12.6 million, or 59%, $9.6 million of which was attributed to time deposit and money market\ndeposits, as customers continued to shift to higher-yielding deposit products. This activity resulted in a 80 bps increase in the cost of interest bearing\ndeposits for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of the prior year. While Bancorp expects pricing\npressure/competition to continue in the coming quarters, the pace of deposit cost expansion is expected to moderate.\n● Interest expense on FHLB borrowings increased $292,000, or 6%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to same period of the\nprior year, driven by both increased borrowing activity and higher costs associated with overnight borrowings.\n● Interest expense on SSUAR increased $340,000, or 57%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period of the prior\nyear, consistent with average balance growth and higher rates.\nNet Interest Income (FTE) – Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023\nNet interest spread (FTE) and NIM (FTE) were 2.52% and 3.26%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.88% and 3.44% for the same\nperiod in 2023, respectively. NIM during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was significantly impacted by the following:\n● The higher interest rate environment that has served to benefit interest-earning assets has simultaneously driven NIM compression, as the cost of\ndeposits and other funding sources has risen. While the FFTR was reduced to a range of 4.75% - 5.00% effective September 18, 2024, it had\npreviously remained at a range of 5.25% - 5.50% since mid-2023, resulting in an inverted interest rate yield curve for an extended period of time.\nAlthough it has flattened/improved some during the first nine months of 2024, it remains to be seen how FRB rate action will impact the interest rate\nyield curve over the next several quarters.\n● Pricing pressure/competition for deposits has driven a significant increase in the cost of funds and shift in Bancorp’s deposit mix, as depositors seek\nhigher yielding deposit alternatives.

Contents\nSupplemental Information - Average Balance Sheets and Interest Rates (FTE)\n● Average loan balances include the principal balance of non-accrual loans, as well as unearned income such as loan premiums, discounts, fees/costs\nand exclude participation loans accounted for as secured borrowings. Participation loans accounted for as secured borrowings averaged $2 million\nand $4 million for the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Participation loans accounted for as secured borrowings\naveraged $3 million and $5 million for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n● Interest income on a FTE basis includes additional amounts of interest income that would have been earned if investments in certain tax-exempt\ninterest earning assets had been made in assets subject to federal taxes yielding the same after-tax income. Interest income on municipal securities\nand tax-exempt loans has been calculated on a FTE basis using a federal income tax rate of 21%. Approximate tax equivalent adjustments to interest\nincome were $85,000 and $122,000 for the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $273,000 and $441,000 for the\nnine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n● Interest income includes loan fees of $1.7 million and $1.1 million for the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and\n$4.6 million and $4.1 million for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest income on loans may be materially\nimpacted by the level of prepayment fees collected and net accretion income related to acquired loans. Net accretion income related to acquired loans\ntotaled $467,000 and $507,000 for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $1.8 million and $2.0 million for\nthe nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n● Net interest income, the most significant component of Bancorp's earnings, represents total interest income less total interest expense. The level of net\ninterest income is determined by mix and volume of interest earning assets, interest bearing deposits and borrowed funds, and changes in interest\nrates.\n● NIM represents net interest income on a FTE basis as a percentage of total average interest earning assets.\n● Net interest spread (FTE) is the difference between taxable equivalent rates earned on total interest earning assets less the cost of interest bearing\nliabilities.\n● The fair market value adjustment on investment securities resulting from ASC 320, “Investments – Debt and Equity Securities” is included as a\ncomponent of other assets.\n68\nTable of Contents\nAsset/Liability Management and Interest Rate Risk\nManaging interest rate risk is fundamental for the financial services industry. The primary objective of interest rate risk management is to neutralize effects of\ninterest rate changes on net income. By considering both on and off-balance sheet financial instruments, management evaluates interest rate sensitivity with the\ngoal of optimizing net interest income within the constraints of prudent capital adequacy, liquidity needs, market opportunities and customer funding\nrequirements.\nInterest Rate Simulation Sensitivity Analysis\nBancorp uses an earnings simulation model to estimate and evaluate the impact of an immediate change in interest rates on earnings in a one-year forecast. The\nsimulation model is designed to reflect dynamics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. By estimating effects of interest rate fluctuations, the\nmodel can approximate interest rate risk exposure. This simulation model is used by management to gauge approximate results given a specific change in\ninterest rates at a given point in time. The model is therefore a tool to indicate earnings trends in given interest rate scenarios and may not indicate actual or\nexpected results.\nThe results of the interest rate sensitivity analysis performed as of September 30, 2024 were derived from conservative assumptions Bancorp uses in its model,\nparticularly in relation to deposit betas, which measure how responsive management’s deposit repricing may be to changes in market rates based on historical\ndata. Management uses different betas in the rising and falling rate scenarios in an effort to best simulate expected earnings trends.\nBancorp’s interest rate sensitivity analysis details that increases in interest rates of 100 and 200 bps would have a slightly positive effect on net interest income,\nwhile decreases in interest rates of 100 and 200 bps would have a slightly negative impact. These results depict a relatively neutral interest rate risk profile. The\nincrease in net interest income in the rising rate scenarios is primarily due to variable rate loans and short-term investments repricing more quickly than\ndeposits and short-term borrowings. Net interest income decreases in the falling rate scenarios because rates on non-maturity deposits cannot be lowered\nsufficiently to offset the decline in interest income associated with assets that immediately reprice as rates fall.\n-200 -100 +100 +200\nBasis Points Basis Points Basis Points Basis Points\n% Change from base net interest income at September 30, 2024 -2.66% -1.47% 1.58% 3.06%\nBancorp’s loan portfolio is currently composed of approximately 69% fixed and 31% variable rate loans, with the fixed rate portion pricing generally based on\na spread to the five year treasury curve at the time of origination and the variable portion pricing based on an on-going spread to Prime (approximately 60%) or\nSOFR (approximately 40%).\nPeriodically, Bancorp enters into interest rate swap transactions with borrowers who desire to hedge exposure to rising interest rates, while at the same time\nentering into an offsetting interest rate swap, with substantially matching terms, with another approved independent counterparty. These are undesignated\nderivative instruments and are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in other non-interest income as interest rates\nfluctuate. Because of matching terms of offsetting contracts, in addition to collateral provisions which mitigate the impact of non-performance risk, changes in\nfair value subsequent to initial recognition have a minimal effect on earnings and are therefore not included in the simulation analysis results above. For\nadditional information see the Footnote titled “Assets and Liabilities Measured and Reported at Fair Value.”\nIn addition, Bancorp periodically uses derivative financial instruments as part of its interest rate risk management, including interest rate swaps. These interest\nrate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges as described in the Footnote titled “Derivative Financial Instruments.” For these derivatives, the effective\nportion of gains or losses is reported as a component of OCI and is subsequently reclassified into earnings as an adjustment to interest expense in periods in\nwhich the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.\n69\nTable of Contents\nProvision for Credit Losses\nProvision for credit losses on loans at September 30, 2024 represents the amount of expense that, based on management’s judgment, is required to maintain the\nACL for loans at an appropriate level under the CECL model. The determination of the amount of the ACL for loans is complex and involves a high degree of\njudgment and subjectivity. See the Footnote titled “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Bancorp’s Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for detailed discussion regarding Bancorp’s ACL methodology by loan segment.\nAn analysis of the changes in the ACL for loans, including provision, and selected ratios follow:\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nBeginning balance $ 82,155 $ 77,710 $ 79,374 $ 73,531\nProvision for credit losses on loans 4,325 2,300 6,575 6,700\nTotal charge-offs (1,345) (2,115) (1,954) (2,805)\nTotal recoveries 208 180 1,348 649\nNet loan (charge-offs) recoveries (1,137) (1,935) (606) (2,156)\nEnding balance $ 85,343 $ 78,075 $ 85,343 $ 78,075\nAverage total loans $ 6,174,309 $ 5,486,262 $ 5,986,366 $ 5,337,493\nProvision for credit losses on loans to average total loans (1) 0.07% 0.04% 0.11% 0.13%\nNet loan (charge-offs) recoveries to average total loans (1) -0.02% -0.04% -0.01% -0.04%\nACL for loans to total loans 1.36% 1.39% 1.36% 1.39%\nACL for loans to average total loans 1.38% 1.42% 1.43% 1.46%\n(1) Ratios are not annualized\nThe ACL for loans totaled $85 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to $78 million at September 30, 2023, representing an ACL to total loans ratio of\n1.36% and 1.39% for the respective periods.\nProvision expense on loans of $4.3 million and $6.6 million was recorded for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, attributed mainly to\nstrong loan growth and deterioration in the FRB unemployment forecast. Net charge offs of $1.1 million and $606,000 were recorded for the three and nine\nmonth periods ended September 30, 2024, serving to decrease the ACL for loans.\nProvision expense on loans of $2.3 million and $6.7 million was recorded to provision for credit losses on loans for the three and nine month periods ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, respectively, driven mainly by strong loan growth. Partially offsetting the increase in the ACL associated with provision expense was net\ncharge off activity of $1.9 million and $2.2 million for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\nWhile separate from the ACL for loans and recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, the ACL for off balance sheet credit exposures also\nexperienced an increase between December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024. While no provision for off balance sheet credit exposures was recorded for the\nthree month period ended September 30, 2024 due to increased utilization (and thus a decrease in availability), provision of $475,000 was recorded for the nine\nmonth period ended September 30, 2024, driven largely by increased availability within the C&D portfolio. The ACL for off balance sheet credit exposures\ntotaled $6.3 million as of September 30, 2024.\nProvision for credit loss expense for off balance sheet credit exposures of $475,000 and $1.1 million was recorded for the three and nine month periods ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The ACL for off balance sheet credit exposures was $5.6 million as of September 30, 2023.\nBancorp’s loan portfolio is well-diversified with no significant concentrations of credit. Geographically, most loans are extended to borrowers in Louisville,\ncentral, eastern and northern Kentucky, as well as the Indianapolis, Indiana and Cincinnati, Ohio metropolitan markets. The adequacy of the ACL is monitored\non an ongoing basis and it is the opinion of management that the balance of the ACL at September 30, 2024 is adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in\nthe loan portfolio as of the financial statement date.\n70\nTable of Contents\nNon-interest Income\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n(dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 $ Variance % Variance 2024 2023 $ Variance % Variance\nWealth management and trust\nservices $ 10,931 $ 10,030 $ 901 9% $ 32,497 $ 29,703 $ 2,794 9%\nDeposit service charges 2,314 2,272 42 2 6,630 6,622 8 0\nDebit and credit card income 5,083 4,870 213 4 14,688 14,064 624 4\nTreasury management fees 2,939 2,635 304 12 8,389 7,502 887 12\nMortgage banking income 1,112 814 298 37 3,077 2,882 195 7\nNet investment product sales\ncommissions and fees 915 791 124 16 2,580 2,345 235 10\nBank owned life insurance 634 569 65 11 1,817 1,677 140 8\nGain (loss) on sale of premises\nand equipment (59) 302 (361) NM (39) 75 (114) NM\nOther 928 613 315 51 2,084 2,933 (849) (29)\nTotal non-interest income $ 24,797 $ 22,896 $ 1,901 8% $ 71,723 $ 67,803 $ 3,920 6%\nTotal non-interest income increased $1.9 million, or 8%, and $3.9 million, or 6%, for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to\nthe same periods of 2023, respectively. Non-interest income comprised 27.6% and 27.7% of total revenues, defined as net interest income and non-interest\nincome, for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to 27.2% and 26.8%% for the same periods of 2023. WM&T services\ncomprised 44.1% and 45.3% of total non-interest income for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to 43.8% for both the three\nand nine month periods ended September 30, 2023.\nWM&T Services:\nThe magnitude of WM&T revenue distinguishes Bancorp from other community banks of similar asset size. WM&T revenue increased $901,000, or 9%,\nand $2.8 million, or 9%, for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, as compared with the same periods of 2023, consistent with\nstrong equity market appreciation and higher estate fee income that more than offset a decline in net new business expansion.\nNet new business refers to revenue generated from newly acquired customers or reactivated accounts, excluding revenue from upselling or cross-selling\nto existing active customers. It plays a crucial role in expanding Bancorp’s financial base and ensuring long-term sustainability and success. During the\nthird quarter of 2024, the WM&T department experienced negative net new business for the first time in a few years, which was driven in large part to\nattrition associated with employee retirements and market competition. Despite negative net new business for the quarter, total WM&T income is\ncurrently projected to increase over the next twelve months, as projected moderate market growth would more than offset the potential negative impact\nfrom the previously mentioned attrition and an expected decline in non-recurring estate fees.\nRecurring fees earned for managing accounts are based on a percentage of market value of AUM and are typically assessed on a monthly basis. Recurring\nfees, which generally comprise the vast majority of WM&T revenue, increased $613,000, or 6%, and $2.3 million, or 8% for the three and nine month\nperiods ended September 30, 2024, as compared with the same periods of 2023. The increases were driven largely by equity market appreciation over the\npast year.\nA portion of WM&T revenue, most notably executor and certain employee benefit plan-related fees, are non-recurring in nature and the timing of these\nrevenues corresponds with the related administrative activities. For this reason, such fees are subject to greater period over period fluctuation. Total non-\nrecurring fees increased $288,000 and $534,000 for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, as compared with the same periods of\n2023, driven by increased estate fee income.\nAUM, stated at market value, totaled $7.32 billion at September 30, 2024 compared with $7.16 billion at December 31, 2023 and $6.67 billion at\nSeptember 30, 2023. The increase in AUM between September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024 is attributed mainly to strong equity market\nappreciation experienced over the past year.\nContracts between WM&T and their customers do not permit performance-based fees and accordingly, none of the WM&T revenue is performance\nbased. Management believes the WM&T department will continue to factor significantly in Bancorp’s financial results and provide strategic diversity to\nrevenue streams.\n71\nTable of Contents\nDetail of WM&T Service Income by Account Type:\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nInvestment advisory $ 4,240 $ 3,856 $ 12,726 $ 11,511\nPersonal trust 3,815 3,557 11,465 10,572\nPersonal investment retirement 1,955 1,778 5,661 5,164\nCompany retirement 416 392 1,240 1,132\nFoundation and endowment 339 303 1,003 872\nCustody and safekeeping 56 77 172 248\nBrokerage and insurance services 5 1 9 9\nOther 105 66 221 195\nTotal WM&T services income $ 10,931 $ 10,030 $ 32,497 $ 29,703\nThe preceding table demonstrates that WM&T fee revenue is concentrated within investment advisory and personal trust accounts. WM&T fees are\npredominantly based on AUM and tailored for individual/company accounts and/or relationships with fee structures customized based on account type\nand other factors, with larger relationships paying a lower percentage of AUM in fees. For example, recurring AUM fee structures are in place for\ninvestment management, irrevocable and revocable trusts, personal investment retirement accounts and accounts holding only fixed income securities.\nWM&T also provides company retirement plan services, which can consist of a one-time conversion fee with recurring AUM fees to follow. While there\nare also fee structures for estate settlements, income received is typically non-recurring in nature. Fee structures are agreed upon at the time of account\nopening and any subsequent revisions are communicated in writing to the customer. As previously mentioned, WM&T fees earned are not performance-\nbased nor are they based on investment strategy or transactions. Bancorp also earns management fees on in-house investments funds acquired from CB.\nAUM by Account Type:\nAUM (not included on balance sheet) increased from $7.16 billion at December 31, 2023 to $7.32 billion at September 30, 2024 as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nNon-managed Non-managed\n(in thousands) Managed (1) Total Managed (1) Total\nInvestment advisory $ 2,736,814 $ 66,332 $ 2,803,146 $ 2,591,561 $ 72,028 $ 2,663,589\nPersonal trust 1,614,335 435,589 2,049,924 1,922,294 459,103 2,381,397\nPersonal investment retirement 946,944 21,282 968,226 848,800 17,854 866,654\nCompany retirement 54,368 633,990 688,358 57,486 510,294 567,780\nFoundation and endowment 523,563 7,278 530,841 471,609 23,413 495,022\nSubtotal $ 5,876,024 $ 1,164,471 $ 7,040,495 $ 5,891,750 $ 1,082,692 $ 6,974,442\nCustody and safekeeping — 276,336 276,336 — 185,638 185,638\nTotal AUM $ 5,876,024 $ 1,440,807 $ 7,316,831 $ 5,891,750 $ 1,268,330 $ 7,160,080\n(1) Non-managed assets represent those for which the WM&T department does not hold investment discretion.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately 80% and 82% of AUM were actively managed, respectively. Company retirement\nplan accounts consist primarily of participant-directed assets. The amount of custody and safekeeping accounts are insignificant to overall WM&T\noperations.\n72\nTable of Contents\nManaged AUM by Class of Investment:\n(in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nInterest bearing deposits $ 414,981 $ 442,820\nTreasury and government agency obligations 210,703 240,848\nState, county and municipal obligations 341,798 297,314\nMoney market mutual funds 35,949 68,617\nEquity mutual funds 1,358,978 1,225,210\nOther mutual funds - fixed, balanced and municipal 547,813 551,141\nOther notes and bonds 28,502 199,146\nCommon and preferred stocks 2,549,702 2,474,186\nCommon trust funds and collective investment funds 179,448 84,996\nReal estate mortgages 167 373\nReal estate 43,028 40,224\nOther miscellaneous assets (1) 164,955 266,875\nTotal managed assets $ 5,876,024 $ 5,891,750\n(1) Includes client directed instruments such as rights, warrants, annuities, insurance policies, unit investment trusts, and oil and gas rights.\nManaged assets are invested in instruments for which market values can be readily determined, the majority of which are sensitive to market\nfluctuations and consist of approximately 67% in equities and 33% in fixed income securities as of September 30, 2024, compared to 64% and 36% as\nof December 31, 2023. This composition has remained relatively consistent from period to period.\nAdditional Sources of Non-interest income:\nDeposit service charges, which consist of non-sufficient funds charges and to a lesser extent, other activity based charges, increased $42,000, or 2%, and\n$8,000, or less than 1%, for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, as compared with the same periods of 2023. Consistent with the\nbanking industry generally, Bancorp has experienced a steady decline in the volume of fees earned on overdrawn checking accounts over the past several years.\nThis trend has been driven by lower check presentment volume, which has in turn led to fewer overdrawn accounts in general. Further, Bancorp anticipates that\nfuture growth of this revenue stream could be significantly impacted by changing industry practices. Bancorp could be faced with strategic decisions\nsurrounding deposit-related service charges in the future, which could negatively impact the contributions made by this, or similar, revenue streams.\nDebit and credit card income consists of interchange revenue, ancillary fees and incentives received from card processors. Debit and credit card revenue\nincreased $213,000, or 4%, and $624,000, or 4%, for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, as compared with the same periods of 2023.\nThe increases were driven by interchange income expansion and higher transaction volume. Total debit card income increased $110,000, or 3%, and $161,000,\nor 2%, and total credit card income increased $103,000, or 13%, and $463,000, or 11% for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024,\ncompared the same periods of the prior year. While Bancorp generally expects this revenue stream to grow with continued expansion of the customer base,\ninterchange rate compression and fluctuations in business and consumer spend levels could serve as challenges to future growth.\nTreasury management fees primarily consist of fees earned for cash management services provided to commercial customers. This category continues to stand\nout as a consistent, growing source of revenue for Bancorp and increased $304,000, or 12%, and $887,000, or 12%, for the three and nine month periods ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, as compared with the same periods of 2023, driven by expansion, increased transaction volume, growing international services and new\nproduct sales. Bancorp anticipates this income category will continue to increase based on continued customer base growth and the expanding suite of services\noffered within Bancorp’s treasury management platform.\n73\nTable of Contents\nMortgage banking income primarily includes gains on sales of mortgage loans and net loan servicing income offset by MSR amortization. Bancorp’s mortgage\nbanking department predominantly originates residential mortgage loans to be sold in the secondary market, primarily to FNMA and FHLMC. Bancorp offers\nconventional, VA, FHA and GNMA financing for purchases and refinances, as well as programs for first-time homebuyers. Interest rates on mortgage loans\ndirectly influence the volume of business transacted by the mortgage-banking department. Mortgage banking revenue increased $298,000, or 37%, and\n$195,000, or 7%, for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, as compared with the same periods of 2023, driven by an increase in\norigination volume during the third quarter of this year in addition to slowing MSR amortization.\nNet investment product sales commissions and fees are generated primarily on stock, bond and mutual fund sales, as well as wrap fees earned on brokerage\naccounts via an arrangement with a third party broker-dealer. Wrap fees represent charges for investment programs that bundle together a suite of services, such\nas brokerage, advisory, research and management and are based on a percentage of account assets. Bancorp deploys its financial advisors primarily through its\nbranch network, while larger managed accounts are generally serviced by Bancorp’s WM&T group. Net investment product sales commissions and fees\nincreased $124,000, or 16%, and $235,000, or 10%, for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023 due\nto organic growth and general market appreciation over the respective period.\nBOLI assets represent the cash surrender value of life insurance policies on certain active and non-active employees who have provided consent for Bancorp to\nbe the beneficiary for a portion of such policies. The related change in cash surrender value and any death benefits received under the policies are recorded as\nnon-interest income and serves to offset the cost of various employee benefits. BOLI income increased $65,000, or 11%, and $140,000, or 8%, for the three and\nnine month periods ending September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of the prior year, which was attributed to general market appreciation and a\nreallocation of investments within the policy plans over the past year.\nLosses on the sale of premises and equipment of $59,000 and $39,000 were recorded for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024. Activity\nfor the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2023 was the result of the sale of certain acquired properties that overlapped with existing locations\nin addition to other merger-related disposal activity.\nOther non-interest income increased $315,000, or 51%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and decreased $849,000, or 29%, for the three and nine\nmonth periods ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same periods of 2023. The increase for the three month period was attributed largely higher swap\nfee income recorded during the current year. In addition, the prior year period included a $250,000 OREO write-down (no such activity in the current year\nperiod). The decrease for the nine month period was driven largely by Bancorp’s decision not to renew the insurance captive in late 2023, which contributed\napproximately $1.4 million of other non-interest income for nine month periods ended September 30, 2023.\n74\nTable of Contents\nNon-interest Expenses\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n(dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 $ Variance % Variance 2024 2023 $ Variance % Variance\nCompensation $ 25,534 $ 23,379 $ 2,155 9% $ 74,389 $ 67,382 $ 7,007 10%\nEmployee benefits 4,629 4,508 121 3 15,591 14,622 969 7\nNet occupancy and equipment 3,775 3,821 (46) (1) 11,264 11,234 30 0\nTechnology and\ncommunication 4,500 4,236 264 6 14,463 12,706 1,757 14\nDebit and credit card\nprocessing 1,845 1,637 208 13 5,402 4,762 640 13\nMarketing and business\ndevelopment 1,438 1,357 81 6 4,109 4,236 (127) (3)\nPostage, printing and supplies 901 938 (37) (4) 2,740 2,701 39 1\nLegal and professional 968 1,049 (81) (8) 3,268 2,665 603 23\nFDIC insurance 1,095 937 158 17 3,368 2,851 517 18\nCapital and deposit based taxes 825 629 196 31 2,128 1,875 253 13\nIntangible amortization 1,052 1,167 (115) (10) 3,155 3,519 (364) (10)\nAmortization of investments in\ntax credit partnerships - 323 (323) NM - 970 (970) NM\nOther 1,890 2,721 (831) (31) 6,645 8,293 (1,648) (20)\nTotal non-interest expenses $ 48,452 $ 46,702 $ 1,750 4% $ 146,522 $ 137,816 $ 8,706 6%\nTotal non-interest expenses increased $1.8 million, or 4%, and $8.7 million, or 6%, for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared\nto the same periods of 2023. Compensation and employee benefits comprised 62.3% and 61.4% of Bancorp’s total non-interest expenses for the three and nine\nmonth periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to 59.7% and 59.5% for the same periods of 2023.\nCompensation, which includes salaries, incentives, bonuses and stock based compensation, increased $2.2 million, or 9%, and $7.0 million, or 10%, for the\nthree and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, as compared with the same periods of 2023. The increases were attributed to annual merit-based\nsalary increases, higher bonus accruals and to a lesser extent, increased incentive compensation. Net full time equivalent employees totaled 1,068 at September\n30, 2024 compared to 1,075 at December 31, 2023 and 1,056 at September 30, 2023.\nEmployee benefits consists of all personnel-related expense not included in compensation, with the most significant items being health insurance, payroll taxes\nand employee retirement plan contributions. Employee benefits increased $121,000, or 3%, and $969,000, or 7%, for the three and nine month periods ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, as compared with the same periods of 2023, driven mainly by an increase in health insurance claims activity.\nNet occupancy and equipment expenses primarily include depreciation, rent, property taxes, utilities and maintenance. Costs of capital asset additions flow\nthrough the statement of income over the lives of the assets in the form of depreciation expense. Net occupancy expense decreased $46,000, or 1%, and\nincreased $30,000, or less than 1%, for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, as compared with the same periods of 2023. At September\n30, 2024, Bancorp’s branch network consisted of 72 locations throughout Louisville, central, eastern and Northern Kentucky, as well as the MSAs of\nIndianapolis, Indiana and Cincinnati, Ohio.\nTechnology and communication expenses include computer software usage and licensing fees, equipment depreciation and expenditures related to investments\nin technology needed to maintain and improve the quality of customer delivery channels, information security and internal resources. Technology expense\nincreased $264,000, or 6%, and $1.8 million, or 14%, for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023,\nconsistent with Bancorp’s growth and continued investment in technology, including various security and compliance-related software upgrades.\nBancorp outsources processing for debit and commercial credit card operations, which generate significant revenue for the Company. These expenses typically\nfluctuate consistent with transaction volumes. Debit and credit card processing expense increased $208,000, or 13%, and $640,000, or 13%, for the three and\nnine month periods ending September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of last year, driven by increased transaction volume and customer base\nexpansion.\n75\nTable of Contents\nMarketing and business development expenses include all costs associated with promoting Bancorp, including community support, retaining customers and\nacquiring new business. Marketing and business development expenses increased $81,000, or 6%, and decreased $127,000, or 3%, for the three and nine month\nperiods ending September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods of 2023. The increase for the three month period related to higher advertising expense\ntied to time deposit product promotions, while the decrease for the nine month period stemmed largely from lower customer entertainment expenses compared\nto the prior year.\nPostage, printing and supplies expense decreased $37,000, or 4%, and increased $39,000, or 1%, for the three and nine month periods ended September 30,\n2024 compared to the same periods of 2023.\nLegal and professional fees decreased $81,000, or 8%, and increased $603,000, or 23%, for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024\ncompared to the same periods of the prior year. The decrease for the three month period is attributed mainly to lower collections-related expenses while the\nincrease for the nine month period was driven primarily by compliance-related consulting projects associated with Bancorp approaching $10 billion in total\nassets.\nFDIC insurance expense increased $158,000, or 17%, and $517,000, or 18%, for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, as compared to\nthe same periods of 2023, consistent with Bancorp’s growth.\nEffective January 1, 2024, Bancorp adopted ASU 2023-02 and began booking tax credit amortization expense for all historical and low income tax credit\nprojects as a component of income tax expense via the proportional amortization method. Such expense had previously been recorded as a component of non-\ninterest expenses. As such, no tax credit amortization expense was recorded as non-interest expense for the three and nine month periods ended September 30,\n2024. Expense of $323,000 and $970,000 was recorded in relation to amortization of tax credit investments for the three and nine month periods ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, respectively.\nCapital and deposit based taxes, which consist primarily of capital-based local income taxes and franchise taxes, increased $196,000, or 31%, and $253,000, or\n13%, for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023. Bancorp’s capital and deposit based tax expense\nis based on gross revenues appropriated to the state of Ohio (the only state Bancorp operates in with a capital-based deposit tax).\nIntangible amortization expense consists of amortization associated with the CDI of acquired deposit portfolios, as well as an intangible related to customer list\nof the WM&T business line added through a past acquisition. The intangibles are amortized on an accelerated basis over a period of approximately ten years.\nIntangible amortization expense decreased $115,000, or 10%, and $364,000, or 10%, for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared\nto the same periods of the prior year, which is attributed to the accelerated depreciation method for which intangible assets are amortized.\nOther non-interest expenses decreased $831,000, or 31%, and $1.6 million, or 20%, for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, as\ncompared to the same periods of 2023, driven largely by Bancorp’s decision not to renew the insurance captive in late 2023, in addition to the benefit of\nmodifications made to the corporate credit card reward program and a decline in fraudulent check and card losses.\n76\nTable of Contents\nIncome Tax Expense\nA comparison of income tax expense and ETR follows:\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n$/bp\n(dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Variance % Variance 2024 2023 $ Variance % Variance\nIncome before income tax expense $ 36,999 $ 34,734 $ 2,265 7% $105,222 $107,553 $ (2,331) (2%)\nIncome tax expense 7,639 7,642 (3) (0) 22,377 23,749 (1,372) (6)\nEffective tax rate 20.65% 22.00% (135) bps (6) 21.27% 22.08% (81) bps (4)\nFluctuations in the ETR are primarily attributed to the following:\n● The stock based compensation component of the ETR fluctuates consistent with the level of SAR exercise activity in addition to the levels of PSU,\nRSA and RSU vesting. The ETR was reduced by 0.36% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a reduction of 0.29% for the\nsame period of 2023, consistent with exercise and vesting activity.\n● The cash surrender value of life insurance policies can vary widely from period to period, driven largely by market changes. The related impact is\ninversely correlated with the ETR generally, with cash surrender value declines typically serving to increase the ETR and vice versa. Changes in the\ncash surrender value of life insurance policies decreased the ETR by 0.73% and 0.49% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.\n● Bancorp invests in certain partnerships that yield federal income tax credits. Taken as a whole, the tax benefit of these investments exceeds\namortization expense, resulting in a positive impact on net income. The timing and magnitude of these transactions may vary widely from period to\nperiod. Effective January 1, 2024, Bancorp adopted ASU 2023-02 and began booking tax credit amortization expense for all tax credit projects as a\ncomponent of income tax expense via the proportional amortization method. The cumulative impact of the adoption of ASU 2023-02 and tax credit\namortization for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 served to reduce the ETR 0.90%. The ETR was reduced by 0.48% by tax credit activity\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n● Tax-exempt interest income earned on loans and investment securities reduced the ETR by 0.45% and 0.49% for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023, respectively.\n● Activity related to the Captive, which previously provided tax advantages associated with the tax-deductible/exempt nature of insurance premiums\npaid to/received by the Captive, reduced the ETR by 0.27% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Bancorp elected not to renew the Captive\nduring the third quarter of 2023 and subsequently dissolved it as of December 31, 2023. No tax benefit associated with the Captive will be\nexperienced going forward.\n77\nTable of Contents\nFinancial Condition – September 30, 2024 Compared to December 31, 2023\nOverview\nTotal assets increased $267 million, or 3%, to $8.44 billion at September 30, 2024 from $8.17 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase for the first nine\nmonths of 2024 was attributed to substantial loan growth of $507 million, or 9%, which was partially offset by declines of $234 million, or 16%, in the\ninvestment securities portfolio and $13 million, or 5%, in cash and cash equivalents.\nTotal liabilities increased $191 million, or 3%, to $7.50 billion at September 30, 2024 from $7.31 billion at December 31, 2023, driven by increases of $125\nmillion, or 63%, and $55 million, or 1%, in FHLB advances and total deposits, respectively.\nStockholders’ equity increased $76 million, or 9%, to $934 million at September 30, 2024 from $858 million at December 31, 2023, as net income of $82.8\nmillion and a $17.5 million improvement in AOCI was offset by $26.7 million of cash dividends declared during the first nine months of 2024. The\nimprovement in AOCI was associated with changes in the interest rate environment and the corresponding impact on the valuation of the AFS debt securities\nportfolio and cash flow hedging derivatives. Further, a $2.5 million increase in retained earnings was recorded in relation to the adoption of ASU 2023-02\neffective January 1, 2024.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents decreased $13 million, or 5%, ending at $253 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $266 million at December 31, 2023, which\nwas the result of normal fluctuations experienced during the first nine months of 2024.\nInvestment Securities\nThe primary purpose of the investment securities portfolio is to provide another source of interest income, as well as a tool for liquidity management. In\nmanaging the composition of the balance sheet, Bancorp seeks a balance between earnings sources, credit and liquidity considerations.\nInvestment securities decreased $234 million, or 16%, to $1.24 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to $1.47 billion at December 31, 2023. This decline\nwas driven by scheduled maturities within the treasury portfolio, normal pay down activity, and to a smaller extent, a increase in the market value of the AFS\ninvestment portfolio specifically. There were no investment security purchases during the first nine months of 2024, as Bancorp has prioritized liquidity amidst\ncontinued loan growth and deposit portfolio fluctuations.\nFHLB Stock\nFHLB stock holdings increased $13 million to $29 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $16 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was driven by\nFHLB borrowing activity during the first nine months of 2024, as FHLB members are required to hold certain levels of FHLB stock in relation to the amount\nof their borrowings. Overnight borrowing activity increased during the first nine months of 2024, as a result of strong loan growth and deposit fluctuations.\nBancorp’s FHLB stock holdings will fluctuate consistent with borrowing activity from period to period.\nLoans\nTotal loans increased $507 million, or 9%, from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. While the substantial loan growth experienced during the first nine\nmonths of 2024 was well-spread across loan categories, C&D and C&I lines of credit experienced growth of 27% and 17%, respectively.\nTotal line of credit utilization has experienced steady improvement through the first nine months of 2024, ending at 43.2% as of September 30, 2024, compared\nto 39.2% at December 31, 2023 and 38.8% at September 30, 2023. Increased utilization has been experienced within the C&D and C&I portfolios, the latter of\nwhich has improved to 31.8% at September 30, 2024 from 28.6% at December 31, 2023 and 26.8% at September 30, 2023. While line utilization has trended\nupward, it still remains below pre-pandemic levels, as customers continue to utilize cash in lieu of higher costing lines of credit.\nBancorp’s credit exposure is diversified between businesses and individuals. No specific industry concentration exceeds 10% of loans outstanding. While\nBancorp has a diversified loan portfolio, a customer’s ability to honor loan agreements is somewhat dependent upon the economic stability and/or industry in\nwhich that customer does business. Loans outstanding and related unfunded commitments are primarily concentrated within Bancorp’s current market areas,\nwhich encompass the Louisville, Kentucky MSA, central, eastern and northern Kentucky, as well as the Indianapolis, Indiana and Cincinnati, Ohio MSAs.\n78\nTable of Contents\nCRE represents the largest segment of Bancorp’s loan portfolio, totaling $2.64 billion, or 42%, of total loans as of September 30, 2024. While a combination of\nsustained higher interest rates and rising central business district vacancies across the country have created credit and collateral concerns within the CRE sector\ngenerally, Bancorp believes the quality of its CRE portfolio, and the overall loan portfolio, remains solid.\nOffice building exposure, which is a sub-segment of CRE and perceived to be of particular risk in the current environment, is a smaller component of\nBancorp’s loan portfolio, totaling $546 million, or 9%, of total loans as of September 30, 2024. Approximately $218 million, or 40%, of Bancorp’s office\nbuilding exposure is medical-related, which in management’s opinion presents reduced risk compared to other CRE uses. In addition, approximately $282\nmillion, or 52%, of the office building exposure is owner-occupied and is generally accompanied by a full commercial banking relationship. This sub-segment\nis concentrated in Bancorp’s primary markets, with no exposure to large office towers and minimal exposure to central business districts, and continues to\nperform well with minimal substandard/non-accrual and past due loans as of September 30, 2024.\nBancorp occasionally enters into loan participation agreements with other banks to diversify credit risk. For certain participation loans sold, Bancorp has\nretained effective control of the loans, typically by restricting the participating institutions from pledging or selling their ownership share of the loan without\npermission from Bancorp. GAAP requires the participated portion of these loans to be recorded as secured borrowings. These participated loans are included in\nthe C&I and CRE loan portfolio segments with a corresponding liability recorded in other liabilities. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total\nparticipated portion of loans of this nature totaled $2 million and $4 million, respectively.\nThe following table presents the maturity distribution (based on contractual maturity) and rate sensitivity of the total loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024:\nMaturity\nAfter one After five\nWithin one but within but within Ater fifteen\nSeptember 30, 2024 (in thousands) year five years fifteen years years Total % of Total\nFixed rate $ 390,031 $ 2,071,509 $ 963,557 $ 919,635 $ 4,344,732 69%\nVariable rate 738,481 694,318 470,932 29,670 1,933,401 31%\nTotal loans $ 1,128,512 $ 2,765,827 $ 1,434,489 $ 949,305 $ 6,278,133 100%\nIn the event where Bancorp structures a loan with a maturity exceeding five years (typically CRE loans), an automatic rate adjustment will typically be set in\nplace at five years from origination date to limit interest rate sensitivity.\n79\nTable of Contents\nNon-performing Loans and Assets\nInformation summarizing non-performing loans and assets follows:\n(dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nNon-accrual loans $ 16,288 $ 19,058\nModifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty - -\nLoans past due 90 days or more and still accruing 870 110\nTotal non-performing loans 17,158 19,168\nOther real estate owned 10 10\nTotal non-performing assets $ 17,168 $ 19,178\nNon-performing loans to total loans 0.27% 0.33%\nNon-performing assets to total assets 0.20% 0.23%\nACL for loans to total non-performing loans 497% 414%\nAs of September 30, 2024, non-accrual loans totaled $16 million compared to $19 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease in total non-accrual loans\nbetween December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024 stemmed mainly from the payoffs of two larger and unrelated CRE relationships that were on non-accrual\nstatus as of December 31, 2023.\nNon-performing assets as of September 30, 2024 consisted of 128 loans, ranging in individual amounts up to $3 million, and one residential real estate property\nheld as OREO.\nDelinquent Loans\nDelinquent loans (consisting of all loans 30 days or more past due) totaled $28 million and $17 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nDelinquent loans to total loans were 0.44% and 0.30% at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase in delinquent loans over this\nperiod was driven by 44 owner-occupied residential real estate loans totaling $6 million that were 30 days past due and two unrelated CRE relationships\ntotaling $4 million that went past due during the third quarter. $9 million of loans in delinquent status as of September 30, 2024 became current in October\n2024, including $2 million of loans that fully paid off.\nClassified Loans\nClassified loans, which consist of loans defined as OAEM, substandard, substandard non-performing (including non-accrual loans discussed above) and\ndoubtful, totaled $167 million and $96 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The increase over this period was driven mainly by loans\nclassified as OAEM and substandard, which increased $66 million in total over this period.\nLoans classified as OAEM have potential weaknesses requiring management’s heightened attention that may result in deterioration of repayment prospects on\nthe loan or of Bancorp’s credit position at some future date. OAEM loans totaled $100 million and $34 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, respectively. The increase in OAEM loans experienced between December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024 was driven by a small number of\nrelationships that were downgraded to OAEM, with one C&I relationship representing $16 million of the increase. Further, approximately $15 million of notes\nclassified as OAEM as of September 30, 2024 represent loans that have been upgraded from the substandard classification during 2024. As of September 30,\n2024, $83 million, or 83%, of loans classified as OAEM were current with their contractual payments.\n80\nTable of Contents\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Loans\nThe ACL for loans is a valuation allowance for loans estimated at each balance sheet date in accordance with GAAP. When Bancorp deems all or a portion of a\nloan to be uncollectible, the appropriate amount is written off and the ACL is reduced by the same amount. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the\nACL when received. Allocations of the ACL may be made for specific loans, but the entire ACL for loans is available for any loan that, in Bancorp’s judgment,\nshould be charged-off. See the Footnote titled “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” from Bancorp’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for\ndiscussion of Bancorp’s ACL methodology on loans.\nBancorp’s ACL for loans was $85 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to $79 million as of December 31, 2023. Provision expense for credit losses on\nloans of $6.6 million was recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consistent with strong loan growth and deterioration in the FRB\nunemployment forecast. Net charge offs of $606,000 were recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, serving to reduce the ACL for loans.\nThe ACL for loans calculation and resulting credit loss expense is significantly impacted by changes in forecasted economic conditions. Should the forecast for\neconomic conditions change, Bancorp could experience further adjustments in its required ACL for loans credit loss expense.\nThe following table sets forth the ACL by category of loan:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n% of Total ACL for % of Total ACL for\nAllocated ACL on loans to Allocated ACL on loans to\n(dollars in thousands) Allowance loans Total Loans Allowance loans Total Loans\nCommercial real estate - non-owner occupied $ 13,328 16% 0.79% $ 22,133 28% 1.42%\nCommercial real estate - owner occupied 9,367 11% 0.98% 11,667 15% 1.29%\nTotal commercial real estate 22,695 27% 0.86% 33,800 43% 1.37%\nCommercial and industrial - term 21,239 25% 2.46% 14,359 18% 1.66%\nCommercial and industrial - lines of credit 6,502 8% 1.27% 6,495 8% 1.48%\nTotal commercial and industrial 27,741 33% 2.02% 20,854 26% 1.60%\nResidential real estate - owner occupied 13,945 16% 1.78% 9,316 12% 1.31%\nResidential real estate - non-owner occupied 4,940 6% 1.30% 4,282 5% 1.19%\nTotal residential real estate 18,885 22% 1.62% 13,598 17% 1.27%\nConstruction and land development 11,651 14% 1.73% 7,593 10% 1.43%\nHome equity lines of credit 1,234 1% 0.52% 1,660 2% 0.79%\nConsumer 2,460 3% 1.71% 1,407 2% 0.97%\nLeases 402 0% 2.40% 220 0% 1.42%\nCredit cards 275 0% 1.05% 242 0% 1.02%\nTotal $ 85,343 100% 1.36% $ 79,374 100% 1.38%\nThe allocation of the ACL for loans amongst respective segments of the loan portfolio experienced a shift between December 31, 2023 and September 30,\n2024, most notably within the CRE and C&I categories. This shift was driven by a thorough evaluation of the qualitative factors within the CECL methodology\nperformed during the second quarter as part of Bancorp’s analysis, which resulted in a larger allocation of the ACL to the C&I segment and a reduced\nallocation of the ACL to the CRE segment.\nThe larger qualitative allocation that had previously been assigned to the CRE portfolio stemmed from pandemic-era concerns surrounding certain\nconcentrations within this segment and subsequent concerns related to the impact of rising interest rates. As the CRE portfolio has continued to perform well\ndespite higher interest rates and the prospect of interest rate decreases are on the horizon, these original concerns have been alleviated. Further, there has been\nminimal charge-off activity within the CRE portfolio for several quarters and delinquent loans within the segment have trended downward. Considering all of\nthese factors, management believes a lower qualitative allocation to the CRE portfolio was warranted.\n81\nTable of Contents\nOffsetting the reduced qualitative allocation for the CRE portfolio as of September 30, 2024 was an increased qualitative allocation for the C&I portfolio. C&I\nconcerns were driven by both recent and long-term charge off activity being concentrated in this portfolio, increased specific reserves, and higher levels of\nOAEM and substandard loans within the C&I segment. Further, C&I customers have generally been more strained by current economic conditions and the\ndramatic increase in interest rates due to exposure to the variable rate structure of many C&I loans. As such, management believed a higher qualitative\nallocation to the C&I portfolio was warranted.\nThe table below details net charge-offs to average loans outstanding by category of loan for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively.\n2024 2023\nNet (charge Net (charge\noffs)/ offs)/\nNet (charge recoveries Net (charge recoveries\nThree months ended September 30, offs)/ Average to average offs)/ Average to average\n(dollars in thousands) recoveries Loans loans recoveries Loans loans\nCommercial real estate - non-owner\noccupied $ 18 $ 1,669,466 0.00% $ 17 $ 1,485,582 0.00%\nCommercial real estate - owner occupied - 946,239 0.00% 6 899,796 0.00%\nTotal commercial real estate 18 2,615,705 0.00% 23 2,385,378 0.00%\nCommercial and industrial - term (591) 866,705 -0.07% (1,862) 810,604 -0.23%\nCommercial and industrial - lines of credit - 501,374 0.00% 1 436,179 0.00%\nTotal commercial and industrial (591) 1,368,079 -0.04% (1,861) 1,246,783 -0.15%\nResidential real estate - owner occupied (391) 766,574 -0.05% 6 667,786 0.00%\nResidential real estate - non-owner\noccupied 7 373,434 0.00% - 341,276 0.00%\nTotal residential real estate (384) 1,140,008 -0.03% 6 1,009,062 0.00%\nConstruction and land development - 630,845 0.00% - 462,092 0.00%\nHome equity lines of credit - 230,053 0.00% - 204,466 0.00%\nConsumer (86) 147,447 -0.06% (101) 141,453 -0.07%\nLeases - 17,008 0.00% - 14,116 0.00%\nCredit cards (94) 25,164 -0.37% (2) 22,912 -0.01%\nTotal $ (1,137) $ 6,174,309 -0.02% $ (1,935) $ 5,486,262 -0.04%\n2024 2023\nNet (charge Net (charge\noffs)/ offs)/\nNet (charge recoveries Net (charge recoveries\nNine months ended September 30, offs)/ Average to average offs)/ Average to average\n(dollars in thousands) recoveries Loans loans recoveries Loans loans\nCommercial real estate - non-owner\noccupied $ 51 $ 1,625,903 0.00% $ 53 $ 1,442,236 0.00%\nCommercial real estate - owner occupied 49 932,038 0.01% 6 870,630 0.00%\nTotal commercial real estate 100 2,557,941 0.00% 59 2,312,866 0.00%\nCommercial and industrial - term (126) 865,401 -0.01% (1,990) 792,245 -0.25%\nCommercial and industrial - lines of credit 204 467,513 0.04% 150 437,250 0.03%\nTotal commercial and industrial 78 1,332,914 0.01% (1,840) 1,229,495 -0.15%\nResidential real estate - owner occupied (392) 740,579 -0.05% (16) 639,207 0.00%\nResidential real estate - non-owner\noccupied 7 366,270 0.00% 2 329,391 0.00%\nTotal residential real estate (385) 1,106,849 -0.03% (14) 968,598 0.00%\nConstruction and land development - 580,720 0.00% - 451,353 0.00%\nHome equity lines of credit 2 220,764 0.00% (12) 200,588 -0.01%\nConsumer (241) 146,168 -0.16% (263) 138,918 -0.19%\nLeases - 16,518 0.00% - 13,715 0.00%\nCredit cards (160) 24,492 -0.65% (86) 21,960 -0.39%\nTotal $ (606) $ 5,986,366 -0.01% $ (2,156) $ 5,337,493 -0.04%\n82\nTable of Contents\nWhile separate from the ACL for loans and recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, the ACL for off balance sheet credit exposures also\nexperienced an increase between December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024. Provision for credit loss expense for off balance sheet credit exposures of\n$475,000 was recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, driven largely by increased availability within the C&D portfolio. The ACL for off\nbalance sheet credit exposures totaled $6.3 million as of September 30, 2024.\nPremises and Equipment\nPremises and equipment are presented on the consolidated balance sheets net of related depreciation on the respective assets, as well as fair value adjustments\nassociated with purchase accounting. Premises and equipment increased $10 million, or 10%, between December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, which was\nprimarily the result of right-of-use lease asset additions. Bancorp’s branch network currently consists of 72 locations throughout Louisville, central, eastern and\nnorthern, Kentucky, as well as the Indianapolis, Indiana and Cincinnati, Ohio markets.\nPremises held for sale totaling $2.3 million and $2.5 million was recorded on Bancorp’s consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December\n31, 2023, which consists of three vacant parcels of land, a former administrative building and one former branch location.\nGoodwill\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Bancorp had $194 million in goodwill recorded on its balance sheet. Goodwill of $58 million and $123\nmillion is attributed to the acquisitions of CB and KB in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Additionally, goodwill totaling $12 million and $682,000 is attributed to\nthe acquisitions of KSB and Austin State Bank in 2019 and 1996, respectively. The acquisition of TBOC in 2013 resulted in a bargain purchase gain.\nEvents that may trigger goodwill impairment include deterioration in economic conditions, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics (i.e. stock price\ndeclining below tangible book value), negative trends in overall financial performance and regulatory actions. At September 30, 2024, Bancorp performed its\nannual qualitative assessment to determine if it was more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their carrying value, including\ngoodwill. The qualitative assessment indicated that it was not more-likely-than-not that the carrying value of the reporting units exceeded their fair value.\nCore Deposit and Customer List Intangibles\nCDIs and CLIs arising from business acquisitions are initially measured at fair value and are then amortized on an accelerated method based on their useful\nlives. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Bancorp’s CDI assets totaled $10 million and $12 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023, Bancorp’s CLI assets were $7 million and $8 million, respectively, and attributed entirely to the WM&T segment.\nOther Assets and Other Liabilities\nOther assets decreased $7 million, or 2%, to $280 million between December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024. Other liabilities increased $20 million, or 8%,\nto $267 million over the same period. The decrease in other assets stems mainly from market value changes in interest rate swap assets and amortization of\nMSR assets. The increase in other liabilities was driven largely by right-of-use lease liability additions (the balance sheet offset of the previously mentioned\nright-of-use asset additions) and increases in accrued tax liabilities and other miscellaneous accruals.\nDeposits\nTotal deposits increased $55 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. Interest bearing deposits increased $95 million, or 2%, outpacing\nthe $40 million, or 3% decrease in non-interest bearing deposits, as depositors continued shifting into higher-yielding alternatives in the current environment.\nBancorp continues to experience a shift in the deposit portfolio mix, as customers continue to seek higher-yielding alternatives to low-rate or non-interest\nbearing deposits in the higher rate environment. As a result, the cost of interest-bearing deposits rose to 2.59% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,\ncompared to 1.55% for the same period of the prior year, with the cost of total deposits (including non-interest deposits) rising to 1.99% from 1.11%. While\ndeposit costs have placed pressure on NIM in 2024, they are expected to moderate in tandem with anticipated interest rate reductions from the FRB.\n83\nTable of Contents\nSecurities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase\nSSUAR declined $3 million, or 2%, between December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, ending at $150 million as of September 30, 2024.\nSSUAR represent a funding source of Bancorp and are used by commercial customers in conjunction with collateralized corporate cash management accounts.\nSuch repurchase agreements are considered financing agreements and mature within one business day from the transaction date. At September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, all of these financing arrangements had overnight maturities and were secured by government sponsored enterprise obligations and\ngovernment agency mortgage-backed securities that were owned and controlled by Bancorp.\nSSUAR are collateralized by securities and are treated as financings; accordingly, the securities involved with the agreements are recorded as assets and are\nheld by a safekeeping agent and the obligations to repurchase the securities are reflected as liabilities. All securities underlying the agreements are under\nBancorp’s control.\nFederal Funds Purchased\nFFP and other short-term borrowing balances decreased $6 million between December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, FFP related\nmainly to excess liquidity held by downstream correspondent bank customers of Bancorp.\nSubordinated Debentures\nBancorp owns the following unconsolidated trust subsidiaries: Commonwealth Statutory Trust III, Commonwealth Statutory Trust IV and Commonwealth\nStatutory Trust V. The sole assets of the trust subsidiaries represent the proceeds of offerings loaned in exchange for subordinated debentures with similar terms\nto the TPS. The TPS are treated as part of Tier 1 Capital. The subordinated note and related interest expense are included in Bancorp’s consolidated financial\nstatements. The subordinated notes are currently redeemable at Bancorp’s option on a quarterly basis. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nsubordinated notes totaled $27 million, respectively.\nFHLB Advances\nFHLB advances outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 totaled $325 million and $200 million, respectively. Total advances at September\n30, 2024 included a $300 million three-month rolling advance related to four separate interest rate swaps (cash flow hedges) entered into in an effort to secure\nlonger-term funding at more attractive rates in addition to a $25 million overnight advance. At December 31, 2023, total advances consisted of a $200 million\nthree-month rolling advance related to three separate interest rate swaps (cash flow hedges). For more information related to the interest rate swaps noted\nabove, see the footnote titled, “Derivative Financial Instruments.”\nOvernight advances have been utilized more frequently during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of substantial loan growth and deposit\nfluctuations.\nLiquidity\nThe role of liquidity management is to ensure funds are available to meet depositors’ withdrawal and borrowers’ credit demands while at the same time\nmaximizing profitability. This is accomplished by balancing changes in demand for funds with changes in supply of those funds. Liquidity is provided by short-\nterm assets that can be converted to cash, AFS debt securities, various lines of credit available to Bancorp, and the ability to attract funds from external sources,\nprincipally deposits. Management believes it has the ability to increase deposits at any time by offering rates slightly higher than market rate.\nBancorp’s Asset/Liability Committee is comprised of senior management and has direct oversight responsibility for Bancorp’s liquidity position and profile. A\ncombination of reports provided to management details internal liquidity metrics, composition and level of the liquid asset portfolio, timing differences in\nshort-term cash flow obligations, and exposure to contingent draws on Bancorp’s liquidity.\nBancorp’s most liquid assets are comprised of cash and due from banks, FFS and AFS debt securities. FFS and interest bearing deposits totaled $144 million\nand $171 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease experienced for the first nine months of 2024 is attributed mainly\nto loan funding activity and deposit balance fluctuations. FFS normally have overnight maturities while interest-bearing deposits in banks are accessible on\ndemand. These investments are generally used for daily liquidity purposes.\n84\nTable of Contents\nThe fair value of the AFS debt security portfolio was $862 million and $1.03 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease\nin AFS debt security portfolio for the first nine months of 2024 was attributed to scheduled maturities, mainly within the treasury portfolio, and normal pay\ndown activity, offset partially by market value appreciation during the period. The investment portfolio (HTM and AFS) includes total cash flows on\namortizing debt securities of approximately $362 million (based on assumed prepayment speeds as of September 30, 2024) expected over the next 12 months,\nincluding $174 million of contractual maturities. Combined with FFS and interest bearing deposits from banks, AFS debt securities offer substantial resources\nto meet either loan growth or reductions in Bancorp’s deposit funding base. Bancorp pledges portions of its investment securities portfolio to secure public\nfunds, cash balances of certain WM&T accounts and SSUAR. At September 30, 2024, the total carrying value of investment securities pledged for these\npurposes comprised 67% of the debt securities portfolio, leaving approximately $403 million of unpledged debt securities, compared to 67% and $480 million\nat December 31, 2023, respectively.\nBancorp’s deposit base consists mainly of core deposits, which are defined as demand, savings, and money market deposit accounts, time deposits less than or\nequal to $250,000, and excludes public funds and brokered deposits. At September 30, 2024, such deposits totaled $5.92 billion and represented 88% of\nBancorp’s total deposits, as compared with $5.78 billion, or 87% of total deposits at December 31, 2023. Because these core deposits are less volatile and are\noften tied to other products of Bancorp through long lasting relationships, they do not place undue pressure on liquidity. However, given the intense, industry-\nwide deposit pricing pressure that is currently being experienced, deposits may generally be more sensitive to market rates, with potential decreases possibly\nstraining Bancorp’s liquidity position.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Bancorp held brokered deposits totaling $203,000 and $597,000, respectively.\nIncluded in total deposit balances at September 30, 2024 are $478 million in public funds generally comprised of accounts with local government agencies and\npublic school districts in the markets in which Bancorp operates. At December 31, 2023, public funds deposits totaled $613 million, the decrease experienced\nduring the first nine months of 2024 was attributed largely to normal seasonal public funds run-off.\nBancorp is a member of the FHLB of Cincinnati. As a member of the FHLB, Bancorp has access to credit products of the FHLB. Bancorp views these\nborrowings as a potential low cost alternative to brokered deposits. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, available credit from the FHLB totaled\n$1.21 billion and $1.33 billion, respectively. Bancorp also had unsecured FFP lines with correspondent banks totaling $80 million at both September 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023, respectively.\nDuring the normal course of business, Bancorp enters into certain forms of off-balance sheet transactions, including unfunded loan commitments and letters of\ncredit. These transactions are managed through Bancorp’s various risk management processes. Management considers both on-balance sheet and off-balance\nsheet transactions in its evaluation of Bancorp’s liquidity.\nBancorp’s principal source of cash is dividends paid to it as the sole shareholder of the Bank. As discussed in the Footnote titled “Commitments and Contingent\nLiabilities,” as of January 1st of any year, the Bank may pay dividends in an amount equal to the Bank’s net income of the prior two years less any dividends\npaid for the same two years. At September 30, 2024, the Bank could pay an amount equal to $190 million in dividends to Bancorp without regulatory approval\nsubject to ongoing capital requirements of the Bank.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nCash flow is provided primarily through financing activities of Bancorp, which include raising deposits and borrowing funds from institutional sources such as\nadvances from FHLB and FFP, as well as scheduled loan repayments and cash flows from debt securities. These funds are primarily used to facilitate\ninvestment activities of Bancorp, which include making loans and purchasing securities for the investment portfolio. Another important source of cash is net\nincome of the Bank from operating activities. For further detail regarding the sources and uses of cash, see the “Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash\nFlows” in Bancorp’s consolidated financial statements.\n85\nTable of Contents\nCommitments\nIn the normal course of business, Bancorp is party to activities that contain credit, market and operational risk that are not reflected in whole or in part in\nBancorp’s consolidated financial statements. Such activities include traditional off-balance sheet credit-related financial instruments, commitments under\noperating leases and long-term debt.\nBancorp provides customers with off-balance sheet credit support through loan commitments and standby letters of credit. Unused loan commitments\ndecreased $43 million, or 2%, as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023, as a result of increased line of credit utilization.\nMost commitments to extend credit are an agreement to lend to a customer as long as collateral is available as agreed upon and there is no violation of any\ncondition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Since some of the commitments are\nexpected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Bancorp uses the same\ncredit and collateral policies in making commitments and conditional guarantees as for on-balance sheet instruments. Bancorp evaluates each customer’s\ncreditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained is based on management’s credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral held varies,\nbut may include accounts receivable, inventory, securities, equipment and real estate. However, should the commitments be drawn upon and should our\ncustomers default on their resulting obligation to us, our maximum exposure to credit loss, without consideration of collateral, is represented by the contractual\namount of those instruments.\nThe ACL for off balance sheet credit exposures, which is separate from the ACL for loans and recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets,\nwas $6.3 million and $5.9 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Provision expense for off balance sheet credit exposures of\n$475,000 was recorded for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, driven largely by increased availability within the C&D portfolio.\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by Bancorp to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party beneficiary. Those\nguarantees are primarily issued to support commercial transactions. Standby letters of credit generally have maturities of one to two years.\nIn addition to owned banking facilities, Bancorp has entered into long-term leasing arrangements for certain facilities. Bancorp also has required future\npayments for a non-qualified defined benefit retirement plan, TPS and the maturity of time deposits.\nSee the footnote titled “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” for additional information regarding commitments.\nCapital\nAt September 30, 2024, stockholders’ equity totaled $934 million, representing an increase of $76 million, or 9%, compared to December 31, 2023, as net\nincome of $82.8 million and a $17.5 million improvement in AOCI was offset by $26.7 million of dividends declared during the first nine months of 2024. The\nimprovement in AOCI was associated with changes in the interest rate environment and the corresponding impact on the valuation of the AFS debt securities\nportfolio and cash flow hedging derivatives. Further, a $2.5 million increase in retained earnings was recorded in relation to the adoption of ASU 2023-02\neffective January 1, 2024. See the “Condensed Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders’ Equity” for further detail of changes in equity.\nBancorp’s TCE ratio and tangible book value per share, both non-GAAP disclosures, experienced improvement between December 31, 2023 and September\n30, 2024, which stemmed largely from recording net income of $82.8 million. TCE was 8.79% at September 30, 2024 compared to 8.09% at December 31,\n2023, while tangible book value per share was $24.58 at September 30, 2024, compared to $21.95 at December 31, 2023. See the section titled “Non-GAAP\nFinancial Measures” for reconcilement of non-GAAP to GAAP measures.\nIn May 2023, Bancorp’s Board of Directors extended its share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to 1 million shares, or approximately 4% of\nBancorp’s total common shares outstanding at the time. The plan, which will expire in May 2025 unless otherwise extended or completed at an earlier date,\ndoes not obligate Bancorp to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of shares prior to the plan’s expiration. No shares were repurchased in 2023, nor\nthe first nine months of 2024, as Bancorp continues to prioritize capital preservation and liquidity management. As of September 30, 2024, approximately\n741,000 shares remain eligible for repurchase under the current repurchase plan.\n86\nTable of Contents\nBank holding companies and their subsidiary banks are required by regulators to meet risk-based capital standards. These standards, or ratios, measure the\nrelationship of capital to a combination of balance sheet and off-balance sheet risks. The value of both balance sheet and off-balance sheet items are adjusted to\nreflect credit risks. See the Footnote titled “Regulatory Matters” for additional detail regarding regulatory capital requirements, as well as capital ratios of\nBancorp and the Bank. The Bank exceeds regulatory capital ratios required to be well-capitalized. Regulatory framework does not define well capitalized for\nholding companies. Management considers the effects of growth on capital ratios as it contemplates plans for expansion.\nCapital ratios as of September 30, 2024 increased compared December 31, 2023, as a result of strong operating results, which helped offset substantial risk-\nweighted asset growth from the loan portfolio. Bancorp continues to exceed the regulatory requirements for all calculations. Bancorp and the Bank intend to\nmaintain a capital position that meets or exceeds the “well-capitalized” requirements as defined by the FRB and the FDIC, in addition to the capital\nconservation buffer.\nBanking regulators have categorized the Bank as well-capitalized. To meet the definition of well-capitalized for prompt corrective action requirements, a bank\nmust have a minimum 6.5% Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio, 8.0% Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio, 10.0% Total Risk-Based Capital ratio and\n5.0% Tier 1 Leverage ratio.\nAdditionally, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers,\nBancorp and the Bank must hold a 2.5% capital conservation buffer composed of Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital above the minimum risk-based\ncapital requirements for the Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio, Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio and Total Risk-Based Capital ratio necessary to be\nconsidered adequately-capitalized. At September 30, 2024, the adequately-capitalized minimums, including the capital conservation buffer, were a 7.0%\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio, 8.5% Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio and 10.5% Total Risk-Based Capital ratio.\nAs previously noted, Bancorp is the 100% owner of three unconsolidated trust subsidiaries. The sole assets of the trust subsidiaries represent the proceeds of\nofferings loaned in exchange for subordinated debentures with similar terms to the TPS. The TPS are treated as part of Tier 1 Capital. The subordinated note\nand related interest expense are included in Bancorp’s consolidated financial statements. The subordinated notes are currently redeemable at Bancorp’s option\non a quarterly basis. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, subordinated notes totaled $27 million, respectively.\nAs permitted by the interim final rule issued on March 27, 2020 by the federal banking regulatory agencies, Bancorp elected the option to delay the estimated\nimpact on regulatory capital related to the adoption of ASC 326 “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses,” or CECL, which was effective January 1, 2020. The\ninitial impact of adoption of ASC 326, as well as 25% of the quarterly increases in the ACL subsequent to adoption of ASC 326 (collectively the “transition\nadjustments”) were delayed for two years. After two years, the cumulative amount of the transition adjustments became fixed and will be phased out of the\nregulatory capital calculations evenly over a three-year period, with 75% recognized in year three, 50% recognized in year four and 25% recognized in year\nfive. After five years, the temporary regulatory capital benefits will be fully reversed. 2024 represents the fifth and final year of the transition period for\nBancorp. Had Bancorp not elected to defer the regulatory capital impact of CECL, the post ASC 326 adoption capital ratios of Bancorp and the Bank would\nstill have exceeded the well-capitalized level.\n87\nTable of Contents\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of total stockholders’ equity in accordance with GAAP to tangible stockholders’ equity (TCE), a non-GAAP\ndisclosure. Bancorp provides the TCE per share, a non-GAAP measure, in addition to those defined by banking regulators, based on its widespread use by\ninvestors as a means to evaluate capital adequacy:\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nTotal stockholders' equity - GAAP (a) $ 934,094 $ 858,103\nLess: Goodwill (194,074) (194,074)\nLess: Core deposit and other intangibles (17,149) (20,304)\nTangible common equity - Non-GAAP (c) $ 722,871 $ 643,725\nTotal assets - GAAP (b) $ 8,437,280 $ 8,170,102\nLess: Goodwill (194,074) (194,074)\nLess: Core deposit and other intangibles (17,149) (20,304)\nTangible assets - Non-GAAP (d) $ 8,226,057 $ 7,955,724\nTotal stockholders' equity to total assets - GAAP (a/b) 11.07% 10.50%\nTangible common equity to tangible assets - Non-GAAP (c/d) 8.79% 8.09%\nTotal shares outstanding (e) 29,414 29,329\nBook value per share - GAAP (a/e) $ 31.76 $ 29.26\nTangible common equity per share - Non-GAAP (c/e) 24.58 21.95\nThe efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP measure, equals total non-interest expenses divided by the sum of net interest income FTE and non-interest income. In\naddition to the efficiency ratio presented, Bancorp considers an adjusted efficiency ratio. Bancorp believes it is important because it provides a comparable\nratio after eliminating net gains (losses) on sales, calls, and impairment of investment securities, as well as net gains (losses) on sales of premises and\nequipment and disposition of any acquired assets, if applicable, and the fluctuation in non-interest expenses related to amortization of investments in tax credit\npartnerships and non-recurring merger expenses, if applicable.\nThree months ended September Nine months ended September\n30, 30,\n(dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nTotal non-interest expenses (a) $ 48,452 $ 46,702 $ 146,522 $ 137,816\nLess: Amortization of investments in tax credit partnerships — (323) — (970)\nTotal non-interest expenses - Non-GAAP (c) $ 48,452 $ 46,379 $ 146,522 $ 136,846\nTotal net interest income, FTE $ 65,064 $ 61,437 $ 187,344 $ 185,757\nTotal non-interest income 24,797 22,896 71,723 67,803\nTotal revenue - Non-GAAP (b) 89,861 84,333 259,067 253,560\nLess: Gain/loss on sale of premises and equipment 59 (302) 39 (75)\nLess: Gain/loss on sale of securities — — — —\nTotal adjusted revenue - Non-GAAP (d) $ 89,920 $ 84,031 $ 259,106 $ 253,485\nEfficiency ratio - Non-GAAP (a/b) 53.92% 55.38% 56.56% 54.35%\nAdjusted efficiency ratio - Non-GAAP (c/d) 53.88% 55.19% 56.55% 53.99%\n88\nTable of Contents\nItem 3.
