FullCircl is a leading UK-based SaaS platform, built to help financial institutions and regulated companies grow revenue, automate and accelerate onboarding, and improve client lifecycle management by removing regulatory and verification roadblocks.\n\n[nCino and FullCircl formally partnered in 2023](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=FQC-J5bSoESQpLZUNvCb4K4SEBh4W_Q3h5ESRQu5Q7wMCQs63VDbkuTWSTXOCHAd_tJat-xS8-p4kJIrVnp0fuvyL15VjpAywMSPr6a486SnwXtVeK8iKP6EBgN5-kNRZMSYxO6F6x4czYlO27NrBDZstHQJT6qjIbHl_-gkW49fQ-7UgfmjnOkDbB4YKVrLelhE4BOHh356pTD4nblPsKzcPj55NQyk2XmHYaTXUcQpuVZ9qcKWQZfHLPRxbQUynaUS1ukbtpLbdVEDLFmB-g==) to bring FullCircl’s data capabilities into the nCino Platform to improve the speed, efficiency, and compliance with which financial institutions acquire, onboard, and serve clients. FullCircl and nCino share several mutual customers, ranging from some of the largest institutions in the UK to niche incumbents and neobanks serving the SME space. The joint proposition can not only create a better client and staff experience for financial institutions, but can contribute to their growth and profitability gains, too.\n\n\"Our ongoing relationship with nCino and FullCircl’s integrated offering will empower us to streamline our application processes, improve our decisioning pace, and speed up loan completions,” said Jake Brook, Lending Change Manager from Yorkshire Building Society. “Automating client data collection and validation will enhance transparency for borrowers and improve the client journey, throughout their lifecycle, not just at onboarding.\"\n\nThe acquisition of FullCircl will provide nCino with new capabilities for onboarding and client lifecycle management. FullCircl offers a powerful business rules-engine that can simplify the complexity of onboarding underpinned by an array of pre-contracted premium data-supply. Additionally, FullCircl’s technology provides frontline teams access to business development tooling to profile a comprehensive graph-database of extensive connected company-data, including news and insights, detailed financial information, credit scores, risk profiles, ultimate beneficial ownership, import/export, legal notices, adverse director history and other critical profiling data.\n\n\"The acquisition of FullCircl is a strategic move for nCino that will not only enhance our data and automation capabilities but also enables us to expand our reach across the UK and more broadly in Europe with an end-to-end experience for full client lifecycle management,” said Pierre Naudé, Chairman and CEO at nCino. “Having worked closely with the FullCircl team for some time now, we recognized the value our joint technology can deliver, and this acquisition marks an exciting step forward in our mission of driving innovation and powering a new era in financial services.”\n\nAndrew Yates, CEO and Cofounder at FullCircl added, “We have been working with the nCino team for several years, and the close alignment in both organisations across vision, culture, customers, product and market opportunity have contributed to this exciting acquisition making perfect sense. We both serve regulated industries who walk a tightrope between a strict operating rulebook and a mandate to deliver growth and shareholder value, all while providing a seamless client experience. This marks a significant new chapter for FullCircl as we become part of nCino.”\n\nThe purchase price for FullCircl is One Hundred and Thirty-Five Million Dollars ($135,000,000) in cash, subject to customary adjustments (the “Purchase Price”). Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000) of the Purchase Price will be retained by nCino for two years following the closing of the transaction as security for the performance of certain warranties and covenants arising under the purchase agreement. nCino plans to provide an update on the financial impact of this acquisition in connection with its third quarter earnings release. \n\n**About nCino** nCino (NASDAQ: NCNO) is powering a new era in financial services.

not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. In addition to its GAAP measures, nCino uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally for budgeting and resource allocation purposes and in analyzing our financial results. For the reasons set forth below, nCino believes that excluding the following items provides information that is helpful in understanding our operating results, evaluating our future prospects, comparing our financial results across accounting periods, and comparing our financial results to our peers, many of which provide similar non-GAAP financial measures.\n\n  * Amortization of Purchased Intangibles. nCino incurs amortization expense for purchased intangible assets in connection with certain mergers and acquisitions. Because these costs have already been incurred, cannot be recovered, are non-cash, and are affected by the inherent subjective nature of purchase price allocations, nCino excludes these expenses for our internal management reporting processes. nCino’s management also finds it useful to exclude these charges when assessing the appropriate level of various operating expenses and resource allocations when budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods. Although nCino excludes amortization expense for purchased intangibles from these non-GAAP measures, management believes it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation.\n  * Stock-Based Compensation Expenses. nCino excludes stock-based compensation expenses primarily because they are non-cash expenses that nCino excludes from our internal management reporting processes. nCino’s management also finds it useful to exclude these expenses when they assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses and resource allocations when budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use, nCino believes excluding stock-based compensation expenses allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between our recurring core business operating results and those of other companies.\n  * Acquisition-Related Expenses. nCino excludes expenses related to acquisitions as they limit comparability of operating results with prior periods. We believe these costs, which are primarily related to legal, consulting and other professional services fees, are non-recurring in nature and outside the ordinary course of business. \n  * Litigation Expenses. nCino excludes fees and expenses related to litigation expenses incurred from legal matters outside the ordinary course of our business as we believe their exclusion from non-GAAP operating expenses will facilitate a more meaningful explanation of operating results and comparisons with prior period results.\n  * Restructuring Costs. nCino excludes costs incurred related to bespoke restructuring plans and other one-time costs that are fundamentally different in strategic nature and frequency from ongoing initiatives. We believe excluding these costs facilitates a more consistent comparison of operating performance over time.\n  * Tax Benefit Related to Acquisitions. In connection with deferred tax liabilities assumed from acquisitions, nCino may reduce the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, resulting in a one-time tax benefit recorded in Income tax provision (benefit). We believe that the exclusion of this benefit from our non-GAAP net income attributable to nCino and non-GAAP net income attributable to nCino per share provides a more direct comparison to all periods presented. \n  * Income Tax Effect on Non-GAAP Adjustments. The income tax effects are related to the imputed tax impact on the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP costs and expenses.\n  * Adjustment to Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest. nCino adjusts the value of redeemable non-controlling interest of its joint venture nCino K.K. in accordance with the operating agreement for that entity. nCino believes investors benefit from an understanding of the company’s operating results absent the effect of this adjustment, and for comparability, has reconciled this adjustment for previously reported non-GAAP results.\n\n\n\nThere are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures because non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures provided by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by nCino’s management about which items are adjusted to calculate its non-GAAP financial measures. nCino compensates for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis and also by providing GAAP measures in its public disclosures. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. nCino encourages investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business, and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures has been provided in the tables below. \n\n**nCino, Inc.**  \n---  \n**RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES**  \n(In thousands, except share and per share data)  \n(Unaudited)  \n**Three Months Ended July 31,**| **Six Months Ended July 31,**  \n**2023**| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**  \n**GAAP total revenues**|  $| 117,236| $| 132,403| $| 230,908| $| 260,490  \n**GAAP cost of subscription revenues**|  $| 29,719| $| 33,367| $| 58,876| $| 65,147  \nAmortization expense -
