This includes a $20 million milestone payment related to the tab-cel BLA acceptance that was received from Pierre Fabre in August 2024, $15.5 million from Pierre Fabre for the purchase of certain existing tab-cel intermediate inventory in September 2024, and gross proceeds of $36 million from a registered direct offering completed in September 2024. The financing was led by existing top institutional investors with participation from a new strategic investor and was completed at a 15% premium to Atara’s 7-day volume-weighted average price \n  * Net cash used in operating activities was $4.0 million for the third quarter 2024, as compared to $51.3 million in the same period in 2023 \n    * Q3 2024 net cash used in operating activities included a $6.0 million sub-licensing fee payment, which was paid to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) under protest, as Atara does not believe it owes this under the terms of its license agreements with MSK. Atara is entering into evaluative non-binding mediation to potentially resolve this disagreement \n  * Total revenues were $40.2 million for the third quarter 2024, as compared to $2.1 million for the same period in 2023. Total revenues increased by $38.1 million year over year, primarily due to revenue recognized as a result of additional obligations for the expanded partnership with Pierre Fabre and accelerated recognition of existing deferred revenue due to the planned transition of substantially all activities relating to tab-cel at the time of BLA approval and transfer to Pierre Fabre \n  * Total costs and operating expenses include non-cash stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expenses of $7.7 million for the third quarter 2024, as compared to $12.4 million for the same period in 2023 \n  * Research and development expenses were $43.9 million for the third quarter 2024, as compared to $56.9 million for the same period in 2023 \n    * Research and development expenses include a $6.0 million sub-licensing fee, which was paid to MSK under protest, whereas third quarter 2023 had no such comparable expense \n    * Research and development expenses also include $2.9 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses for the third quarter 2024, as compared to $6.8 million for the same period in 2023 \n  * General and administrative expenses were $10.4 million for the third quarter 2024, as compared to $12.2 million for the same period in 2023 \n    * General and administrative expenses include $3.5 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses for the third quarter 2024, as compared to $4.4 million for the same period in 2023 \n  * Atara reported net losses of $21.9 million, or $2.93 per share, for the third quarter 2024, as compared to $69.8 million, or $16.40 per share, for the same period in 2023 \n\n\n\n**_2024_** **_Outlook and Cash Runway_**\n\n  * Atara expects full year 2024 operating expenses to decrease by approximately 35% from 2023 \n  * The large majority of the year-over-year operating expense reduction began in Q2 2024 and is expected to continue for the remainder of the year \n  * Atara expects that cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and accounts receivable as of September 30, 2024, plus the items noted below, in total will enable funding of planned operations into 2027: \n    * additional $60 million approval milestone from Pierre Fabre contingent upon the approval of the tab-cel BLA; \n    * additional anticipated purchases of tab-cel inventory through the manufacturing transfer date by Pierre Fabre; \n    * anticipated reimbursement for tab-cel global development costs through the BLA transfer by Pierre Fabre; \n    * operating efficiencies resulting from completed workforce reductions; \n    * the planned transition of substantially all activities relating to tab-cel at the time of the BLA transfer to Pierre Fabre potentially as early as Q1 2025, which will further reduce quarterly operating expenses; and \n    * anticipated royalties from sales of tab-cel by Pierre Fabre in the U.S. post BLA approval \n\n\n\n**About ATA3219**\n\nATA3219 combines the natural biology of unedited T cells with the benefits of an allogeneic therapy. It consists of allogeneic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-sensitized T cells that express a CD19 CAR construct for the treatment of CD19+ relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies, including B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus. ATA3219 has been optimized to offer a potential best-in-class profile, featuring off-the-shelf availability. It incorporates multiple clinically validated technologies including a modified CD3ζ signaling domain (1XX) that optimizes expansion and mitigates exhaustion, enrichment during manufacturing for a less differentiated phenotype for robust expansion and persistence and retains the endogenous T-cell receptor without gene editing as a key survival signal for T cells contributing to persistence. \n\n**About ATA3431**\n\nATA3431 is an allogeneic, bispecific CAR directed against CD20 and CD19, built on Atara’s EBV T-cell platform. The design consists of a tandem CD20-CD19 design, with binders oriented to optimize potency. Dual targets address the limitations of single antigen loss and tumor variability. ATA3431 features a novel 1XX signaling domain, memory phenotype, and retained, unedited T-cell receptor. Preclinical data have demonstrated early evidence of antitumor activity, long-term persistence, and superior tumor growth inhibition compared to an autologous CD19/CD20 CAR T benchmark. \n\n**Next-Generation Allogeneic CAR T Approach**\n\nAtara is focused on applying Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) T-cell biology, featuring experience in over 600 patients treated with allogeneic EBV T cells, and novel chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) technologies to meet the current limitations of autologous and allogeneic CAR therapies head-on by advancing a potential best-in-class CAR T pipeline in oncology and autoimmune disease. Unlike gene-edited approaches aimed at inactivating T-cell receptor (TCR) function to reduce the risk for graft-vs-host disease, Atara’s allogeneic platform maintains expression of the native EBV TCR that promotes in vivo functional persistence while also demonstrating inherently low alloreactivity due to their recognition of defined viral antigens and partial human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching. A molecular toolkit of clinically-validated technologies—including the 1XX signaling domain designed for better cell fitness and less exhaustion while maintaining stemness—offers a differentiated approach to addressing significant unmet need with the next generation CAR T. \n\n**About Atara Biotherapeutics, Inc.**\n\nAtara is harnessing the natural power of the immune system to develop off-the-shelf cell therapies for difficult-to-treat cancers and autoimmune conditions that can be rapidly delivered to patients from inventory. With cutting-edge science and differentiated approach, Atara is the first company in the world to receive regulatory approval of an allogeneic T-cell immunotherapy. Our advanced and versatile T-cell platform does not require T-cell receptor or HLA gene editing and forms the basis of a diverse portfolio of investigational therapies that target EBV, the root cause of certain diseases, in addition to next-generation AlloCAR-Ts designed for best-in-class opportunities across a broad range of hematological malignancies and B-cell driven autoimmune diseases.

The financing was led by existing top institutional investors with participation from a new strategic investor and was completed at a 15% premium to Atara’s 7-day volume-weighted average price \n  * Net cash used in operating activities was $4.0 million for the third quarter 2024, as compared to $51.3 million in the same period in 2023 \n    * Q3 2024 net cash used in operating activities included a $6.0 million sub-licensing fee payment, which was paid to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) under protest, as Atara does not believe it owes this under the terms of its license agreements with MSK. Atara is entering into evaluative non-binding mediation to potentially resolve this disagreement \n  * Total revenues were $40.2 million for the third quarter 2024, as compared to $2.1 million for the same period in 2023. Total revenues increased by $38.1 million year over year, primarily due to revenue recognized as a result of additional obligations for the expanded partnership with Pierre Fabre and accelerated recognition of existing deferred revenue due to the planned transition of substantially all activities relating to tab-cel at the time of BLA approval and transfer to Pierre Fabre \n  * Total costs and operating expenses include non-cash stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expenses of $7.7 million for the third quarter 2024, as compared to $12.4 million for the same period in 2023 \n  * Research and development expenses were $43.9 million for the third quarter 2024, as compared to $56.9 million for the same period in 2023 \n    * Research and development expenses include a $6.0 million sub-licensing fee, which was paid to MSK under protest, whereas third quarter 2023 had no such comparable expense \n    * Research and development expenses also include $2.9 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses for the third quarter 2024, as compared to $6.8 million for the same period in 2023 \n  * General and administrative expenses were $10.4 million for the third quarter 2024, as compared to $12.2 million for the same period in 2023 \n    * General and administrative expenses include $3.5 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses for the third quarter 2024, as compared to $4.4 million for the same period in 2023 \n  * Atara reported net losses of $21.9 million, or $2.93 per share, for the third quarter 2024, as compared to $69.8 million, or $16.40 per share, for the same period in 2023 \n\n\n\n**_2024_** **_Outlook and Cash Runway_**\n\n  * Atara expects full year 2024 operating expenses to decrease by approximately 35% from 2023 \n  * The large majority of the year-over-year operating expense reduction began in Q2 2024 and is expected to continue for the remainder of the year \n  * Atara expects that cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and accounts receivable as of September 30, 2024, plus the items noted below, in total will enable funding of planned operations into 2027: \n    * additional $60 million approval milestone from Pierre Fabre contingent upon the approval of the tab-cel BLA; \n    * additional anticipated purchases of tab-cel inventory through the manufacturing transfer date by Pierre Fabre; \n    * anticipated reimbursement for tab-cel global development costs through the BLA transfer by Pierre Fabre; \n    * operating efficiencies resulting from completed workforce reductions; \n    * the planned transition of substantially all activities relating to tab-cel at the time of the BLA transfer to Pierre Fabre potentially as early as Q1 2025, which will further reduce quarterly operating expenses; and \n    * anticipated royalties from sales of tab-cel by Pierre Fabre in the U.S. post BLA approval \n\n\n\n**About ATA3219**\n\nATA3219 combines the natural biology of unedited T cells with the benefits of an allogeneic therapy. It consists of allogeneic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-sensitized T cells that express a CD19 CAR construct for the treatment of CD19+ relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies, including B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus. ATA3219 has been optimized to offer a potential best-in-class profile, featuring off-the-shelf availability. It incorporates multiple clinically validated technologies including a modified CD3ζ signaling domain (1XX) that optimizes expansion and mitigates exhaustion, enrichment during manufacturing for a less differentiated phenotype for robust expansion and persistence and retains the endogenous T-cell receptor without gene editing as a key survival signal for T cells contributing to persistence. \n\n**About ATA3431**\n\nATA3431 is an allogeneic, bispecific CAR directed against CD20 and CD19, built on Atara’s EBV T-cell platform. The design consists of a tandem CD20-CD19 design, with binders oriented to optimize potency. Dual targets address the limitations of single antigen loss and tumor variability. ATA3431 features a novel 1XX signaling domain, memory phenotype, and retained, unedited T-cell receptor. Preclinical data have demonstrated early evidence of antitumor activity, long-term persistence, and superior tumor growth inhibition compared to an autologous CD19/CD20 CAR T benchmark. \n\n**Next-Generation Allogeneic CAR T Approach**\n\nAtara is focused on applying Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) T-cell biology, featuring experience in over 600 patients treated with allogeneic EBV T cells, and novel chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) technologies to meet the current limitations of autologous and allogeneic CAR therapies head-on by advancing a potential best-in-class CAR T pipeline in oncology and autoimmune disease. Unlike gene-edited approaches aimed at inactivating T-cell receptor (TCR) function to reduce the risk for graft-vs-host disease, Atara’s allogeneic platform maintains expression of the native EBV TCR that promotes in vivo functional persistence while also demonstrating inherently low alloreactivity due to their recognition of defined viral antigens and partial human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching. A molecular toolkit of clinically-validated technologies—including the 1XX signaling domain designed for better cell fitness and less exhaustion while maintaining stemness—offers a differentiated approach to addressing significant unmet need with the next generation CAR T. \n\n**About Atara Biotherapeutics, Inc.**\n\nAtara is harnessing the natural power of the immune system to develop off-the-shelf cell therapies for difficult-to-treat cancers and autoimmune conditions that can be rapidly delivered to patients from inventory. With cutting-edge science and differentiated approach, Atara is the first company in the world to receive regulatory approval of an allogeneic T-cell immunotherapy. Our advanced and versatile T-cell platform does not require T-cell receptor or HLA gene editing and forms the basis of a diverse portfolio of investigational therapies that target EBV, the root cause of certain diseases, in addition to next-generation AlloCAR-Ts designed for best-in-class opportunities across a broad range of hematological malignancies and B-cell driven autoimmune diseases.

(Nasdaq:\nATRA), a leader in T-cell immunotherapy, leveraging its novel allogeneic Epstein-Barr virus\n(EBV) T-cell platform to develop transformative therapies for patients with cancer and\nautoimmune diseases, today reported financial results for the third quarter 2024, recent\nbusiness highlights, and key upcoming milestones.\n“With the first patient now enrolled in our Phase 1 NHL trial of ATA3219, we have taken an\nimportant step in applying our proven Epstein-Barr virus platform to the significant\nopportunity in allogeneic CAR T,” said Cokey Nguyen, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive\nOfficer of Atara. “The first quarter of 2025 is positioned to be transformational for the\ncompany, with the potential for FDA approval of tab-cel and transition of this business to our\npartner Pierre Fabre, repositioning Atara as a fully focused allogeneic CAR-T company with\nmultiple near-term data milestones for our lead program in oncology and autoimmune\nindications.”\nTabelecleucel (tab-cel® or EbvalloTM) for Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disease\n(PTLD)\nTab-cel biologics license application (BLA) is on track with Priority Review and a\nPrescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of January 15, 2025\nA U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory committee meeting is not\nplanned\nAtara has the potential to receive an additional $60 million milestone payment from\nPierre Fabre contingent upon FDA approval of the tab-cel BLA\nATA3219: CD19 Program in Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL)\nFirst patient treated in ongoing Phase 1 clinical study of ATA3219 for NHL, including\nlarge B-cell lymphomas, follicular lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma\nStudy designed to evaluate safety, preliminary efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and\nbiomarkers\nInitial clinical data anticipated in Q1 2025\nATA3219: CD19 Program in Lupus Nephritis (LN)\nAtara expects to initiate a Phase 1 study of ATA3219 as a monotherapy for the\ntreatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with kidney involvement (lupus\nnephritis [LN]) by end of year with initial clinical data anticipated in mid-2025\nATA3219: CD19 Program in Extrarenal Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (ERL) Without\nLymphodepletion (LD)\nAtara expanded the Phase 1 LN study of ATA3219 with an additional cohort in ERL\nwithout LD, and expects initiation by end of year with initial clinical data anticipated in\nmid-2025\nThe elimination of LD is designed to further simplify the treatment regimen and to\npotentially provide a differentiated safety profile to patients without comprising efficacy,\nwhich may improve patient access\nATA3431: CD19/CD20 Program for B-Cell Malignancies\nAtara is progressing toward an IND submission in Q4 2025\nLeadership and Board of Directors Update\nAs previously announced, on September 9, 2024, Cokey Nguyen, Ph.D. became\nPresident and CEO and Pascal Touchon assumed the role of Chairman of the Board\nof Directors\nGreg Ciongoli, founder and managing partner of Adiumentum Capital Management,\njoined Atara’s Board of Directors\nEric Hyllengren has been appointed to serve as the Company’s Chief Operating\nOfficer, in addition to his role as Chief Financial Officer\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of September 30, 2024 totaled\n$67.2 million, as compared to $35.3 million as of June 30, 2024. This includes a $20\nmillion milestone payment related to the tab-cel BLA acceptance that was received\nfrom Pierre Fabre in August 2024, $15.5 million from Pierre Fabre for the purchase of\ncertain existing tab-cel intermediate inventory in September 2024, and gross proceeds\nof $36 million from a registered direct offering completed in September 2024. The\nfinancing was led by existing top institutional investors with participation from a new\nstrategic investor and was completed at a 15% premium to Atara’s 7-day volume-\nweighted average price\nNet cash used in operating activities was $4.0 million for the third quarter 2024, as\ncompared to $51.3 million in the same period in 2023\nQ3 2024 net cash used in operating activities included a $6.0 million sub-\nlicensing fee payment, which was paid to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer\nCenter (MSK) under protest, as Atara does not believe it owes this under the\nterms of its license agreements with MSK. Atara is entering into evaluative non-\nbinding mediation to potentially resolve this disagreement\nTotal revenues were $40.2 million for the third quarter 2024, as compared to $2.1\nmillion for the same period in 2023. Total revenues increased by $38.1 million year\nover year, primarily due to revenue recognized as a result of additional obligations for\nthe expanded partnership with Pierre Fabre and accelerated recognition of existing\ndeferred revenue due to the planned transition of substantially all activities relating to\ntab-cel at the time of BLA approval and transfer to Pierre Fabre\nTotal costs and operating expenses include non-cash stock-based compensation,\ndepreciation and amortization expenses of $7.7 million for the third quarter 2024, as\ncompared to $12.4 million for the same period in 2023\nResearch and development expenses were $43.9 million for the third quarter 2024, as\ncompared to $56.9 million for the same period in 2023\nResearch and development expenses include a $6.0 million sub-licensing fee,\nwhich was paid to MSK under protest, whereas third quarter 2023 had no such\ncomparable expense\nResearch and development expenses also include $2.9 million of non-cash\nstock-based compensation expenses for the third quarter 2024, as compared to\n$6.8 million for the same period in 2023\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $10.4 million for the third quarter 2024, as\ncompared to $12.2 million for the same period in 2023\nGeneral and administrative expenses include $3.5 million of non-cash stock-\nbased compensation expenses for the third quarter 2024, as compared to $4.4\nmillion for the same period in 2023\nAtara reported net losses of $21.9 million, or $2.93 per share, for the third quarter\n2024, as compared to $69.8 million, or $16.40 per share, for the same period in 2023\n2024 Outlook and Cash Runway\nAtara expects full year 2024 operating expenses to decrease by approximately 35%\nfrom 2023\nThe large majority of the year-over-year operating expense reduction began in Q2\n2024 and is expected to continue for the remainder of the year\nAtara expects that cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and accounts\nreceivable as of September 30, 2024, plus the items noted below, in total will enable\nfunding of planned operations into 2027:\nadditional $60 million approval milestone from Pierre Fabre contingent upon the\napproval of the tab-cel BLA;\nadditional anticipated purchases of tab-cel inventory through the manufacturing\ntransfer date by Pierre Fabre;\nanticipated reimbursement for tab-cel global development costs through the BLA\ntransfer by Pierre Fabre;\noperating efficiencies resulting from completed workforce reductions;\nthe planned transition of substantially all activities relating to tab-cel at the time of\nthe BLA transfer to Pierre Fabre potentially as early as Q1 2025, which will\nfurther reduce quarterly operating expenses; and\nanticipated royalties from sales of tab-cel by Pierre Fabre in the U.S. post BLA\napproval\nAbout ATA3219\nATA3219 combines the natural biology of unedited T cells with the benefits of an allogeneic\ntherapy. It consists of allogeneic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-sensitized T cells that express a\nCD19 CAR construct for the treatment of CD19+ relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies,\nincluding B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases\nincluding systemic lupus erythematosus. ATA3219 has been optimized to offer a potential\nbest-in-class profile, featuring off-the-shelf availability. It incorporates multiple clinically\nvalidated technologies including a modified CD3ζ signaling domain (1XX) that optimizes\nexpansion and mitigates exhaustion, enrichment during manufacturing for a less\ndifferentiated phenotype for robust expansion and persistence and retains the endogenous\nT-cell receptor without gene editing as a key survival signal for T cells contributing to\npersistence.\nAbout ATA3431\nATA3431 is an allogeneic, bispecific CAR directed against CD20 and CD19, built on Atara’s\nEBV T-cell platform. The design consists of a tandem CD20-CD19 design, with binders\noriented to optimize potency. Dual targets address the limitations of single antigen loss and\ntumor variability. ATA3431 features a novel 1XX signaling domain, memory phenotype, and\nretained, unedited T-cell receptor. Preclinical data have demonstrated early evidence of\nantitumor activity, long-term persistence, and superior tumor growth inhibition compared to\nan autologous CD19/CD20 CAR T benchmark.\nNext-Generation Allogeneic CAR T Approach\nAtara is focused on applying Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) T-cell biology, featuring experience in\nover 600 patients treated with allogeneic EBV T cells, and novel chimeric antigen receptor\n(CAR) technologies to meet the current limitations of autologous and allogeneic CAR\ntherapies head-on by advancing a potential best-in-class CAR T pipeline in oncology and\nautoimmune disease. Unlike gene-edited approaches aimed at inactivating T-cell receptor\n(TCR) function to reduce the risk for graft-vs-host disease, Atara’s allogeneic platform\nmaintains expression of the native EBV TCR that promotes in vivo functional persistence\nwhile also demonstrating inherently low alloreactivity due to their recognition of defined viral\nantigens and partial human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching. A molecular toolkit of\nclinically-validated technologies—including the 1XX signaling domain designed for better cell\nfitness and less exhaustion while maintaining stemness—offers a differentiated approach to\naddressing significant unmet need with the next generation CAR T.\nAbout Atara Biotherapeutics, Inc.\nAtara is harnessing the natural power of the immune system to develop off-the-shelf cell\ntherapies for difficult-to-treat cancers and autoimmune conditions that can be rapidly\ndelivered to patients from inventory. With cutting-edge science and differentiated approach,\nAtara is the first company in the world to receive regulatory approval of an allogeneic T-cell\nimmunotherapy. Our advanced and versatile T-cell platform does not require T-cell receptor\nor HLA gene editing and forms the basis of a diverse portfolio of investigational therapies\nthat target EBV, the root cause of certain diseases, in addition to next-generation AlloCAR-\nTs designed for best-in-class opportunities across a broad range of hematological\nmalignancies and B-cell driven autoimmune diseases. Atara is headquartered in Southern\nCalifornia.

These\nrisks are more fully described under the heading “1A. Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this report and include, among others:\n•we have incurred substantial losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future;\n•we have earned limited commercialization revenues to date, and we may never achieve profitability;\n•we have one approved product, Ebvallo, in the EU and the UK, are generally early in our development efforts and have only a small number of product candidates in\nclinical development, and all of our other product candidates are still in preclinical development. If we or our collaborators are unable to successfully develop,\nmanufacture and commercialize our product or product candidates or experience significant delays in doing so, our business may be materially harmed;\n•we will require substantial additional financing on terms acceptable to us to achieve our goals, and a failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed could force us to\ndelay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or manufacturing efforts;\n•our future success depends on our ability to retain our executive officers and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel;\n•the results of preclinical studies or earlier clinical studies are not necessarily predictive of future results, and our existing product candidates in clinical studies, and any\nother product candidates we advance into clinical studies may not have favorable results in later clinical studies or receive regulatory approval;\n•clinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome;\n•our T-cell immunotherapy product and product candidates and our next-generation CAR T programs represent new therapeutic approaches that could result in\nheightened regulatory scrutiny, delays in clinical development or our inability to achieve regulatory approval, commercialization or payor coverage of our product\ncandidates;\n•there can be no assurance that we will achieve all of the anticipated benefits of the Fujifilm Transaction and we could face unanticipated challenges;\n•the market opportunities for our product and product candidates may be limited to those patients who are ineligible for or have failed prior treatments and may be small;\n•we may not be able to obtain or maintain orphan drug exclusivity for our product candidates;\n•the proposed revision of the European legislation on pharmaceuticals could lead to uncertainties over the regulatory framework that will be applicable to medicinal\nproducts in the EU, including orphan medicinal products;\n•we have been affected by and could be adversely affected in the future by the effects of health epidemics and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which could\nmaterially and adversely affect our business and operations in the future, as well as the businesses and operations of third parties on which we rely;\n4\n•if we are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient intellectual property protection for our product candidates, or if the scope of the intellectual property protection is not\nsufficiently broad, our ability to commercialize our product candidates successfully and to compete effectively may be adversely affected;\n•our principal stockholders own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert control or significant influence over matters subject to stockholder approval;\n•if we fail to continue to meet the listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (Nasdaq), our common stock may be delisted, which could have a material adverse\neffect on the liquidity of our common stock;\n•we recently qualified as a “smaller reporting company” and a “non-accelerated filer,” and any decision on our part to comply only with certain reduced reporting and\ndisclosure requirements applicable to such companies could make our stock less attractive to investors;\n•our workforce reductions may not result in anticipated savings, could result in total costs and expenses that are greater than expected and could disrupt our business; and\n•maintaining clinical and commercial timelines is dependent on our end-to-end supply chain network to support manufacturing; if we experience problems with our third\nparty suppliers or CMOs, development and/or commercialization of our product and product candidates may be adversely affected.\n5\nPART I\nItem 1. Business\nOverview\nAtara Biotherapeutics is a leader in T-cell immunotherapy, leveraging its novel allogeneic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) T-cell platform to develop transformative therapies\nfor patients with cancer and autoimmune disease. Tab-cel (tabelecleucel), our lead program in Phase 3 clinical development in the U.S., has received marketing authorization\napproval (MAA) under the proprietary name Ebvallo™ for commercial sale in the European Union (EU) by the European Commission (EC) and for commercial sale and use in\nthe United Kingdom (UK) by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). We are the most advanced allogeneic T-cell immunotherapy company and\nintend to rapidly deliver off-the-shelf treatments to patients with high unmet medical need. Our platform leverages the unique biology of EBV T cells and has the capability to\ntreat a wide range of EBV-driven diseases or other serious diseases through incorporation of engineered chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) or T-cell receptors (TCRs). We are\napplying this one platform, that does not require TCR or human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene editing, to create a robust pipeline. Our strategic priorities are:\n•Tab-cel®: Our most advanced T-cell immunotherapy program, tab-cel, has received MAA for commercial sale in the EU and the UK under the proprietary name Ebvallo\nand is partnered with Pierre Fabre Medicament (Pierre Fabre) for commercialization in Europe and potential commercialization, if approved, worldwide, including in the\nU.S. Tab-cel is currently in Phase 3 development in the U.S. for patients with EBV- associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (EBV+ PTLD) who have\nfailed rituximab or rituximab plus chemotherapy, as well as other EBV-driven diseases; and\n•ATA3219: Allogeneic CAR T targeting CD19, currently in Phase 1 development is being developed as a potential best-in-class product intended to target B-cell\nmalignancies and autoimmune diseases, based on a next generation 1XX co-stimulatory domain and the innate advantages of EBV T cells as the foundation for an\nallogeneic CAR T platform.\nIn addition to the aforementioned strategic priorities, we also have a number of preclinical programs, including ATA3431, an allogeneic dual CAR T immunotherapy\ntargeting both CD19 and CD20 for B-cell malignancies; and a potential next generation EBV vaccine which is differentiated from earlier EBV vaccine efforts that solely\nfocused on B cell responses to EBV. We have paused development on ATA188, an allogeneic T-cell immunotherapy targeting EBV antigens believed to be important for the\npotential treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS), while we explore strategic options for this asset.\nOur T-cell immunotherapy platform is potentially applicable to a broad array of targets and diseases. Our off-the-shelf, allogeneic T-cell platform allows for rapid\ndelivery of a T-cell immunotherapy product manufactured in advance of patient need and stored in inventory, with each manufactured lot of cells providing therapy for\nnumerous potential patients. This differs from autologous treatments, in which each patient’s own cells must be extracted, genetically modified outside the body and then\ndelivered back to the patient, requiring a complex logistics network. We select the appropriate set of cells for use based on a patient’s unique immune profile. We estimate that\nonly four and six unique ATA3219 lots will be needed to cover approximately 90% of U.S. NHL and lupus patients, respectively. One of our contract manufacturing\norganizations (CMOs) has completed commercial production qualification activities for tab-cel and another of our CMOs is currently in the process of completing commercial\nproduction qualification activities for tab-cel while we manufacture inventory according to Pierre Fabre’s commercial product supply strategy.\nIn October 2021, we entered into the Commercialization Agreement with Pierre Fabre (Pierre Fabre Commercialization Agreement), pursuant to which we granted to\nPierre Fabre an exclusive, field-limited license to commercialize and distribute Ebvallo in Europe and select emerging markets in the Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe and\nCentral Asia (the Initial Territory) following regulatory approval. As contemplated by the Pierre Fabre Commercialization Agreement, we entered into (i) a Manufacturing and\nSupply Agreement (ii) a Pharmacovigilance Agreement (iii) and a Quality Agreement, in each case, with Pierre Fabre to further advance our partnership with Pierre Fabre. In\nSeptember 2022, we amended the Pierre Fabre Commercialization Agreement and received an additional $30 million milestone payment from Pierre Fabre following EC\napproval of Ebvallo for EBV+ PTLD and subsequent filing of the MAA transfer to Pierre Fabre, in exchange for, among other things, a reduction in: (i) royalties we are eligible\nto receive as a percentage of net sales of Ebvallo in the Initial Territory, and (ii) the supply price mark up on Ebvallo purchased by Pierre Fabre. Additionally, we agreed to\nextend the time period for provision of certain services to Pierre Fabre under the Pierre Fabre Commercialization Agreement. In December 2022, we entered into a Purchase and\nSale Agreement (HCRx Agreement) with HCR Molag Fund L.P. (HCRx,) a Delaware limited partnership. Pursuant to the terms of the HCRx Agreement, we received a total\ninvestment amount of $31.0 million in exchange for granting HCRx the right to receive a portion of the tiered, sales-based royalties for Ebvallo, in amounts ranging from the\nmid-single digits to significant double digits, and certain milestone payments, both related to the Initial Territory and otherwise payable to us by Pierre Fabre. The total royalties\nand milestones payable to HCRx related to the Initial Territory under the HCRx Agreement are capped between 185% and 250% of the total investment amount by HCRx,\ndependent upon the timing of such royalty and milestone payments to HCRx.\n6\nOn October 31, 2023, we entered into an amended and restated Pierre Fabre Commercialization Agreement (A&R Commercialization Agreement), pursuant to which\nwe expanded Pierre Fabre’s exclusive rights to research, develop, manufacture, commercialize and distribute tab-cel (Ebvallo) to include all other countries in the world\n(Additional Territory) in addition to the Initial Territory (together, the Territory), subject to our performance of certain obligations as described below. In December 2023, upon\nthe effective date of the A&R Commercialization Agreement, we met the contractual right to receive an additional upfront cash payment of $20.0 million for the expanded\nexclusive license grant, for which such cash was received in January 2024. We will also be entitled to receive an aggregate of up to $620.0 million in additional milestone\npayments upon achieving certain regulatory and commercial milestones relating to tab-cel in the Additional Territory including up to $100.0 million in potential regulatory\nmilestones through approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of a biologics license application (BLA) for tab-cel. Of the $100.0 million in potential\nregulatory milestones, we expect to receive $20.0 million in April 2024 based on the positive pre-BLA meeting, an additional $20.0 million in connection with BLA acceptance,\nand up to $60.0 million in potential regulatory milestones in connection with BLA approval. We are eligible to receive significant double-digit tiered royalties as a percentage of\nnet sales of tab-cel (Ebvallo) in the Territory until the later of 12 years after the first commercial sale in each such country, the expiration of specified patent rights in each such\ncountry, or the expiration of all regulatory exclusivity for tab-cel in each such country. Royalty payments may be reduced in certain specified customary circumstances.\nRoyalties and milestones from the commercialization of Ebvallo in the Initial Territory remain subject to the HCRx Agreement.\nDuring the applicable period specified in the A&R Commercialization Agreement, we will be responsible, at Pierre Fabre’s cost, to continue conducting the ongoing\nPhase 3 ALLELE clinical study and the Phase 2 multi-cohort clinical study. We will also be responsible, at Pierre Fabre’s cost, for certain other activities directed to obtaining\nregulatory approval in the United States for tab-cel for EBV-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease pursuant to the terms of the A&R Commercialization\nAgreement. Pierre Fabre will be responsible, at its cost, for obtaining and maintaining all other required regulatory approvals and for commercialization and distribution of tab-\ncel in the Territory, including conducting any other clinical study required.\nPrior to the transfer of manufacturing responsibility to Pierre Fabre, we will be responsible for manufacturing and supplying tab-cel to Pierre Fabre for\ncommercialization in the Territory at cost plus a margin for orders placed after December 31, 2023, subject to a maximum annual increase. Pierre Fabre will assume the\nresponsibility and cost for the manufacture and supply of tab-cel in the Territory upon the Manufacturing Transition Date, which is defined as the earlier of i) the date on which\nall activities relating to the transfer of tab-cel manufacturing, pursuant to the A&R Commercialization Agreement, from Atara to Pierre Fabre have been completed to the\nreasonable satisfaction of both parties, or ii) December 31, 2025, throughout the remainder of the term of the A&R Commercialization Agreement. Pierre and we are to use\ncommercially reasonable efforts to achieve such transition prior to the earlier transfer date from Atara to Pierre Fabre of the first marketing authorization in the Additional\nTerritory or the first BLA.\nWe have also entered into research collaborations with leading academic institutions such as Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) and the Council of the\nQueensland Institute of Medical Research (QIMR Berghofer) pursuant to which we acquired rights to novel and proprietary technologies and programs.\nOur research facilities in Thousand Oaks, California (ARC) and Aurora, Colorado contain our translational and preclinical sciences, analytical development and process\nscience functions. These facilities support our product pipeline, process development and leverage our allogeneic cell therapy platform to drive innovation.\nIn January 2022, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies California, Inc. (FDB) and, for certain limited purposes,\nFUJIFILM Holdings America Corporation, to sell all of the Company’s right, title and interest in and to certain assets related to the Atara T-Cell Operations and Manufacturing\nfacility (ATOM Facility) located in Thousand Oaks, California for $100 million in cash, subject to potential post-closing adjustments pursuant to the asset purchase agreement\n(the Fujifilm Transaction). The closing of the Fujifilm Transaction occurred on April 4, 2022. We also entered into a Master Services and Supply Agreement with FDB\n(Fujifilm MSA) that became effective upon the closing and could extend for up to ten years. Pursuant to the Fujifilm MSA, FDB will supply us with specified quantities of our\ncell therapy products (if approved) and product candidates, manufactured in accordance with cGMP standards. The Fujifilm MSA does not obligate us to purchase products and\nproduct candidates exclusively from FDB.\nWe also work with Charles River Laboratories (CRL) pursuant to a Commercial Manufacturing Services Agreement (CRL MSA) that we entered into in December\n2019. Pursuant to the CRL MSA, CRL provides manufacturing services for our product and certain intermediates. We further amended the CRL MSA to extend the term until\nthe earlier of March 31, 2024 or upon receipt of certain batches of our product and product candidates. We are currently in negotiations with CRL for a new commercial drug\nproduct supply agreement to be effective upon the expiration of the CRL MSA. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into a new commercial drug\nproduct supply agreement with CRL on terms favorable or acceptable to us, or at all. If we are\n7\nunable to enter into a new commercial drug product supply agreement or extend the CRL MSA, we may need to identify alternative sources of drug product supply.\nWe have non-cancellable minimum commitments for products and services, subject to agreements with a term of greater than one year, with clinical research\norganizations and CMOs.\nIn November 2023, we announced a reduction in force of approximately 30% of our workforce at that time. This workforce reduction resulted in total restructuring\ncharges of $6.7 million, comprised primarily of severance payments and wages for the 60-day notice period in accordance with the California Worker Adjustment and\nRetraining Notification (WARN) Act. In most cases, the severance payments were paid as a lump sum in January 2024. All of the severance costs represent cash expenditures.\nIn January 2024, we announced another reduction in force of approximately 25% of total workforce. We expect to recognize approximately $4.5 million in total\nseverance and related benefits as a result of this reduction in force, consisting primarily of severance payments and wages for the 60-day notice period in accordance with the\nCalifornia WARN Act. In most cases, the severance will be paid in the first half of 2024. Certain of the notified employees had employment agreements which provided for\nseparation benefits in the form of salary continuation; these benefits will be paid from February 2024 through January 2025. The majority of the associated costs represent cash\nexpenditures.\nPipeline\nOur pipeline is summarized below:\nExcluding Ebvallo™ in EU, these investigational agents are not approved by any regulatory agencies and efficacy and safety have not been established\nEBV+ PTLD: EBV-Associated Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disease; RR: rituximab relapsed/refractory; HCT: allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant; SOT: solid organ transplant;\nNHL: non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma\nAtara has entered into an agreement with Pierre Fabre to commercialize tab-cel® for EBV+ cancers worldwide\nOther programs: EBV vaccine and other hematological malignancies and solid tumor AlloCAR T programs\n(1)Phase 2 multi-cohort initiated in Q3 2020, with possible indications including EBV+ PTLD with CNS involvement, front-line treatment in EBV+ PTLD including front line with CNS\ninvolvement, EBV+ PID/AID LPD, and other potential EBV-associated diseases\n(2)Targeted antigen recognition technology; Phase 2 Randomized Controlled Trial\nEbvallo™ (Tab-cel®)\nEBV+ PTLD\nSince its discovery as the first human oncovirus, EBV has been implicated in the development of a wide range of diseases, including lymphomas and other cancers.\nEBV is widespread in human populations and persists as a lifelong, asymptomatic infection. In healthy individuals, a small percentage of T cells are devoted to keeping EBV in\ncheck. In contrast, immunocompromised patients, such as those undergoing hematopoietic cell transplants (HCT) or solid organ transplants (SOT) have a reduced ability to\ncontrol EBV. Left without appropriate immune surveillance, EBV-transformed cells can, in some patients, proliferate and cause an aggressive, life-threatening cancer called\nEBV+ PTLD. Nearly all cases of PTLD that occur following HCT are EBV positive while approximately 60% of PTLD cases that occur following SOT are EBV positive.\n8\nHistorical studies suggest a high unmet medical need for improved therapies in patients with EBV+ PTLD who have failed rituximab or rituximab plus chemotherapy,\nwith approximately 40% to 60% of patients either not responding to or progressing following this first line of therapy. Expected median overall survival in patients with EBV+\nPTLD following HCT who have failed rituximab-based first line therapy is approximately 1.7 months, and for patients with EBV+ PTLD following SOT who have failed\nrituximab-based first line therapy, the median overall survival is approximately 3.3 months. The use of chemotherapy in patients with EBV+ PTLD who have failed rituximab\nis frequently associated with significant rates of treatment-related mortality due to the frailty of the patients and severe toxicities associated with chemotherapy. Based on our\nmarket research, we estimate there were several hundred EBV+ PTLD patients who failed rituximab or rituximab plus chemotherapy in the U.S. in 2019.\nTab-cel® (Ebvallo™) for EBV+ PTLD\nIn June 2015, we licensed certain patent rights, know-how and a library of T cells and cell lines specific to EBV from MSK under an exclusive license agreement. In\naccordance with the license agreement, we agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the licensed products and to make milestone payments with respect\nto the licensed programs and to make royalty payments to MSK to the extent product candidates arising from the collaboration are commercialized. Our first commercial\nproduct, Ebvallo, is part of this MSK collaboration and targets EBV.\nTab-cel® (Ebvallo™) is an allogeneic EBV-specific T-cell immunotherapy that is approved in the EU and UK and currently in Phase 3 development in the U.S. for the\ntreatment of patients with EBV+ PTLD who have failed rituximab or rituximab plus chemotherapy. Tab-cel is also under development for other EBV+ diseases with significant\nunmet medical need through a Phase 2 multi-cohort study that was initiated in the third quarter of 2020.\nTab-cel has received Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with EBV+ PTLD\nafter HCT who have failed rituximab and orphan designation in the U.S. and European Union (EU) for the treatment of patients with EBV+ PTLD following HCT or SOT.\nIn clinical studies conducted at MSK that have enrolled patients with EBV+ PTLD following HCT and SOT, efficacy following treatment with tab-cel monotherapy\ncompared favorably with historical data in these patient populations. Patients with EBV+ PTLD after HCT who have failed rituximab and were treated with tab-cel had two-\nyear overall survival of approximately 83% in two separate clinical studies. In the setting of EBV+ PTLD after SOT in patients who have failed rituximab, similar results were\nobserved, with two-year overall survival of approximately 86% in tab-cel-treated patients. A response rate of greater than or equal to 50% was observed in HCT and SOT\npatients in these studies.\nIn December 2017, we initiated two Phase 3 studies for tab-cel intended to support approval in two separate indications, the treatment of EBV+ PTLD following HCT\n(which was referred to as the MATCH study) and SOT in patients who have failed rituximab (which was referred to as the ALLELE study). In 2019, after discussion and\nalignment with regulators, we combined MATCH and ALLELE into a single study (which we now refer to as the ALLELE study) that now consists of an HCT cohort for EBV+\nPTLD patients who have failed rituximab, and a single SOT cohort for EBV+ PTLD patients who have failed prior treatment with rituximab with or without chemotherapy.\nAdditionally, we expanded the ALLELE study geographically to include clinical sites in Europe and Canada.\nIn the third quarter of 2020, we completed an interim analysis for the ALLELE study. Data from the interim analysis showed a 50 percent objective response rate\n(ORR) to tab-cel with independent oncologic and radiographic assessment (IORA) in patients with relapsed-refractory EBV+ PTLD following HCT or SOT, that had reached at\nleast six months follow-up after the ORR assessment. This ORR is consistent with previously published investigator assessed data. The tab-cel safety profile is also consistent\nwith previously published data, with no new safety signals. In December 2022, we presented updated interim analysis and safety results from the ALLELE study and updated\nefficacy and safety data from two single-center, open-label studies, and multicenter expanded access program in patients with EBV+ Leiomysosarcomas at the 2022 American\nSociety of Hematology Annual Meeting. In December 2023, we presented new data for patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) or treatment-naïve EBV+ PTLD involving the\ncentral nervous system following SOT or HCT. An ORR of 77.8% was observed in 18 central nervous system (CNS) EBV+ PTLD patients including first line PTLD, and the\nestimated one-year overall survival rate (OS) was 70.6%. The one-year OS for responders was 85.7% versus 0% for non-responders. In January 2024, data from the ALLELE\nstudy that was published in The Lancet Oncology showed a 51.2% objective response rate and 23-month median duration of response in r/r EBV+ PTLD patients and that tab-\ncel was well tolerated with no events of graft-versus-host disease as related to tab-cel.\n9\nIn October 2021, we entered into the Pierre Fabre Commercialization Agreement, pursuant to which we granted to Pierre Fabre an exclusive, field-limited license to\ncommercialize and distribute Ebvallo in the Initial Territory. In September 2022, we amended the Pierre Fabre Commercialization Agreement to receive an additional $30\nmillion milestone payment from Pierre Fabre in exchange for a reduction in royalties and the supply price mark up on Ebvallo purchased by Pierre Fabre. See section ‘Terms of\nCertain License and Collaboration Agreements’ below for additional details. In December 2022, we sold a portion of our right to receive royalties and certain milestones in\nEbvallo under the Pierre Fabre Commercialization Agreement to HCRx for a total investment amount of $31.0 million, subject to a repayment cap between 185% and 250% of\nthe total investment amount by HCRx.\nOn October 31, 2023, we entered into the A&R Commercialization Agreement, which became effective in December 2023. Pursuant to the A&R Commercialization\nAgreement, Pierre Fabre’s exclusive rights to research, develop, manufacture, commercialize and distribute tab-cel (Ebvallo) will be expanded to include all other countries in\nthe world (Additional Territory) in addition to the Initial Territory (together, the Territory), subject to our performance of certain obligations as described below. In December\n2023, upon the effective date of the A&R Commercialization Agreement, we met the contractual right to receive an additional upfront cash payment of $20.0 million for the\nexpanded exclusive license grant, for which such cash was received in January 2024. We will also be entitled to receive an aggregate of up to $620.0 million in additional\nmilestone payments upon achieving certain regulatory and commercial milestones relating to tab-cel in the Additional Territory, including up to $100.0 million in potential\nregulatory milestones through BLA approval. Of the $100.0 million in potential regulatory milestones, we expect to receive $20.0 million in April 2024 based on the positive\npre-BLA meeting, an additional $20.0 million in connection with BLA acceptance, and up to $60.0 million in potential regulatory milestones in connection with BLA approval.\nWe are eligible to receive significant double-digit tiered royalties as a percentage of net sales of tab-cel (Ebvallo) in the Territory until the later of 12 years after the first\ncommercial sale in each such country, the expiration of specified patent rights in each such country, or the expiration of all regulatory exclusivity for tab-cel in each such\ncountry. Royalty payments may be reduced in certain specified customary circumstances. Royalties and milestones from the commercialization of Ebvallo in the Initial\nTerritory remain subject to the HCRx Agreement.\nIn November 2021, we submitted an EU marketing authorization application (MAA) for tab-cel in patients with EBV+ PTLD. In December 2022, the EC granted\nmarketing authorization for Ebvallo under the “exceptional circumstances” regulatory pathway as a monotherapy for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients two years of\nage and older with r/r EBV+ PTLD who have received at least one prior therapy. For SOT patients, prior therapy includes chemotherapy unless chemotherapy is inappropriate.\nOur request to transfer the marketing authorization for Ebvallo to Pierre Fabre was adopted by the EC in February 2023. Pierre Fabre commenced Ebvallo launch activities in\nthe first European countries in the first quarter of 2023 and is progressively launching Ebvallo on a country-by-country basis. Under the “exceptional circumstances” marketing\nauthorization, Pierre Fabre is subject to annual reassessments of certain ongoing post-marketing obligations to continue confirmation of the benefits of Ebvallo. The annual\nreassessments will determine whether the Ebvallo marketing authorization should be maintained, changed, or suspended, based on Pierre Fabre’s fulfillment of post-marketing\nobligations and the risk/benefit profile of Ebvallo.\nIn October 2022, we filed the MAA for Ebvallo with the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) in the United Kingdom (UK). In May\n2023, the MHRA granted Ebvallo marketing authorization in the UK for the treatment of patients with EBV+ PTLD and the marketing authorization was subsequently\ntransferred to Pierre Fabre.\nWe have performed extensive studies demonstrating analytical comparability between the tab-cel manufacturing process versions used for the pivotal ALLELE study\nand that intended for commercialization. Comprehensive comparability analyses covered 21 key attributes for potency, purity and alloreactivity. We believe analytic\ncomparability between tab-cel process versions has been demonstrated based on well-established statistical methodology and application of International Council for\nHarmonization (ICH) guidelines and is further supported by significant and consistent clinical experience. These comparability data analyses were submitted to the EMA\nthrough our MAA filing. EMA stated in its assessment report issued following approval of the MAA for tab-cel by the EC that it considered comparability of the intended\ncommercial product with the clinically used product to be shown.\nWe have been engaged in discussions with the FDA regarding a potential biologics license application (BLA) submission for tab-cel in the United States, including on\n(i) the content of chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) module 3 and the assessment of comparability between the product used in the pivotal ALLELE study and that\nintended for commercialization and (ii) the clinical data package requirements.\nIn February 2022, we held a Type B CMC meeting with the FDA to discuss comparability between the intended commercial and pivotal clinical trial process versions.\nThis meeting did not result in alignment on comparability and the FDA initially recommended we conduct a clinical study with commercial product as the FDA did not agree\nthat comparability has been demonstrated between product used in the pivotal ALLELE study and the intended commercial product. Following further discussions, the FDA\nrecommended a potential path to a BLA submission without the need for a new clinical study.\n10\nWe subsequently held another meeting with the FDA to discuss topics relating to CMC, which culminated in clear guidance and agreement on specific CMC module 3\nrequirements for a potential BLA submission. Following this meeting, we filed an amendment to the Investigational New Drug (IND) application for tab-cel to provide\nadditional CMC information requested by the FDA.\nIn 2023, we held a number of meetings with the FDA on clinical aspects and CMC for a potential BLA submission for tab-cel. Following such discussions, we aligned\nwith the FDA on analytical comparability between manufacturing process versions of tab-cel. This alignment supports our ability to pool the pivotal clinical trial data from\ndifferent process versions in a tab-cel BLA submission.\nWe recently held a pre-BLA meeting with the FDA to discuss various aspects of our proposed BLA submission, which supports our plan to submit the tab-cel BLA in\nthe second quarter of 2024. Of the $100.0 million in potential regulatory milestones that we may be entitled to receive through approval from Pierre Fabre pursuant to the terms\nof the A&R Commercialization Agreement, we expect to receive $20.0 million in April 2024 based on the positive pre-BLA meeting, an additional $20.0 million in connection\nwith BLA acceptance, and up to $60.0 million in potential regulatory milestones in connection with BLA approval.\nTab-cel Multi-Cohort Study\nWe continue to pursue development of tab-cel in additional patient populations, with a primary focus on immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative diseases (IA-\nLPDs), given the commonality of their EBV-driven mechanism of disease in immunocompromised patients, high unmet medical needs and positive clinical data to date with\ntab-cel. In patients where previous treatments have failed, the objective response rates, including complete response, were 33.3% (three out of nine patients) in AID-LPD and\n37.5% (three out of eight patients) in PID-LPD groups. Tab-cel was generally well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile consistent with previously published clinical studies.\nThese clinical data demonstrated that tab-cel was well-tolerated and showed encouraging clinical activity in this patient population, with objective response rates ranging from\n50% (two out of four patients) to 80% (four out of five patients). The overall survival (OS) rate at one year in patients with EBV viremia treated in the EAP-201 study was 100\npercent for a median follow-up of 14.6 months (min 12.2, max 17.8).\nIn the third quarter of 2020, we initiated a Phase 2 multi-cohort study which comprises a total of five patient populations, including IA-LPDs and other EBV-driven\ndiseases, in both the U.S. and EU. We continue to enroll patients in this study. We are investigating additional label expansion opportunities with our Phase 2 multi-cohort\nstudy. In December 2023, we presented combined analysis that included the first reported data from our Phase 2 multi-cohort study at the European Society for Medical\nOncology Immuno-Oncology annual congress that demonstrated a 77.8% ORR in 18 CNS EBV+ PTLD patients including first line PTLD.\nATA3219\nWe are developing ATA3219, an allogeneic CD19 CAR T immunotherapy targeting B-cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases, leveraging our next-generation\n1XX CAR co-stimulatory domain and EBV T-cell platform and does not require TCR or HLA gene editing. ATA3219 combines the natural biology of unedited T cells with the\nbenefits of an allogeneic therapy. It consists of allogeneic EBV-sensitized T cells that express a CD19 CAR construct for the treatment of CD19+ r/rB-cell malignancies,\nincluding B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) and B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with kidney involvement (lupus\nnephritis (LN)). ATA3219 has been optimized to offer a potential best-in-class profile, featuring off-the-shelf availability. It incorporates multiple clinically validated\ntechnologies including a modified CD3ζ signaling domain (1XX) that optimizes expansion and mitigates exhaustion, provides enrichment during manufacturing for a less\ndifferentiated phenotype for robust expansion and persistence and retains the endogenous T-cell receptor without gene editing as a key survival signal for T cells which\ncontribute to persistence.\nData from preclinical studies for ATA3219 suggest enhanced functional persistence, polyfunctional phenotype and efficient targeting of CD19-expressing tumor cells\nboth in vitro and in vivo with a manufacturing process that focuses on T-cell stemness. Additional in vitro data demonstrate the CD19 antigen-specific functional activity of\nATA3219 and CAR-mediated activity against B cells from SLE patients, leading to robust CD19-specific B-cell depletion compared to controls. This preclinical data was\nsubmitted as part of a late-breaking abstract which was accepted for poster presentation at the upcoming International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy meeting to be held May\n29-June 1, 2024.\nBased on academic data from a clinical study, an EBV T-cell platform has the potential to generate off-the-shelf, allogeneic CAR T immunotherapies with high\nresponse rates, durable responses and low risk of toxicity that can be rapidly delivered to patients.\nOur EBV CD19 CAR T program incorporates multiple clinically validated technologies designed for a memory phenotype, robust expansion, and retains the\nendogenous T-cell receptor without gene editing as a key survival signal for T cells contributing to functional persistence. We continue to make progress on the ATA3219\nmanufacturing process for scale-up.\n11\nData from an academic study (Curran et al ASH 2023) that used allogeneic EBV CAR T cells (CD28/CD3ζ co-stimulatory domain), demonstrated proof of principle for\nAtara’s allogeneic CAR T approach with overall survival up to 3 years in post-transplant B-cell malignancy patients. Atara’s ATA3219 builds upon this study with an improved\nprocess and construct that leverages multiple clinically validated technologies featuring a less differentiated phenotype and a novel 1XX costimulatory domain. We continue to\nmake progress on the ATA3219 manufacturing process for scale-up.\nIn July 2023, we received a Safe to Proceed letter from the FDA in response to our IND submission for ATA3219 in r/r B-cell NHL. We initiated enrollment of a multi-\ncenter, Phase 1 open-label, dose escalation clinical trial for ATA3219 in NHL, including large B-cell lymphomas, follicular lymphoma, or mantle cell lymphoma, with initial\nclinical data anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nIn February 2024, we received a Safe to Proceed letter from the FDA in response to our IND submission for use of ATA3219 as a monotherapy for the treatment of SLE\nwith LN and expect to initiate a Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of ATA3219 in the second half of 2024. Initial data is anticipated in the first half of\n2025.\nAdditional Programs and Platform Expansion Activities\nIn addition to the prioritized programs described above, we have a number of preclinical programs.\nOur CAR T immunotherapy pipeline includes ATA3431, an allogeneic, bispecific CAR directed against CD19 and CD20 for B-cell malignancies and autoimmune\ndisease, leveraging our 1XX CAR co-stimulatory domain and EBV T-cell platform and does not require gene TCR or HLA gene editing. ATA3431 is enriched for central\nmemory CAR T cells and in December 2023, we presented preclinical data that demonstrated early evidence of antitumor activity, long-term persistence, and superior tumor\ngrowth inhibition compared to an autologous CD19/CD20 CAR T benchmark at the 65th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition 2023. We are\nprogressing toward an IND submission and expect to file an IND submission for ATA3431 in 2025.\nWe are also collaborating with QIMR Berghofer to develop a potential next generation EBV vaccine which is differentiated from earlier EBV vaccine efforts that solely\nfocused on B cell responses to EBV. We also retain the rights to ATA188, an allogeneic T-cell immunotherapy targeting EBV antigens believed to be important for the\npotential treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). We have paused development on ATA188 while we explore strategic options for this asset. We have also discontinued some\nprograms and will return the programs to our collaborators. For example, in February 2024, we notified MSK that we will return the ATA2271 and ATA3271 programs\ntargeting mesothelin to MSK.\nWe believe our platform will have utility beyond the current set of targets to which it has been directed. We continue to evaluate additional product candidates,\nincluding those derived from collaborations with our partners. We also continue to evaluate opportunities to license or acquire additional product candidates or technologies to\nenhance our existing platform.\nCompetition\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary\nproducts. We face competition from numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, as well as from academic institutions, government agencies and private and\npublic research institutions for our current product candidates. Some of these competitors or potential competitors have significantly greater established presences in the market,\nfinancial resources, varied technologies, scientific tools and technical expertise than we do. Our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors\ndevelop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than any products that we may develop.\nShould any of our T-cell product candidates be approved for use, we will face substantial competition. In addition to the current standard of care for patients,\ncommercial and academic clinical studies are being pursued by a number of parties in the field of immunotherapy. Early results from these studies have fueled continued interest\nin T-cell immunotherapy. In addition, if approved, our T-cell programs would compete with currently marketed drugs and therapies used for treatment of the indications we are\naddressing, and potentially with product candidates currently in development for the same indications.\nEBV+ PTLD\nThere are currently no FDA-approved products for the treatment of EBV+ PTLD, and there are no EC-approved products for this indication except for Ebvallo.\nHowever, we are aware that some marketed products and therapies are used off-label by some healthcare professionals and institutions in the treatment of EBV+ PTLD, such as\nrituximab and combination chemotherapy regimens.\n12\nIn addition, a number of companies and academic institutions are developing product candidates for EBV+ PTLD and other EBV-driven diseases including: Viracta\nTherapeutics, Inc., which is conducting a pivotal, Phase 2 clinical study for nanatinostat (formerly named tractinostat, or VRx-3996) in combination with antiviral drug\nvalganciclovir in relapsed/refractory EBV+ lymphomas; AlloVir (formerly known as ViraCyte), which has completed a Phase 2 clinical study for posoleucel (ALVR105), an\nallogeneic, multi-virus T-cell product that targets six viruses in allogeneic HSCT recipients with ≥1 treatment-refractory infection, including EBV, and is conducting two Phase\n3 clinical trials for Virus-Associated Hemorrhagic-Cystitis, as well as a Phase 3 trial for the prevention of BKV, CMV, AdV, EBV, HHV06 and JCV in post-allogeneic HSCT\npatients.\nCAR T Program\nThere are currently six autologous CAR T therapies approved in the U.S. and/or EU: Novartis’ Kymriah® (tisagenlecleucel), Gilead/Kite’s Yescarta® (axicabtagene\nciloleucel) and TecartusTM (brexucabtagene autoleucel) and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Breyanzi® (lisocabtagene maraleucel) and Abecma (idecabtagene vicleucel) with 2seventy\nbio and Johnson & Johnson and Legend Biotech’s Carykti™ (ciltacabtagene autoleucel). There are many CAR-mediated cell therapies in development, and, although the\nmajority are autologous, they also include allogeneic and off-the-shelf cell therapies. There are multiple allogeneic CAR platforms being developed with differences in\napproaches to minimize instances of donor cells recognizing the patient’s body as foreign or rejection of the donor cells by the patient’s body. These approaches include the use\nof gene-editing to remove or inhibit the TCR and the use of cell types without a TCR. The majority of clinical stage allogeneic CAR programs utilize alpha beta T cells as the\ncell type and gene editing of the T-cell receptor and HLA as the preferred technology approach, however, other strategies are also in development. It is possible that some of\nthese other approaches will have more favorable characteristics than the approach we utilize, which would result in them being favored by potential partners or customers over\nour products. Depending on the diseases (such as autoimmune diseases) that we target in the future, we may face competition from both autologous and allogeneic CAR\ntherapies and other modalities (e.g., small molecules, antibodies, bispecifics) in the indication of interest.\nTerms of Certain License and Collaboration Agreements\nOut-licensing\nPierre Fabre Commercialization Agreement\nIn October 2021, we entered into the Pierre Fabre Commercialization Agreement, pursuant to which we granted to Pierre Fabre an exclusive, field-limited license to\ncommercialize and distribute Ebvallo in Europe and select emerging markets in the Initial Territory following regulatory approval. In September 2022, we amended the Pierre\nFabre Commercialization Agreement and received an additional $30 million milestone payment from Pierre Fabre following EC approval of Ebvallo for EBV+ PTLD and\nsubsequent filing of the MAA transfer to Pierre Fabre, in exchange for, among other things, a reduction in: (i) royalties we are eligible to receive as a percentage of net sales of\nEbvallo in the Initial Territory, and (ii) the supply price mark up on Ebvallo purchased by Pierre Fabre. Additionally, we agreed to extend the time period for provision of certain\nservices to Pierre Fabre under the Pierre Fabre Commercialization Agreement. In December 2022, we sold a portion of our right to receive royalties and certain milestones in\nEbvallo under the Pierre Fabre Commercialization Agreement to HCRx for a total investment amount of $31.0 million, subject to a repayment cap between 185% and 250% of\nthe total investment amount by HCRx. See Note 6 – “Liability Related to the Sale of Future Revenues” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8.\nFinancial Statement and Supplementary Data of this report for further information related to the agreement with HCRx.\nIn October 2023, we entered into an A&R Commercialization Agreement, pursuant to which we expanded Pierre Fabre’s exclusive rights to research, develop,\nmanufacture, commercialize and distribute Ebvallo to include the Additional Territory in addition to the Initial Territory, subject to our performance of certain obligations as\ndescribed below.\nDuring the applicable period specified in the A&R Commercialization Agreement, we will be responsible, at Pierre Fabre’s cost, to continue conducting the ongoing\nPhase 3 ALLELE clinical study and the Phase 2 multi-cohort clinical study. We will also be responsible, at Pierre Fabre’s cost, for certain other activities directed to obtaining\nregulatory approval in the United States for tab-cel for EBV-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease pursuant to the terms of the A&R Commercialization\nAgreement. Pierre Fabre will be responsible, at its cost, for obtaining and maintaining all other required regulatory approvals and for commercialization and distribution of tab-\ncel in the Additional Territory, including conducting any other clinical study required. We will own any intellectual property rights developed solely by us under the Agreement.\nAs part of the Pierre Fabre Commercialization Agreement, we formed a joint steering committee (JSC) with Pierre Fabre that provides oversight, decision making and\nimplementation guidance regarding the commercialization activities, the responsibilities of which has been expanded to cover the incremental scope of the A&R\nCommercialization Agreement.\n13\nPierre Fabre paid us an upfront cash payment of $45.0 million for the exclusive license grant for the Initial Territory in the fourth quarter of 2021. In December 2022,\nwe met the contractual right to receive $40.0 million in milestone payments upon certain regulatory milestones, for which the cash was received in January 2023. Subject to the\nterms of the royalty purchase agreement with HCRx, as described in Note 6 – “Liability Related to the Sale of Future Revenues” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report, we are entitled to receive an aggregate of up to $308.0 million in remaining\nmilestone payments upon achieving certain regulatory and commercial milestones in addition to double-digit tiered royalties as a percentage of net sales of Ebvallo in the Initial\nTerritory, until the later of 12 years after the first commercial sale in such country, the expiration of specified patent rights, or the expiration of all regulatory exclusivity for such\nproduct on a country-by-country basis. In December 2023, upon the effective date of the A&R Commercialization Agreement, we met the contractual right to receive an\nadditional upfront cash payment of $20.0 million for the expanded exclusive license grant, for which the cash was received in January 2024. We will also be entitled to receive\nan aggregate of up to $620.0 million in additional milestone payments upon achieving certain regulatory and commercial milestones relating to tab-cel in the Additional\nTerritory, including up to $100.0 million in potential regulatory milestones through BLA approval. Of the $100.0 million in potential regulatory milestones, we expect to\nreceive $20.0 million in April 2024 based on the positive pre-BLA meeting, an additional $20.0 million in connection with BLA acceptance, and up to $60.0 million in potential\nregulatory milestones in connection with BLA approval. In addition, we will be eligible to receive significant double-digit tiered royalties as a percentage of net sales of tab-cel\n(Ebvallo) in the Additional Territory until the later of 12 years after the first commercial sale in such country, the expiration of specified patent rights in such country, or the\nexpiration of all regulatory exclusivity for such Product in such country.\nWe have entered into a separate manufacturing and supply agreement with Pierre Fabre for us to manufacture Ebvallo for Pierre Fabre to use in the Initial Territory\nbased on a fixed price through December 31, 2023 and at a price equal to cost plus a margin for orders placed after December 31, 2023, subject to a maximum annual increase.\nPrior to the transfer of manufacturing responsibility to Pierre Fabre, we will be responsible for manufacturing and supplying tab-cel to Pierre Fabre for commercialization in the\nTerritory. Upon the Manufacturing Transition Date and through the remainder of the term of the A&R Commercialization Agreement, Pierre Fabre will be responsible, at its\ncost, for the manufacture and supply of tab-cel in the Territory. Without transfer of the manufacturing technology, no other party can manufacture tab-cel.\nWe are also responsible for cell selection services in the Initial Territory at our cost for a certain period of time, unless the parties agree to transfer the related cell\nselection technology to Pierre Fabre prior to this date, and we are responsible for cell selection services at the sole expense of Pierre Fabre for a certain period of time in the\nAdditional Territory. After this period of time, if we agree to continue to provide cell selection services in the Territory, it shall be at the sole expense of Pierre Fabre. Cell\nselection is the process of identifying the appropriate cell line from available inventory to be used for a patient. Without transfer of the cell selection technology, no other party\ncan provide such services.\nIn-licensing\nMSK Agreements\nIn June 2015, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with MSK for three clinical stage T-cell therapies. We are required to make payments to MSK based on\nachievement of specified regulatory and sales-related milestones, as well as mid-single-digit percentage tiered royalty payments based on future sales of products resulting from\nthe development of the licensed product candidates, if any. In addition, under certain circumstances, we are required to make certain minimum annual royalty payments to\nMSK, which are creditable against earned royalties owed for the same annual period. We are also required to pay a low double-digit percentage of any consideration we receive\nfor sublicensing the licensed rights. The license agreement expires on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis on the latest of: (i) expiration of the last licensed patent\nrights related to each licensed product, (ii) expiration of any market exclusivity period granted by law with respect to each licensed product, and (iii) a specified number of years\nafter the first commercial sale of the licensed product in each country. Upon expiration of the license agreement, we will retain non-exclusive rights to the licensed products.\nIn May and December 2018, we licensed additional technology from MSK. We are obligated to make additional milestone payments based on achievement of specified\ndevelopment, regulatory and sales-related milestones, as well as mid-single-digit percentage tiered royalty payments based on future sales of products resulting from the\ndevelopment of the licensed product candidates, if any.\nIn March 2021, we amended and restated our license agreement with MSK to terminate our license to certain rights and license additional know-how rights not\notherwise covered by our existing agreements.\nIn February 2024, we notified MSK that we intend to terminate our licenses to the ATA2271 and ATA3271 programs targeting mesothelin.\n14\nQIMR Berghofer Agreements\nIn October 2015, we entered into an exclusive license agreement and a research and development collaboration agreement with QIMR Berghofer. Under the terms of the\nlicense agreement, we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to develop and commercialize allogeneic T-cell therapy programs utilizing technology and know-how\ndeveloped by QIMR Berghofer. In September 2016, the exclusive license agreement and research and development collaboration agreement were amended and restated. Under\nthe amended and restated agreements, we obtained an exclusive and worldwide license to develop and commercialize additional T-cell programs, as well as the option to license\nadditional technology in June 2018. We further amended and restated our license agreement and research and development collaboration agreements with QIMR Berghofer in\nAugust 2019 to terminate our license to certain rights related to cytomegalovirus (CMV). In addition, we further amended and restated our license agreement and research and\ndevelopment collaboration agreements with QIMR Berghofer in August 2020 to terminate our license to certain rights related to BK polyomavirus and JC polyomavirus. In\nDecember 2021, we further amended and restated our license agreement and research and development collaboration agreements with QIMR Berghofer to terminate our license\nto certain rights related to HPV associated cancers. We refer to our December 2021 fourth amended and restated license agreement with QIMR Berghofer as the QIMR License\nAgreement and our December 2021 fourth amended and restated research and development collaboration agreement with QIMR Berghofer as our QIMR Collaboration\nAgreement.\nThe QIMR License Agreement provides for various milestone and low to mid single-digit royalty payments to QIMR Berghofer based on future product sales, if any.\nUnder the terms of the QIMR Collaboration Agreement, we are required to reimburse the cost of agreed-upon development activities related to programs developed under the\ncollaboration. The QIMR Collaboration Agreement also provides for various milestone payments to QIMR Berghofer based on the achievement of certain developmental and\nregulatory milestones.\nIntellectual Property\nOur commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, to operate without infringing on the\nproprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and\nnon-U.S. patent applications and other regulatory filings related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and\nimplementation of our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop\nand maintain our proprietary position. Some of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how and other intellectual property rights we rely on are owned by us and others are in-\nlicensed from our partners. When we refer to “our” technologies, inventions, patents, patent applications or other intellectual property rights, we are referring to both the rights\nthat we own or possess as well as those that we in-license. Additionally, we expect to benefit from a variety of statutory frameworks in the U.S., Europe and other countries that\nrelate to the regulation of biosimilar molecules and orphan drug status. These statutory frameworks provide certain periods of regulatory exclusivity for qualifying molecules.\nSee “Government Regulation.”\nPatents\nWe seek composition-of-matter and/or associated method patents, including method-of-treatment patents, for each of our product candidates in key therapeutic areas.\nThe U.S. patent system permits the filing of provisional and non-provisional patent applications. A provisional patent application is not examined for patentability by the U.S.\nPatent and Trademark Office (USPTO), and automatically expires 12 months after its filing date. As a result, a provisional patent application cannot mature into an issued\npatent. Provisional patent applications are often used, among other things, to establish an early effective filing date for a later-filed non-provisional patent application. A non-\nprovisional patent application is examined by the USPTO and can mature into a patent once the USPTO determines that the claimed invention meets the standards of\npatentability.\nIndividual patents extend for varying periods of time depending on the date of filing of the patent application, the priority date claimed, and the legal term of patents as\ndetermined by the applicable law in the countries in which those patents are obtained. Generally, patents issued from applications filed in the U.S. are effective for 20 years\nfrom the earliest non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the\nFDA regulatory review period; however, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14\nyears following FDA approval. Additionally, patent term adjustments can extend term to account for certain delays by the USPTO during prosecution before that office. The\nduration of non-U.S. patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically, the life of a non-U.S. patent is 20 years from the earliest international\nfiling date, not inclusive of any patent term extension that may be available. The actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country to\ncountry and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the\n15\navailability of extensions of patent term, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.\nNational and international patent laws concerning protein-based biologics such as our products remain highly unsettled. No consistent policy regarding the patent-\neligibility or the breadth of claims allowed in patents in this field has emerged to date among the U.S., Europe or other countries. Changes in either the patent laws or in\ninterpretations of patent laws in the U.S. or other countries can diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights. Accordingly, we cannot\npredict the breadth or enforceability of claims that may be granted in our patents or in third party patents. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by\nextensive intellectual property litigation. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our product candidates and technology will depend on our success in\nobtaining effective claims for our patents and enforcing those claims once a patent is granted. We do not know whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance\nof any patents. Our issued patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with sufficient protection\nor competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop and commercialize similar drugs or duplicate\nour technology, business model or strategy without infringing our patents. Because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of any drug we\nmay develop from our product candidates, it is possible that, before any of our drugs can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short\nperiod following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent.\nOur global patent estate consists of both solely-owned and in-licensed patents and patent applications, is directed to compositions of matter and/or associated methods,\nincluding methods of treatment, and consists of 19 patent families having a total of more than 230 issued patents or patent applications. Our patents and patent applications (if\nissued) are expected to expire between 2024 and 2044, not inclusive of any patent term extension that may be available in any associated jurisdiction.\nTrade Secrets\nIn addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.\nWe seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and invention\nassignment agreements with our employees. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to\ngrant us ownership of technologies that are developed by an employee. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach or any\nunauthorized disclosure of our proprietary information. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the\nextent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights\nin related or resulting know-how and inventions.\nTrademarks\nWe also rely upon trademarks to develop and maintain our competitive position, and we continue to pursue and obtain trademark rights relating to our business. We\nhave a vigorous global program of trademark registration and enforcement to maintain and strengthen the value of our trademarks and prevent the unauthorized use of those\ntrademarks. Our global trademark portfolio consists of six different trademark families comprised of more than 70 registrations and pending applications.\nGovernment Regulation and Product Approval\nAs a biopharmaceutical company that operates in the United States, we are subject to extensive regulation. Our T-cell immunotherapies, if approved, will be products\nregulated as biological products, or biologics. With this classification, commercial production of our products will need to occur in registered facilities in compliance with\ncurrent good manufacturing practice (cGMP) for biologics. The FDA categorizes human cell- or tissue-based products as either minimally manipulated or more than minimally\nmanipulated and has determined that more than minimally manipulated products require clinical trials to demonstrate product safety and efficacy and the submission of a BLA\nfor marketing authorization. Our product candidates are considered more than minimally manipulated and will require evaluation in clinical trials and the submission and\napproval of a BLA before we can market them.\nGovernment authorities in the United States (at the federal, state and local level) and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research,\ndevelopment, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, tracking and tracing, post-\napproval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of biopharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. Our product candidates must be approved\nby the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries.\nGenerally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that\n16\nimposed in the U.S., although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in Europe are addressed in a centralized way, but country-\nspecific regulation remains essential in many respects. The process for obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state,\nlocal and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.\nU.S. Product Development Process\nIn the U.S., the FDA regulates pharmaceutical and biological products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), the Public Health Service Act (PHSA),\nand their implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and\nregulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product\ndevelopment process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include, among other actions,\nrefusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning or other enforcement letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market,\nproduct seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal\npenalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed\nin the U.S. generally involves the following:\n•completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices (GLPs), and applicable requirements for the humane use of\nlaboratory animals or other applicable regulations;\n•submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;\n•approval by an independent Institutional Review Board (IRB), or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced at such clinical site;\n•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices (GCPs), and any\nadditional requirements for the protection of human research patients and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product\nfor its intended use;\n•submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantial evidence of safety, purity, and potency of the drug from analytical (CMC) studies and\nfrom results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;\n•satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;\n•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced and tested to assess compliance with\ncGMP; to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity and; if applicable, the\nFDA’s current good tissue practices (GTPs) for the use of human cellular and tissue products;\n•potential FDA inspection of the nonclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and\n•FDA review and approval, i.e., licensure of the product candidate that is the subject of the BLA.\nBefore testing any biological product candidate, including our product candidates, in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests,\nalso referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and\nactivity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including applicable GLPs. The clinical trial\nsponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical\ntrial protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after\nreceipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In\nsuch a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological\nproduct candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to unacceptable and significant risks to clinical trial subjects or non-compliance with FDA requirements. If the\nFDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not begin, continue or recommence in the U.S. without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA.\nAccordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or\nterminate the conduct of such trials in the U.S.\n17\nClinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not\nemployed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing\nprocedures, subject inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if\ncertain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and\nmonitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research patients provide informed consent. Further,\nthe protocol and amendments, which describe the study design, for each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent IRB at or servicing each institution at\nwhich the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to\nindividuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed\nconsent document that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Some studies also\ninclude oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization\nfor whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is\nan unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies\nand clinical study results to public registries.\nHuman clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:\n•Phase 1. The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening\ndiseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients\nrather than healthy human volunteers.\n•Phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of\nthe product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.\n•Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed\nclinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk to benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for marketing approval and\nproduct labeling.\nPost-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted, and in some cases are required by the FDA, after initial marketing\napproval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety\nfollow-up. During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial\ninvestigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the\nFDA and to investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, findings from other studies that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug, laboratory animal\ntesting or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk to human patients, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious expected adverse reaction over the rate\nlisted in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies\nfor reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial\nreceipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its\ndata safety monitoring board may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the product candidate to which the research\npatients are being exposed poses an unacceptable health risk, including risks inferred from other unrelated immunotherapy trials. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate\napproval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product has been associated\nwith unexpected serious harm to patients.\nPrior to and concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional studies on and must also develop additional information about the physical\ncharacteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help\nreduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the FDCA, PHSA and FDA regulations emphasize the importance of manufacturing\ncontrol for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate\nand, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate\npackaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration\nover its shelf life.\n18\nU.S. BLA Review and Approval Processes\nAfter the completion of clinical trials of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA for an innovator biological product must be obtained before commercial\nmarketing of the biological product. The BLA submission must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human trials, information on the\nmanufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there\ncan be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.\nUnder the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended (PDUFA), each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees for\nlicensed innovator biological products on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for innovator biological products. Fee waivers or reductions are\navailable in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for\ninnovator biological products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.\nWithin 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submission to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for\nfiling. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event,\nthe BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is\naccepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is\nsafe, potent, and/or effective for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and\npreserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present\ndifficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to\nwhether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such\nrecommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also determines whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation\nStrategy (REMS) is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a\nmedicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans,\nor elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor\nof the BLA must submit and obtain approval for a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve a BLA without a REMS, if required.\nBefore approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the\nmanufacturing processes and facilities comply with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. For\nimmunotherapy products, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with the GTPs, to the extent applicable. GTPs are FDA regulations\nand guidance documents that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissue, and cellular and tissue-based products\n(HCT/Ps), which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to\nensure that cell and tissue-based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA\nregulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing.\nAdditionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial\nrequirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP, GTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of\ntraining, record keeping, production, and quality control.\nNotwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and\ndeny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not\nto approve the BLA after its review, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that describes the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies\nidentified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may\ninclude recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either\nresubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.\n19\nIf a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could\nrestrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA\nmay impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan or REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any\napproval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety\nand effectiveness, and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.\nIn addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) requires applicants to study certain drugs and biological products in relevant pediatric subpopulations, with the\npotential of obtaining pediatric labeling for the product, if the drug is found to be safe and effective for use in children. With enactment of the Food and Drug Administration\nSafety and Innovation Act of 2012, or FDASIA, sponsors must submit an initial pediatric study plan in the BLA. Pediatric study plans must contain an outline of the proposed\npediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation and\nmust be agreed upon by the FDA. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.\nThe FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers for pediatric studies, including the study of all pediatric patients or subpopulations based\non age on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are\ncontained in FDASIA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation. For example, Section 505B of\nthe U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended by the FDA Reauthorization Act in 2020, requires that any original NDA or BLA submitted on or after August 18, 2020 for\na new active ingredient contain reports on molecularly targeted pediatric cancer investigations unless the requirement is waived or deferred, if the drug that is the subject of the\napplication is: (1) intended for the treatment of an adult cancer, and (2) directed at a molecular target that the FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or\nprogression of a pediatric cancer. This requirement applies even if the adult cancer indication does not occur in the pediatric population and even if the drug is for an adult\nindication for which orphan designation has been granted. Therefore, the BLA of any product we develop that is determined to be substantially relevant to the growth or\nprogression of a pediatric cancer, even if the drug has been designated as an orphan drug for an adult indication, must contain reports on molecularly targeted pediatric cancer\ninvestigations unless such investigations are waived or deferred.\nOrphan Drug Designation in the U.S.\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or\ncondition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the\ncost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that drug or biologic.\nOrphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its\npotential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or\napproval process.\nIf a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to\norphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for\nseven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the\nFDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of\norphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee.\nA designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation.\nIn addition, exclusive marketing rights in the U.S. may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is\nunable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.\nExpedited Development and Review Programs in the U.S.\nThe FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new products\nare eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical\nneed for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. For a product that\n20\nhas received fast track designation, the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted. A sponsor seeking a\nrolling submission must provide a schedule for the submission of each section of the BLA, and the FDA must agree to the rolling submission and that the schedule is\nacceptable. In addition, the sponsor must pay any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA. Submission of sections of a BLA on a rolling basis does\nnot guarantee that the FDA will begin their review of these sections upon receipt or even before the BLA submission is deemed to be complete. Therefore, a rolling BLA\nsubmission may not result in a faster timeline to marketing approval. Additionally, a rolling BLA submission has no bearing on whether or not a product candidate is ultimately\napproved.\nAny product, including a product with a fast track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such\nas priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it is intended for treatment of a serious condition and has the potential to provide safe and\neffective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed\nproducts. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the\nreview. The FDA intends to take action on applications under priority review within 6 months of the application filing date compared with 10 months from the filing date for\nstandard review.\nAdditionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or\nconditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or\non a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or\nother clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the\nFDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to\ndemonstrate clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely\nimpact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.\nRegenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation was established by FDA in 2017 to facilitate an efficient development program for, and expedite\nreview of, any drug that meets the following criteria: (1) it qualifies as a RMAT, which is defined as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue\nproduct, or any combination product using such therapies or products, with limited exceptions; (2) it is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening\ndisease or condition; and (3) preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. RMAT\ndesignation provides potential benefits that include more frequent meetings with FDA to discuss the development plan for the product candidate and eligibility for rolling\nreview and priority review. Products granted RMAT designation may also be eligible for accelerated approval on the basis of a surrogate or intermediate endpoint reasonably\nlikely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites, including through expansion to additional sites. Once approved,\nwhen appropriate, the FDA can permit fulfillment of post-approval requirements under accelerated approval through the submission of clinical evidence, clinical studies, patient\nregistries, or other sources of real-world evidence such as electronic health records; through the collection of larger confirmatory datasets; or through post-approval monitoring\nof all patients treated with the therapy prior to approval.\nBreakthrough therapy designation is also intended to expedite the development and review of products that treat serious or life-threatening conditions. The designation\nby FDA requires preliminary clinical evidence that a product candidate, alone or in combination with other drugs and biologics, demonstrates substantial improvement over\ncurrently available therapy on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough therapy\ndesignation comes with all of the benefits of Fast Track designation, which means that the sponsor may file sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis if certain\nconditions are satisfied, including an agreement with FDA on the proposed schedule for submission of portions of the application and the payment of applicable user fees before\nthe FDA may initiate a review.\nFast Track designation, priority review, RMAT and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or\napproval process. The FDA may revoke any of these designations if the product no longer meets applicable criteria.\n21\nPost-Approval Requirements in the U.S.\nAny products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements,\nreporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and\ncomplying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for\nuses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved uses (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational\nactivities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although a physician may prescribe a legally available product for an off-label use, if the physician\ndeems such product to be appropriate in his/her professional medical judgment, a manufacturer may not market or promote off-label uses. However, it is permissible to share in\ncertain circumstances truthful and not misleading information that is consistent with the product’s approved labeling.\nIn addition, the distribution of prescription drug products, including most biological products that require a prescription, are subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing\nAct, or the PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by\nthe states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription drug product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.\nFurthermore, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval to ensure the long-term\nstability of the product. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and\ndocumentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of\napproved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and\ncertain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in production and quality control\nto maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA,\nincluding, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and depending on\nthe significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and\nclaims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.\nThe FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. Discovery of previously\nunknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or\nadministrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others.\nNewly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and\ncontraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures, for example, a REMS. Also, new government requirements, including those\nresulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.\nU.S. Marketing Exclusivity\nThe Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) amended the PHSA to authorize the FDA to approve similar versions of innovative biologics, commonly\nknown as biosimilars. A competitor seeking approval of a biosimilar must file an application to establish that its molecule is highly similar to an approved innovator biologic,\nnotwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and shows no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in\nterms of safety, purity, and potency, which can generally be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Separately, a product that is\nbiosimilar to the reference product is considered interchangeable if the product demonstrates that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product\nin any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the interchangeable biosimilar and the reference biological product may be\nalternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference\nbiological product. If a product is shown to be biosimilar or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biologic, this can potentially reduce the cost and time required to\nobtain approval to market the biosimilar or interchangeable product. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well\nas the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles and have slowed implementation of the BPCIA by the FDA.\nThe BPCIA, however, bars the submission of BLAs for biosimilars to an approved application until four years after the licensure date for the reference biologic. In\naddition, the FDA may not approve biosimilar applications for 12 years after an innovator biological product receives initial marketing approval. During this 12-year period of\nreference product exclusivity, another company may obtain FDA licensure and market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the\ncompeting\n22\nproduct containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product.\nThe BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed\n“interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. This 12-year period of data exclusivity may be\nextended by six months, for a total of 12.5 years, if the FDA requests, and the innovator company completes pediatric clinical investigations of the product.\nThe development and, if approved, marketing of biosimilars is subject to user fees under the Biosimilar User Fee Amendments of 2022 (BsUFA), which currently apply\nthrough September 2027 and may be renewed or amended thereafter. Sponsors must submit an initial biosimilar biological product development (BPD) fee on the earlier of the\nsubmission of an IND or within 7 calendar days of FDA granting a first BPD meeting, and annually thereafter until the sponsor submits a BLA that is accepted for filing, or the\nsponsor discontinues participation in the BPD program. FDA may also remove a sponsor from the BPD program if the sponsor has failed to pay annual BPD fees for a period of\n2 consecutive fiscal years. Sponsors who discontinue participation in the BPD program but want to reengage FDA on product development must also pay all prior assessed\nBPD fees still owed and a reactivation fee and will be subject to annual BPD fees. Once a sponsor submits a BLA for a biosimilar, they are subject to application fees. And,\nonce a biosimilar BLA is approved, the sponsor is subject to annual program fees. The FDA amends the specific fee amounts under BsUFA on an annual basis.\nThe BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, there has been discussion of whether Congress should reduce the 12-\nyear reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent\nlitigation. As a result, the ultimate implementation of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents, if granted, may be eligible for\nlimited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-\nWaxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years, as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process.\nHowever, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is\ngenerally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that\napplication. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the\npatent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we\nmay intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the\nexpected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.\nReimbursement of Approved Products in the U.S.\nIn both domestic and foreign markets, sales and reimbursement of any approved products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of such products will be\ncovered by third party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. Third party payors determine which\nmedications they will cover and establish reimbursement amounts. There may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and\ncoverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Interim reimbursement amounts for\nnew drugs, if applicable, may also be insufficient to cover our costs and may only be temporary. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical\nsetting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices\nfor drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently\nrestrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the U.S. Coverage and reimbursement policies for drug products can differ significantly\nfrom payor to payor as there is no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products among third party payors in the U.S. Third party payors in the U.S. often\nrely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. There may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and\nreimbursement as the process of determining coverage and reimbursement is often time consuming and costly which will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for\nthe use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage or adequate reimbursement will be obtained. It is difficult to predict at this time what\ngovernment authorities and third party payors will decide with respect to coverage and reimbursement for our drug products.\nThese third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. The containment of\nhealthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in\nimplementing cost-containment programs,\n23\nincluding price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. In the U.S. there have been several Congressional inquiries and\nproposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and\nmanufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. For example, included in the\nConsolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 were several drug price reporting and transparency measures, such as a new requirement for certain Medicare plans to develop tools to\ndisplay Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit information in real time and for group and health insurance issuers to report information on pharmacy benefit and drug costs\nto the Secretaries of the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor and the Treasury. Additionally, on July 9, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order to\npromote competition in the U.S. economy that included several initiatives addressing prescription drugs. Among other provisions, the Executive Order stated that the Biden\nadministration will “support aggressive legislative reforms that would lower prescription drugs, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, by imposing inflation\ncaps, and through other related reforms.” In response to the Executive Order, on September 9, 2021, the Department of Health and Human Services issued a Comprehensive\nPlan for Addressing High Drug Prices that identified potential legislative policies and administrative tools that Congress and the agency can pursue in order to make drug prices\nmore affordable and equitable, improve and promote competition throughout the prescription drug industry, and foster scientific innovation. Most recently, in August 2022,\nPresident Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), which implements substantial changes to the Medicare program, including drug pricing reforms and\nchanges to the Medicare Part D benefit design. Among other reforms, the IRA imposes inflation rebates on drug manufacturers for products reimbursed under Medicare Parts B\nand D if the prices of those products increase faster than inflation; implements changes to the Medicare Part D benefit that, beginning in 2025, will cap benefit annual out-of-\npocket spending at $2,000 while imposing new discount obligations for pharmaceutical manufacturers; and, beginning in 2026, establishes a “maximum fair price” for a fixed\nnumber of pharmaceutical and biological products covered under Medicare Parts B and D following a price negotiation process with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid\nServices. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing,\nincluding price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some\ncases, to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.\nWithin the U.S., if we obtain appropriate approval in the future to market any of our product candidates, we may seek approval and coverage for those products under\nMedicaid, Medicare and the Public Health Service (PHS), pharmaceutical pricing program and also seek to sell the products to federal agencies.\nMedicaid is a joint federal and state program that is administered by the states for low income and disabled beneficiaries. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program,\nmanufacturers are required to pay a rebate for each unit of a covered outpatient drug reimbursed by the state Medicaid programs. The amount of the rebate for each product is set\nby law and may be subject to an additional discount if certain pricing increases more than inflation.\nMedicare is a federal program administered by the federal government that covers individuals age 65 and over as well as those with certain disabilities. Medicare Part D\nprovides coverage to enrolled Medicare patients for self-administered, outpatient drugs (i.e., drugs typically dispensed by a pharmacy and that do not need to be administered by\na physician). Medicare Part D is administered by private prescription drug plans approved by the U.S. government and each drug plan establishes its own Medicare Part D\nformulary for prescription drug coverage and pricing, subject to CMS rules and requirements, which the drug plan may modify from time-to-time.\nMedicare Part B covers most injectable drugs given in an in-patient setting, and some drugs administered by a licensed medical provider in hospital outpatient\ndepartments and doctors’ offices. Medicare Part B is administered by Medicare Administrative Contractors, which generally have the responsibility of making coverage\ndecisions in accordance with CMS rules and requirements. Subject to certain payment adjustments and limits, Medicare generally pays for Part B covered drugs based on a\npercentage of manufacturer-reported average sales price.\nDrug products are subject to discounted pricing when purchased by federal agencies via the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS). FSS participation is required for a drug\nproduct to be covered and paid for by certain federal agencies and for coverage under Medicaid, Medicare Part B and the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program, commonly\nreferred to as the 340B Drug Pricing Program. FSS pricing is negotiated periodically with the Department of Veterans Affairs. FSS pricing is intended to not exceed the price\nthat a manufacturer charges its most-favored non-federal customer for its product. In addition, prices for drugs purchased by the Veterans Administration, Department of\nDefense (including drugs purchased by military personnel and dependents through the TRICARE retail pharmacy program), Coast Guard, and PHS are subject to a cap on\npricing (known as the “federal ceiling price”) and may be subject to an additional discount if pricing increases more than inflation.\nTo maintain coverage of drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, manufacturers are required to extend discounts to certain purchasers under the PHS\npharmaceutical pricing program. Purchasers eligible for discounts include hospitals that serve a\n24\ndisproportionate share of financially needy patients, community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the PHS.\nIn March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act\n(collectively, the Affordable Care Act), which included changes to the coverage and payment for drug products under government health care programs. Since its enactment,\nthere have been judicial and Congressional challenges to numerous elements of the Affordable Care Act, as well as efforts by both the executive and legislative branches of the\nfederal government to repeal or replace certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. For example, while Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted\nlaws that modify certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act, such as removing penalties, starting January 1, 2019, for not complying with the Affordable Care Act’s\nindividual mandate to carry health insurance, delaying the implementation of certain mandated fees, and increasing the point-of-sale coverage gap discount that is owed by\npharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D. In June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of certain aspects\nof the ACA, without ruling on the merits of the constitutionality arguments. Additionally, the American Rescue Plan of 2021, Pub. L. No. 117-2, enacted on March 11, 2021,\ntemporarily increased premium tax credit assistance for those eligible for subsidies for 2021 and 2022 and removed the 400% federal poverty level limit that otherwise applies\nfor purposes of eligibility to receive premium tax credits. Most recently, the IRA extended this increased tax credit assistance and removal of the 400% federal poverty limit\nthrough 2025.It is unclear how the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration and any future litigation will impact the Affordable Care Act and our business.\nU.S. Health Care Laws\nHealthcare providers and third party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory\napproval. Our current and future arrangements with third party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and\nregulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct research and would market, sell and distribute our products.\nAs a biopharmaceutical company, even though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third party payors,\nfederal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients’ rights are and will be applicable to our business. Restrictions under applicable\nfederal and state healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include the following:\n•the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute, which, for example, governs our marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies, and relationships with\nhealthcare providers or other entities, by prohibiting, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration,\ndirectly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or\nrecommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n•federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, which can be enforced through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and civil\nmonetary penalty laws that impose criminal and civil penalties against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal\ngovernment, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, claims for payment or approval that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or\nconceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; the FDCA and PHSA, which prohibit the misbranding and adulteration of biological products that are\nregulated as drugs, and which regulate the marketing of biological products;\n•the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), which imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any\nhealthcare benefit program and also created federal criminal laws that prohibit knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any\nmaterially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;\n•HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), which also imposes obligations, including mandatory\ncontractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information held by covered entities and their\nbusiness associates and their subcontractors that use, disclose or otherwise process individually identifiable health information as well as their covered subcontractors;\n•the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, implemented as the Open Payments Program, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and\nmedical supplies to report annually to CMS information related to payments and other transfers of value to U.S.-licensed physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists,\noptometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse\nanesthetists, certified nurse midwives and U.S. teaching hospitals, as well as\n25\nownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations;\n•state and foreign laws and regulations that are analogous to the federal laws and regulations described in the preceding subsections of this risk factor, such as state anti-\nkickback and false claims laws, including but not limited to the UK Bribery Act 2010, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving\nhealthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers;\n•state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance\npromulgated by the federal government; including those that require drug manufacturers to report information regarding pricing and marketing information related to\npayments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers as well as those that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives.\nSome state laws require the protection of the privacy and security of health information in a manner that may differ from each other in significant ways and often are not\npreempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. For example, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), effective January 1, 2020,\nwhich was recently amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (CPRA); and\n•similar healthcare and privacy laws and regulations in the European Economic Area (EEA), the UK and other jurisdictions, such as, the General Data Protection\nRegulation (EU) 2016/679, which impose obligations and restrictions on the collection and use of personal information relating to individuals located in the EEA and the\nUK (including health information).\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible\nthat governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable healthcare laws\nand regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and\nadministrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from government-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, disgorgement, additional\nreporting requirements or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\nForeign Regulation\nIn addition to regulations in the U.S., we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical studies and commercial sales and distribution of our product\ncandidates and interactions with healthcare professionals. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval from the comparable\nregulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may commence clinical studies or market products in those countries or\nareas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the\ntime may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.\nCertain countries outside of the U.S. have a process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application (CTA), which is similar to an IND in the U.S., prior to the\ncommencement of human clinical studies. In the EU, for example, in accordance with the requirements of the EU Clinical Trials Regulation 536/2014 (CTR), a CTA must be\nsubmitted to the centralized EU Portal, Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS) for review by each country in which the sponsor intends to conduct the clinical study. As part\nof the application process under the CTR, the sponsor proposes a reporting Member State, which coordinates the validation and evaluation of the application. The reporting\nMember State shall consult and coordinate with the other concerned Member States. Ethics Committee (similar to an Investigational Review Board) review of the CTA is part\nof the process under the CTR. If an approval is issued, the sponsor can start the clinical trial in all concerned Member States. However, a concerned Member State can in limited\ncircumstances declare an “opt-out” from an approval. In such a case, the clinical trial cannot be conducted in that concerned Member State. The CTR also aims to streamline\nand simplify the rules on safety reporting and introduces enhanced transparency requirements such as mandatory submission of a summary of the clinical trial results to the EU\nDatabase.\nUnder the CTR, clinical trial sponsors were able to, but not obligated to, use the CTIS starting January 31, 2022. Beginning January 31, 2023, clinical trial sponsors\nwere required to use the CTIS to submit a CTA for a new clinical trial in the EU or EEA, but clinical trials already approved under the previous law, the Clinical Trials Directive\n(CTD) can continue running under the CTD until January 31, 2025, at which time the sponsor must comply with the CTR and record information on these studies in the CTIS.\nNational regulators in the EU Member States and EEA countries began to carry out their legal responsibilities in evaluating and overseeing clinical trials using the CTIS\nbeginning January 31, 2022.\nUnder EU regulatory systems, a company may submit Marketing Authorization Applications (MAA) under national, centralized or decentralized, or mutual-recognition\nprocedures. We expect to utilize the centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicinal\n26\nproducts produced by biotechnology or those medicinal products containing new active substances for specific indications such as the treatment of AIDS, cancer,\nneurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, viral diseases and designated orphan medicines, and optional for other medicines which are highly innovative. Under the centralized\nprocedure, a marketing application is submitted to the EMA, where it is evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. If this committee delivers a\nfavorable opinion, this typically results in the grant by the EC of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states within 67 days of receipt of the opinion.\nThe initial marketing authorization is valid for five years, but once renewed is usually valid for an unlimited period.\nConditional marketing authorization in the EU is permitted based on incomplete clinical data for a limited number of medicinal products for human use, including\nproducts designated as orphan medicinal products under EU law, if (1) the risk-benefit balance of the product is positive, (2) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to\nprovide the required comprehensive clinical study data, (3) unmet medical needs will be fulfilled and (4) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market\nof the medicinal product outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. Specific obligations, including with respect to the completion of ongoing or\nnew studies, and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data, may be specified in the conditional marketing authorization. Conditional marketing authorizations are\nvalid for one year and may be renewed annually, if the risk-benefit balance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions. A\ndifferent marketing authorization pathway is also available to sponsors, called “exceptional circumstances” under which the EC grants marketing authorization of a product for\na specific condition or disease when comprehensive data cannot be obtained even after authorization (e.g., for rare conditions or diseases). Sponsors who obtain marketing\nauthorization for a drug product under exceptional circumstances are subject to ongoing post-marketing obligations to continue confirmation of the benefits of the product.\nContinuation of a marketing authorization granted under the “exceptional circumstances” regulatory pathway is subject to annual re-assessments. The annual re-assessment will\ndetermine whether the marketing authorization should be maintained, changed, or suspended, based on a sponsor’s fulfillment of its post-marketing obligations and the\nrisk/benefit profile of product.\nAs in the U.S., we may apply for designation of a product as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the EU before the MAA is submitted. Orphan\ndrugs in Europe enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to 11 years of orphan market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show\nthat its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan-designated product. The PRIME initiative was established by the EMA to help promote and\nfoster the development of new medicines in the European Union that demonstrate potential for a major therapeutic advantage in areas of unmet medical need. Benefits of\nPRIME designation include early confirmation of potential for accelerated assessment, early dialogue and increased interaction with relevant regulatory committees to discuss\ndevelopment options, scientific advice at key development milestones, and proactive regulatory support from the EMA in order for the product to obtain a faster MAA.\nIn the EU, companies developing a new medicinal product must agree to a pediatric investigation plan (PIP) with the EMA and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in\naccordance with that PIP. The MAA for the product must include the results of pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP, unless a waiver applies, in which\ncase studies in children are not required (for example, if the disease or condition occurs only in adults). or a deferral has been granted, in which case the pediatric clinical trials\nmust be completed at a later date. Products granted a marketing authorization on the basis of pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP are eligible for a six\nmonth extension of the protection under a supplementary protection certificate (if any is in effect at the time of approval) or, in the case of orphan medicinal products, a two\nyear extension of the orphan market exclusivity. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP\nare developed and submitted.\nOutside the U.S., there are additional challenges in ensuring adequate coverage and payment for our products. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to\ngovernmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory approval for a product and may\nrequire us to conduct a clinical study that compares the cost effectiveness of our product candidates or products to other available therapies. The conduct of this type of clinical\nstudy could be expensive and result in delays to our or our commercialization partners’ commercialization efforts. Third party payors are challenging the prices charged for\nmedical products and services, and many third party payors limit reimbursement for newly-approved health care products. Budgetary pressures in many EU countries are also\ncausing governments to consider or implement various cost-containment measures, such as price freezes, increased price cuts and rebates. If budget pressures continue,\ngovernments may implement additional cost-containment measures. Cost-control initiatives could decrease the price we might establish for products that we may develop or\nsell, which would result in lower product revenues or royalties payable to us. There can be no assurance that any country with price controls or reimbursement limitations for\npharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.\nThe EC is currently conducting a wholesale review of the pharmaceutical legal framework, which includes the regulatory protection afforded to medicinal products\nsuch as data exclusivity, marketing protection, market exclusivity for orphan indications and pediatric extension. It is expected that the protection currently afforded in the EU\nwill be reduced in the years to come and the new EU\n27\nlegislative proposal is expected to be published by the EC in the second quarter of 2023, although this timeline may be further prolonged.\nBrexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom\nFollowing the result of a referendum in 2016, the United Kingdom (UK) left the EU on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as Brexit. Pursuant to the formal\nwithdrawal arrangements agreed between the UK and the EU, the UK was subject to a transition period until December 31, 2020 (the Transition Period) during which EU rules\ncontinued to apply. A UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement (the Deal) that outlines the future trading relationship between the UK and the EU was agreed in December\n2020 and approved by each EU member state and the UK.\nSince a significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the UK applicable to our business and our product candidates is derived from EU directives and\nregulations, UK Legislation has retained existing EU law. However, new UK legislation is being drafted and the UK has not implemented new EU law, such as the CTR;\ntherefore Brexit has had, and will continue to have, a material impact upon the regulatory regime with respect to the development, manufacture, importation, approval and\ncommercialization of our product candidates in the UK and the EU. Great Britain (made up of England, Scotland and Wales) is no longer covered by the EEA’s procedures for\nthe grant of marketing authorizations (Northern Ireland will be covered by the centralized authorization procedure and can be covered under the decentralized or mutual\nrecognition procedures, as the EU legal framework continues to apply in Northern Ireland, under the Northern Ireland Protocol). A separate marketing authorization will be\nrequired to market drugs in Great Britain. It is currently unclear whether the Medical Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the United Kingdom is sufficiently\nprepared to handle the increased volume of MAAs that it is likely to receive. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals, would delay or prevent\nus from commercializing our product candidates in the UK or the EU and restrict our ability to generate revenue and achieve and sustain profitability.\nWhile the Deal provides for the tariff-free trade of medicinal products between the UK and the EU there may be additional non-tariff costs to such trade which did not\nexist prior to the end of the Transition Period. Further, should the UK diverge from the EU from a regulatory perspective in relation to medicinal products, tariffs could be put\ninto place in the future. We could therefore, both now and in the future, face significant additional expenses (when compared to the position prior to the end of the Transition\nPeriod) to operate our business, which could significantly and materially harm or delay our ability to generate revenues or achieve profitability of our business. Any further\nchanges in international trade, tariff and import/export regulations as a result of Brexit or otherwise may impose unexpected duty costs or other non-tariff barriers on us. These\ndevelopments, or the perception that any of them could occur, may significantly reduce global trade and, in particular, trade between the impacted nations and the UK. It is also\npossible that Brexit may negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees, particularly those from the EU.\nOrphan designation in Great Britain following Brexit is granted on an essentially identical basis as it is in the EU, but is based on the prevalence of the condition in\nGreat Britain. It is therefore possible that conditions currently designated as orphan conditions in Great Britain will no longer be designated as such and that conditions that are\nnot currently designated as orphan conditions in the EU will be designated as such in Great Britain.\nAdditional Regulation\nAs a biopharmaceutical company, even though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third party\npayors, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients’ rights are and will be applicable to our business. We are also subject to\nregulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act\nand other present and potential federal, state or local regulations. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological and chemical substances\nused in, and waste generated by, our operations. Our research and development involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and viruses. Although we believe\nthat our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental\ncontamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result, and any\nsuch liability could exceed our resources.\nManufacturing\nIn April 2022, we sold all of our right, title and interest in and to certain assets related to the Atara T-Cell Operations and Manufacturing facility (ATOM Facility)\nlocated in Thousand Oaks, California to FDB. We also entered into a Master Services and Supply Agreement with FDB (Fujifilm MSA) which became effective in April 2022\nand could extend for up to ten years. Pursuant to\n28\nthe Fujifilm MSA, FDB will supply us with specified quantities of our product and product candidates, manufactured in accordance with cGMP standards. The Fujifilm MSA\ndoes not obligate us to purchase our product and product candidates exclusively from FDB.\nWe continue to scale our EBV T-cell manufacturing platform to improve product yields from a single donor leukapheresis collection and have generated data\nconfirming the use of stirred-tank bioreactors to improve yield and cell growth productivity. We believe our scalable technology can potentially be a key enabler to deliver\nbiologic-like cost of goods manufactured and could be leveraged across our portfolio, including our CAR T programs.\nIn addition to FDB, we also work with Charles River Laboratories Inc. (CRL) pursuant to a Commercial Manufacturing Services Agreement (CRL MSA) that we\nentered into in December 2019. Pursuant to the CRL MSA, CRL provides manufacturing services for our product and certain intermediates. We further amended the CRL MSA\nto extend the term until the earlier of March 31, 2024 or upon receipt of certain batches of our product and intermediates. We are currently in negotiations with CRL for a new\ncommercial drug product supply agreement to be effective upon the expiration of the CRL MSA. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into a new\ncommercial drug product supply agreement with CRL on terms favorable or acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to enter into a new commercial drug product supply\nagreement or extend the CRL MSA, we may need to identify alternative sources of drug product supply.\nOur current manufacturing strategy is to evaluate each product candidate and determine which site in our manufacturing network provides the phase-appropriate\ntechnical, quality and regulatory compliance requirements. In addition, the long-range supply requirements of our product candidates are evaluated periodically to ensure we are\nplanning manufacturing capacity and capabilities accordingly across our network. Our manufacturing network is comprised of our own laboratory facilities and the\nmanufacturing capabilities of our partners, including MSK and Q-Gen Cell Therapeutics, an affiliate of QIMR Berghofer, and contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs),\nincluding SAFC Carlsbad, Inc., FDB and CRL. This strategic approach provides us with the flexibility to support our clinical and commercial production needs, address time or\ncapacity constraints as well as provide supply redundancy, where appropriate.\nOur T-cell product candidates require blood-derived starting materials which are received from healthy, consenting third party donors through FDA- and EMA-\ncompliant collection centers. Our manufacturing operations are conducted under Code of Federal Regulations Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs), as well as Good Tissue\nPractices (GTPs). GTPs are FDA regulations and guidance documents that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of HCT/Ps,\nwhich are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that\ncell and tissue-based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also\nrequire tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing.\nThrough agreements with our partners, we have acquired the right to use certain manufacturing process know-how related to producing clinical research-related drug\nsupply. These include materials to support the manufacturing of clinical study material, including key starting materials and intermediates as well as existing inventory of\nclinical study materials. We have the ability to obtain supply from third parties to ensure we have the necessary starting materials donated from healthy consenting third party\ndonors.\nHuman Capital Management\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 225 employees, excluding those impacted by the reduction in force in November 2023, which was subsequently reduced by\napproximately 25% as a result of the January 2024 reduction in force. We believe that the success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain\nqualified personnel. Our human capital strategy is designed to enable successful execution of our business objectives, while fostering a collaborative and innovative culture, that\nembraces diversity and inclusion. We monitor our success with insights across human capital metrics such as employee engagement, vacancy rates, time to hire, promotion\nrates, performance ratings, succession depth, retention, EEO compliance, pay equity, and diversity representation. The principal purposes of our compensation policies and\nequity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate employees and directors by paying for performance through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and cash-\nbased performance bonus awards. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are a party to a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our relations with\nour employees to be good.\nCOVID-19 Business Update\nTo date, the COVID-19 pandemic has not materially impacted our or our partners’ clinical, research and development, regulatory, and manufacturing operations or\ntimelines. We have transitioned a portion of our workforce to a remote, work-from-home\n29\nmodel, while maintaining essential in-person laboratory functions in order to advance key research, development and manufacturing priorities. We implemented safety\nprotocols and procedures to support our onsite workforce.\nThe full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our business and operations is subject to future developments which are uncertain and difficult to predict.\nFor additional information about risks and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic that may impact our business, financial condition and operations, see the\nsection titled “1A. Risk Factors” under Part I, Item 1A in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.\nCorporate Information\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in 2012. Our principal corporate offices are located at 2380 Conejo Spectrum St., Suite 200, Thousand Oaks, California 91320 and\nour telephone number at that address is (805) 623-4211.

Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Investors should carefully consider all of the risk factors and uncertainties described below, in addition to\nthe other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the section of this report titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before investing in our common stock.\nThe risks described below may not be the only ones relating to our company and additional risks that we currently believe are immaterial may also affect us. If any of\nthese risks, including those described below, materialize, our business, competitive position, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future\nprospects could be seriously harmed. In these circumstances, the market price of our securities could decline, and investors may lose all or a part of their investment.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Results and Capital Needs\nWe have incurred substantial losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future.\nInvestment in biopharmaceutical product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that product\ncandidates will fail to prove effective, gain regulatory approval or become commercially viable. We have one product, Ebvallo, which is approved in the EU and the UK and\nhave generated limited revenues from commercialization, and have incurred significant research, development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations and expect\nto continue to incur such expenses. As a result, we have incurred significant operating losses in every annual reporting period since our inception. For the year ended December\n31, 2023, we reported a net loss of $276.1 million.\nWe do not know when, or if, we will generate sufficient revenue from commercialization to offset our operating expenses. We expect to continue to incur significant\nexpenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to research, develop and seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates and any additional product\ncandidates we may acquire, in-license or develop. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely\naffect our business. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of change of our expenses and our ability to generate revenues. If any of our product\ncandidates fails in clinical studies or does not gain regulatory approval, or if approved, fails to achieve market acceptance, we may never become profitable. Even if we achieve\nprofitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our expenses may increase in the future as we continue to invest in research and\ndevelopment of our existing product candidates, investigate and potentially acquire new product candidates.\nWe have a limited operating history, which may make it difficult to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nOur operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, acquiring product and technology rights and conducting product development\nactivities for our product candidates. We have not yet demonstrated our ability to successfully complete any Phase 3 clinical studies, obtain regulatory approval in the U.S.,\nconsistently manufacture a commercial scale product or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful\ncommercialization for any of our product candidates or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf. In addition, the adoptive immunotherapy technology underlying our T-\ncell product candidates, including our next-generation CAR T programs, is new and largely unproven. Any predictions about our future success, performance or viability,\nparticularly in view of the rapidly evolving immunotherapy field, may prove to be inaccurate.\nIn addition, as a young business, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors. We expect our\nfinancial condition and operating results to continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our\ncontrol. Accordingly, any of our quarterly or annual periods’ results are not indicative of future operating performance.\n31\nWe have earned limited commercialization revenues to date. We may never achieve profitability.\nTo date, we have generated only limited revenues from commercialization. We have regulatory approval for one product, Ebvallo, in the EU and the UK. We have out-\nlicensed the commercialization rights to tab-cel (Ebvallo in the EU and the UK) to Pierre Fabre under the A&R Commercialization Agreement and we have sold certain royalty\nand milestone interests for the Initial Territory, subject to a specified cap, to HCRx pursuant to the HCRx Agreement. Our ability to generate revenues from commercialization\nand achieve profitability will be subject to the A&R Commercialization Agreement, the HCRx Agreement and depend on our commercialization partners’ ability to successfully\ncommercialize products, including any of our current product and product candidates, and other product candidates that we may develop, in-license or acquire in the future. Our\nability to generate revenues from the sale of products and achieve profitability will also depend on a number of additional factors, including our ability to:\n•successfully complete development activities, including the necessary clinical studies with positive results;\n•complete and submit regulatory submissions to the FDA, EMA or other agencies and obtain regulatory approval for indications for which there is a commercial market;\n•develop manufacturing and distribution processes for our novel T-cell immunotherapy product candidates;\n•develop commercial quantities of our products, including at acceptable cost levels;\n•establish and maintain adequate supply of our products, including cell lines with sufficient breadth to treat patients;\n•establish and maintain manufacturing and commercialization relationships with reliable third parties;\n•qualify our CMOs’ manufacturing facilities such that we can maintain the supply of our products by ensuring adequate manufacturing of bulk drug substances and drug\nproducts in a manner that is compliant with global legal and regulatory requirements;\n•achieve market acceptance of and pricing and reimbursement for our products, if any;\n•attract, hire and retain qualified personnel;\n•protect our rights in our intellectual property and regulatory protections portfolio; and\n•find suitable commercialization partners who can obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from third parties, including government payors, set commercially viable\nprices, market, sell and distribute our approved products.\nOur revenues from Ebvallo or any product candidate for which regulatory approval is obtained will be dependent, in part, upon the size of the markets in the territories\nfor which we gain regulatory approval, the accepted price for the product, the ability to get reimbursement at any price, and the terms and conditions of our commercialization\nagreement with our partner for that territory. We do not retain any meaningful milestones or royalty payments from Pierre Fabre for Ebvallo in the Initial Territory until the\napplicable royalty cap under the HCRx Agreement is met, which could take many years, if at all. If the number of our addressable disease patients is not as significant as we\nestimate, the indication approved by regulatory authorities is narrower than we expect, or the reasonably accepted population for treatment is narrowed by competition,\nphysician choice, treatment guidelines or a reduction in the incidence of the addressable disease, our partners may not successfully commercialize our products, even if\napproved. The timing and amount of any milestone and royalty payments we may receive from our partners, as well as the commercial success of our products will depend on,\namong other things, the efforts, allocation of resources, negotiation of pricing and reimbursement and successful commercialization of our products by our partners. As a result,\neven if we generate product revenues, we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations. If we fail to become profitable or are\nunable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and may be forced to reduce our operations.\nWe will require substantial additional financing on terms acceptable to us to achieve our goals, and a failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed could force us to\ndelay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or manufacturing efforts.\nWe expect to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future to continue the clinical development and manufacturing of our T-cell immunotherapy product\ncandidates, and the advancement and expansion of our preclinical research pipeline. We also expect to continue to expend resources for the development and manufacturing of\nour product and product candidates and the technology we have licensed or have an exclusive right to license from our partners. These expenditures will include costs\nassociated with research and development, potentially acquiring or licensing new product candidates or technologies, conducting preclinical and clinical studies and potentially\nobtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing products. Under the terms of our license agreements with each of our in-license partners, we are obligated to make payments\nupon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. Because the design and outcome of our\nongoing, planned and\n32\nanticipated clinical studies is highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of\nour product and product candidates.\nOur future capital requirements depend on many factors, including:\n•the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our product candidates, and conducting preclinical and clinical studies;\n•the timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates, if clinical studies are successful, including any costs from post-market\nrequirements;\n•the cost of contracting for the manufacture of our product and product candidates for clinical studies in preparation for regulatory approval and in preparation for\ncommercialization;\n•our ability to establish and maintain strategic licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements;\n•the costs to develop, acquire or in-license future product candidates or technologies;\n•the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, expanding, defending and enforcing patent claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such\nlitigation;\n•the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, our product and future products, if any; and\n•the emergence of competing technologies or other adverse market developments.\nWe expect that existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, combined with certain anticipated payments from the A&R Commercialization Agreement,\nas well as cost reductions from completed workforce reductions and operating efficiencies resulting from our planned transition of substantially all activities relating to tab-cel\nat the time of the BLA transfer to Pierre Fabre, will enable us to fund our planned operations into 2027. Such anticipated payments are estimates based on assumptions and plans\nthat are subject to change and such changes could materially impact our cash runway. These assumptions include the receipt of future payments that are dependent upon the\nsuccessful filing and approval of the tab-cel BLA, as well as the completion of specific development and regulatory activities by us and actions taken by third parties, and are,\ntherefore, uncertain at this time.\nOur operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us, and we may need additional funds sooner than planned. We do not have any\ncommitted external source of funds other than milestone and royalty payments that we may receive under the A&R Commercialization Agreement, subject to the terms of the\nHCRx Agreement. We do not retain any meaningful milestone or royalty payments related to the Initial Territory from Pierre Fabre until the applicable royalty cap under the\nHCRx Agreement is met, if at all.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $51.7 million. Our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term\ninvestments as of December 31, 2023 will not be sufficient to fund our planned operations for at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial\nstatements. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for at least 12 months after the issuance of the accompanying consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nTo alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, we plan to secure additional capital, potentially through a\ncombination of public or private security offerings; use of our ATM facility; and/or strategic transactions. We may also need to raise additional funding as required based on the\nstatus of our development programs and our projected cash flows. Although we have been successful in raising capital in the past, and expect to continue to raise capital as\nrequired, there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining sufficient funding on terms acceptable to us to fund continuing operations, if at all, or identify and enter\ninto any strategic transactions that will provide the capital that we will require. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding on acceptable terms, we could be forced to delay,\nlimit, reduce or terminate preclinical studies, clinical studies or other development activities for one or more of our product candidates, which could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our product candidates on terms that\nare unfavorable to us.\nWe plan to seek required additional capital, and may do so through a variety of means, including through private and public equity offerings and debt financings. For\nexample, in December 2022, we sold certain of our royalty and milestone interests related to the Initial Territory under the amended and restated Pierre Fabre\nCommercialization Agreement, subject to a specified cap, to HCRx pursuant to the HCRx Agreement. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or\nconvertible debt securities, or if existing holders of warrants exercise their rights to purchase common stock, the ownership interest of existing\n33\nstockholders will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of stockholders. To the extent equity valuations,\nincluding the trading price of our common stock, are depressed as a result of economic disruptions or other uncertainties, for example due to rising inflationary pressures, the\nwar in Ukraine, the war in the Middle East or other factors, the potential magnitude of this dilution will increase. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that\ninclude covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take certain actions, including incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, entering into licensing arrangements,\nor declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds from third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates or grant licenses or\nother rights on terms that are not favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing when needed, we may be required to delay, limit,\nreduce or terminate our product development efforts for our product candidates, grant to others the rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise\nprefer to develop ourselves or take other actions that are adverse to our business.\nIf we fail to continue to meet the listing standards of Nasdaq, our common stock may be delisted, which could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity of our common\nstock.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Global Market. Nasdaq has requirements that a company must meet in order to remain listed on Nasdaq. In\nparticular, Nasdaq rules require us to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share of our common stock (the “Bid Price Requirement”). If the closing bid price of our\ncommon stock falls below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days or we do not meet other listing requirements, we would fail to be in compliance with Nasdaq listing\nstandards. There can be no assurance that we will continue to meet the Bid Price Requirement, or any other requirement in the future.\nOn January 8, 2024, we received a deficiency letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq notifying us that, for the last 30 consecutive business days,\nthe bid price for our common stock had closed below the Bid Price Requirement.\nIn accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) (Compliance Period Rule), we have been provided a period of 180 calendar days, or until July 8, 2024\n(Compliance Date), to regain compliance with the Bid Price Requirement. If, at any time before the Compliance Date, the bid price for our common stock closes at $1.00 or\nmore for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, as required under the Compliance Period Rule, Nasdaq will provide us written communication that we have regained\ncompliance with the Bid Price Requirement.\nIf we do not regain compliance with the Bid Price Requirement by the Compliance date, we may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar day compliance period. To\nqualify, we will be required to (i) transfer to the Nasdaq Capital Market, (ii) provide written notice of our intention to cure the deficiency during the additional 180 calendar day\ncompliance period, by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary, and (iii) and meet the continued listing requirement for market value of its publicly held shares and all other\ninitial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the Bid Price Requirement, which requirements include, among other things, a minimum\nstockholders’ equity of at least $4 million. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we reported total stockholders’ deficit of $99.2 million, which is below the stockholders’\nequity requirement under the applicable standards.\nIf we do not regain compliance with the Bid Price Requirement by the Compliance Date and we are not eligible for an additional compliance period, or Nasdaq\nconcludes that we will not be able to cure the deficiency during the additional compliance period, Nasdaq will provide us written notification that our common stock will be\nsubject to delisting. At that time, we may appeal the delisting determination to a Nasdaq Hearings Panel. However, there can be no assurance that such appeal would be\nsuccessful. If the Nasdaq Hearing Panel does not result in Nasdaq granting us an extension of time to achieve compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule, our common stock\nwill be delisted from Nasdaq.\nIf our common stock were to be delisted, the actual and potential liquidity of our common stock and our ability to raise future capital would be adversely affected and\nthe market price of our common stock could decrease. If, for any reason, we are unable to obtain listing on another national securities exchange or take action to restore our\ncompliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements, a reduction in some or all of the following may occur, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our\nstockholders:\n•the liquidity of our common stock;\n•the market price of our common stock;\n•our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations;\n•the number of institutional and general investors that will consider investing in our securities;\n•the number of market makers in our common stock;\n•the availability of information concerning the trading prices and volume of our common stock; and\n34\n● the number of broker-dealers willing to execute trades in shares of our common stock\nOur workforce reductions may not result in anticipated savings, could result in total costs and expenses that are greater than expected and could disrupt our business.\nIn August 2022, we reduced our workforce by approximately 20% across all areas of our company, including members of management. In November 2023, we further\nreduced our workforce by approximately 30%. In January 2024, we announced another reduction of our workforce by approximately 25%. The reductions in force reflect a\nprioritization around key research and development programs and the reduction of our expense profile. We may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits, savings\nand improvements in our cost structure from our restructuring efforts due to unforeseen difficulties, delays or unexpected costs. If we are unable to realize the expected\noperational efficiencies and cost savings from restructuring, our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. We also cannot be certain that we will not\nhave to undertake additional workforce reductions or restructuring activities in the future. Furthermore, our cost savings plan may be disruptive to our operations, which could\naffect our ability to generate product revenue. In addition, our workforce reductions could yield unanticipated consequences, such as attrition beyond planned staff reductions,\nor disruptions in our day-to-day operations. Our workforce reductions could also harm our ability to attract and retain qualified management, scientific, clinical, and\nmanufacturing personnel who are critical to our business. Any failure to attract or retain qualified personnel could prevent us from successfully developing and\ncommercializing our product candidates in the future, including tab-cel, if approved.\nThere can be no assurance that we will achieve all of the anticipated benefits of the Fujifilm Transaction and we could face unanticipated challenges.\nWe may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits from the Fujifilm Transaction and we may encounter post-closing risks, including associated with the\nprovision of services to us by FDB pursuant to the Fujifilm MSA. We may experience increased difficulty and loss of institutional knowledge as a result of the transfer of\nATOM Facility employees to FDB in connection with the Fujifilm Transaction, which could harm our business. Additionally, significant time and resources may be required\nfrom us, which could disrupt our business and distract management from other responsibilities, which may result in losses or continued financial involvement in the ATOM\nFacility, including through indemnification or other financial arrangements, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nRisks Related to the Development of Our Product and Product Candidates\nWe have one approved product, Ebvallo, in the EU and the UK and are generally early in our development efforts and have only a small number of product candidates in\nclinical development. All of our other product candidates are still in preclinical development. If we or our collaborators are unable to successfully develop, manufacture\nand commercialize our product or product candidates or experience significant delays in doing so, our business may be materially harmed.\nWe have one approved product, Ebvallo, in the EU and the UK and are generally early in our development efforts, and only a small number of our product candidates\nare in clinical development. The majority of our product candidates are currently in preclinical development. We have invested substantial resources in identifying and\ndeveloping potential product candidates, conducting preclinical and clinical studies, manufacturing activities, and preparing for the commercial launch of our product and\nproduct candidates. Our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our product and product candidates, if approved, will depend heavily on the successful development,\nmanufacture and our partners' eventual commercialization of our product and product candidates.\nThe success of our product and product candidates will depend on many factors, including the following:\n•completion of preclinical and clinical studies with positive results, including demonstrating the stability, safety, purity, and potency of our product candidates to the\nsatisfaction of the FDA or other regulatory agencies;\n•receipt of regulatory approvals from applicable authorities, including required authorizations for clinical trials and marketing authorizations;\n•protecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio, including by obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our\nproduct candidates;\n•establishing or making successful arrangements with third party manufacturers and commercialization partners;\n•qualifying our and our CMOs’ manufacturing facilities for clinical and commercial manufacturing purposes;\n•developing manufacturing and distribution processes for our novel T-cell product candidates and next-generation CAR T programs;\n35\n•contracting with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates at an acceptable cost;\n•contracting with third parties for commercialization of our products on terms favorable to us, if approved by applicable regulatory authorities;\n•acceptance of our products, if approved by applicable regulatory authorities, by patients and the medical community;\n•our partners’ ability to obtain and maintain coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors, including government payors, for our products, if approved by\napplicable regulatory authorities;\n•effectively competing with other therapies;\n•maintaining a continued acceptable benefit/risk profile of the products following approval; and\n•maintaining and growing an organization of scientists and functional experts who can develop our products and technology.\nIf we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully develop and\ncommercialize our product candidates, which could materially harm our business.\nWe have been affected by and could be adversely affected in the future by the effects of health epidemics and pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which could\nmaterially and adversely affect our business and operations in the future, as well as the businesses and operations of third parties on which we rely.\nOur business could be adversely affected by health epidemics and pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which presented a substantial public health and\neconomic challenge around the world and has affected, and continues to affect, our employees, patients, communities and business operations, as well as the U.S. economy and\nfinancial markets. We continue to maintain essential in-person manufacturing and laboratory functions in order to advance key research, development and manufacturing\npriorities. In connection with these measures, we may be subject to claims based upon, arising out of, or related to COVID-19 and our actions and responses thereto. The effects\nof potential future state executive orders, local shelter-in-place orders, government-imposed quarantines, our work-from-home policies and other similar actions may negatively\nimpact productivity, disrupt our business and delay our clinical programs and timelines, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the restrictions\nand other limitations on our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course.\nFurther quarantines, shelter-in-place or similar restrictions and other actions taken by foreign, federal, state and local governments, or the perception that such orders,\nshutdowns or other restrictions on the conduct of business operations could be reinstated, related to COVID-19, other health epidemics and pandemics, or other infectious\ndiseases, could impact our manufacturing capabilities and third party manufacturing facilities in the United States and other countries, or the availability or cost of materials,\nwhich would disrupt our supply chain. In particular, standard transportation channels were impacted and may again be impacted, and we and other manufacturing, testing,\nproduct disposition, CMOs and external testing laboratories are subject to enhanced risk assessment and mitigation measures. In addition, there were and may continue to be\ninterruptions in the supply of leukapheresis collections, which supply raw materials used in our products.\nOur clinical trials may also be affected by health epidemics and pandemics and have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical site initiation and patient\nenrollment experienced delays as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including due to the prioritization of hospital resources toward COVID-19 and away from clinical trials\nand as a result of changing practice patterns that impact the diseases our trials address. Some patients may not be able to comply with clinical trial protocols if quarantines\nimpede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services or if patients are forced to quarantine due to a health epidemic or pandemic. For example, while most clinical trial sites\nfor our studies, including our Phase 3 clinical trial of tab-cel in patients with EBV+ PTLD, remained open to enrollment for patients, some sites limited the screening and\nenrollment of new patients due to governmental orders related to COVID-19, or fear of infection of COVID-19, limited, and may limit in the future, patients’ abilities to access\nclinical sites. Pandemic-related travel restrictions may also interrupt key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site data monitoring and the collection, processing and\nanalyses of efficacy, safety and translational data. For example, at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed a temporary slow-down in stem cell and solid organ\ntransplant volumes, which may have decreased the eligible patient population for the tab-cel Phase 3 study. In April 2020, we initiated a temporary pause in the screening and\nenrollment of patients in our EMBOLD study of ATA188 in patients with PMS. Although we were able to resume the screening and enrollment of patients in our EMBOLD\nstudy and enrolled the first patient in the study in June 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic required us to pause screening and enrollment of patients in our clinical studies.\nSimilarly, our ability to recruit and retain principal investigators and site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to health epidemics and pandemics,\nmay be adversely impacted.\n36\nIn addition, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected our business and results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other\nrisks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section.\nOur future success is dependent on the regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nWe only have one product, Ebvallo, that has gained regulatory approval, an approval in the EU and the UK. Currently, our prioritized clinical-stage product candidates\ninclude tab-cel (tabelecleucel) in the U.S. and ATA3219 Our business is substantially dependent on our ability to obtain regulatory approval for, and, if approved, to find a\npartner who can successfully commercialize our product candidates in a timely manner.\nNeither we nor our partners can commercialize product candidates in the U.S. without first obtaining regulatory approval for the product candidates from the FDA;\nsimilarly, neither we nor our partners can commercialize product candidates outside of the U.S. without obtaining regulatory approval from comparable foreign regulatory\nauthorities. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any product candidate for a target indication, we must demonstrate with substantial evidence\ngathered in preclinical and clinical studies that the product candidate is safe and effective for use for that target indication and that the manufacturing facilities, processes and\ncontrols are adequate with respect to such product candidate to assure stability, safety, purity and potency.\nThe time required to obtain approval by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the\ncommencement of preclinical and clinical studies and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. The novel nature of our\nproduct candidates may create further challenges in obtaining regulatory approval. For example, the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities have limited experience\nwith regulating the development and commercialization of T-cell immunotherapies, particularly allogeneic T-cell product candidates, and CAR T therapies, including assessing\nthe comparability of different versions of such product candidates. In addition, approval policies, regulations, regulatory positions or the type and amount of clinical and other\ndata necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate’s clinical development and throughout regulatory interactions, and may vary among\njurisdictions, particularly for novel therapies. The EC and the MHRA has approved the MAA for Ebvallo as a monotherapy treatment for patients with EBV+ PTLD who have\nreceived at least one prior therapy under “exceptional circumstances,” which is a pathway under which EC and MHRA grant marketing authorization when “comprehensive\ndata cannot be obtained even after authorization.” Under the exceptional circumstances marketing authorization, our commercial partner, Pierre Fabre, is subject to ongoing\npost-marketing obligations to continue confirmation of the benefits of Ebvallo, and if any of our other product candidates are approved under this pathway, we or our future\ncommercial partners will be subject to this obligation. Continuation of the Ebvallo marketing authorization is subject to annual re-assessment. The annual re-assessment will\ndetermine whether the Ebvallo marketing authorization should be maintained, changed, or suspended, based on Pierre Fabre’s fulfillment of post-marketing obligations and the\nrisk/benefit profile of Ebvallo. If we, or our commercial partners, do not satisfy the ongoing post-marketing obligations or the EC determines that the risk/benefit profile of\nEbvallo is not acceptable, the EC may change or suspend the marketing approval for Ebvallo. We have not obtained regulatory approval for any other product candidate, and it\nis possible that none of our existing product candidates or any future product candidates will ever obtain regulatory approval.\nOur product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval from the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority for many reasons, including:\n•disagreement with the design or conduct of our clinical studies;\n•failure to demonstrate positive benefit/risk profile of the product candidate for its proposed indication;\n•failure to demonstrate the stability, safety, purity and potency of the product candidate;\n•failure of clinical sites to conduct the study in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements;\n•failure of clinical studies to meet the level of statistical significance required for approval;\n•disagreement with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical studies;\n•the insufficiency of data collected from clinical studies of our product candidates to support the submission and filing of a BLA or other submission or to obtain\nregulatory approval;\n•inability to reach agreement with the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities on the methodologies for, and assessment of, comparability of different versions\nof product candidates used in non-pivotal studies, pivotal studies and for intended commercial use;\n37\n•failure to obtain approval of our manufacturing processes or facilities of third party manufacturers with whom we contract for clinical and commercial supplies or our\nown manufacturing facility; or\n•changes or inconsistencies in the requested or required methodologies, statistical analyses, specification criteria or regulatory submission requirements for a product\ncandidate, including changes to, or inconsistencies with, applicable industry practice or precedent; or\n•changes in the approval policies or regulations that render our preclinical and clinical data insufficient for approval or in positions, guidance or feedback communicated\nby the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that have a negative impact on the potential approval of a product candidate.\nThe FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority may require information beyond what we plan to provide in or expect to be required for a marketing application,\nincluding additional CMC information, preclinical or clinical data to support approval. These requirements may delay or prevent approval and our commercialization plans, or\nwe may decide to abandon the development program. For example, at a Type B meeting in February 2022, we were not able to align with the FDA on comparability between\ntab-cel product versions used in the pivotal ALLELE study and the intended commercial product. The FDA initially recommended we conduct a new clinical trial with the\ncommercial product to address the lack of alignment on comparability and to gain additional clinical experience with the intended commercial product. Throughout 2023, we\nheld a number of meetings with the FDA on clinical aspects and CMC for a potential BLA submission for tab-cel. We recently held a pre-BLA meeting with the FDA that\nsupports our plan to submit the tab-cel BLA in the second quarter of 2024. The FDA may not ultimately accept or approve a BLA submission with the current clinical dataset. In\nthis case, the conduct of an additional clinical trial or trials in the lead indication or completing the ongoing ALLELE study may be necessary to support a BLA submission for\ntab-cel, which would result in considerable delay to a BLA submission or could lead us not to pursue a BLA submission. Conducting an additional clinical trial, if required, may\nprove too difficult or too expensive, and the process of designing a clinical trial, enrolling enough patients, and completing treatment and data collection under the protocol\ncould take a significant amount of time, effort, and resources. Even if we complete the clinical trial, the study may not meet its prespecified endpoints, and even if it does, the\nFDA may still disagree that the clinical trial is sufficient to support submission and approval of a BLA for tab-cel, or may consider that the data, while adequate for BLA\nsubmission, can support only a more limited indication than that for which we initially applied.\nOur development activities and/or commercialization planning with our partners could be harmed or delayed by governmental or regulatory delays due to a variety of\nfactors. These factors include limitations on the availability of governmental and regulatory agency personnel to review regulatory filings or engage with us (caused by global\nhealth concerns or otherwise, including the COVID-19 pandemic); changes to governmental regulatory requirements, policies, guidelines or priorities, reallocation, or\navailability of government resources; or for other reasons, that may significantly delay the FDA’s, or other regulatory agencies', ability to review and process any submissions\nwe have filed or may file or cause other regulatory delays. If global health concerns continue to prevent the FDA or other regulatory authorities from conducting their regular\ninspections, or impact reviews or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA or other regulatory authorities to review and process our\nregulatory submissions in a timely fashion, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 10,\n2020, the FDA announced its intention to postpone most inspections of foreign manufacturing facilities and products inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities through\nApril 2020. On March 18, 2020, the FDA announced its intention to postpone temporarily routine surveillance inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities and provided\nguidance regarding the conduct of clinical trials. On July 10, 2020, the FDA announced that it is working toward the goal of restarting on-site inspections it deems to be\n“mission critical.” In May 2021, the FDA updated its guidance, first published in August 2020, clarifying how it intends to conduct inspections during the COVID-19 pandemic,\nincluding how it plans to determine which inspections are “mission critical.” Additionally, on April 14, 2021, the FDA issued a guidance document in which the FDA described\nits plans to conduct voluntary remote interactive evaluations of certain drug manufacturing facilities and clinical research sites. According to the guidance, the FDA intends to\nrequest such remote interactive evaluations in situations where an in-person inspection would not be prioritized, deemed mission-critical, or where direct inspection is\notherwise limited by travel restrictions, but where the FDA determines that remote evaluation would still be appropriate. The FDA intends to use this risk-based assessment\nsystem to identify the categories of regulatory activity that can occur within a given geographic area, ranging from mission critical inspections to resumption of all regulatory\nactivities. The FDA has since adjusted its inspection activities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. On December 29, 2021, the FDA implemented temporary changes to its\ninspection activities to ensure the safety of its employees and regulated firms. On February 2, 2022, FDA announced that it would resume domestic surveillance inspections\nacross all product areas on February 7, 2022. In July 2022, FDA published draft guidance outlining its policies regarding remote regulatory assessments. On May 11, 2023, the\nCOVID-19 Public Health Emergency (PHE) declared under the Public Health Services (PHS) Act expired. It is unclear how FDA’s and other health agencies’ policies and\nguidance will impact any inspections of our facilities or clinical trial sites involved with our clinical studies.\nIf we do obtain approval for a product candidate marketing application, regulatory authorities may approve any of our product candidates for fewer or more limited\nindications than we request (including failing to approve the most commercially promising\n38\nindications), may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical studies, or may approve a product candidate with a label that does not include\nthe labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate. In addition, the clinical study requirements of the FDA, EMA and\nother regulatory agencies and the criteria these regulators use to determine the safety and efficacy of a product candidate are determined according to the type, complexity,\nnovelty and intended use and market of the potential products. The regulatory approval process for novel product candidates, such as our novel T-cell product candidates and\nnext-generation CAR T programs, can be more complex and consequently more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or extensively studied pharmaceutical or\nother product candidates. Approvals by the EC and FDA of autologous CAR T therapies, such as Novartis’ Kymriah® and Gilead’s Yescarta®, may not be indicative of what\nthese regulators may require for approval of our therapies. We have multiple clinical trials of our product candidates currently ongoing. If an adverse safety issue, clinical hold\nor other adverse finding occurs in one or more of our clinical trials, such event could adversely affect our other clinical trials of the same or related product candidates.\nMoreover, our product candidates may not perform successfully in clinical studies or may be associated with adverse events that distinguish them from those that have\npreviously been approved, such as approved autologous CAR T therapies. For instance, allogeneic product candidates may result in adverse events not experienced with\nautologous products. Even if a product candidate is approved by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, the approval might contain significant limitations\nrelated to use for specified age groups, warnings, precautions or contraindications, or may be subject to burdensome post-approval study or risk management requirements. If we\nare unable to obtain regulatory approval for one of our product candidates in one or more jurisdictions, or any approval contains significant limitations, we may not be able to\nobtain sufficient funding to continue the development of that product or generate revenues attributable to that product candidate. Also, any regulatory approval of our current or\nfuture product candidates, once obtained, may be withdrawn in a region or country by the respective regulatory agency.\nOur T-cell immunotherapy product and product candidates and our next-generation CAR T programs represent new therapeutic approaches that could result in heightened\nregulatory scrutiny, delays in clinical development or our inability to achieve regulatory approval, commercialization or payor coverage of our product candidates.\nOur future success is dependent on the successful development and commercialization of T-cell immunotherapies and our next-generation CAR T programs in general\nand our development product candidates in particular. Because these programs, particularly our pipeline of allogeneic T-cell product and product candidates that are\nbioengineered from donors, represent a new approach to immunotherapy for the treatment of cancer and other diseases, developing and commercializing our product candidates\nsubject us to a number of challenges, including:\n•obtaining regulatory approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities, which have limited experience with regulating the development and commercialization of\nT-cell immunotherapies, particularly allogeneic T-cell products and product candidates;\n•developing and deploying consistent and reliable processes for procuring blood from consenting third party donors, isolating T cells from the blood of such donors,\nactivating the isolated T cells against a specific antigen, characterizing and storing the resulting activated T cells for future therapeutic use, selecting and delivering a\nsufficient supply and breadth of appropriate partially HLA-matched cell line from among the available T-cell lines, and finally infusing these activated T cells into\npatients;\n•utilizing these product candidates in combination with other therapies (e.g., immunomodulatory approaches such as checkpoint inhibitors), which may increase the risk\nof adverse side effects;\n•educating medical personnel regarding the potential side effect profile of our product and each of our product candidates, particularly those that may be unique to our\nallogeneic T-cell product and product candidates and to our next-generation CAR T programs;\n•understanding and addressing variability in the quality of a donor’s T cells, which could ultimately affect our ability to manufacture products and product candidates in a\nreliable and consistent manner;\n•developing processes for the safe administration of these product and product candidates, including long-term follow-up and registries, for all patients who receive these\nproduct candidates;\n•establishing or making arrangements with third party manufacturers to manufacture, or manufacturing on our own, product and product candidates to our specifications\nand in a timely manner to support our clinical studies and, if approved, commercialization;\n•sourcing clinical and, if approved by applicable regulatory authorities, commercial supplies for the materials used to manufacture and process these product and product\ncandidates that are free from viruses and other pathogens that may increase the risk of adverse side effects;\n39\n•developing a manufacturing process and distribution network that can provide a stable supply with a cost of goods that allows for an attractive return on investment;\n•establishing favorable terms with commercialization partners that possess appropriate sales and marketing capabilities ahead of and after obtaining any regulatory\napproval to gain market acceptance, and obtaining adequate coverage, reimbursement and pricing by third party payors and government authorities; and\n•developing therapies for types of diseases beyond those initially addressed by our current product and product candidates.\nWe cannot be sure that the manufacturing processes used in connection with our T-cell immunotherapy product and product candidates will yield a sufficient supply of\nsatisfactory products that are stable, safe, pure, and potent, or comparable to those T cells historically produced by our partners, be scalable or profitable.\nMoreover, actual or perceived safety issues, including adoption of new therapeutics or novel approaches to treatment, may adversely influence the willingness of\nsubjects to participate in clinical studies, or, if one of our product candidates is approved by applicable regulatory authorities, of physicians to subscribe to the novel treatment\nmechanics or of patients to provide consent to receive a novel treatment despite its regulatory approval. The FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities may require specific\npost-market studies or additional information that communicates the benefits or risks of our products. New data may reveal new risks of our product candidates at any time\nprior to or after regulatory approval.\nThe FDA may also modify or enhance trial requirements which may affect enrollment. In August 2023, the FDA published a guidance document, Informed Consent,\nGuidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors, which supersedes past guidance and finalizes draft guidance on informed consent. The FDA’s new guidance presents\nevolving requirements for informed consent which may affect recruitment and retention of patients in clinical trials. Effects on recruitment and retention of patients may hinder\nor delay a clinical trial and could cause a significant setback to an applicable program.\nPhysicians, hospitals and third party payors often are slow to utilize new products, technologies and treatment practices that require additional upfront costs and\ntraining. Physicians may not be willing to undergo training on this novel therapy, may decide the therapy is too complex to adopt without appropriate training or not cost-\nefficient, and may choose not to administer the therapy. Based on these and other factors, hospitals and payors may decide that the benefits of this new therapy do not or will not\noutweigh its costs.\nThe results of preclinical studies or earlier clinical studies are not necessarily predictive of future results. Our existing product candidates in clinical studies, and any other\nproduct candidate we advance into clinical studies, may not have favorable results in later clinical studies or receive regulatory approval.\nSuccess in preclinical studies and early clinical studies does not ensure that later clinical studies will generate adequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of an\ninvestigational drug. Likewise, a number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including those with greater resources and experience than us, have\nsuffered significant setbacks in clinical studies, even after seeing promising results in earlier preclinical studies or clinical studies. Despite the results reported in earlier\npreclinical studies or clinical studies for our product candidates, there can be significant variability in safety and efficacy results between different clinical trials of the same\nproduct candidate due to numerous factors. We do not know whether the clinical studies we may conduct, or clinical studies in progress, will demonstrate adequate efficacy and\nsafety to result in regulatory approval to market any product candidates in any particular jurisdiction.\nTab-cel has been predominantly evaluated in single-center studies under investigator-sponsored investigational new drug (INDs) applications held by MSK and in our\nExpanded Access Programs, utilizing different response criteria and endpoints from those we have used or may utilize in later clinical studies. These Phase 2 clinical studies\nwith tab-cel also enrolled a heterogeneous group of patients with a variety of EBV-driven malignancies, including EBV+ PTLD after HCT and EBV+ PTLD after SOT. These\nPhase 2 studies were not prospectively designed to evaluate the efficacy of tab-cel in the treatment of a single disease state for which we may later seek approval. Findings from\nearly studies may not be reproducible in late phase studies we conduct. For instance, the current protocol for our ALLELE study in EBV+ PTLD is designed to rule out a 20%\nORR as the null hypothesis. This means that if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval on ORR among patients receiving at least one dose of tab-cel exceeds 20% at the\nend of the study, then the study would be expected to meet the primary endpoint for the treatment of PTLD. For example, assuming enrollment of 33 patients in a cohort of\nALLELE, an observed ORR above approximately 37% would be expected to meet the primary endpoint for that cohort. In addition, our amended ALLELE study protocol\nincludes an interim analysis as well as a final study analysis. We have previously received feedback from the FDA that an interim analysis of the ALLELE study may not be\nsufficient to support approval of a BLA. Moreover, final study results may not be consistent with interim study results. Furthermore, modifications to the total sample size of the\nALLELE study and the statistical approach may be necessary in connection with the review of such a BLA submission by the FDA.\n40\nEfficacy data from prospectively designed studies may differ significantly from those obtained from retrospective subgroup analyses. In addition, clinical data obtained\nfrom a clinical study with an allogeneic product candidate may not yield the same or better results as compared to an autologous product candidate. If later-stage clinical studies\ndo not produce favorable results, our ability to achieve regulatory approval for any of our product candidates may be adversely impacted. Even if we believe that we have\nadequate data to support an application for regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates, the FDA or other regulatory authorities may not agree and may require\nthat we conduct additional clinical studies.\nEbvallo was approved under the exceptional circumstances regulatory pathway by the EMA and the MHRA, therefore continuation of the Ebvallo marketing\nauthorizations in the EU and the UK are subject to annual reassessments. The annual reassessments will determine whether the Ebvallo marketing authorization should be\nmaintained, changed, or suspended, based on Pierre Fabre’s fulfillment of post-marketing obligations and the risk/benefit profile of Ebvallo.\nInterim “top line” and preliminary data from clinical studies that we or our partners may announce or share with regulatory authorities from time to time may change as\nmore patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we or our partners may announce or share with regulatory authorities interim “top line” or preliminary data from clinical studies. Interim data from\nclinical studies are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available.\nPreliminary or “top line” data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data\npreviously announced. As a result, interim and preliminary data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. Adverse differences between preliminary or\ninterim data and final data could impact the regulatory approval of, and significantly harm the prospects of any product candidate that is impacted by the applicable data.\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical study\nprocess. Product candidates in later stages of clinical studies may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical and clinical\nstudies.\nWe may experience delays in our ongoing or future clinical studies and we do not know whether clinical studies will begin or enroll subjects on time, will need to be\nredesigned or will be completed on schedule, if at all. There can be no assurance that the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities will not put clinical studies of any of\nour product candidates on clinical hold in the future. Clinical studies may be delayed, suspended or prematurely terminated for a variety of reasons, such as:\n•delays in enrollment due to travel, shelter-in-place or quarantine policies, or other factors, related to the COVID-19 pandemic or other epidemics or pandemics;\n•delay or failure in reaching agreement with the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority on a study design that we are able to execute;\n•delay or failure in obtaining authorization to commence a study or inability to comply with conditions imposed by a regulatory authority regarding the scope or design of\na study;\n•delay or failure in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations (CROs) and clinical study sites, the terms of which can be\nsubject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and study sites;\n•delay or failure in obtaining institutional review board (IRB) approval or the approval of other reviewing entities, including comparable foreign regulatory authorities, to\nconduct a clinical study at each site;\n•withdrawal of clinical study sites from our clinical studies or the ineligibility of a site to participate in our clinical studies;\n•delay or failure in recruiting and enrolling eligible subjects to participate in a study;\n•delay or failure in subjects completing a study or returning for post-treatment follow-up;\n•clinical sites and investigators deviating from study protocol, failing to conduct the study in accordance with regulatory requirements, or dropping out of a study;\n•an FDA or other regulatory authority clinical site inspection reveals serious violations of regulations applicable to clinical investigations, which may result in requests for\nadditional data analyses and/or rejection of data deemed unreliable;\n41\n•inability to identify and maintain a sufficient number of study sites, including because potential study sites may already be engaged in competing clinical study programs\nenrolling the same population;\n•failure of our third-party clinical study managers to satisfy their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or return trustworthy data;\n•delay or failure in adding new study sites;\n•interim results or data that are ambiguous or negative or are inconsistent with earlier results or data;\n•feedback from the FDA, the IRB, data safety monitoring boards or comparable foreign authorities, or results from earlier stage or concurrent preclinical and clinical\nstudies, that might require modification to the protocol for a study;\n•a decision by the FDA, the IRB, comparable foreign authorities, or us, or a recommendation by a data safety monitoring board or comparable foreign authority, to\nsuspend or terminate clinical studies for non-compliance with regulatory requirements, safety issues, including a finding that our product candidates have undesirable side\neffects or other unexpected characteristics, or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risk, or for any other reason;\n•unacceptable benefit/risk profile, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects;\n•failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a product candidate;\n•difficulties in manufacturing or obtaining from third parties sufficient quantities and breadth of appropriate partially HLA matched cell lines from among the available T-\ncell lines to start or to use in clinical studies;\n•lack of adequate funding to continue a study, including the incurrence of unforeseen costs due to enrollment delays, requirements to conduct additional studies or\nincreased expenses associated with the services of our CROs and other third parties; or\n•changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue a clinical study.\nPatient enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical studies, is affected by many factors including:\n•the size and nature of the patient population;\n•the possibility that the rare diseases that many of our product candidates address are under-diagnosed;\n•changing medical practice patterns or guidelines related to the diseases or conditions we are investigating;\n•the severity of the disease under investigation;\n•our ability to open clinical study sites;\n•the proximity of subjects to clinical sites;\n•the patient referral practices of physicians;\n•the design and eligibility criteria of the clinical study;\n•ability to obtain and maintain patient consents;\n•risk that enrolled subjects will drop out or die before completion;\n•competition for patients from other clinical studies;\n•our or our partner’s ability to manufacture the requisite materials for a study;\n•risk that we do not have appropriately matched HLA cell lines;\n•clinicians’ and patients’ perceptions as to the potential advantages and risks of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that\nmay be approved for the diseases or conditions we are investigating; and\n•disruptions caused by man-made or natural disasters or public health pandemics or epidemics, including, for example, the COVID-19 pandemic.\n42\nAs an example, we activated additional clinical sites for the ALLELE study of tab-cel over the course of 2018 and increased HLA coverage during this period. As a\nresult, enrollment in our studies was limited in the early part of 2018 and increased through the course of the year as we increased clinical sites and HLA coverage. However, in\nMay 2019, we announced that enrollment in our Phase 3 studies of tab-cel for patients with EBV+ PTLD was proceeding slower than anticipated. Many of our product\ncandidates are designed to treat rare diseases, and as a result, the pool of potential patients with respect to a given disease is small. We may not be able to initiate or continue to\nsupport clinical studies of tab-cel or any other product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible participants in these studies as required by\nthe FDA or other regulatory authorities. We experienced some transient delays in clinical trial site initiation and patient enrollment in certain of our clinical trials, including our\nALLELE study, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Even if we are able to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical studies, if the pace of enrollment is slower\nthan we expect, the development costs for our product candidates may increase and the completion of our studies may be delayed or our studies could become too expensive to\ncomplete.\nWe rely on CROs, other vendors and clinical study sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical studies, and while we have agreements governing their\ncommitted activities, we have limited influence over their actual performance. Furthermore, these third parties may also have relationships with other entities, some of which\nmay be our competitors. Reliance on CROs entails risks to which we would not be subject if we conducted our clinical studies ourselves, including reliance on the CRO for\nclinical site initiation and monitoring, the possibility that the CRO does not maintain the financial resources to meet its obligations under our agreements, the possibility of\nbreach of these agreements by the CRO because of factors beyond our control, including a failure to properly perform their obligations under these agreements, and the\npossibility of termination or non-renewal of the agreements by the CROs, based on their own business priorities, at a time that is costly or damaging to us. Our reliance on these\nthird parties for research and development activities will reduce our control over these activities but will not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. For example, we will\nremain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan, study protocols for the trial, statistical analysis\nplan and other study-specific documents (for example, monitoring and blinding plans). Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as Good\nClinical Practice (GCP), International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, or ICH, guidelines, and regulations regarding\nthe informed consent process, safety reporting requirements, data collection guidelines, and other regulations for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials\nto assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. The EMA also requires us to\ncomply with similar standards. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCP requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we\nor any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCP requirements, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, EMA or\ncomparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure that upon\ninspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with GCP and other applicable regulations. In addition,\nour clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under applicable current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and current Good Tissue Practices (cGTP)\nregulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to conduct new clinical trials, which would delay the marketing approval process. We also are required\nto register certain ongoing clinical trials and post the results of certain completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within certain\ntimeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions.\nIf we experience delays or quality issues in the conduct, completion or termination of any clinical study of our product candidates, the approval and commercial\nprospects of such product candidate will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues from such product candidate will be delayed. In addition, any delays in\ncompleting our clinical studies will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to generate revenues. Any\ndelays in completing our clinical studies for our product candidates may also decrease the period of commercial exclusivity. In addition, many of the factors that could cause a\ndelay in the commencement or completion of clinical studies may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nOur product and product candidates, the methods used to deliver them or their dosage levels may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or\nprevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label or result in significant negative consequences following any regulatory approval.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our product and product candidates, their delivery methods or dosage levels could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt,\ndelay or halt clinical studies and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory\nauthority. As a result of safety or toxicity issues that we or our partners may experience in our clinical studies, we or our partners may not receive approval to market any\nproduct candidates, which could prevent us from ever generating product or royalty revenues for such product candidates or achieving profitability. Results of our studies could\nreveal an unacceptably high severity and incidence of side effects, or risks that outweigh the benefits of our product and product candidates. In such an event, our studies could\nbe suspended or terminated, and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of our product\ncandidates for any or all targeted\n43\nindications. The drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled subjects to complete the study or result in potential product liability claims.\nAdditionally, if any of our product candidates receives regulatory approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such product, a number of\npotentially significant negative consequences could result, including that:\n•we may be forced to suspend marketing of that product;\n•regulatory authorities, IRBs, or other clinical trial oversight bodies may place a hold on any ongoing clinical trials;\n•regulatory authorities may withdraw or change their approvals of that product;\n•regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label or limit access of that product to selective specialized centers with additional safety reporting and with\nrequirements that patients be geographically close to these centers for all or part of their treatment;\n•we may be required to conduct post-marketing studies;\n•we may be required to change the way the product is administered;\n•we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to subjects or patients;\n•our products may be seized, or we may be required to recall our products;\n•our products may become less competitive in the marketplace; and\n•our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could diminish the usage or otherwise limit the commercial success of our product and product candidates and prevent us from achieving or\nmaintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate, if approved by applicable regulatory authorities.\nThe market opportunities for our product and product candidates may be limited to those patients who are ineligible for or have failed prior treatments and may be small.\nThe FDA often approves new cancer therapies initially only for use in patients with relapsed or refractory metastatic disease. We expect to seek initial approval of tab-\ncel and our other oncology product candidates in this setting. Subsequently, for those products that prove to be sufficiently beneficial, if any, we may seek approval for earlier\nlines of treatment and potentially as a first line therapy, but there is no guarantee that our product and product candidates, even if approved, would be approved for earlier lines\nof therapy, and, prior to any such approvals, we will have to conduct additional clinical trials.\nOur projections of both the number of people who have the diseases we are targeting, as well as the subset of people with these diseases in a position to receive second\nor later lines of therapy, and who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our product and product candidates, are based on our current beliefs and estimates. These\nestimates have been derived from a variety of sources, including scientific literature, surveys of clinicians, patient foundations, or our own market research, and may prove to be\nincorrect. Further, new studies, product approvals, changes to the standard of care and diagnosis rates or scientific understanding of disease burden may change the estimated\nincidence or prevalence of these diseases, and the number of patients who could benefit from our products may turn out to be lower than expected. Additionally, the potentially\naddressable patient population for our product candidates may be limited or may not be amenable to treatment with our product candidates. For instance, we expect our product,\ntab-cel, to initially target a patient population that suffers from aggressive EBV+PTLD and has failed rituximab or rituximab plus chemotherapy. Our commercial partners may\nhave different estimates of the market opportunities for our product or product candidates. At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we initially observed a temporary slow-\ndown in stem cell and solid organ transplant volumes. These reductions were transient, but if a reduction in such volumes resumes or if there are other disruptive factors that\nreduce PTLD incidence, such as changes in immunosuppression regimens or treatment of re-activated viremia, it could result in lower PTLD incidence and thus reduce the\ndemand for tab-cel. Even if our product and product candidates obtain significant market share, because the potential target populations are small, we may never achieve\nprofitability without obtaining regulatory approval for additional indications.\n44\nWe may not be able to obtain or maintain orphan drug exclusivity for our product candidates.\nRegulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the U.S., EU and the UK, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the\nOrphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient\npopulation of fewer than 200,000 individuals annually in the U.S. The FDA, the EMA, and the MHRA have granted us orphan drug designation for tab-cel for EBV+ PTLD.\nGenerally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first regulatory approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the\nproduct is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the FDA, the EMA, and the MHRA from approving another marketing application for the same biologic\nfor the same indication for that time period. The applicable period is seven years in the U.S. and ten years in the EU and the UK. The EU and UK exclusivity periods can be\nreduced to six years if a drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation or if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified.\nThese periods may be reduced in the EU based on a new applicable legal framework, currently under review by the European Parliament and Council. Orphan drug exclusivity\nmay be lost if the FDA, EMA or MHRA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the\ndrug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. In the U.S., the FDA may still approve a later marketing application blocked by an ongoing period of\norphan drug exclusivity in limited circumstances such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the\norphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for\nwhich the product was approved. As a result, even if one of our product candidates receives orphan exclusivity, the FDA can still approve or license other drugs or biological\nproducts that have a different active ingredient for use in treating the same indication or disease.\nIn addition, Congress is considering updates to the orphan drug provisions of the FDCA in response to a 2021 11th Circuit decision, Catalyst Pharms., Inc. v. Becerra, 14\nF.4th 1299 (11th Cir. 2021), in which the court disagreed with the FDA’s longstanding position that the orphan drug exclusivity only applies to the approved use or indication\nwithin an eligible disease, and not to all uses or indications within the entire disease or condition. In particular, the circuit court held that that the orphan-drug exclusivity for the\ndrug developed by Catalyst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Catalyst) blocked the FDA’s approval of another drug for all uses or indications within the same orphan-designated disease,\nLambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), even though Catalyst’s drug was approved at that time only for use in the treatment of LEMS in adults. Accordingly, the court\nordered the FDA to set aside the approval of a drug indicated for LEMS in children. This decision created uncertainty in the application of the orphan drug exclusivity. Any\nchanges to the orphan drug provisions could change our opportunities for, or likelihood of success in obtaining, orphan drug exclusivity and could materially adversely affect\nour business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospect.\nEven if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not be maintained or effectively protect the product from competition because different\ndrugs can be approved for the same condition.\nBTD by the FDA and PRIME designation by the EMA may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process and it does not increase the likelihood\nthat our product candidates will receive marketing approval.\nAlthough we have obtained BTD for tab-cel in the U.S. for treatment of patients with EBV+ PTLD who have failed rituximab, these designations may not lead to faster\ndevelopment or regulatory review and does not increase our likelihood of success. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug or biologic that is intended, alone or in\ncombination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug, or\nbiologic in our case, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects\nobserved early in clinical development. For product candidates that have been designated as breakthrough therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA and the\nsponsor of the study can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens.\nBiologics designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA may also be eligible for other expedited review programs, such as priority review. Based on our BTD, we may\npursue a rolling submission strategy for our BLA for tab-cel for EBV+ PTLD in the U.S. While a rolling review process may provide the opportunity for ongoing\ncommunications with and feedback from the FDA, it may not result in a faster timeline to marketing approval and has no bearing on whether or not tab-cel is ultimately\napproved. The FDA may raise issues and pose questions to us that may delay the initiation and completion of our BLA submission, acceptance of the complete BLA for filing,\nand approval of the BLA. We may not be able to provide a satisfactory or a timely response to FDA questions or we may not be able to gather the required data to prepare our\nBLA submissions as we plan. If we are unable to address all questions or concerns that the FDA may raise or if we do not have timely access to the data required for the\npreparation of the BLA, we may not be able to initiate and complete our BLA in a timely manner and ultimately receive FDA approval. In addition, even if we submit our BLA\nunder the rolling review process, the FDA may decide not to review portions of our BLA under the rolling review process until the submission is deemed to be complete.\n45\nPRIME designation supports the development and accelerated review by the EMA of new therapies to treat patients with unmet medical need. Despite this designation\nand the associated opportunity for accelerated assessment, the EMA may decide that additional time is needed for the MAA review and convert the MAA to a standard review\ntimeline. For example, the EMA converted the tab-cel MAA review timeline from accelerated to standard.\nDesignation as a breakthrough therapy is at the discretion of the FDA, and access to PRIME is at the discretion of the EMA. Receipt of a BTD or PRIME designation for\na product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under non-expedited FDA or EMA review\nprocedures and does not assure ultimate approval by either the FDA or EMA. In addition, the FDA or EMA, respectively, may later decide that the product no longer meets the\nconditions for qualification and rescind the BTD or PRIME designation or decide that the time period for FDA or EMA, respectively, review or approval will not be shortened.\nFor example, in June 2022, FDA published a draft guidance document outlining considerations for the FDA in rescinding BTD for products that no longer meet the\nrequirements for that designation.\nA Fast Track designation by the FDA, even if granted for other current or future product candidates, may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review, licensure\nprocess and does not increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing licensure.\nWe may seek fast track designation for one or more of our future product candidates. If a drug or biological product is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-\nthreatening disease or condition and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition, the drug sponsor may apply for FDA fast track\ndesignation for a particular indication. We may seek fast track designation for our product candidates, but there is no assurance that the FDA will grant this designation to any of\nour proposed product candidates. Marketing applications submitted by sponsors of products in fast track development may qualify for priority review under the policies and\nprocedures offered by the FDA, but the fast track designation does not assure any such qualification or ultimate marketing licensure by the FDA. The FDA has broad discretion\nwhether or not to grant fast track designation, so even if we believe a particular product candidate is eligible for this designation, there can be no assurance that the FDA would\ndecide to grant it. Even if we do receive fast track designation, we may not experience a faster development process, review or licensure compared to conventional FDA\nprocedures or pathways and receiving a fast track designation does not provide assurance of ultimate FDA licensure. In addition, the FDA may withdraw fast track designation\nat any time, including if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program.\nFailure to obtain regulatory or payor approval in international jurisdictions would prevent our product candidates from being marketed abroad.\nIn addition to regulations in the U.S., to market and sell our products in the EU, the UK, many Asian countries and other jurisdictions, we, or our current or future\ncommercialization partners, must obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements, both from a clinical and manufacturing\nperspective. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required\nto obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the U.S. generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval and may include additional\nrisks. Clinical studies accepted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries. In addition, many countries outside the U.S. require that a\nproduct be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that country. A product candidate that has been approved for sale in a particular country may not\nreceive reimbursement approval in that country. We or our partners may not be able to obtain approvals from regulatory authorities or payor authorities outside the U.S. on a\ntimely basis, if at all. Approval by a regulatory agency or payor does not ensure approval by any other regulatory or payor authorities in other countries or jurisdictions. We may\nnot be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market. If we or our partners are unable to obtain\napproval of any of our product candidates by regulatory or payor authorities in the US, EU, the UK, Asia or elsewhere, the commercial prospects of that product candidate may\nbe significantly diminished.\nThe proposed revision of the European legislation on pharmaceuticals could lead to uncertainties over the regulatory framework that will be applicable to medicinal\nproducts in the EU, including orphan medicinal products.\nIn April 2023, the EC published proposals to revise the existing European legislation on medicinal products (EU Pharma Law Review). The revisions consist of two\nproposals, a new directive and a new regulation (EU Pharma Law Proposal) that would amend and/or repeal and replace the relevant legislation concerning medicinal products\nfor human use, including legislation concerning orphan medicinal products and medicinal products for pediatric use. The EU pharma Law Review could have a significant\nimpact on the designation of and incentives offered to orphan medicinal products in the EU. If adopted in current form, the EU Pharma Law Proposal would introduce the\npossibility for the Commission, by way of delegated acts, to derogate from the current prevalence criterion, and introduce specific criteria for certain conditions, due to the\ncharacteristics of such conditions or other scientific reasons. The EU Pharma Law Proposal also proposes changes to the current orphan market exclusivity (OME) approach. If\nadopted in the\n46\ncurrent form, the EU Pharma Law Proposal would in most cases reduce the duration of the OME and replace the current system of separate OME periods for each new\nindication with a system with a single OME period for each active substance.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may still face future development and regulatory difficulties.\nEven if we, or our partners obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate, it would be subject to ongoing requirements by the FDA and comparable foreign\nregulatory authorities governing the manufacture, quality control, further development, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, adverse event reporting, safety surveillance,\nimport, export, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of safety and other post-marketing information. These requirements include submissions of safety and other\npost-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance by us and/or our CMOs and CROs for any post-approval clinical studies that we conduct.\nThey also include any post-approval requirements or commitments imposed by FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities as a condition of approval, or any risk\nevaluation or mitigation strategies (REMS), if applicable. The safety profile of any product will continue to be closely monitored by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory\nauthorities after approval. If the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities become aware of new safety information after approval of any of our product candidates,\nthey may require labeling changes or establishment of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, impose significant restrictions on a product’s indicated uses or marketing or\nimpose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance.\nIn addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to initial and continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory\nauthorities for compliance with current cGMP, current GCP, current cGTP and other regulations. If we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown problems with a\nproduct, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose\nrestrictions on that product, the manufacturing facility or us, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing. If we, our\nproducts, product candidates, or the manufacturing facilities for our products or product candidates fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency\nmay:\n•issue warning letters or untitled letters;\n•mandate modifications to promotional materials or require us to provide corrective information to healthcare practitioners;\n•require us or our partners to enter into a consent decree, which can include imposition of various fines, reimbursements for inspection costs, required due dates for\nspecific actions and penalties for noncompliance;\n•seek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n•suspend, withdraw or modify regulatory approval;\n•suspend or modify any ongoing clinical studies;\n•refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us;\n•suspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n•seize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products, require us to withdraw product from the market, or require us to initiate a product recall.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may also generate negative publicity or inhibit our ability to successfully commercialize our products.\nAdvertising and promotion of any product candidate that obtains approval in the U.S. will be heavily scrutinized by the FDA, the Department of Justice (DOJ), the\nOffice of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), state attorneys general, members of the U.S. Congress and the public. Additionally,\nadvertising and promotion of any product candidate that obtains approval outside of the U.S. will be heavily scrutinized by comparable foreign entities and stakeholders. For\nexample, a company may not promote “off-label” uses for its drug products. An off-label use is the use of a product for an indication that is not described in the product’s FDA-\napproved label in the U.S. or for uses in other jurisdictions that differ from those approved by the applicable regulatory agencies. Physicians, on the other hand, may prescribe\nproducts for off-label uses. Although the FDA and other regulatory agencies do not regulate a physician’s choice of drug treatment made in the physician’s independent medical\njudgment, they do restrict promotional communications from companies or their sales force with respect to off-label uses of products for which marketing clearance has not\nbeen issued. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA approved labeling. Violations, including\nactual or alleged promotion of our products for unapproved or off-label uses, are subject to enforcement letters, inquiries and investigations, and civil and criminal sanctions by\nthe FDA or\n47\ncomparable foreign bodies. Any actual or alleged failure to comply with labeling and promotion requirements may result in fines, warning letters, mandates to corrective\ninformation to healthcare practitioners, injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties.\nRegulations, guidelines and recommendations published by various government agencies and organizations may affect the use of our product candidates.\nChanges to regulations, recommendations or other guidelines advocating alternative therapies for the indications we treat could result in decreased use of our products.\nFor example, although treatment with EBV-specific T cells is recognized as a recommended treatment for persistent or progressive EBV+ PTLD as set forth in the National\nComprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines, future guidelines from governmental agencies, professional societies, practice management groups, private health/science\nfoundations and other organizations could lead to decreased ability to develop our product candidates, or decreased use of our products once approved by applicable regulatory\nauthorities.\nWe may not successfully identify, acquire, develop or commercialize new potential product candidates.\nPart of our business strategy is to expand our product candidate pipeline by identifying and validating new product candidates, which we may develop ourselves, in-\nlicense or otherwise acquire from others. In addition, in the event that our existing product candidates do not receive regulatory approval or are not successfully commercialized,\nthen the success of our business will depend on our ability to expand our product pipeline through internal development, in-licensing or other acquisitions. We may be unable to\nidentify relevant product candidates. If we do identify such product candidates, we may be unable to reach acceptable terms with any third party from which we desire to in-\nlicense or acquire them. Any product candidates we identify, acquire, in-license, develop, or manufacture may not be safe or effective for their targeted diseases, and may not\nreceive marketing authorization in a timely manner, or at all.\nRisks Related to Manufacturing\nWe are subject to a multitude of manufacturing risks, any of which could substantially increase our costs and limit supply of our product and product candidates.\nConcurrently with the in-license of our existing product and product candidates, we acquired manufacturing process know-how and, in some cases, inventory of process\nintermediates and clinical materials from our partners. Transferring manufacturing processes, testing and associated know-how is complex and involves review and\nincorporation of both documented and undocumented processes that may have evolved over time. In addition, transferring production to different facilities may require\nutilization of new or different processes and/or equipment to meet the specific requirements of a given facility. Each stage is retroactively and concurrently verified to be\ncompliant with appropriate regulations. As a result, there is a risk that all relevant know-how was not adequately transferred to us from our partners or that previous execution\nwas not compliant with applicable regulations.\nIn addition, we need to conduct significant development and scale-up work to transfer these processes and manufacture each of our product and product candidates for\nvarious studies, clinical studies and commercial launch readiness. To the extent we elect to transfer manufacturing within our network of third party CMOs, we are required to\ndemonstrate that the product manufactured in the new or “receiving” facility is comparable to the product manufactured in the original or “sending” facility. The inability to\ndemonstrate to each of the applicable regulatory authorities that comparable drug product was manufactured could delay the development of our product candidates or\navailability of additional commercial product supplies.\nThe processes by which some of our product and product candidates are manufactured were initially developed by our partners for clinical purposes. We intend to\nevolve the processes developed by our partners and the processes developed by us to support advanced clinical studies and commercialization requirements. We similarly intend\nto evolve the processes originating at Atara to support advanced clinical studies and commercialization requirements. Developing commercially viable manufacturing processes\nis a difficult and uncertain task, and there are risks associated with scaling to the level required for advanced clinical studies or commercialization, including cost overruns,\npotential problems with process scale-up, process reproducibility, comparability issues, stability, safety, purity and potency issues, regulatory agency review and endorsement\nprocesses, consistency and timely availability of reagents or raw materials. The manufacturing facilities in which our product and product candidates will be made could be\nadversely affected by pandemics, earthquakes and other natural or man-made disasters, equipment failures, labor shortages, power failures, and numerous other factors. In\naddition, there have been, and there may continue to be, transient interruptions in the supply of raw materials and consumables used in the development and manufacturing of\nour preclinical and clinical cell therapies related to raw material shortages due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other global pressures, including leukapheresis collections, which\nsupply starting materials used in our product and product candidates, and raw materials and consumables specialized for cell therapy manufacturing. If we are unable to obtain\nsuch raw materials or other necessary raw materials in a timely manner, our business operations and manufacturing capabilities could be adversely affected.\n48\nThe process of manufacturing cellular therapies is susceptible to product loss due to contamination, equipment failure or improper installation or operation of equipment,\nor vendor or operator error. Even minor deviations from normal manufacturing and distribution processes for any of our product and product candidates could result in reduced\nproduction yields, impact to key product quality attributes, and other supply disruptions. Product defects can also occur unexpectedly. If microbial, viral or other contamination\nis discovered in reagents or in our product and product candidates or in the manufacturing facilities in which our product and product candidates are made, these manufacturing\nfacilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to allow us to investigate and remedy the contamination. For example, we were informed by a CMO of mold\ncontamination in certain manufacturing suites related to the manufacture of finished Ebvallo and tab-cel product and intermediates at the CMO’s facility and we worked with the\nCMO to investigate and remediate such contamination issue while production continued in other manufacturing suites. Because our T-cell immunotherapy product and product\ncandidates are manufactured from cells collected from the blood of third party donors, the process of manufacturing is susceptible to the availability of the third party donor\nmaterial. The process of developing products that can be commercialized may be particularly challenging, even if they otherwise prove to be safe and effective. The\nmanufacture of these product and product candidates involves complex processes. Some of these processes require specialized equipment and highly skilled and trained\npersonnel. The process of manufacturing these product and product candidates will be susceptible to additional risks, given the need to maintain aseptic conditions throughout\nthe manufacturing process. Contamination with viruses or other pathogens in either the donor material or materials utilized in the manufacturing process or ingress of\nmicrobiological material at any point in the process may result in contaminated or unusable product. Viral contaminants may also arise in recombinant viral reagent production\nsystems used to manufacture viral reagents used to manufacture product and product candidates. These types of contaminations could result in delays in the manufacture of\nproducts which could result in delays in the development of our product candidates. These contaminations could also increase the risk of adverse side effects. Furthermore, our\nallogeneic products ultimately consist of many individual cell intermediate or cell product lots, each with a different HLA profile. As a result, the selection and distribution of\nthe appropriate cell product lot for therapeutic use in a patient requires close coordination between clinical operations, supply chain and quality assurance personnel.\nAny adverse developments affecting our, or our CMOs’ manufacturing operations for our product and product candidates may result in lot failures, inventory shortages,\nshipment delays, product withdrawals or recalls or other interruptions in the supply of our drug product which could delay the development of our product candidates or our\nability to supply product to our commercial partners, including Pierre Fabre. We may also have to write off inventory, incur other charges and expenses for supply of drug\nproduct that fails to meet specifications, undertake costly remediation efforts, or seek more costly manufacturing alternatives. Inability to meet the demand for our product and\nproduct candidates could damage our reputation and the reputation of our products among physicians, healthcare payors, patients or the medical community that supports our\nproduct development efforts, including hospitals and outpatient clinics.\nDelays in receiving regulatory approvals for product candidates produced at our CMOs’ facilities could delay our development plans and thereby limit our ability to\ngenerate revenues.\nThe research and development and process and analytical development labs within ARC and our facility in Aurora, Colorado, currently support our preclinical and\nmid/late development activities. Product-specific qualification to support clinical development and commercial production qualification activities are ongoing for product\ncandidates at our CMOs’ facilities. If the appropriate regulatory approvals for manufacturing product candidates at our CMOs’ facilities are delayed, we may not be able to\nmanufacture sufficient quantities of our product candidates, which would limit our development activities and our opportunities for growth.\nIn addition to the similar manufacturing risks described in “Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties,” our facilities, and our CMOs’ facilities, will be subject\nto ongoing, periodic inspection by the FDA, EMA or other comparable regulatory agencies to ensure compliance with cGMP and GTP. Our, or our partner’s, failure to follow\nand document adherence to these regulations or other regulatory requirements may lead to significant delays in the availability of products for clinical or, in the future,\ncommercial use, may result in the termination of or a hold on a clinical study, or may delay or prevent filing or approval of commercial marketing applications for our product\ncandidates. We also may encounter problems with the following:\n•achieving adequate inventory of clinical-grade materials that meet regulatory agency standards or specifications with consistent and acceptable production yield and\ncosts;\n•shortages of qualified personnel, raw materials or key contractors; and\n•achieving and maintaining ongoing compliance with cGMP regulations and other requirements of the FDA, EMA or other comparable regulatory agencies.\n49\nFailure to comply with applicable regulations could also result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, a requirement to suspend or\nput on hold one or more of our clinical studies, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our product candidates, delays, suspension or withdrawal of\napprovals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could harm our business.\nDeveloping advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls is costly, time consuming and is required to fully utilize our or our CMOs’ facilities. Failure to\nadvance manufacturing techniques and process controls could lead to a delay in obtaining approval for our product candidates. Without further investment, advances in\nmanufacturing techniques may render the facilities and equipment that manufacture our product candidates inadequate or obsolete.\nA number of the product candidates in our portfolio, if approved by applicable regulatory authorities, may require significant commercial supply to meet market\ndemand. In these cases, we may need to increase, or “scale up,” the production process by a significant factor over the initial level of production. If we are unable to do so, are\ndelayed, or if the cost of this scale up is not economically feasible for us or we cannot find a third party supplier, we may not be able to produce our product candidates in\nsufficient quantities to meet future demand.\nIf one or more of our CMO’s facilities is damaged or destroyed or production at these facilities is otherwise interrupted, our business would be negatively affected.\nIf any of our CMOs’ manufacturing facilities, or the equipment in any such facilities, is either damaged or destroyed, we may not be able to quickly or inexpensively\nreplace such manufacturing capacity or replace it at all. In the event of a temporary or protracted disruption in operations or loss of a facility or its equipment, we may not be\nable to transfer manufacturing to another third party in the time required to maintain supply. Even if we could transfer manufacturing to another third party, the shift would\nlikely be expensive and time-consuming, particularly since the new facility would need to comply with the necessary regulatory requirements or may require regulatory\napproval before selling any products manufactured at that facility. Such an event could delay our clinical studies or reduce our commercial product revenues.\nCurrently, we maintain insurance coverage against damage to our property and to cover business interruption and research and development restoration expenses.\nHowever, our insurance coverage may not reimburse us, or may not be sufficient to reimburse us, for any expenses or losses we may suffer. We may be unable to meet our\nrequirements for our product candidates if there were a catastrophic event or failure of our current manufacturing facility or processes.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nMaintaining clinical and commercial timelines is dependent on our end-to-end supply chain network to support manufacturing; if we experience problems with our third\nparty suppliers or CMOs we may delay development and/or commercialization of our product and product candidates.\nWe rely on our CMOs or our partners for the current production of our product and product candidates and the acquisition of materials incorporated in or used in the\nmanufacturing or testing of our product and product candidates. Our CMOs or partners are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements\nwith our CMOs or partners, we cannot directly control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources, including experienced staff, to the manufacturing of supply for\nour ongoing clinical, nonclinical and preclinical programs. Our CMOs for our product and product candidates will need to be prepared to undergo pre-approval inspection in\nconnection with our regulatory filings, and we cannot be certain that we will be able to adequately support them through such inspection nor that they will successfully pass any\nsuch inspection.\nTo meet our projected supply needs for clinical and commercial materials to support our activities through regulatory approval and commercial manufacturing of tab-\ncel, product candidates resulting from our next-generation CAR T programs or any other product candidates, we will need to transition the manufacturing of these materials to a\nCMO. Regardless of where production occurs, we will need to develop relationships with suppliers of critical starting materials or reagents, increase the scale of production and\ndemonstrate comparability of the material produced at these facilities to the material that was previously produced. Transferring manufacturing processes, analytical methods\nand know-how is complex and involves review and incorporation of both documented and undocumented processes that may have evolved over time.\nIn addition, transferring production to different facilities may require utilization of new or different processes to meet the specific requirements of a given facility. We\nwould expect additional comparability work will also need to be conducted to support the transfer of certain manufacturing processes and process improvements. We cannot be\ncertain that all relevant know-how and data has been adequately incorporated into the manufacturing process until the completion of studies (and the related evaluations)\nintended to demonstrate the comparability of material previously produced with that generated by us or our CMOs.\n50\nIf we or our CMOs are not able to successfully transfer and produce comparable product and product candidates, our ability to further develop and manufacture our\nproduct and product candidates may be negatively impacted.\nWe still may need to identify additional CMOs for continued production of supply for some of our product and product candidates. Given the nature of our\nmanufacturing processes, the number of CMOs who possess the requisite skill and capability to manufacture our T-cell immunotherapy product candidates, and the critical\nintermediates or reagents used to manufacture such products, are limited. We have not yet identified alternate suppliers in the event the current CMOs that we utilize are unable\nto scale production, or if we otherwise experience any problems with them.\nWe rely on our CMOs and manufacturing network for the production of our product and product candidates. Our supply, and ability to maintain inventory, of these\nproducts and product candidates depends on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these facilities, which could be adversely affected by equipment failures, failure to meet\nregulatory or cGMP requirements, labor or raw material shortages, public health epidemics, natural disasters, power failures, cyber-attacks and many other factors. If we\nencounter any manufacturing or supply chain difficulties, we may be unable to meet the demand for our products and product candidates.\nManufacturing cellular therapies is complicated and tightly regulated by the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities around the world, and although alternative third\nparty suppliers with the necessary manufacturing and regulatory expertise and facilities exist, it could be expensive and take a significant amount of time to arrange for\nalternative suppliers, transfer manufacturing procedures and analytical methods to these alternative suppliers, and demonstrate comparability of material produced by such new\nsuppliers. New manufacturers of any product, product candidate or intermediate would be required to qualify under applicable regulatory requirements. These manufacturers\nmay not be able to manufacture our product and product candidates at costs, or in sufficient quantities, or in a timely manner necessary to complete development of our product\ncandidates or make commercially successful products. If we are unable to arrange for alternative third party manufacturing sources, or to do so on commercially reasonable\nterms or in a timely manner, we may not be able to complete development of our product candidates, or market or distribute them. In addition, should the FDA or comparable\nregulatory authorities not agree with our product candidate specifications and comparability methodologies or assessments for these materials, regulatory authorities may\nrequire that we conduct additional studies, including bridging comparability testing, and further clinical development or commercial launch of our product candidates could be\nsubstantially delayed.\nReliance on third party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured product and product candidates ourselves, including reliance\non the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, the possibility that the third party manufacturer does not maintain the financial resources to meet its\nobligations under the manufacturing agreement, the possibility of breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control, including a\nfailure to manufacture our product candidates or any products we or our partners may eventually commercialize in accordance with our specifications, misappropriation of our\nproprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how, the possibility that the third party does not devote sufficient time or resources to our product candidates or\nany products we or our partners may eventually commercialize based on its own business priorities, the possibility that the third party is acquired by another party and changes\nits business priorities, and the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party, based on its own business priorities, at a time that is costly or\ndamaging to us. For example, the CRL MSA expires on March 31, 2024. While we are in active negotiations with CRL for a new commercial manufacturing agreement, there\ncan be no assurance that we will be able to enter into a new commercial drug product supply agreement with CRL on terms favorable or acceptable to us or at all. Any delays in\nentering into a new commercial manufacturing agreement and/or further extension of the current CRL MSA could delay the development and commercialization of our product\nand product candidates, if approved. In addition, if we are unable enter into a new commercial manufacturing agreement with CRL on acceptable terms, or at all, we would have\nto explore other options for the manufacture of our product and product candidates, which could harm our business. If Fujifilm does not perform its obligations under the\nFujifilm MSA adequately or does not devote sufficient time or resources to our product or product candidates, our operations, including the commercialization of our products,\nmay be adversely impacted. Similarly, if CRL does not perform its obligations under the CRL MSA adequately or does not devote sufficient time or resources to our product or\nproduct candidates, our operations, including the commercialization of our products, may be adversely impacted. We also have non-cancellable minimum purchase\ncommitments for products and services in certain of our agreements with our CMOs, if we do not fulfill such minimum purchase commitments, we will need to pay such CMOs\nthe difference between the applicable minimum purchase commitment and our actual purchases of products and services for a given period. In addition, the FDA and other\nregulatory authorities require that our product candidates and any products that we or our partners may eventually commercialize be manufactured according to cGMP, cGTP\nand similar regulatory jurisdictional standards. These requirements include, among other things, quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and\ndocumentation. The FDA or similar foreign regulatory agencies may also implement new standards at any time or change their interpretations and enforcement of existing\nstandards for manufacture, packaging or testing of products. We have limited control over our manufacturers’ compliance with these regulations and standards and although we\nmonitor our manufacturers, we depend on them to provide honest and accurate information. Any failure by our third party manufacturers to comply with cGMP or cGTP or\nfailure to scale up manufacturing processes, including any failure to deliver sufficient quantities of product candidates in a timely\n51\nmanner, could lead to a delay in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval of any of our product candidates. In addition, such failure could be the basis for the FDA to issue a\nwarning letter, withdraw approvals for product candidates previously granted to us, or take other regulatory or legal action, including recall or seizure of outside supplies of the\nproduct candidate, total or partial suspension of production, suspension of ongoing clinical studies, refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications,\ndetention or product, refusal to permit the import or export of products, injunction or imposing civil and criminal penalties.\nWe depend on third party suppliers and testing laboratories for key materials used to produce or test our product and product candidates. Any significant disruption in\nour supplier relationships could harm our business. Any significant delay in the supply of a product candidate for an ongoing clinical study could considerably delay initiation or\ncompletion of our clinical studies, product testing and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates. If raw materials or components cannot be purchased or fail to\nmeet approved specifications, the commercial launch of our product and product candidates could be delayed, or there could be a shortage in supply, which could impair our\nability to generate revenues from the sale of our product and product candidates.\nWe are dependent on Pierre Fabre for the commercialization of tab-cel (Ebvallo in the EU, UK) worldwide, including the United States. The failure of Pierre Fabre to meet\nits contractual, regulatory or other obligations could adversely affect our business and our obligations under the HCRx Agreement.\nWe have entered into the A&R Commercialization Agreement for tab-cel (Ebvallo in the EU and the UK) worldwide for EBV-positive cancers and are in the process of\nnegotiating amendments to certain ancillary agreements as contemplated by the A&R Commercialization Agreement to further advance our partnership with Pierre Fabre. The\nclosing of the A&R Commercialization Agreement occurred in December 2023. As a result, we are entirely dependent on Pierre Fabre for marketing and commercialization,\nincluding negotiation of pricing and reimbursement, of tab-cel. The timing and amount of any milestone and royalty payments we may receive under the A&R\nCommercialization Agreement, as well as the commercial success of tab-cel, will depend on, among other things, the efforts, allocation of resources, negotiation of pricing and\nreimbursement and successful commercialization of tab-cel by Pierre Fabre.\nUnder the terms of the A&R Commercialization Agreement, if we receive US BLA approval for tab-cel in patients with EBV+ PTLD, we are required to transfer the\nBLA to Pierre Fabre. Pierre Fabre will be responsible for obtaining all other regulatory approvals and maintaining all regulatory approvals. We will depend on Pierre Fabre to\ncomply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements governing, if and when applicable, the manufacture, quality control, further development, labeling, packaging,\nstorage, distribution, adverse event reporting, safety surveillance, import, export, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of safety and other post-marketing\ninformation. We do not control the individual efforts of Pierre Fabre and have limited ability to terminate the A&R Commercialization Agreement if Pierre Fabre does not\nperform as expected. The failure of Pierre Fabre to devote sufficient time and effort to comply with regulatory requirements and maintain the US BLA (if approved), the EU and\nUK marketing authorizations and other regulatory approvals and/or to meet their obligations to us, could have an adverse impact on our financial results and operations, and our\nobligations under the HCRx Agreement with respect to the Initial Territory.\nWe also depend on Pierre Fabre to comply with all applicable laws relative to the commercialization of tab-cel in the Additional Territory. The failure of Pierre Fabre to\ndevote sufficient time and effort to the commercialization of tab-cel; to meet their obligations to us, including for future royalty and milestone payments; to adequately deploy\nbusiness continuity plans in the event of a crisis; and/or to satisfactorily resolve significant disagreements with us or address other factors could have an adverse impact on our\nfinancial results and operations. In addition, if Pierre Fabre violates, or are alleged to have violated, any laws or regulations during the performance of their obligations for us, it\nis possible that we could suffer financial and reputational harm or other negative outcomes, including possible legal consequences.\nAny termination, breach or expiration of the A&R Commercialization Agreement or ancillary agreements, could have a material adverse effect on our financial\nposition, and our obligations under the HCRx Agreement with respect to the Initial Territory, by reducing or eliminating our right to receive fees, milestones and royalties. In\nsuch an event, we may be required to devote additional efforts and to incur additional costs associated with the transfer of regulatory approvals and commercialization of tab-\ncel. Alternatively, we may attempt to identify and transact with a new commercialization partner, but there can be no assurance that we would be able to identify a suitable\npartner or transact on terms similar to the A&R Commercialization Agreement or that are favorable to us.\nWe may not realize the benefits of strategic alliances that we may form in the future or of potential future product acquisitions or licenses.\nWe may desire to form additional strategic alliances, commercialization partnerships, create joint ventures or collaborations, enter into licensing arrangements with third\nparties or acquire products or business, in each case that we believe will complement or augment our existing business. These relationships or transactions, or those like them,\nmay require us to incur nonrecurring and other\n52\ncharges, increase our near- and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute our existing stockholders, reduce the potential profitability of the products that are the subject\nof the relationship or disrupt our management and business. In addition, we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic alliances and transactions and the\nnegotiation process is time-consuming and complex and there can be no assurance that we can enter into any of these transactions even if we desire to do so. Moreover, we may\nnot be successful in our efforts to establish a strategic alliance or other alternative arrangements for any future product candidates and programs because our research and\ndevelopment pipeline may be insufficient, our product candidates and programs may be deemed to be at too early a stage of development for collaborative effort and third\nparties may not view our product candidates and programs as having the requisite potential to demonstrate a positive benefit/risk profile. Any delays in entering into new\nstrategic alliances agreements related to our product candidates could also delay the development and commercialization of our product candidates and reduce their\ncompetitiveness even if they reach the market. In addition, any termination of established strategic alliance agreements will terminate any potential future funding we may\nreceive under the relevant agreements, and we would have to seek a new partner for development or commercialization, curtail or abandon that development or\ncommercialization, or undertake and fund the development and commercialization of the relevant product. If we seek a new partner but are unable to do so on acceptable terms,\nor at all, or do not have sufficient funds to conduct the development or commercialization of products ourselves, we would have to explore other strategic options, including\ncurtailing or abandoning that development or commercialization, which could harm our business. For example, effective July 31, 2022, we terminated the agreements with\nBayer pursuant to the Termination, Amendment and Program Transfer Agreement (Bayer Termination Agreement).\nIf we license products or acquire businesses, we may not be able to realize the benefit of these transactions if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our\nexisting operations and company culture. We cannot be certain that, following an acquisition or license, we will achieve the financial or strategic results that would justify the\ntransaction.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient intellectual property protection for our product candidates, or if the scope of the intellectual property protection is not\nsufficiently broad, our ability to commercialize our product candidates successfully and to compete effectively may be adversely affected.\nWe rely upon a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets and confidentiality agreements – both that we own or possess or that are owned or possessed by our\npartners that are in-licensed to us – to protect the intellectual property related to our technology, product and product candidates. When we refer to “our” technologies,\ninventions, patents, patent applications or other intellectual property rights, we are referring to both the rights that we own or possess as well as those that we in-license, many of\nwhich are critical to our intellectual property protection and our business. For example, the product, product candidates and platform technology we have licensed from our\npartners are protected primarily by patent or patent applications of our partners that we have licensed and as confidential know-how and trade secrets. If the intellectual property\nthat we rely on is not adequately protected, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have.\nThe patentability of inventions and the validity, enforceability and scope of patents in the biotechnology field is uncertain because it involves complex legal, scientific\nand factual considerations, and it has in recent years been the subject of significant litigation. Moreover, the standards applied by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office\n(USPTO) and non-U.S. patent offices in granting patents are not always applied uniformly or predictably. For example, there is no uniform worldwide policy regarding\npatentable subject matter or the scope of claims allowable in biotechnology patents.\nThere is no assurance that all potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications is known to us or has been found in the instances where\nsearching was done. We may be unaware of prior art that could be used to invalidate an issued patent or prevent a pending patent application from issuing as a patent. There\nalso may be prior art of which we are aware, but which we do not believe affects the validity or enforceability of a claim of one of our patents or patent applications, which\nmay, nonetheless, ultimately be found to affect the validity or enforceability of such claim. As a consequence of these and other factors, our patent applications may fail to\nresult in issued patents with claims that cover our product and product candidates in the U.S. or in other countries.\nEven if patents have issued or do successfully issue from patent applications, and even if these patents cover our product and product candidates, third parties may\nchallenge the validity, enforceability or scope thereof, which may result in these patents being narrowed, invalidated or held to be unenforceable. No assurance can be given that\nif challenged, our patents would be declared by a court to be valid or enforceable.\nEven if unchallenged, our patents and patent applications or other intellectual property rights may not adequately protect our intellectual property, provide exclusivity\nfor our product and product candidates or prevent others from designing around our claims. The possibility exists that others will develop products on an independent basis\nwhich have the same effect as our product and product\n53\ncandidates and which do not infringe our patents or other intellectual property rights, or that others will design around the claims of patents that we have had issued that cover\nour product and product candidates. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications with respect to our product and product candidates\nare threatened, it could jeopardize our ability to commercialize our product and product candidates and dissuade companies from collaborating with us.\nWe may also desire to seek a license from a third party who owns intellectual property that may be useful for providing exclusivity for our product and product\ncandidates, or for providing the ability to develop and commercialize a product candidate in an unrestricted manner. There is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain a\nlicense from such a third party on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nIn addition, the USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar\nprovisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the\napplicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent\nrights in the relevant jurisdiction.\nWe and our partners have filed a number of patent applications covering our product and product candidates or methods of using or making those product candidates.\nWe cannot offer any assurances about which, if any, patents will be issued with respect to these pending patent applications, the breadth of any such patents that are ultimately\nissued or whether any issued patents will be found invalid and unenforceable or will be threatened by third parties. Because patent applications in the U.S. and most other\ncountries are confidential for a period of time after filing, and some remain so until issued, we cannot be certain that we or our partners were the first to file any patent\napplication related to a product or product candidate. We or our partners may also become involved in proceedings regarding our patents, including patent infringement\nlawsuits, interference or derivation proceedings, oppositions, and inter partes and post-grant review proceedings before the USPTO the European Patent Office and other non-\nU.S. patent offices.\nEven if granted, patents have a limited lifespan. In the U.S., the natural expiration of a patent generally occurs 20 years after it is filed. Although various extensions may\nbe available if certain conditions are met, the life of a patent and the protection it affords is limited. If we encounter delays in our clinical studies or in obtaining regulatory\napprovals, the period of time during which we could exclusively market any of our product and product candidates under patent protection, if approved, could be reduced. Even\nif patents covering our product and product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired for a product, we may be vulnerable to competition from biosimilar\nproducts, as we may be unable to prevent competitors from entering the market with a product that is similar or identical to our product candidates.\nFurthermore, the research resulting in certain of our licensed patent rights and technology was funded by the U.S. government. As a result, the government has certain\nrights to these patent rights and technology. When new technologies are developed with government funding, the government generally obtains certain rights in any resulting\npatents, including a non-exclusive license authorizing the government to practice the invention for or on behalf of the U.S. These rights may permit the government to disclose\nconfidential information on which we rely to third parties and to exercise march-in rights to use or allow third parties to use our licensed technology. The government can\nexercise its march-in rights if it determines that action is necessary because we fail to achieve practical application of the government-funded technology, because action is\nnecessary to alleviate health or safety needs, to meet requirements of federal regulations or to give preference to U.S. industry. In addition, our rights in any inventions that result\nfrom government-funded research may be subject to certain requirements to manufacture products embodying these inventions in the U.S.\nIf we are sued for infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties, the resulting litigation could be costly and time-consuming and could prevent or delay our or\nour partners’ development and commercialization efforts.\nOur commercial success depends, in part, on us and our partners not infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of\nlitigation and other adversarial proceedings, both within and outside the U.S., involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical\nindustries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interference or derivation proceedings, oppositions, and inter partes and post-grant review proceedings before the USPTO\nand non-U.S. patent offices. Numerous U.S. and non-U.S. issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing\nand may develop our product and product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our\nproduct and product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of third parties’ patent rights, as it may not always be clear to industry participants, including us, which\npatents cover various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform or\npredictable.\n54\nThird parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing or future intellectual property rights, alleging that we are employing their proprietary\ntechnology without authorization. There may be third party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for\ntreatment related to the use or manufacturing of our product and product candidates that we failed to identify. For example, patent applications covering our product and\nproduct candidates could have been filed by others without our knowledge, since these applications generally remain confidential for some period of time after their filing date.\nEven pending patent applications that have been published, including some of which we are aware, could be later amended in a manner that could cover our product and\nproduct candidates or their use or manufacture. In addition, we may have analyzed patents or patent applications of third parties that we believe are relevant to our activities and\nbelieve that we are free to operate in relation to any of our product and product candidates, but our competitors may obtain issued claims, including in patents we consider to be\nunrelated, which may block our efforts or potentially result in any of our product, product candidates or our activities infringing their claims.\nIf we or our partners are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our product candidates, products and methods either do not infringe the patent\nclaims of the relevant patent or that the patent claims are invalid, and we may not be able to do this. Proving that a patent is invalid is difficult and even if we are successful in\nthe relevant proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel could be diverted from other activities. If any\nissued third party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment, we\ncould be forced, including by court order, to cease developing, manufacturing or commercializing the relevant product or product candidate until the relevant patent expired.\nAlternatively, we may desire or be required to obtain a license from such third party in order to use the infringing technology and to continue developing, manufacturing or\nmarketing the infringing product or product candidate. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonably terms, or at all. Even if we were\nable to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property licensed to us.\nWe may face claims that we misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of a third party. If we are found to have misappropriated a third party’s trade\nsecrets, we may be prevented from further using these trade secrets, which could limit our ability to develop our product candidates.\nDefending against intellectual property claims could be costly and time consuming, regardless of the outcome. Thus, even if we were to ultimately prevail, or to settle\nbefore a final judgment, any litigation could burden us with substantial unanticipated costs. In addition, litigation or threatened litigation could result in significant demands on\nthe time and attention of our management team, distracting them from the pursuit of other company business. During the course of any intellectual property litigation, there\ncould be public announcements of the results of hearings, rulings on motions, and other interim proceedings in the litigation and these announcements may have negative\nimpact on the perceived value of our product, product candidates, programs or intellectual property. In the event of a successful intellectual property claim against us, we may\nhave to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys’ fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent, or to redesign our infringing product and\nproduct candidates, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. In addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual\nproperty rights or personnel and the parties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could impose limitations on the conduct of our\nbusiness. We may also elect to enter into license agreements in order to settle patent infringement claims prior to litigation, and any of these license agreements may require us\nto pay royalties and other fees that could be significant. As a result of all of the foregoing, any actual or threatened intellectual property claim could prevent us or our partners\nfrom developing or commercializing a product or product candidate or force us to cease some aspect of our business operations.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting, enforcing and defending patents on all of our product and product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive.\nOur intellectual property rights in certain countries outside the U.S. may be less extensive than those in the U.S. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect\nintellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the U.S. Consequently, we and our partners may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in\ncountries outside the U.S., or from selling or importing infringing products made using our inventions in and into the U.S. or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our\ntechnologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection or where we do not have exclusive rights under the relevant patents to develop their own products\nand, further, may export otherwise-infringing products to territories where we and our partners have patent protection but where enforcement is not as strong as that in the U.S.\nThese infringing products may compete with our product and product candidates in jurisdictions where we or our partners have no issued patents or where we do not have\nexclusive rights under the relevant patents, or our patent claims and other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing.\n55\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain\ncountries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to\nbiopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us and our partners to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our\nintellectual property rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our attention from other aspects\nof our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing, and could provoke third parties\nto assert claims against us or our partners. We or our partners may not prevail in any lawsuits that we or our licensors initiate, and even if we or our licensors are successful the\ndamages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful.\nWe have in-licensed a significant portion of our intellectual property from our partners. If we breach any of our license agreements with these partners, we could lose the\nability to continue the development and potential commercialization of one or more of our product candidates.\nWe hold rights under license agreements with our partners, including MSK and QIMR Berghofer that are important to our business. Our discovery and development\nplatform is built, in part, around patent rights in-licensed from our partners. Under our existing license agreements, we are subject to various obligations, including diligence\nobligations with respect to development and commercialization activities, payment obligations upon achievement of certain milestones and royalties on product sales. If there is\nany conflict, dispute, disagreement or issue of nonperformance between us and our counterparties regarding our rights or obligations under these license agreements, including\nany conflict, dispute or disagreement arising from our failure to satisfy diligence or payment obligations, we may be liable to pay damages and our counterparties may have a\nright to terminate the affected license. The termination of any license agreement with one of our partners would materially adversely affect our ability to utilize the intellectual\nproperty that is subject to that license agreement in our drug discovery and development efforts, our ability to enter into future collaboration, licensing and/or marketing\nagreements for one or more affected product and product candidates and our, or our partners’ ability to commercialize the affected product and product candidates. Furthermore,\na disagreement under any of these license agreements may harm our relationship with the partner, which could have negative impacts on other aspects of our business.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our intellectual property, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful and have a material\nadverse effect on the success of our business.\nThird parties may infringe our patents or misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property rights. Our patent applications cannot be enforced against third\nparties practicing the technology claimed in these applications unless and until a patent issues from the applications, and then only to the extent the issued claims cover the\ntechnology. In the future, we or our partners may elect to initiate legal proceedings to enforce or defend our or our partners’ intellectual property rights, to protect our or our\npartners’ trade secrets or to determine the validity or scope of our intellectual property rights. Any claims that we or our partners assert against perceived infringers could also\nprovoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us or our partners alleging that we or our partners infringe their intellectual property rights or that our intellectual property\nrights are invalid.\nInterference or derivation proceedings provoked by third parties, brought by us or our partners, or brought by the USPTO or any non-U.S. patent authority may be\nnecessary to determine the priority of inventions or matters of inventorship with respect to our patents or patent applications. We or our partners may also become involved in\nother proceedings, such as reexamination or opposition proceedings, inter partes review, post-grant review or other pre-issuance or post-grant proceedings in the USPTO or its\nforeign counterparts relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property of others. An unfavorable outcome in any of these proceedings could require us or our\npartners to cease using the related technology and commercializing our product and product candidates, or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our\nbusiness could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us or our partners a license on commercially reasonable terms if any license is offered at all. Even if we or our\nlicensors obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us or our licensors. In addition, if the breadth or\nstrength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize\ncurrent or future product and product candidates.\nAny intellectual property proceedings can be expensive and time-consuming. Our or our partners’ adversaries in these proceedings may have the ability to dedicate\nsubstantially greater resources to prosecuting these legal actions than we or our partners can. Accordingly, despite our or our partners’ efforts, we or our partners may not be\nable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect our rights as fully\nas in the U.S. Even if we are successful in the relevant proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel could\nbe diverted from other activities. We could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys’ fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a\npatent. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that one or more of our patents is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or may refuse to stop the\nother party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse\n56\nresult in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential\ninformation could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other\ninterim proceedings or developments.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets and other proprietary information, the value of our technology could be materially adversely affected and\nour business could be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking the protection afforded by patents, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not\npatentable or that we elect not to patent, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce, and other elements of our technology, discovery and development processes that\ninvolve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. The T-cell immunotherapy product candidates and platform technology we have\nlicensed from our partners are protected primarily as confidential know-how and trade secrets. Any disclosure to or misappropriation by third parties of our confidential\nproprietary information could enable competitors to quickly duplicate or surpass our technological achievements, including by enabling them to develop and commercialize\nproducts substantially similar to or competitive with our product candidates, thus eroding our competitive position in the market.\nTrade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements and invention\nassignment agreements with our employees, consultants, CMOs, and outside scientific advisors, contractors and collaborators. These agreements are designed to protect our\nproprietary information. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors, or outside scientific advisors might\nintentionally or inadvertently disclose our trade secrets or confidential, proprietary information to competitors. In addition, competitors may otherwise gain access to our trade\nsecrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. If any of our confidential proprietary information were to be lawfully obtained or\nindependently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent such competitor from using that technology or information to compete with us, which could harm\nour competitive position.\nEnforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using any of our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In\naddition, the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights such as trade secrets to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the U.S.\nMisappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets to third parties could impair our competitive advantage in the market and could materially adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Commercialization of Our Product and Product Candidates\nOur commercial success depends upon attaining significant market acceptance of our product and product candidates, if approved, among physicians, patients, healthcare\npayors and the medical community, including hospitals and outpatient clinics.\nEven if we or our partners obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates that we may develop or acquire in the future, the product may not gain market\nacceptance among physicians, healthcare payors, patients or the medical community that supports our product development efforts, including hospitals and outpatient clinics.\nMarket acceptance of any of our product and product candidates for which we receive approval depends on a number of factors, including:\n•the efficacy and safety of the product candidates as demonstrated in clinical studies;\n•the clinical indications and patient populations for which the product candidate is approved;\n•the inclusion into clinical treatment guidelines;\n•acceptance by physicians and patients of the drug as a safe and effective treatment;\n•the administrative and logistical burden of treating patients;\n•the ability to identify in a timely manner the appropriate patients who will benefit from specific therapy;\n•the consideration of novel cellular therapies by physicians, hospitals and third party payors;\n•the potential and perceived advantages of product candidates over alternative treatments;\n•the safety of product candidates seen in a broader patient group, including its use outside the approved indications;\n57\n•any restrictions on use together with other medications;\n•the prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n•product labeling or product insert requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n•the timing of market introduction of our products as well as competitive products;\n•the development of manufacturing and distribution processes for our product and product candidates;\n•the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;\n•the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from, and our commercialization partners’ ability to negotiate pricing with, third-party payors and government\nauthorities;\n•relative convenience and ease of administration;\n•the ability to achieve a pricing and reimbursement recommendation or commercial agreement with national payors; and\n•the effectiveness of our commercialization partners’ sales and marketing efforts.\nEven if we or our partners are able to commercialize our product and product candidates, the products may not receive coverage and adequate reimbursement from third\nparty payors in the U.S. and in other countries in which our partners seek to commercialize our products, which could harm our business.\nOur ability to commercialize any product successfully will depend, in part, on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related\ntreatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations.\nGovernment authorities and third party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, determine which medications they will cover and\nestablish reimbursement levels. A primary trend in the healthcare industry is cost containment. Government authorities and third party payors continue to support initiatives to\ncontrol costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them\nwith predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Third party payors may also seek additional clinical evidence, beyond\nthe data required to obtain regulatory approval, demonstrating clinical benefits and value in specific patient populations before covering our products for those patients. We\ncannot be sure that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be available for any product that our partners commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of\nreimbursement will be. In some countries such as the U.S., greater cost-shifting from the payor to the patient is also a trend, and higher patient copayments or other\nadministrative burdens could lead to reduced demand from patients or healthcare professionals. This could particularly be the case in a challenging economic climate. Coverage\nand reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product or product candidate for which we obtain regulatory approval, and ultimately our partners’ ability to\nsuccessfully commercialize any product or product candidate for which we obtain regulatory approval.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the\ndrug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for\nin all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may\nalso not be sufficient to cover our costs and may only be temporary. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used,\nmay be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced\nby mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs\nfrom countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the U.S. Coverage and reimbursement policies for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor as\nthere is no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products among third party payors in the U.S. Third party payors in the U.S. often rely upon Medicare\ncoverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. The process of determining coverage and reimbursement is often time consuming and\ncostly which will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage or adequate\nreimbursement will be obtained. It is difficult to predict at this time what government authorities and third party payors will decide with respect to coverage and reimbursement\nfor our drug products. Our partners’ inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any\napproved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed and our overall financial condition.\n58\nCurrent and future legislation, including potentially unfavorable pricing regulations or other healthcare reform initiatives, may increase the difficulty and cost for us to\nobtain regulatory approval of our product candidates and affect the prices for our product and product candidates.\nThe regulations that govern, among other things, regulatory approvals, coverage, pricing and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to\ncountry. In the U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that\ncould prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to successfully sell any product and\nproduct candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In particular, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and\nEducation Reconciliation Act, collectively, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), was enacted, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and\nprivate insurers, and continues to significantly impact the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act and its implementing regulations, among other things,\naddressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for certain drugs and biologics, including our\nproduct candidates, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to\nutilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded\nprescription drugs, provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research.\nOther legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the U.S. since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other\nthings, created measures for spending reductions by the U.S. Congress. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went\ninto effect in April 2013. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, this reduction was temporarily suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, with subsequent\nreductions to 1% from April 1, 2022 until June 30, 2022. The 2% reduction was then reinstated and has been in effect since June 30, 2022, and will remain in effect (with\nadditional reductions of 2.25% in the first half of 2030 and 3% in the second half of 2030 to offset the COVID-19 suspension) until 2031 unless additional Congressional action\nis taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was enacted which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers,\nincluding hospitals and outpatient clinics, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.\nThere have been judicial and Congressional challenges to numerous elements of the ACA, as well as efforts by both the executive and legislative branches of the federal\ngovernment to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. While the U.S. Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain\nprovisions of the ACA, such as removing penalties, starting January 1, 2019, for not complying with the ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance and eliminating the\nimplementation of certain mandated fees. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a legal challenge to the law brought by several states arguing that, without the\nindividual mandate, the entire ACA was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court dismissed the lawsuit without ruling on the merits of the states’ constitutionality arguments.\nFurther, the IRA, signed into law in August 2022, extended the provision of enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health coverage through the ACA marketplace. The\nenhanced subsidies, which were originally passed as part of the American Rescue Plan Act are now extended through 2025. In the future, there may be additional challenges\nand/or amendments to the ACA. It is unclear how future litigation and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business.\nThere have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the foreign, federal and state levels directed at broadening the availability of\nhealthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future. The continuing efforts of governments,\ninsurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare, including by imposing price controls, may\nadversely affect the demand for our product and product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval and our ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our products.\nAny reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.\nFor example, in April 2023, the European Commission adopted a wide-ranging proposal for a new Directive and a new Regulation. If made into law, this proposal will\nrevise and replace the existing general pharmaceutical legislation. This change will likely result in significant changes to the pharmaceutical industry. In particular, it is expected\nthat the new Directive and Regulations will, if made into law, affect the duration of the period of regulatory protection afforded to medicinal products including regulatory data\nprotection (also called “data exclusivity”), marketing exclusivity afforded to orphan medicinal products, as well as the conditions of eligibility to the orphan designation.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We\ncannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the U.S. or foreign regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact\nof these changes on the regulatory approvals of\n59\nour product and product candidates, if any, may be. In the U.S., the EU and other potentially significant markets for our product and product candidates, government authorities\nand third party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies,\nwhich has resulted in lower average selling prices for certain products in certain markets. In the U.S., there have been several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted\nfederal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient\nprograms, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. For example, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 included several drug price\nreporting and transparency measures, such as a new requirement for certain Medicare plans to develop tools to display Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit information in\nreal time and for group and health insurance issuers to report information on pharmacy benefit and drug costs to the Secretaries of Health and Human Services, Labor, and the\nTreasury. Additionally, the IRA allows Medicare to: beginning in 2026, establish a “maximum fair price” for certain pharmaceutical and biological products covered under\nMedicare Parts B and D; beginning in 2023, penalize drug companies that raise prices for products covered under Medicare Parts B and D faster than inflation; and beginning in\n2025 impose new discount obligations on pharmaceutical and biological manufacturers for products covered under Medicare Part D. CMS has also taken steps to implement the\nIRA, including: on June 30, 2023, issuing guidance detailing the requirements and parameters of the first round of price negotiations, to take place during 2023 and 2024, for\nproducts subject to the “maximum fair price” provision that would become effective in 2026; on August 29, 2023, releasing the initial list of ten drugs subject to price\nnegotiations; on November 17, 2023, releasing guidance outlining the methodology for identifying certain manufacturers eligible to participate in a phase-in period where\ndiscounts on applicable products will be lower than those required by the Medicare Part D Manufacturer Discount Program; and on December 14, 2023, releasing a list of 48\nMedicare Part B products that had an adjusted coinsurance rate based on the inflationary rebate provisions of the IRA for the time period of January 1, 2024 to March 31, 2024.\nWhile it remains to be seen how the drug pricing provisions imposed by the IRA will affect the broader pharmaceutical industry, several pharmaceutical manufacturers and\nother industry stakeholders have challenged the law, including through lawsuits brought against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of the U.S.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services, CMS, and the CMS Administrator challenging the constitutionality and administrative implementation of the IRA’s drug price\nnegotiation provisions.\nThere have also been administrative developments in the U.S. related to drug pricing. For example, on February 2, 2022, the Biden Administration signaled its\ncontinued commitment to the Cancer Moonshot initiative, which was initially launched in 2016. In its announcement, the administration noted that its new goals under the\ninitiative include addressing inequities in order to ensure broader access to cutting-edge cancer therapeutics and investing in a robust pipeline for new treatments. On September\n12, 2022, President Biden issued an Executive Order to promote biotechnology and biomanufacturing innovation. The Order noted several methods through which the Biden\nAdministration would support the advancement of biotechnology and biomanufacturing in healthcare, and instructed the Department of Health and Human Service to submit,\nwithin 180 days of the Order, a report assessing how to use biotechnology and biomanufacturing to achieve medical breakthroughs, reduce the overall burden of disease, and\nimprove health outcomes. On October 14, 2022 President Biden issued an Executive Order on Lowering Prescription Drug Costs for Americans, which instructed the Secretary\nof the Department of Health and Human Services to consider whether to select for testing by the CMS Innovation Center new health care payment and delivery models that\nwould lower drug costs and promote access to innovative drug therapies for beneficiaries enrolled in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Executive Order further directed\nthe Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to submit, within 90 days of the date of the Executive Order, a report regarding any models that may lead to\nlower cost-sharing for commonly used drugs and support value-based payment that promotes high-quality care. Most recently, on February 14, 2023, the Department of Health\nand Human Services issued a report in response to the October 14, 2022 Executive Order, which, among other things, selects three potential drug affordability and accessibility\nmodels to be tested by the CMS Innovation Center. Specifically, the report addresses: (1) a model that would allow Part D Sponsors to establish a “high-value drug list” setting\nthe maximum co-payment amount for certain common generic drugs at $2; (2) a Medicaid-focused model that would establish a partnership between CMS, manufacturers, and\nstate Medicaid agencies that would result in multi-state outcomes-based agreements for certain cell and gene therapy drugs; and (3) a model that would adjust Medicare Part B\npayment amounts for Accelerated Approval Program drugs to advance the developments of novel treatments. On August 29, 2023, CMS released an initial list of ten drugs\nsubject to price negotiations. This negotiation process will occur during 2023 and 2024 and result in maximum prices that will be effective beginning in 2026. While it remains\nto be seen how the drug pricing provisions imposed by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will affect the broader pharmaceutical industry, several pharmaceutical manufacturers\nand other industry stakeholders have challenged the law, including through lawsuits brought against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of the\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services, CMS, and the CMS Administrator challenging the constitutionality and administrative implementation of the IRA’s drug price\nnegotiation provisions.\nOther proposed administrative actions may affect our government pricing responsibilities. For example, CMS has issued proposals to amend the existing Medicaid\nDrug Rebate Program regulations. In addition, there are pending legal and legislative developments relating to the 340B drug pricing program, including ongoing litigation\nchallenging federal enforcement actions against manufacturers and recently introduced and enacted state legislation. It remains to be seen how these drug pricing initiatives will\naffect the broader pharmaceutical industry.\n60\nAt the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing,\nincluding price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some\ncases, to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Another emerging trend at the state level is the establishment of prescription drug affordability\nboards, some of which will prospectively permit certain states to establish upper payment limits for drugs that the state has determined to be “high-cost”. Furthermore, the\nincreased emphasis on managed healthcare in the U.S. and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the EU will put additional pressure on product pricing,\nreimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, other insurers,\njudicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general.\nIn addition, there is significant uncertainty regarding the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive\npharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our product and product candidates. If third party payors do not consider our product and product\ncandidates to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, the payors may not cover our product and product candidates after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they\ndo, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.\nPrice controls may be imposed in foreign markets, which may adversely affect our future profitability.\nIn some countries, particularly Member States of the EU and the UK, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing\nnegotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after receipt of regulatory approval for a product. In addition, there can be considerable pressure by\ngovernments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. Political, economic and regulatory developments may\nfurther complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various EU Member States\nand parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced Member States, can further reduce prices. In some countries, we, or our collaborators, may be\nrequired to conduct a clinical study or other studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product and product candidates to other available therapies in order to obtain or\nmaintain reimbursement or pricing approval. Publication of discounts by third party payors or authorities may lead to further pressure on the prices or reimbursement levels\nwithin the country of publication and other countries. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels,\nour business could be adversely affected.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\nWe face competition from numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, as well as from academic institutions, government agencies and private and public\nresearch institutions for our current product and product candidates. Our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize\nproducts that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Additionally, our commercial opportunities will be\nreduced or eliminated if novel upstream products or changes in treatment protocols reduce the overall incidence or prevalence of our current or future target diseases.\nCompetition could result in reduced sales and pricing pressure on our product and product candidates, if approved by applicable regulatory authorities. In addition, significant\ndelays in the development of our product candidates could allow our competitors to bring products to market before us and impair any ability to commercialize our product and\nproduct candidates.\nThere are currently no FDA-approved products for the treatment of EBV+ PTLD, and there are no EC-approved products for this indication except for Ebvallo.\nHowever, we are aware some marketed products and therapies are used per global physician treatment guidelines in the US and the EU in the treatment of EBV+ PTLD by\nsome healthcare professionals and institutions, such as rituximab and combination chemotherapy regimens. In addition, a number of companies and academic institutions are\ndeveloping product candidates for EBV+ PTLD and other EBV-driven diseases, for example, Viracta Therapeutics, Inc., which is conducting a pivotal, Phase 2 clinical study\nfor nanatinostat (formerly named tractinostat, or VRx-3996) in combination with antiviral drug valganciclovir in relapsed/refractory EBV+ lymphomas.\nThere are currently six autologous CAR T therapies approved in the U.S. and/or EU: Novartis’ Kymriah® (tisagenlecleucel), Gilead/Kite’s Yescarta® (axicabtagene\nciloleucel) and TecartusTM (brexucabtagene autoleucel) and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Breyanzi® (lisocabtagene maraleucel) and Abecma (idecabtagene vicleucel) with 2seventy\nbio, Johnson & Johnson and Legend Biotech’s CarvyktiTM (ciltacabtagene autoleucel). There are many CAR-mediated cell therapies in development, and, although the majority\nare autologous, they also include allogeneic and off-the-shelf cell therapies. There are multiple allogeneic CAR platforms being developed with differences in approaches to\nminimize instances of donor cells recognizing the patient’s body as foreign or rejection of the donor cells by the patient’s body. These approaches include the use of gene-\nediting to remove or inhibit the TCR and the use of cell types\n61\nwithout a TCR. The majority of clinical stage allogeneic CAR programs utilize alpha beta T cells as the cell type and gene editing of the T-cell receptor and HLA as the\npreferred technology approach, however, other strategies are also in development such as Gamma Delta T cells and NK cells. It is possible that some of these other approaches\nwill have more favorable characteristics than the approach we utilize, which would result in them being favored by potential partners or customers over our products. Depending\non the diseases (such as autoimmune diseases) that we target in the future, we may face competition from both autologous and allogeneic CAR therapies and other modalities\n(e.g., small molecules, antibodies, bispecifics) in the indication of interest.\nMany of the approved or commonly used drugs and therapies for our current or future target diseases, including EBV+ PTLD and MS, are well established and are\nwidely accepted by physicians, patients and third party payors. Some of these drugs are branded and subject to patent protection, and other drugs and nutritional supplements are\navailable on a generic basis. Insurers and other third party payors may encourage the use of generic products or specific branded products. We expect that our product and our\nproduct candidates, if approved, will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products. Absent differentiated and compelling clinical evidence, pricing\npremiums may impede the adoption of our products over currently approved or commonly used therapies, which may adversely impact our business. In addition, many\ncompanies are developing new therapeutics, and we cannot predict what the standard of care will become as our products continue in clinical development.\nMany of our competitors or potential competitors have significantly greater established presence in the market, financial resources and expertise in research and\ndevelopment, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical studies, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do, and as a result may\nhave a competitive advantage over us. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, including through collaborative arrangements with large\nand established companies or if they are acquired by larger companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management\npersonnel, establishing clinical study sites and patient registration for clinical studies, establishing agreements with CROs and CMOs, as well as in acquiring technologies and\ntechnology licenses complementary to our programs or advantageous to our business.\nAs a result of these factors, these competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products before we are able to obtain patent protection or other intellectual\nproperty rights, which will limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are safer, more effective, more\nwidely used and cheaper than ours, and may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products. These appreciable advantages could render our\nproduct candidates obsolete or noncompetitive before we can recover development and other expenses.\nWe are subject to certain contractual obligations under our royalty financing agreement with HealthCare Royalty Partners and may be subject to claims for damages if we\nfail to fulfill these obligations.\nIn December 2022, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement (the HCRx Agreement) with HCR Molag Fund, L.P. (HCRx). Under the terms of the HCRx\nAgreement, we received $31.0 million in cash in consideration for our right to receive a portion of future royalty payments and certain milestones for Ebvallo in the Initial\nTerritory due to us from Pierre Fabre under the A&R Commercialization Agreement. The HCRx Agreement contains certain customary terms and conditions, including\nrepresentations and warranties, covenants, and indemnification obligations in favor of each party. Among these terms, there are certain covenants regarding our compliance with\nthe A&R Commercialization Agreement. In the event of actual or alleged breaches of the A&R Commercialization Agreement or the HCRx Agreement, we could be subject to\nclaims for damages from HCRx and could be subject to costly litigation.\nWe expect the product candidates we develop will be regulated as biological products (biologics) and therefore they may be subject to competition sooner than anticipated.\nThe Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA) was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act to establish an abbreviated pathway for the\napproval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. The regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics,\nincluding the possible designation of a biosimilar as “interchangeable” based on its similarity to an approved biologic. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product\ncannot be approved by the FDA until 12 years after the reference product was approved under a BLA. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still\nmarket a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from\nadequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The law is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by\nthe FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning are subject to uncertainty. While it is uncertain when processes intended to implement BPCIA may be\nfully adopted by the FDA, any of these processes could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological products.\n62\nWe believe that our product and any of the product candidates we develop that are approved in the U.S. as a biological product under a BLA should qualify for the 12-\nyear period of exclusivity. However, there is a risk that this exclusivity could be shortened due to Congressional action or otherwise, or that the FDA will not consider the\nsubject product candidates to be reference products for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for generic competition sooner than anticipated. Moreover, the\nextent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of the reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological\nproducts is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing.\nIn addition, the approval of a biologic product biosimilar to one of our products could have a material adverse impact on our business as it may be significantly less\ncostly to bring to market and may be priced significantly lower than our products.\nIf we are unable to enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product and product candidates, we may be unable to generate any revenue from the sale\nof our products.\nIn order to market any products that may be approved by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, we must enter into agreements with third parties to\nmarket and sell our product. There is no guarantee that we will be able to enter into such agreements with third parties or to do so on commercially reasonable terms or in a\ntimely manner. Any failure or delay in entering into agreements with third parties to market and sell our products, would adversely impact the commercialization of these\nproducts. There can be no assurance that we would be able to identify a suitable third party to market and sell our product or agree upon terms with third parties that are\nfavorable or acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to identify and reach agreement with a third party to market and commercialize our product, we may need to explore\nother strategic options, including commercializing products ourselves, and there is no guarantee we can successfully commercialize products ourselves. We may be competing\nwith many companies that currently have extensive and well-funded sales and marketing operations. Without a sufficiently scaled, appropriately timed and trained third party to\nperform sales and marketing functions, we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.\nWe may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, including with respect to our employee base, and managing our operations successfully.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 225 employees, excluding those impacted by the reduction in force announced in November 2023. In January 2024, we announced\nanother reduction of our workforce by approximately 25%. We may encounter difficulties in managing the size of our operations to support our continuing development\nactivities and the commercialization of our product and potential commercialization of our product candidates by our partners. As our development and commercialization\nplans and strategies continue to evolve, or as a result of any future acquisitions, we must continue to improve our managerial, operational, financial and other procedures and\nprocesses to manage the size our of operations. Our management, personnel and systems currently in place may not be adequate to support any future growth. Future growth\nwould impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including:\n•managing our preclinical and clinical studies effectively;\n•managing CMC operations and our external manufacturing partners effectively;\n•identifying, recruiting, maintaining, motivating and integrating additional employees, including the additional personnel needed to support continued development and of\nour product candidates;\n•managing our internal development efforts effectively while complying with our contractual obligations to licensors, licensees, contractors and other third parties;\n•improving our managerial, development, operational, information technology, and finance systems; and\n•expanding our facilities.\nAs our operations expand, we will also need to manage additional relationships with various strategic partners, suppliers and other third parties. Our future financial\nperformance and our ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to manage our\ndevelopment efforts and preclinical and clinical studies effectively and hire, train and integrate additional management, research and development, regulatory, manufacturing\nand administrative personnel. Our failure to accomplish any of these tasks could prevent us from successfully growing our company.\n63\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance.\nOur stock price has fluctuated in the past and can be expected to be volatile in the future. From January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2023, the reported sale price of\nour common stock has fluctuated between $0.20 and $16.93 per share. The stock market in general and the market for biotechnology companies in particular have experienced\nextreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. In particular, during the COVID-19 pandemic the volatility of the stock\nmarket for biopharmaceutical companies was heightened. As a result of the general volatility of the biopharmaceutical market, investors may experience losses on their\ninvestment in our common stock. The market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including the following:\n•the success of competitive products or technologies;\n•regulatory actions with respect to our product candidates or products or our competitors’ product candidates or products;\n•actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n•announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n•announcements of the results, including safety and efficacy of our product candidates, or progress of our clinical studies;\n•results of clinical studies, including safety and efficacy, of our product candidates or those of our competitors;\n•regulatory or legal developments in the U.S. and other countries;\n•developments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n•the recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n•the level of expenses related to any of our product candidates or clinical development programs;\n•the results of our efforts to in-license or acquire additional product candidates or products;\n•actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n•variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n•fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n•inconsistent or unusual trading volume levels of our shares or derivatives thereof;\n•announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n•sales of our common stock by us, our insiders or our other stockholders;\n•changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n•market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n•general economic, industry and market conditions; and\n•the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section.\nIn addition, the stock markets in general, and the markets for biotechnology and pharmaceutical stocks in particular, have experienced significant volatility that has\noften been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies, which has resulted in decreased stock prices for many companies. For example, negative publicity\nregarding drug pricing and price increases by pharmaceutical companies has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, the markets for biotechnology and\npharmaceutical stocks. Likewise, as a result of significant changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade\nand healthcare spending and delivery, including the possible repeal and/or replacement of all or portions of the Affordable Care Act or changes in tariffs and other restrictions\non free trade stemming from U.S. and foreign government policies, or for other reasons, the financial markets could experience significant volatility that could also negatively\nimpact the markets for biotechnology and pharmaceutical stocks. These market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\n64\nIn the past, class action litigation has often been instituted against companies whose securities have experienced periods of volatility in market price. Any such litigation\nbrought against us could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources, which could result in delays of our clinical studies or our partners’\ncommercialization efforts.\nOur principal stockholders own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control or significant influence over matters subject to stockholder\napproval.\nOur principal stockholders own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock. These stockholders may be able to determine the outcome of all matters\nrequiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any\nmerger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock. The interests of\nour significant stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily\nthose of other stockholders, including seeking a premium value for their common stock, and might affect the market price for our common stock.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders\nof a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. Moreover, certain holders of shares of our common stock will have rights,\nsubject to certain conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves\nor other stockholders. We have registered and intend to continue to register all shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans. Once we\nregister these shares, they can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs as a result of being a public company and our management expects to devote substantial time to public\ncompany compliance programs.\nAs a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the\nExchange Act, which require, among other things, that we file with the SEC annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. In\naddition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently adopted by the SEC and The Nasdaq Stock Market to implement provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, impose\nsignificant requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate\ngovernance practices. Further, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the SEC has adopted and will adopt additional rules and\nregulations, such as mandatory “say on pay” voting requirements, that now apply to us. Stockholder activism, the current political environment and the potential for future\nregulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate\nour business in ways we cannot currently anticipate.\nThe rules and regulations applicable to public companies have substantially increased our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-\nconsuming and costly. To the extent these requirements divert the attention of our management and personnel from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The increased costs will decrease our net income or increase our net loss and may require us to reduce costs\nin other areas of our business or increase the prices of our products or services.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be the sole source of potential gain\nfor our stockholders.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and\ndevelopment of our business. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our\ncommon stock will be the sole source of gain for our stockholders for the foreseeable future.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of\nthe percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To raise capital, we may sell substantial amounts of\ncommon stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock in one or more\n65\ntransactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. These future issuances of common stock or common stock-related securities, together with the exercise\nof outstanding options or warrants, and any additional shares issued in connection with acquisitions or in-licenses, if any, may result in material dilution to our investors. Such\nsales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common\nstock. To the extent equity valuations, including the trading price of our common stock, are depressed as a result of economic disruptions or other factors, the potential\nmagnitude of this dilution will increase. Pursuant to our equity incentive plans, our compensation committee is authorized to grant equity-based incentive awards to our\nemployees, non-employee directors and consultants. Future grants of RSUs, options and other equity awards and issuances of common stock under our equity incentive plans\nwill result in dilution and may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nSome terms of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would\nbe beneficial to our stockholders and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation (Certificate of Incorporation) and amended and restated bylaws (Bylaws), as well as Delaware law, could make it\nmore difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, or remove our current management. These\ninclude terms that:\n•permit our board of directors to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with any rights, preferences and privileges as they may designate;\n•provide that all vacancies on our board of directors, including as a result of newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law, be filled by the\naffirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n•establish that our board of directors is divided into three classes, with each class serving three-year staggered terms, which makes it more difficult to replace a majority of\nour directors in a short period of time;\n•require that any action to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and not be taken by written consent;\n•provide that stockholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of stockholders\nmust provide advance notice in writing, and also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder’s notice;\n•not provide for cumulative voting rights, thereby allowing the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors to elect all\nof the directors standing for election; and\n•provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by our board of directors, the chairperson of our board of directors or our chief executive officer.\nAny of the factors listed above may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for\nstockholders to replace members of our board of directors, who are responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may discourage, delay or\nprevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not, in general,\nengage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of\ndirectors has approved the transaction. Any term of our Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control\ncould limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay\nfor our common stock.\nOur Bylaws designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our\nstockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our current or former directors, officers, stockholders,\nor other employees.\nOur bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and\nexclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us under Delaware law, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by\nany current or former director, officer, or other employee of the Company to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers,\nor other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws (as either may be amended\n66\nfrom time to time), (iv) any action asserting a claim against us governed by the internal affairs doctrine, or (v) any other action asserting an “internal corporate claim,” as defined\nunder Section 115 of the DGCL. The forgoing provisions do not apply to any claims arising under the Securities Act and, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an\nalternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States will be the sole and exclusive forum for resolving any action asserting a claim arising under the Securities Act.\nThese choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our current or\nformer directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. There is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such\nprovisions, and the enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ charter documents has been challenged in legal proceedings. It is possible that a\ncourt could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable, and if a court were to find the choice of forum provision to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an\naction, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe recently qualified as a “smaller reporting company” and a “non-accelerated filer,” and any decision on our part to comply only with certain reduced reporting and\ndisclosure requirements applicable to such companies could make our common shares less attractive to investors.\nAs a result of our public float (the market value of our common shares held by non-affiliates) as of June 30, 2023, we qualify as a “smaller reporting company,” as\ndefined under the Exchange Act. In addition, we are a “non-accelerated filer” as defined under the Exchange Act. For as long as we continue to be a smaller reporting company\nor a non-accelerated filer, we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not smaller\nreporting companies or non-accelerated filers, as applicable, including, but not limited to, an exemption from the requirement that our independent registered public accounting\nfirm attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nIf we choose to rely on any of these reporting and disclosure exemptions, the information we provide stockholders will be different than the information that is available\nwith respect to many other public companies. Moreover, if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure or have an\nindependent review and attestation of our internal control over financial reporting, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the market price of our\ncommon stock may be more volatile.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could\ndecline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us and our business. In the\nevent securities or industry analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us or our business, our stock price would likely\ndecline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our\nstock price and trading volume to decline.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain our executive officers and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent upon our executive officers and other key employees and the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees,\nincluding scientific, technical or management personnel, could impede the achievement of our corporate objectives. In August 2022, we announced a reduction of our\nworkforce by approximately 20% across all areas of our company, including members of management. In November 2023, we implemented a further reduction of our\nworkforce by approximately 30%, and in January 2024, we announced an additional reduction of our workforce by approximately 25%, including a member of management.\nLosing members of management and other key personnel subjects us to a number of risks, including the failure to coordinate responsibilities and tasks, the necessity to create\nnew management systems and processes, the impact on corporate culture, and the retention of historical knowledge.\nOur success depends on our ability to recruit, retain, manage and motivate our employees. Although we enter into employment agreements or offer letters with our\nemployees, these documents provide for “at-will” employment, which means that any of our employees could leave our employment at any time, with or without notice.\nCompetition for skilled personnel in our industry and geographic regions is intense and may limit our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms or at all.\nTo induce valuable employees to remain at our company, in addition to salary and cash incentives, we have provided equity awards that vest\n67\nover time. The value to employees of equity awards may be significantly affected by movements in our stock price that are beyond our control and may at any time be\ninsufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies.\nOur relationships with customers and third party payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, privacy and other laws and regulations, which could\nexpose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, including physicians, and third party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of our product and any product\ncandidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. Our current and future arrangements with third party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable federal and\nstate fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct research\nand would market, sell and distribute our products. As a biopharmaceutical company, even though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly\nto Medicare, Medicaid or other third party payors, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients’ rights are and will be applicable\nto our business. If we obtain FDA approval of any of our product candidates and our partners begin commercializing those products in the United States, our potential exposure\nunder such laws will increase significantly, and our costs associated with compliance with such laws are also likely to increase. These laws may impact, among other things, our\ncurrent activities with principal investigators and research patients, as well as proposed and future sales, marketing and education programs, distribution agreements,\ndiscounting, commission compensation, certain patient support offerings, and other business arrangements generally. In addition, the approval and commercialization of our\nproduct and any of our product candidates outside the United States will also likely subject us to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned here, among other foreign\nlaws. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations that may affect certain business arrangements and our ability to operate include, but are not\nlimited to, the following:\n•the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute, a criminal law that governs, for example, our marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies, and relationships\nwith healthcare providers or other entities, by prohibiting, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing\nremuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase,\norder or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n•the FDCA and PHSA, which prohibit the misbranding and adulteration of biological products that are regulated as drugs, and which regulate the marketing of biological\nproducts;\n•federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, which can be enforced through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and civil\nmonetary penalty laws impose criminal and civil penalties against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government,\nincluding the Medicare and Medicaid programs, claims for payment or approval that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an\nobligation to pay money to the federal government;\n•provisions enacted under the federal HIPAA impose criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute, a scheme or artifice to\ndefraud any healthcare benefit program and also impose criminal liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a\nmaterial fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;\n•HIPAA, as amended by HITECH also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of\nindividually identifiable health information held by covered entities and their business associates and their subcontractors that use, disclose or otherwise process\nindividually identifiable health information;\n•the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, implemented as the Open Payments Program, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and\nmedical supplies to report annually to CMS information related to payments and other transfers of value to U.S.-licensed physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists,\noptometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse\nanesthetists and certified nurse midwives and U.S. teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members and\napplicable group purchasing organizations;\n•state and foreign laws and regulations that are analogous to, and may be broader in scope than, the federal laws and regulations described in this risk factor, such as state\nanti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing or other arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-\ngovernmental third party payors, including private insurers; and\n68\n•state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance\npromulgated by the federal government; some state laws require drug manufacturers to report information regarding pricing and marketing information related to\npayments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers as well as those that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives;\nand some other state laws require the protection of the privacy and security of health information, which may differ from each other in significant ways and often are not\npreempted by HIPAA.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible\nthat governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable healthcare laws\nand regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and\nadministrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from government-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, disgorgement, additional\nreporting requirements or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations,\nreputational harm, contractual damages, and diminished profits and future earnings, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of\noperations. If any physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to not be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be\nsubject to significant criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government-funded healthcare programs.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could cause\nsignificant liability for us and harm our reputation.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct, including intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations or similar regulations of comparable\nforeign regulatory authorities, provide accurate information to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, comply with manufacturing standards we have established,\ncomply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable foreign regulatory\nauthorities, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information\nobtained in the course of clinical studies, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee\nmisconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from\ngovernmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us,\nand we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the\nimposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical studies and will face an even greater risk if we\ncommercially sell any products that we may develop. Product liability claims may be brought against us by subjects enrolled in our clinical studies, patients, healthcare\nproviders or others using, administering or selling our products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products caused\ninjuries, we could incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n•decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop;\n•clinical holds or termination of clinical study sites or entire study programs;\n•injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n•withdrawal of clinical study participants;\n•significant costs to defend the related litigation;\n•substantial monetary awards to study subjects or patients;\n•loss of revenue;\n•diversion of management and scientific resources from our business operations; and\n•the inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\n69\nWe currently hold product liability insurance coverage at a level that we believe is customary for similarly situated companies and adequate to provide us with insurance\ncoverage for foreseeable risks, but which may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost\nor in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise. As deemed necessary, we may expand our insurance coverage for products to include the sale of commercial\nproducts if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates in development, but we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for\nany products that receive regulatory approval. Large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. A successful\nproduct liability claim or series of claims brought against us, particularly if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our\nbusiness.\nIf we and our third party manufacturers fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur\ncosts that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nWe and our third party manufacturers are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures\nand the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including\nchemicals and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and\nwastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our or our third party\nmanufacturers’ use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs\nassociated with civil or criminal fines and penalties.\nAlthough we maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of\nhazardous materials with a policy limit that we believe is customary for similarly situated companies and adequate to provide us with insurance coverage for foreseeable risks,\nthis insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted\nagainst us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological or hazardous materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws\nand regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or\nother sanctions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe actual or perceived failure by us, our customers, or vendors to comply with increasingly stringent laws, regulations and contractual obligations relating to privacy, data\nprotection, and data security could harm our reputation, and subject us to significant fines and liability.\nWe are or may become subject to numerous domestic and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, the scope of which is\nchanging, subject to differing applications and interpretations and may be inconsistent among countries, or conflict with other rules. We are also subject to the terms of our\ncontractual obligations to customers and third parties related to privacy, data protection, and data security. The actual or perceived failure by us, our customers, our vendors, or\nother relevant third parties to address or comply with these laws, regulations, and obligations could increase our compliance and operational costs, expose us to regulatory\nscrutiny, actions, fines and penalties, cause regulators to reject, limit or disrupt our clinical trial activities, result in reputational harm, lead to a loss of customers, reduce the use\nof our products, result in litigation and liability, and could otherwise cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFor example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (EU GDPR) imposes strict requirements on in-scope organizations regarding the processing of\npersonal information (i.e., data which identifies an individual or from which an individual is identifiable) of individuals (or data subjects). The EU GDPR governs the\ncollection, use, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal information and has direct effect in all EU Member States and extraterritorial effect where organizations\noutside of the European Economic Area (EEA) process personal information of individuals in the EEA in relation to the offering of goods or services to those individuals or the\nmonitoring of their behavior. The UK has implemented the EU GDPR into its national law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act as the UK GDPR\n(together, the UK GDPR and the EU GDPR, the GDPR). Under the UK GDPR, companies established in the UK and companies not established in the UK but who process\npersonal information of individuals in the UK in relation to the offering of goods or services to those individuals, or to the monitoring of their behavior will be subject to the UK\nGDPR. As such, the GDPR applies to us to the extent we are established in an EU Member State or the UK, we are processing personal information in the context of an\nestablishment in an EU Member State or the UK or we are processing personal information in relation to the offering of goods or services to individuals in the EEA or the UK or\nmonitoring their behavior.\n70\nThe GDPR imposes onerous and comprehensive privacy, data protection, and data security obligations onto controllers, including, as applicable: (i) contractual privacy,\ndata protection, and data security commitments, including the requirement to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard personal information\nprocessed; (ii) establishing means for individuals to exercise their data protection rights (e.g., the right to erasure of personal information); (iii) limitations on retention and the\namount of personal information processed; (iv) additional requirements pertaining to sensitive information (such as health data); (v) data breach notification requirements to: (x)\nsupervisory authorities without undue delay (and no later than 72 hours where feasible) after becoming aware of the breach, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the\ndata subjects’ rights and freedoms; and/or (y) concerned individuals where the breach is likely to result in a high risk to their rights and freedoms; (vi) requirements to process\npersonal information lawfully including specific requirements for obtaining valid consent from data subjects where consent is the lawful basis for processing; (vii) obligations to\nconsider data protection as any new products or services are developed and designed; and (viii) accountability and transparency requirements, which require controllers to\ndemonstrate and record compliance with the GDPR and to provide more detailed information to data subjects(such as clinical trial subjects and investigators) regarding\nprocessing. The GDPR also provides that EU Member States and the UK (as applicable) may introduce further laws and regulations limiting the processing of genetic,\nbiometric, or health data, which could limit our ability to collect, use and share personal information subject to the GDPR, cause our compliance costs to increase, require us to\nchange our practices, adversely impact our business, and harm our financial condition.\nIn addition, the EU GDPR also prohibits the transfer of personal information from the EEA to countries that the European Commission does not recognize as having an\n“adequate” level of data protection unless the parties to the transfer have implemented specific safeguards to protect the transferred personal information. Data protection laws\nin the UK (as discussed below) and Switzerland impose similar restrictions. One of the primary safeguards allowing U.S. companies to import personal information from the EU\nand Switzerland had historically been certification to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework, which is administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, and Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield framework respectively. However, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework was invalidated as a mechanism to legitimize international transfers in July 2020 in the\n“Schrems II” decision handed down by the Court of Justice of the EU and imposed further restrictions on the use of standard contractual clauses (SCCs). The Schrems II\ndecision also led to a requirement for companies to carry out a transfer impact assessment (TIA) which, among other things, assess laws governing access to personal\ninformation in the recipient country and considers whether supplementary measures that provide privacy protections additional to those under the EU SCCs will need to be\nimplemented to ensure an “essentially equivalent” level of data protection to that afforded in the EU. Similarly, the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield framework was declared as\ninadequate by the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner in light of the Schrems II decision.\nOn October 7, 2022, the U.S. President introduced an Executive Order to facilitate a new Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework (DPF), and on July 10, 2023, the EC\nadopted its Final Implementing Decision granting the U.S. adequacy (Adequacy Decision) for EU-U.S. transfers of personal information for companies that self-certify to the\nDPF. Entities relying on EU SCCs for transfer to the U.S. are also able to rely on the analysis in the Adequacy Decision as support for their TIA regarding the equivalence of\nU.S. national security safeguards and redress. However, any transfers by us or our vendors of personal information subject to the EU GDPR may not comply with European data\nprotection law, may increase our exposure to the EU GDPR’s heightened sanctions for violations of its cross-border data transfer restrictions, and may reduce demand from\ncompanies subject to European data protection laws.\nComplying with the GDPR involves rigorous and time-intensive processes that may cause us to incur certain operational costs and/or require us to change our business\npractices. There may also be a risk that the measures will not be implemented correctly or that individuals within the business will not be fully compliant with the required\nprocedures. If there are breaches of these measures, we could face significant administrative and monetary sanctions as well as reputational damage which may have a material\nadverse effect on our operations, financial condition and prospects. Assisting our customers, partners, and vendors in complying with the GDPR, or complying with the GDPR\nourselves, may cause us to incur substantial operational costs or require us to change our business practices. There may also be a risk that the measures will not be implemented\ncorrectly or that individuals within the business will not be fully compliant with the required procedures. There is a risk that we could be impacted by a cybersecurity incident\nthat results in loss or unauthorized disclosure of personal information, potentially resulting in us facing harms similar to those described above.\nCompanies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection\nrequirements, potential significant fines for non-compliance of up to the greater of €20 million (under the EU GDPR) or £17.5 million (under the UK GDPR) or 4% of\nconsolidated annual global turnover and restrictions or prohibitions on data processing. The GDPR identifies a list of points to consider when determining the level of fines to\nimpose (including the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement). The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge\ncomplaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR.\n71\nThe UK GDPR also imposes similar restrictions on transfers of personal information from the UK to jurisdictions that the UK Government does not consider\n“adequate”, including the U.S. It should also be noted that the UK Government has published its own form of EU SCCs known as the UK International Data Transfer\nAgreement together with an International Data Transfer Addendum to the new EU SCCs. The UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) has also published its version of\nthe TIA and guidance on international transfers, although entities may choose to adopt either the EU or UK style TIA. Further, on September 21, 2023, the UK Secretary of\nState of Science, Innovation and Technology established a UK-U.S. data bridge (i.e., a UK equivalent of the Adequacy Decision) and adopted UK regulations to implement the\nUK-U.S. data bridge (“UK Adequacy Regulations”). Personal information may now be transferred from the UK under the UK-U.S. data bridge through the UK extension to the\nDPF to organizations self-certified under the UK extension to DPF.\nOther countries outside of Europe and the UK continue to enact or are considering enacting similar cross-border data transfer restrictions and laws requiring local data\nresidency, which could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services and operating our business. For example, Brazil recently enacted the General Data Protection\nLaw (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais or LGPD) (Law No. 13,709/2018), which broadly regulates the processing of personal information and imposes compliance\nobligations and penalties comparable to those of the EU GDPR and the UK GDPR.\nRegulation of privacy, data protection and data security has also become more stringent in the United States. HIPAA imposes requirements to protect the privacy and\nsecurity of protected health information (“PHI”) and to provide notification in the event of a breach of PHI. Violations of HIPAA are punishable by civil money penalties and, in\nsome cases, criminal penalties and imprisonment. HHS’ Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”), which is responsible for enforcing HIPAA, also may enter into resolution agreements\nrequiring the payment of a civil money penalty and/or the establishment of a corrective action plan to address violations of HIPAA. Pursuant to HIPAA, HHS has adopted\nprivacy regulations, known as the privacy rule, to govern the use and disclosure of PHI (the “Privacy Rule”). HHS has also adopted data security regulations (the “Security\nRule”) that require Covered Entities (including health care providers) and Business Associates to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the\nintegrity, confidentiality and availability of PHI that is electronically created, received, maintained or transmitted (such as between us and our affiliated practices).\nNumerous state and certain other federal laws protect the confidentiality of health information and other personal information, including but not limited to state medical\nprivacy laws, state laws protecting personal information, state data breach notification laws, state genetic privacy laws, human subjects research laws and federal and state\nconsumer protection laws. For example, the CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020, give California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal\ninformation, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil\npenalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and\npotential liability. The CCPA was substantially expanded on January 1, 2023, when the CPRA amendments to the CCPA became fully operative. The CPRA amendments,\namong other things, give California residents the ability to limit use of certain sensitive personal information, further restrict the use of cross-contextual advertising, establish\nrestrictions on the retention of personal information, expand the types of data breaches subject to the CCPA’s private right of action, provide for increased penalties for CCPA\nviolations concerning California residents under the age of 16, and establish a new California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new law. Regulation of\nprivacy, data protection and data security has also become more stringent in the United States, with several new laws being enacted at the state level. For instance, additional\nstates have enacted laws related to consumer privacy, such as Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia. While these new laws generally include exemptions for HIPAA-\ncovered data, they add layers of complexity to compliance in the U.S. market, and could increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our business. While these laws\ngenerally include exemptions for HIPAA-covered and clinical trial data, they impact the overall privacy landscape. Multiple other states and the federal government are\nconsidering enacting similar legislation, demonstrating a strong trend towards more stringent state privacy, data protection and data security legislation in the U.S., which could\nincrease our potential liability and adversely affect our business. Other states have passed or amended existing state privacy laws to impose enhanced privacy and cybersecurity\nobligations for consumer health data, such as, the Washington My Health My Data Act and Nevada’s Consumer Health Data Privacy Law. For instance, Washington State\npassed the “My Health My Data Act” with respect to “consumer health data” which is defined as “personal information that is linked or reasonably linkable to a consumer and\nthat identifies a consumer’s past, present, or future physical or mental health” and which will go into effect in 2024 with additional privacy rights and compliance obligations.\nLawmakers and regulatory bodies at the federal level have been considering more detailed regulation regarding these subjects and the privacy and security of personal\ninformation. For example, the FTC recently published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on “commercial surveillance” and data security, and is seeking comment on\nwhether it should implement new trade regulation rules or other regulatory alternatives concerning the ways in which companies (1) collect, aggregate, protect, use, analyze,\nand retain consumer data, as well as (2) transfer, share, sell, or otherwise monetize that data in ways that are unfair or deceptive. The FTC’s rulemaking may create change\nthroughout the economy and broader data ecosystem. The FTC has also been active with respect to enforcement of its Health Breach Notification Rule and in scrutinizing the\nuse and disclosure of sensitive personal information.\n72\nAdditionally, the OCR has issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which propose a number of changes to the HIPAA Privacy Rule, with updates to the HIPAA Privacy Rule\nexpected in 2024.\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has authority under Section 5 of the FTC Act to regulate unfair or deceptive practices, and has used this authority to initiate\nenforcement actions against companies that implement inadequate controls around privacy and information security in violation of their externally facing policies. The FTC has\nrecently brought several cases alleging violations of Section 5 of the FTC Act with respect to health information, and has proposed rulemaking on privacy and data security.\nCompliance with applicable U.S. and foreign privacy, data protection, and data security laws and regulations may result in government investigations or cause us to\nincur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business. Moreover, complying with these various\nlaws could require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to collect, use and disclose data, or in some cases, impact our ability to operate in\ncertain jurisdictions. Failure to comply with U.S. and foreign privacy, data protection, and data security laws and regulations could result in government investigations or\nenforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation, claims, or public statements against us and/or adverse publicity and could negatively\naffect our operating results and business. Claims that we have violated individuals’ privacy rights, failed to comply with privacy, data protection, and data security laws, or\nbreached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time consuming to defend, could result in adverse publicity and could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial performance and business, and operations. Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed\nby, the laws, regulations and policies that are applicable to the business of our customers may limit the adoption and use of, and reduce the overall demand for, our products and\nservices.\nIf our security measures are compromised, or our information technology systems or those of our vendors, and other relevant third parties fail or suffer security breaches,\nloss or leakage of data, and other disruptions, this could result in a material disruption of our services, compromise sensitive information related to our business, harm our\nreputation, trigger our breach notification obligations, prevent us from accessing critical information, and expose us to liability or other adverse effects to our business.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we may collect, process, and store proprietary, confidential, and sensitive information, including personal information (including\nhealth information), intellectual property, trade secrets, and proprietary business information owned or controlled by ourselves or other parties. It is critical that we do so in a\nsecure manner to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of such information. We face several risks relative to protecting this critical information, including loss\nof access risk, inappropriate use or disclosure, inappropriate modification, and the risk of our being unable to adequately monitor, audit and modify our controls over our\ncritical information. This risk extends to the third party service providers who handle elements of our operations.\nWe, our partners, our CROs, our CMOs, and other business vendors on which we rely depend on information technology and telecommunication systems for significant\nelements of our operations, including, for example, systems handling human resources, financial reporting and controls, regulatory compliance and other infrastructure\noperations. Notwithstanding the implementation of security measures, given the size and complexity of our information technology systems and those of our third party vendors\nand other contractors and consultants, and the increasing amounts of proprietary, confidential and sensitive information that they maintain, such information technology systems\nhave been subject to and remain vulnerable to breakdown, service interruptions, system malfunction, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical\nfailures, as well as security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our personnel, third party vendors, contractors, consultants, business partners, and/or other third\nparties, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties (including the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering, and other\nmeans to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information), which may compromise our system infrastructure, or that of our\nthird party vendors and other contractors and consultants, or lead to data leakage. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through accidental actions or omissions\nby trusted insiders, cyber attacks or cyber intrusions, including by computer hackers, viruses, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number,\nintensity, and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Additionally, the increased usage of computers operated on home\nnetworks due to the shelter-in-place or similar restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic may make our systems more susceptible to security breaches. For example, in\nMarch 2021, MSK provided notice that MSK was one of many customers impacted by a data breach at Accellion, Inc., which provides a document-sharing system. MSK\nsubsequently notified us that certain documents related to one of our discontinued programs were subject to the breach, which compromise we deemed immaterial. Although we\ntake measures to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access, use or disclosure, we and our third party service providers frequently defend against and respond to cyber\nattacks, and our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or viruses or breached due to personnel error, malfeasance, or other\nmalicious or inadvertent disruptions. Any such breach or interruption could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed by unauthorized\nparties, manipulated, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen.\n73\nFailures or significant downtime of our information technology or telecommunication systems or those used by our third party service providers could cause significant\ninterruptions to our operations, including preventing us from conducting tests or research and development activities and preventing us from managing the administrative\naspects of our business. For example, the loss of clinical study data from completed, ongoing or planned clinical studies could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts\nand significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. In addition, sophisticated operating system software and applications that we procure from third parties\nmay contain defects in design or manufacture, including vulnerabilities, “bugs” and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of our networks, system,\nor our processing of personal information or other data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or\ninappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability, the further development of our product candidates could be delayed and our\nbusiness could be otherwise adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to anticipate all types of security threats, and we may not be able to implement preventative measures effective against all such security threats. We\nalso may not be effective in responding to, containing or mitigating the risks of an attack. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized\nuntil launched, and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers, organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations,\nhostile foreign governments or agencies, or cybersecurity researchers. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or\napplications, or those of our third party vendors and other contractors and consultants, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur\nliability and reputational damage and the further development and commercialization of our products and services could be delayed.\nThe costs related to significant security breaches or disruptions could be material and could exceed the limits of the cybersecurity insurance we maintain, if any, against\nsuch risks. If the information technology systems of our third party vendors and other contractors and consultants become subject to disruptions or security breaches, we may\nhave insufficient recourse against such third parties and may have to expend significant resources to mitigate the impact of such an event, and to develop and implement\nprotections to prevent future events of this nature from occurring.\nWe cannot assure you that our data protection efforts and our investment in information technology will prevent significant breakdowns, data leakages, breaches in our\nsystems, or those of our third party vendors and other contractors and consultants, or other cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect upon our reputation,\nbusiness, operations, or financial condition. For example, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, or those of our third party vendors and other\ncontractors and consultants, it could result in a material disruption of our programs and the development of our services and technologies could be delayed. Furthermore,\nsignificant disruptions of our internal information technology systems or those of our third party vendors and other contractors and consultants, or security breaches could result\nin the loss, misappropriation, and/or unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, confidential information (including trade secrets or other\nintellectual property, proprietary business information, and personal information), which could result in financial, legal, business, and reputational harm to us. Any such event\nthat leads to unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of personal information, including personal information regarding our customers or employees, could harm our reputation\ndirectly, compel us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to mandatory corrective action, and otherwise subject us\nto liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information, which could result in significant legal and financial exposure and\nreputational damages that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. For example, in November 2023, we experienced a cybersecurity incident which resulted in\nunauthorized access of certain systems within our IT environment and a third party obtaining certain of our documents. Such unauthorized access was detected and contained\nwithin several hours and it was determined the third party did not access any of our material confidential information. Following such incident, we’ve taken additional measures\nto strengthen our IT environment.\nAlthough we take measures to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access, use or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to\nattacks by hackers or viruses or breached due to personnel error, malfeasance, or other malicious or inadvertent disruptions. Any such breach or interruption could compromise\nour networks and the information stored there could be accessed by unauthorized parties, manipulated, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen.\nAny such access, breach, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under domestic or foreign privacy, data protection and data\nsecurity laws such as HIPAA and HITECH, and penalties. Notice of certain security breaches must be made to affected individuals, the Secretary of HHS, and for extensive\nbreaches, notice may need to be made to the media or state attorneys general. Such notice could harm our reputation and our ability to compete. Although we have implemented\nsecurity measures, such data is currently accessible through multiple channels, and there is no guarantee we can protect our data from breach. Unauthorized access, loss or\ndissemination could also damage our reputation or disrupt our operations, including our ability to conduct our analyses, conduct research and development activities, collect,\nprocess and prepare company financial information, and manage the administrative aspects of our business.\n74\nPenalties for violations of these laws vary. For instance, penalties for failure to comply with a requirement of HIPAA and HITECH vary significantly, and include\nsignificant civil monetary penalties and, in certain circumstances, criminal penalties with fines up to $250,000 per violation and/or imprisonment. A person who knowingly\nobtains or discloses individually identifiable health information in violation of HIPAA may face a criminal penalty of up to $50,000 and up to one-year imprisonment. The\ncriminal penalties increase if the wrongful conduct involves false pretenses or the intent to sell, transfer or use identifiable health information for commercial advantage,\npersonal gain or malicious harm.\nFurther, various states, such as California and Massachusetts, have implemented similar privacy laws and regulations, such as the California Confidentiality of Medical\nInformation Act, that impose restrictive requirements regulating the use and disclosure of health information and other personally identifiable information. These laws and\nregulations are not necessarily preempted by HIPAA, particularly if such a state law affords greater protection to individuals than HIPAA. Where state laws are more protective,\nwe have to comply with the stricter provisions. In addition to fines and penalties imposed upon violators, some of these state laws also afford private rights of action to\nindividuals who believe their personal information has been misused. California’s patient privacy laws, for example, provide for penalties of up to $250,000 and permit injured\nparties to sue for damages. Similarly, the CCPA allows consumers a private right of action when certain personal information is subject to unauthorized access and exfiltration,\ntheft or disclosure due to a business’ failure to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures. The interplay of federal and state laws may be subject to varying\ninterpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us and data we receive, use and share, potentially exposing us to additional expense,\nadverse publicity and liability. Further, as regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and laws and regulations concerning the protection of personal information\nexpand and become more complex, these potential risks to our business could intensify. Changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types\nof sensitive data, for the treatment of genetic data, along with increased customer demands for enhanced data security infrastructure, could greatly increase our cost of providing\nour products, decrease demand for our products, reduce our revenues and/or subject us to additional liabilities.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us or our customers may have an adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition or results\nof operations.\nWe are subject to income and non-income based taxes in the U.S. and various jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our business and financial condition could be adversely\naffected by changes in federal, state, local or international tax laws, changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions, changes in\naccounting principles, applicability of withholding taxes, and changes to our business operations. For example, U.S. legislation such as the Tax Act, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief,\nand Economic Security Act (CARES Act), and the American Rescue Act, made significant changes to the corporate tax rate, the potential realization of net deferred tax assets\nrelating to our operations, taxation of foreign earnings, and deductibility of expenses, and could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and certain tax assets to offset future taxable income or taxes may be subject to certain limitations.\nOur ability to use our federal and state net operating losses (NOLs) and certain other tax attributes to offset potential future taxable income and related income taxes\nthat would otherwise be due is dependent upon our generation of future taxable income, and we cannot predict with certainty when, or whether, we will generate sufficient\ntaxable income to use all of our NOLs or other tax attributes.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had significant U.S. federal and state NOLs due to prior period losses. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), federal NOLs\ngenerated in tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018 may be carried forward indefinitely, but the utilization of such federal NOLs is limited to 80% of current year\ntaxable income. States vary in conformity to all or portions of the Tax Act. The Tax Act did not have a material impact to our financial statements.\nIn addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), our ability to utilize these NOLs and other tax attributes, such as federal\ntax credits, in any taxable year may be limited if we have experienced an “ownership change”. Generally, a Section 382 ownership change occurs if one or more stockholders or\ngroups of stockholders who owns at least 5% of a corporation’s stock increases its ownership by more than 50 percentage points over its lowest ownership percentage within a\nthree-year testing period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We performed a Section 382 analysis of transactions in our stock through December 31, 2023 and\nconcluded that we have experienced ownership changes since inception that we believe under Section 382 of the Code will result in limitations on our ability to use certain pre-\nchange NOLs and credits. In addition, we may experience subsequent ownership changes as a result of future equity offerings or other changes in the ownership of our stock,\nsome of which are beyond our control. As a result, the amount of the NOLs and tax credit carryforwards presented in our financial statements could be limited and, in the case\nof NOLs generated before January 1, 2018 may expire unused. Any such material limitation or expiration of our NOLs may harm our future operating results by effectively\nincreasing our future tax obligations. Similar provisions of state tax\n75\nlaw may also apply to limit the use of accumulated state tax attributes. Regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs, or other unforeseen reasons, may cause our\nexisting tax attributes to expire, decrease in value or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm our future revenues and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather\nconditions, medical epidemics and other natural or man-made disasters or business interruptions, for which we are predominantly self-insured. Two of our corporate locations\nare located in California, an area prone to earthquakes and fires. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition\nand increase our costs and expenses. We rely on third-party manufacturers to produce our product candidates. Our ability to obtain clinical supplies of product candidates could\nbe disrupted, if the operations of these suppliers are affected by a man-made or natural disaster or other business interruption, including, for example, the COVID-19 pandemic.\n76\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nRisk Management and Strategy\nWe have established policies and processes designed to assess, identify, and manage material risk from cybersecurity threats, and have integrated these processes into\nour overall risk management systems and processes.\nWe routinely assess material risks from cybersecurity threats, including any potential unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through our information systems that\nmay result in adverse effects on the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our information systems or any information residing therein.\nWe monitor our environments to identify cybersecurity threats, as well as assess our environments in the event of a material change in our business practices that may\naffect information systems that are vulnerable to such cybersecurity threats. These risk assessments include identification of reasonably foreseeable internal and external risks,\nthe likelihood and potential damage that could result from such risks, and the sufficiency of existing policies, procedures, systems, and safeguards in place to manage such\nrisks.\nFollowing our monitoring, we adjust, implement and maintain reasonable safeguards to minimize identified risks; reasonably address any identified gaps in existing\nsafeguards; and regularly monitor the effectiveness of our safeguards. Primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our cybersecurity risks rests with our\nChief Information Officer, who reports to our Chief Financial Officer, to manage any identified risks and mitigation process. As part of our overall cyber security framework,\nwe monitor and test our safeguards and train our employees on these safeguards, in collaboration with our information technology (IT) department and management. Personnel\nat all levels and departments are made aware of our cybersecurity policies through ongoing training.\nWe engage third-party vendors in connection with our cybersecurity risk monitoring and processes. These service providers assist in our design and implementation of\nour cybersecurity policies and procedures, as well as to monitor and test our safeguards. We require each third-party service provider to certify that it has the ability to\nimplement and maintain appropriate security measures, consistent with all applicable laws, to implement and maintain reasonable security measures in connection with their\nwork with us, and to promptly report any suspected breach of its security measures that may affect our company.\nWe also maintain insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of cybersecurity risks.\nNotwithstanding any of these measures, our systems and networks remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown cybersecurity attacks and other threats, any of\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We have experienced, and will continue to experience,\ncyber incidents in the normal course of our business. As of the date of this report, we have not identified any risks from cybersecurity threats, including those from any previous\ncybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected us, our business strategy, results of operation or financial condition. However, there can be no assurances that a\ncybersecurity threat or incident that could have a material impact on us will not occur in the future. For additional information on the risks we face from cybersecurity threats,\nplease see the risk factor titled, \"If our security measures are compromised, or our information technology systems or those of our vendors, and other relevant third parties fail\nor suffer security breaches, loss or leakage of data, and other disruptions, this could result in a material disruption of our services, compromise sensitive information related to\nour business, harm our reputation, trigger our breach notification obligations, prevent us from accessing critical information, and expose us to liability or other adverse effects to\nour business.\" in Item 1A. \"Risk Factors.\"\nGovernance\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for the primary oversight of our information security programs, including relating to cybersecurity. The\nAudit Committee receives status updates on at least a semi-annual basis from our Chief Information Officer on, among other things, our cyber risks and threats, the status of\nprojects to strengthen our information security systems, assessments of our security program, and our views of the emerging threat landscape. The Chair of the Audit\nCommittee regularly reports to the Board on cybersecurity risks and other matters reviewed by the Audit Committee. In addition, all Board members have access to the materials\nfor each Audit Committee meeting.\nOur Chief Information Officer is responsible for the oversight of our cybersecurity risks. We have implemented a security incident response plan and use this incident\nresponse framework as part of the process we employ to keep the Audit Committee and our executive management informed about cybersecurity risks and to monitor the\nprevention, detection, mitigation and remediation of\n77\ncybersecurity incidents. The plan is a set of procedures and tasks that our incident response team, under the direction of the Chief Information Officer, executes with the goal of\nensuring timely identification and appropriate resolution of cybersecurity incidents. In addition, we validate compliance with our internal data security controls through the use\nof security monitoring tools.\nOur Chief Information Officer has over 25 years of IT experience and has a thorough understanding of enterprise level cyber security framework. Our Chief\nInformation Officer has also participated in cybersecurity reviews and implementations including various tools and platforms for over 10 years and drives strategic cyber\nsecurity implementations based on industry best practices that helps us strengthen our security posture on a continuous basis.\nItem 2. Properties\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Thousand Oaks, California and consists of approximately 51,160 square feet of office space under a lease agreement that\nexpires in February 2026.\nIn March 2021, we entered into a new lease agreement for approximately 33,659 square feet of office, lab and warehouse space in Thousand Oaks, California. The\ninitial 10.5-year term of this lease commenced in August 2021. We have the option to extend this lease for two additional five-year periods after the initial term.\nIn November 2023, we entered into an amended lease agreement for our office and lab space in Aurora, Colorado, to extend the term of our lease agreement through\nApril 2025.\nIn April 2022, we assigned our lease of approximately 90,580 square feet of office, lab and cellular therapy manufacturing space in Thousand Oaks, California, which\nexpires in April 2033, to FDB as part of the Fujifilm Transaction. We remain joint and severally liable for obligations related to the assigned lease.\nWe lease office space in South San Francisco, California, under a non-cancellable lease agreement through May 2025. In October 2022, we entered into a sub-lease\nagreement with a third party for this office space. The sub-lease term commenced in November 2022 and expires in May 2025, with no option to extend the sub-lease term.\nWe use our leased spaces in Thousand Oaks, California and Aurora, Colorado for our translational and preclinical sciences, analytical development and process science\nfunctions. These facilities support our product pipeline and process development and leverage our allogeneic cell therapy platform to drive innovation. We believe our existing\nfacilities are in good operating condition and suitable for the conduct of our business.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nNone.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\n78\nPART II\nItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nMarket Information\nOur common stock has been listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “ATRA” since October 16, 2014. Prior to that time, there was no public\nmarket for our common stock.\nOn March 20, 2024, there were 4 stockholders of record of our common stock. We are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record\nholders, as many of our shares are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of our stockholders.\nDividend Policy\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and\ndevelopment of our business and do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any further determination to pay dividends on our capital stock\nwill be at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to applicable laws, and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, general\nbusiness conditions and other factors that our board of directors considers relevant.\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans\nInformation about our equity compensation plans is incorporated herein by reference to Item 12 of Part III of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nItem 6. [Reserved]\nNot Applicable.\n79\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our audited consolidated financial statements\nand related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and other parts of this Annual Report contain forward-looking statements that\ninvolve risk and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the “Risk\nFactors” section of this Annual Report, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the\nfollowing discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nAtara Biotherapeutics is a leader in T-cell immunotherapy, leveraging its novel allogeneic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) T-cell platform to develop transformative therapies\nfor patients with cancer and autoimmune disease. Tab-cel (tabelecleucel), our lead program in Phase 3 clinical development in the U.S., has received marketing authorization\napproval (MAA) under the proprietary name Ebvallo™ for commercial sale in the European Union (EU) by the European Commission (EC) and for commercial sale and use in\nthe United Kingdom (UK) by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). We are the most advanced allogeneic T-cell immunotherapy company and\nintend to rapidly deliver off-the-shelf treatments to patients with high unmet medical need. Our platform leverages the unique biology of EBV T cells and has the capability to\ntreat a wide range of EBV-driven diseases or other serious diseases through incorporation of engineered chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) or T-cell receptors (TCRs). We are\napplying this one platform, that does not require TCR or human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene editing, to create a robust pipeline. Our strategic priorities are:\n•Tab-cel®: Our most advanced T-cell immunotherapy program, tab-cel, has received MAA for commercial sale in the EU and the UK under the proprietary name Ebvallo\nand is partnered with Pierre Fabre Medicament (Pierre Fabre) for commercialization in Europe and potential commercialization, if approved, worldwide, including in the\nU.S. Tab-cel is currently in Phase 3 development in the U.S. for patients with EBV- associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (EBV+ PTLD) who have\nfailed rituximab or rituximab plus chemotherapy, as well as other EBV-driven diseases; and\n•ATA3219: Allogeneic CAR T targeting CD19, currently in Phase 1 development is being developed as a potential best-in-class product intended to target B-cell\nmalignancies and autoimmune diseases, based on a next generation 1XX co-stimulatory domain and the innate advantages of EBV T cells as the foundation for an\nallogeneic CAR T platform.\nIn addition to the aforementioned strategic priorities, we also have a number of preclinical programs, including ATA3431, an allogeneic dual CAR T immunotherapy\ntargeting both CD19 and CD20 for B-cell malignancies; and a potential next generation EBV vaccine which is differentiated from earlier EBV vaccine efforts that solely\nfocused on B cell responses to EBV. We have paused development on ATA188, an allogeneic T-cell immunotherapy targeting EBV antigens believed to be important for the\npotential treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS), while we explore strategic options for this asset.\nOur T-cell immunotherapy platform is potentially applicable to a broad array of targets and diseases. Our off-the-shelf, allogeneic T-cell platform allows for rapid\ndelivery of a T-cell immunotherapy product manufactured in advance of patient need and stored in inventory, with each manufactured lot of cells providing therapy for\nnumerous potential patients. This differs from autologous treatments, in which each patient’s own cells must be extracted, genetically modified outside the body and then\ndelivered back to the patient, requiring a complex logistics network. We select the appropriate set of cells for use based on a patient’s unique immune profile. We estimate that\nonly four and six unique ATA3219 lots will be needed to cover approximately 90% of U.S. NHL and lupus patients, respectively. One of our contract manufacturing\norganizations (CMOs) has completed commercial production qualification activities for tab-cel and another of our CMOs is currently in the process of completing commercial\nproduction qualification activities for tab-cel while we manufacture inventory according to Pierre Fabre’s commercial product supply strategy.\nIn October 2021, we entered into the Commercialization Agreement with Pierre Fabre (Pierre Fabre Commercialization Agreement), pursuant to which we granted to\nPierre Fabre an exclusive, field-limited license to commercialize and distribute Ebvallo in Europe and select emerging markets in the Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe and\nCentral Asia (the Initial Territory) following regulatory approval. As contemplated by the Pierre Fabre Commercialization Agreement, we entered into (i) a Manufacturing and\nSupply Agreement (ii) a Pharmacovigilance Agreement (iii) and a Quality Agreement, in each case, with Pierre Fabre to further advance our partnership with Pierre Fabre. In\nSeptember 2022, we amended the Pierre Fabre Commercialization Agreement and received an additional $30 million milestone payment from Pierre Fabre following EC\napproval of Ebvallo for EBV+ PTLD and subsequent filing of the MAA transfer to Pierre Fabre, in exchange for, among other things, a reduction in: (i) royalties we are eligible\nto receive as a percentage of net sales of Ebvallo in the Initial Territory, and (ii) the supply price mark up on Ebvallo purchased by Pierre Fabre. Additionally, we agreed to\nextend the time period for provision of certain services to Pierre Fabre under the Pierre Fabre Commercialization Agreement. In December 2022, we entered into a Purchase and\nSale Agreement (HCRx Agreement) with HCR\n80\nMolag Fund L.P. (HCRx,) a Delaware limited partnership. Pursuant to the terms of the HCRx Agreement, we received a total investment amount of $31.0 million in exchange\nfor HCRx being entitled to receive a portion of the tiered, sales-based royalties for Ebvallo, in amounts ranging from the mid-single digits to significant double digits, as well as\ncertain milestone payments, both related to the Initial Territory and otherwise payable to us by Pierre Fabre. The total royalties and milestones payable to HCRx related to the\nInitial Territory under the HCRx Agreement are capped between 185% and 250% of the total investment amount by HCRx, dependent upon the timing of such royalty and\nmilestone payments to HCRx.\nOn October 31, 2023, we entered into an amended and restated Pierre Fabre Commercialization Agreement (A&R Commercialization Agreement), pursuant to which\nwe expanded Pierre Fabre’s exclusive rights to research, develop, manufacture, commercialize and distribute tab-cel (Ebvallo) to include all other countries in the world\n(Additional Territory) in addition to the Initial Territory (together, the Territory), subject to our performance of certain obligations as described below. In December 2023, upon\nthe effective date of the A&R Commercialization Agreement, we met the contractual right to receive an additional upfront cash payment of $20.0 million for the expanded\nexclusive license grant, for which the cash was received in January 2024. We will also be entitled to receive an aggregate of up to $620.0 million in additional milestone\npayments upon achieving certain regulatory and commercial milestones relating to tab-cel in the Additional Territory including up to $100.0 million in potential regulatory\nmilestones through approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of a biologics license application (BLA) for tab-cel. Of the $100.0 million in potential\nregulatory milestones, we expect to receive $20.0 million in April 2024 based on the positive pre-BLA meeting, an additional $20.0 million in connection with BLA acceptance,\nand up to $60.0 million in potential regulatory milestones in connection with BLA approval. We are eligible to receive significant double-digit tiered royalties as a percentage of\nnet sales of tab-cel (Ebvallo) in the Territory until the later of 12 years after the first commercial sale in each such country, the expiration of specified patent rights in each such\ncountry, or the expiration of all regulatory exclusivity for tab-cel in each such country. Royalty payments may be reduced in certain specified customary circumstances.\nRoyalties and milestones from the commercialization of Ebvallo in the Initial Territory remain subject to the HCRx Agreement.\nDuring the applicable period specified in the A&R Commercialization Agreement, we will be responsible, at Pierre Fabre’s cost, to continue conducting the ongoing\nPhase 3 ALLELE clinical study and the Phase 2 multi-cohort clinical study. We will also be responsible, at Pierre Fabre’s cost, for certain other activities directed to obtaining\nregulatory approval in the United States for tab-cel for EBV-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease pursuant to the terms of the A&R Commercialization\nAgreement. Pierre Fabre will be responsible, at its cost, for obtaining and maintaining all other required regulatory approvals and for commercialization and distribution of tab-\ncel in the Territory, including conducting any other clinical study required.\nPrior to the transfer of manufacturing responsibility to Pierre Fabre, we will be responsible for manufacturing and supplying tab-cel to Pierre Fabre for\ncommercialization in the Territory at cost plus a margin for orders placed after December 31, 2023, subject to a maximum annual increase. Pierre Fabre will assume the\nresponsibility and cost for the manufacture and supply of tab-cel in the Territory upon the Manufacturing Transition Date, which is defined as the earlier of i) the date on which\nall activities relating to the transfer of tab-cel manufacturing, pursuant to the A&R Commercialization Agreement, from Atara to Pierre Fabre have been completed to the\nreasonable satisfaction of both parties, or ii) December 31, 2025, throughout the remainder of the term of the A&R Commercialization Agreement. Pierre and we are to use\ncommercially reasonable efforts to achieve this prior to the earlier transfer date from Atara to Pierre Fabre of the first marketing authorization in the Additional Territory or the\nfirst BLA.\nWe have also entered into research collaborations with leading academic institutions such as Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) and the Council of the\nQueensland Institute of Medical Research (QIMR Berghofer) pursuant to which we acquired rights to novel and proprietary technologies and programs.\nOur research facilities in Thousand Oaks, California (ARC) and Aurora, Colorado contain our translational and preclinical sciences, analytical development and process\nscience functions. These facilities support our product pipeline, process development and leverage our allogeneic cell therapy platform to drive innovation.\nIn January 2022, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies California, Inc. (FDB) and, for certain limited purposes,\nFUJIFILM Holdings America Corporation, to sell all of the Company’s right, title and interest in and to certain assets related to the Atara T-Cell Operations and Manufacturing\nfacility (ATOM Facility) located in Thousand Oaks, California for $100 million in cash, subject to potential post-closing adjustments pursuant to the asset purchase agreement\n(the Fujifilm Transaction). The closing of the Fujifilm Transaction occurred on April 4, 2022. We also entered into a Master Services and Supply Agreement with FDB\n(Fujifilm MSA) that became effective upon the closing and could extend for up to ten years. Pursuant to the Fujifilm MSA, FDB will supply us with specified quantities of our\ncell therapy products (if approved) and product candidates, manufactured in accordance with cGMP standards. The Fujifilm MSA does not obligate us to purchase products and\nproduct candidates exclusively from FDB.\n81\nWe also work with Charles River Laboratories (CRL) pursuant to a Commercial Manufacturing Services Agreement (CRL MSA) that we entered into in December\n2019. Pursuant to the CRL MSA, CRL provides manufacturing services for our product and certain intermediates. We further amended the CRL MSA to extend the term until\nthe earlier of March 31, 2024 or upon receipt of certain batches of our product and product candidates. We are currently in negotiations with CRL for a new commercial drug\nproduct supply agreement to be effective upon the expiration of the CRL MSA. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into a new commercial drug\nproduct supply agreement with CRL on terms favorable or acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to enter into a new commercial drug product supply agreement or extend\nthe CRL MSA, we may need to identify alternative sources of drug product supply.\nWe have non-cancellable minimum commitments for products and services, subject to agreements with a term of greater than one year, with clinical research\norganizations and CMOs.\nIn November 2023, we announced a reduction in force of approximately 30% of our workforce at that time. This workforce reduction resulted in total restructuring\ncharges of $6.7 million, comprised primarily of severance payments and wages for the 60-day notice period in accordance with the California Worker Adjustment and\nRetraining Notification (WARN) Act. In most cases, the severance payments were paid as a lump sum in January 2024. All of the severance costs represent cash expenditures.\nIn January 2024, we announced another reduction in force of approximately 25% of total workforce. We expect to recognize approximately $4.5 million in total\nseverance and related benefits as a result of this reduction in force, consisting primarily of severance payments and wages for the 60-day notice period in accordance with the\nCalifornia WARN Act. In most cases, the severance will be paid in the first half of 2024. Certain of the notified employees had employment agreements which provided for\nseparation benefits in the form of salary continuation; these benefits will be paid from February 2024 through January 2025. The majority of the associated costs represent cash\nexpenditures.\nFinancial Overview\nWe have a limited operating history. Since our inception in 2012, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to identify, acquire and develop our product\ncandidates, including conducting preclinical and clinical studies, acquiring or manufacturing materials for clinical studies, and providing general and administrative support for\nthese operations.\nOur net losses were $276.1 million and $228.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, we had an\naccumulated deficit of $2.0 billion. Substantially all of our net losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from\ngeneral and administrative expenses associated with our operations. As of December 31, 2023, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $51.7 million,\nwhich we intend to use to fund our operations.\nRevenues\nWe have only just begun to generate commercialization revenues under the A&R Commercialization Agreement, following the December 2022 EC approval of Ebvallo.\nOur commercialization revenue recognized to date is derived from agreements with Pierre Fabre, primarily related to upfront license fees, milestone payments and amounts\nrecognized from the sale of zero-cost inventories for which all performance obligations are complete, and is subject to the terms of the HCRx Agreement. We do not retain any\nmeaningful milestone or royalty payments related to the Initial Territory under the A&R Commercialization Agreement until the applicable royalty cap under the HCRx\nAgreement is met, if at all, or until regulatory approval is achieved in the US or for another market within the Additional Territory. Our license and collaboration revenue\nrecognized to date is primarily derived from agreements with Bayer AG, which terminated as of July 31, 2022.\nWe expect that any revenue we generate from the A&R Commercialization Agreement, subject to the terms of the HCRx Agreement, will fluctuate from period to\nperiod as a result of the timing and number of inventory purchases by Pierre Fabre, potential milestone achievement, any potential regulatory approvals and the timing of\nmanufacturing and cell selection technology transfer to Pierre Fabre.\nCost of commercialization revenue\nCost of commercialization revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with cell selection services performed for Pierre Fabre, in-license sales-related milestone\ncosts, period manufacturing expenses and the lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments to inventories. All Ebvallo sold to Pierre Fabre to date had been produced prior to\nreceiving regulatory approval of Ebvallo. Costs incurred to produce Ebvallo prior to regulatory approval, referred to as zero cost inventories, have been recorded as\n82\nresearch and development expense in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Once we begin selling Ebvallo produced after receiving\nregulatory approval and in a qualified manufacturing facility, and as revenue is recognized on such Ebvallo shipments, cost of commercialization revenue will also include direct\nand indirect costs related to the production of Ebvallo. Such costs include, but are not limited to, CMO costs, quality testing and validation, materials used in production, and an\nallocation of compensation, benefits and overhead costs associated with employees involved with production.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe largest component of our total operating expenses since inception has been our investment in research and development activities, including the preclinical and\nclinical development of our product candidates. Research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits for research and development and\nregulatory support employees, including stock-based compensation; expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations and investigative sites that\nconduct preclinical and clinical studies; the costs of acquiring and manufacturing clinical study materials and other supplies, including expenses incurred under agreements with\nCMOs; payments under licensing and research and development agreements; other outside services and consulting costs; and facilities, information technology and overhead\nexpenses. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\nWe plan to continue investment in the development of our product candidates. Our current planned research and development activities include the following:\n•continuing to enroll patients in our Phase 3 clinical study of tab-cel for the treatment of patients with EBV+ PTLD after HCT and SOT who have failed rituximab;\n•process development, testing and manufacturing of drug supply to support clinical and IND-enabling studies;\n•continuing to develop product candidates based on our next-generation CAR T programs;\n•continuing to develop our product candidates in additional indications, including tab-cel for EBV+ cancers;\n•continuing to develop other preclinical product candidates; and\n•leveraging our relationships and experience to in-license or acquire additional product candidates or technologies.\nIn addition, we believe it is important to invest in the development of new product candidates to continue to build the value of our product candidate pipeline and our\nbusiness. We plan to continue to advance our most promising early product candidates into preclinical development with the objective of advancing these early-stage programs\nto human clinical studies over the next several years.\nOur expenditures on current and future preclinical and clinical development programs are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion. The\nduration, costs, and timing of clinical studies and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including:\n•the availability of qualified drug supply for use in our ongoing Phase 3 or other clinical studies;\n•the scope, rate of progress, and expenses of our ongoing clinical studies, potential additional clinical studies and other research and development activities;\n•the potential review or reanalysis of our clinical study results;\n•future clinical study results;\n•uncertainties in clinical study enrollment rates or discontinuation rates of patients;\n•potential additional safety monitoring or other studies requested by regulatory agencies;\n•changing medical practice patterns related to the indications we are investigating;\n•significant and changing government regulation;\n•disruptions caused by man-made or natural disasters or public health pandemics or epidemics, including, for example, the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n•the timing and receipt of any regulatory approvals, as well as potential post-market requirements.\n83\nThe process of conducting the necessary clinical research to obtain approval from the FDA and other regulators is costly and time consuming and the successful\ndevelopment of our product candidates is highly uncertain. The risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in the\nsection of this report titled “1A. Risk Factors.” As a result of these risks and uncertainties, we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the duration and completion\ncosts of our research and development projects, or if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates\nthat obtain regulatory approval.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits for legal, human resources, finance and other general and administrative\nemployees, including stock-based compensation; professional services costs, including legal, patent, human resources, audit and accounting services; other outside services and\nconsulting costs; and information technology and overhead expenses.\nGain on sale of ATOM Facility\nThe gain on sale of the ATOM Facility consists of the consideration received from FDB, less transaction costs and the carrying value of assets sold.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest expense recorded in connection with the HCRx Agreement.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate was 0% for the years ended December 31,\n2023 and 2022.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates\nOur management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been\nprepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates. We base our estimates on\nhistorical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the\ncarrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and\nconditions. Our significant judgments and estimates are detailed below, and our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of the accompanying\nconsolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue from out-license agreements is recognized as we satisfy performance obligations and when a customer obtains control of the promised goods or services, in an\namount that reflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue generated from our out-license agreements is not subject to\nrepayment and typically includes upfront fees, development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments and royalties on the licensee’s future product sales.\nOur out-license agreements may include the transfer of intellectual property rights in the form of licenses, promises to provide research and development services and\npromises to participate on certain development committees with the collaboration party. We assess whether the promises in these agreements are considered distinct\nperformance obligations that should be accounted for separately. Judgment is required to determine whether these promises are distinct.\nThe transaction price in each agreement is allocated to the identified performance obligations based on the standalone selling price (SSP) of each distinct performance\nobligation.\n84\nRevenue associated with nonrefundable upfront license fees where the license fees and other promises cannot be accounted for as separate performance obligations is\ndeferred and recognized as revenue over the expected period of performance using an appropriate recognition method based on the nature of the performance obligations. We\nutilize judgment to assess the pattern of delivery of the performance obligation. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjust the measure\nof performance and related revenue recognition. A significant change in the assumptions and estimates, such as forecasted costs or the extent and timing of patient demand, and\nexpected dates of technology transfer, could have a material impact on the timing and amount of revenue recognized in future periods or adjustments to cumulative revenue\nrecognized in the period of change.\nAt the inception of each agreement that includes development, regulatory or commercial milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered\nprobable of being reached and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price by using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue\nreversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in the agreement\nbased on relative SSP. We typically determine SSPs using a cost plus margin approach model. Milestone payments that are not within our or the licensee’s control, such as\nregulatory approvals, are typically not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. At the end of each reporting period, we re-evaluate the\nprobability of achievement of each such milestone and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjust our estimates of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are\nrecorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment.\nCertain judgments affect the application of our revenue recognition policy. For example, we record short-term and long-term deferred revenue based on our best\nestimate of when such revenue will be recognized. Short-term deferred revenue consists of amounts that are expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months, and\nlong-term deferred revenue consists of amounts that we expect will be recognized after the next 12 months. This estimate is based on forecasted patient demand, our current\noperating plan, and expected dates of technology transfer, and if these items should change in the future, we may recognize a different amount of deferred revenue over the next\n12-month period.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate and accrue expenses, the largest of which is related to research and development\nexpenses, including those related to clinical studies and clinical product candidate manufacturing. This process involves reviewing contracts and purchase orders, identifying and\nevaluating the services that have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the associated cost incurred for the services which we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise\nnotified of the actual costs incurred.\nCosts for preclinical studies, clinical studies and product candidate manufacturing activities are recognized based on an evaluation of our vendors’ progress towards\ncompletion of specific tasks, using data such as patient enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to us by our vendors regarding their actual costs incurred.\nPayments for these activities are based on the terms of individual contracts and payment timing may differ significantly from the period in which the services were performed.\nWe determine accrual estimates through reports from, and discussions with, applicable personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or state of completion of\nstudies, or the goods and services delivered. Our estimates of accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date are based on the facts and circumstances known at the time. Costs\nthat are paid in advance of performance are deferred as a prepaid asset and recognized as expense as the services are provided.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no material changes from our estimates of accrued research and development expenses. We do not believe\nthere is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates of accrued research and development expenses. However, if actual results are not\nconsistent with our estimates, we may be exposed to changes in accrued research and development expenses that could be material or the accrued research and development\nexpenses reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of accrued research and development.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe have stock-based compensation programs, which include an employee incentive plan, an inducement plan and an employee stock purchase plan. See Note 2 –\n“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 11 – “Stockholders' Equity” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8. Financial\nStatements and Supplementary Data of this report for a complete discussion of our stock-based compensation programs. We account for stock-based compensation expense,\nincluding the expense for grants of restricted stock units (RSUs) and stock options that may be settled in shares of our common stock, based on the fair values of the equity\ninstruments issued. The fair value is determined on the measurement date, which is generally the date of grant. The fair value of our RSUs is measured at the market price of our\ncommon stock on the measurement date. The fair value for our stock option awards is determined at the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model.\n85\nAssumptions for the Black-Scholes valuation model used for employee stock awards include:\n•Expected term – We derived the expected term for employee stock awards using the “simplified” method (the expected term is determined as the average of the time-to-\nvesting and the contractual life of the options), as we have limited historical information to develop expectations about future exercise patterns and post vesting\nemployment termination behavior. Expected term for non-employee awards is based on the remaining contractual term of an option on each measurement date.\n•Expected volatility – In 2021 and 2022, volatility was estimated using an average of our historical volatility and comparable public companies’ volatility for similar\nterms. Beginning in 2023, volatility is based solely on our stock price historical volatility.\n•Expected dividend rate – We have not historically declared or paid dividends to our stockholders and have no plans to pay dividends; therefore, we have assumed an\nexpected dividend yield of 0%.\n•Risk-free interest rate – The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with expected terms similar to that of the associated award.\n•The fair value of our common stock is measured at the market price on the measurement date.\nFor awards with performance-based vesting criteria, we assess the probability of the achievement of the performance conditions at the end of each reporting period and\nbegin to recognize the share-based compensation costs when it becomes probable that the performance conditions will be met. For awards that are subject to both service and\nperformance conditions, no expense is recognized until it is probable that performance conditions will be met. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will\nbe a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine stock-based compensation expense. However, if actual results are not consistent with our\nestimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes in stock-based compensation expense that could be material or the stock-based compensation expense reported in our\nfinancial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the stock-based compensation.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nSee Note 12 – “Income Taxes” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report for a\ncomplete discussion of the components of our income tax expense, as well as the temporary differences that exist as of December 31, 2023.\nOur consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business.\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions, including those that may be uncertain. We are also required to exercise judgment with respect to the realization\nof our net deferred tax assets. We evaluate all positive and negative evidence and exercise judgment regarding past and future events to determine if it is more likely than not\nthat all or some portion of the deferred tax assets may not be realized. If appropriate, a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits\nthat may not be realized.\nWe do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in our liability for uncertain income tax positions or our effective income tax\nrate. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses that could be material. We recorded a valuation allowance of\napproximately $475.0 million as of December 31, 2023 related primarily to net operating loss carryforwards, capitalized research expenses, tax credit carryforwards and stock-\nbased compensation.\nLiability related to the sale of future revenues\nTo the extent we account for the sale of future revenues as debt in accordance with ASC 470, we amortize the liability and recognize interest expense related to the sale\nof future revenues using the effective interest rate method over the estimated life of the underlying agreement. The liability and related interest expense are based on our current\nestimate of expected future payments over the life of the arrangement. We re-assess the amount and timing of expected payments each reporting period using a combination of\ninternal projections and forecasts from external resources and record interest expense on the carrying value of the liability using the imputed effective interest rate. To the extent\nour estimates of future payments are greater or less than previous estimates or the estimated timing of such payments is materially different than previous estimates, this could\nimpact the amount of interest expense we record each period as well as the amount and classification of the liability. We will account for any such changes by adjusting the\neffective interest rate on a prospective basis. The assumptions used in determining the expected repayment term of the liability and amortization period requires that we make\nestimates that could impact the effective interest rate, short-term and long-term classification of the liability and the period over which the liability will be amortized.\n86\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nRevenues\nRevenue consisted of the following in the periods presented:\nYear ended December 31,\n2023 2022 Increase (Decrease)\n(in thousands)\nCommercialization revenue $ 7,886 $ — $ 7,886\nLicense and collaboration revenues 687 63,573 (62,886)\nTotal revenue $ 8,573 $ 63,573 $ (55,000)\nCommercialization revenues were $7.9 million in 2023 as compared to none in 2022. The increase in 2023 was due to the EC marketing authorization for commercial\nsale and use of Ebvallo in the EU was transferred to Pierre Fabre in February 2023 and no commercialization revenue could be recognized prior to this occurring.\nLicense and collaboration revenues were $0.7 million in 2023 as compared to $63.6 million in 2022. The decrease in 2023 was primarily due to Bayer having notified us\nin May 2022 of its decision to terminate the Bayer Agreements, which resulted in the recognition of the remaining deferred revenue related to the Bayer Agreements in the\nsecond quarter of 2022. The only license and collaboration revenue recognized subsequent to the termination of the agreements with Bayer in the third quarter of 2022 has been\nrelated to certain early access program cost reimbursements per the A&R Commercialization Agreement.\nCost of commercialization revenue\nCost of commercialization revenue consisted of the following in the periods presented:\nYear ended December 31,\n2023 2022 Increase (Decrease)\n(in thousands)\nCost of commercialization revenue $ 8,886 $ — $ 8,886\nCosts of commercialization revenues were $8.9 million in 2023 compared to none in 2022. The increase primarily related to adjustments to reflect current period work-\nin-process inventory at net realizable value, idle capacity period manufacturing costs and in-license sales-related milestone expense. Prior to receiving EC regulatory approval\nfor Ebvallo in the EU in December 2022, we recorded all costs incurred in the manufacture of Ebvallo to be sold upon commercialization as research and development expense.\nAs a result, Ebvallo inventories manufactured before EC regulatory approval, referred to as zero cost inventories, were expensed as research and development and are therefore\nexcluded from the cost of commercialization revenue. Ebvallo manufacturing costs incurred after EC regulatory approval are capitalized into inventory. All commercialization\nrevenue recognized to date relates to zero cost inventories and all Ebvallo sold to Pierre Fabre in the year ended December 31, 2023 were zero cost inventories.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses consisted of the following costs, by program, in the periods presented:\nYear ended December 31,\n2023 2022 Increase (Decrease)\n(in thousands)\nProgram-specific expenses\nTab-cel® expenses $ 22,088 $ 40,597 $ (18,509)\nATA188 expenses 21,308 26,776 (5,468)\nCAR T and other program expenses 9,523 10,728 (1,205)\nNon program-specific expenses\nEmployee and overhead expenses 159,437 186,339 (26,902)\nOther non program-specific expenses 12,429 8,093 4,336\nTotal research and development expenses $ 224,785 $ 272,533 $ (47,748)\n87\nTab-cel expenses were $22.1 million in 2023 as compared to $40.6 million in 2022. The decrease in 2023 was primarily due to the capitalization of tab-cel\nmanufacturing costs to inventory following EC regulatory approval in December 2022 and a decrease in European tab-cel regulatory filing and approval activities.\nATA188 expenses were $21.3 million in 2023 as compared to $26.8 million in 2022. The decrease in 2023 is primarily due to lower product development and\nmanufacturing activities as a result of us pausing such activities while we awaited the results of the Phase 2 EMBOLD clinical trial primary analysis data. Following the\nannouncement in November 2023 that the study did not meet its primary endpoint and the subsequent pause in the development of ATA188, we expect ATA188 expenses to be\nlower in future periods.\nCAR T and other program expenses were $9.5 million in 2023 as compared to $10.7 million in 2022. The decrease in 2023 was primarily driven by higher\nmanufacturing, development and outside services spend in 2022 leading up to the submission of the ATA3219 IND in mid-2023, partially offset by costs related to ATA3219\nclinical trial start-up activities in the second half of 2023.\nNon program specific expenses were $171.9 million in 2023 as compared to $194.4 million in 2022. The decrease in 2023 was primarily due to lower payroll and related\ncosts, driven by the sale of the ATOM facility and August 2022 reduction in force, partially offset by increased costs associated with cross-program materials and outside\nservices. In 2023 as compared to 2022, payroll and related costs decreased by $26.1 million; outside service costs decreased by $2.3 million; facility-related costs increased by\n$1.6 million; and other non-program specific costs increased by $4.3 million.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the periods indicated were as follows:\nYear ended December 31,\n2023 2022 (Decrease) Increase\n(in thousands)\nGeneral and administrative expenses $ 50,908 $ 71,553 $ (20,645)\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $50.9 million in 2023 as compared to $71.6 million in 2022. The decrease in 2023 was primarily driven by lower payroll and\nrelated costs as a result of the August 2022 reduction in force and lower outside service costs related to a reduction in US tab-cel commercial activities.\nOther income (expense), net\nYear ended December 31,\nIncrease\n2023 2022 (Decrease)\n(in thousands)\nInterest income $ 5,426 $ 3,059 $ 2,367\nInterest expense (5,285) (373) (4,912)\nOther income (expense), net (246) (700) 454\nGain on sale of ATOM Facility — 50,237 (50,237)\nTotal other income (expense), net $ (105) $ 52,223 $ (52,328)\nInterest income was $5.4 million in 2023, as compared to $3.1 million in 2022. The increase in 2023 was primarily driven by higher investment yields, partially offset\nby lower balances of cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities.\nInterest expense was $5.3 million in 2023 as compared to $0.4 million in 2022. The higher interest expense in 2023 was due to interest expense recognized on the\nliability related to the sale of future revenues following us entering into the HCRx Agreement in December 2022.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nSince our inception in 2012, we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of common and preferred stock, issuance of pre-funded warrants to purchase\ncommon stock, upfront fees and milestone payments from the Bayer License Agreement and the A&R Commercialization Agreement and the sale of our ATOM Facility.\n88\nIn the past three years, we have entered into two separate sales agreements with Cowen and Company, LLC (Cowen): in November 2021 (2021 ATM Facility) and in\nNovember 2023 (2023 ATM Facility). Each ATM facility provides or provided for the sale, in our sole discretion, of shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering\nprice of up to $100.0 million, through Cowen, as our sales agent. We filed a registration statement on Form S-3 registering the offer and sale of these shares under the Securities\nAct (the 2023 Registration Statement). Upon the effectiveness of the 2023 Registration Statement, the 2021 ATM Facility was terminated, and no further sales can be made\nunder the 2021 ATM Facility. The issuance and sale of these shares by us pursuant to the ATM facilities are deemed “at the market” offerings defined in Rule 415 under the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act), and were registered under the Securities Act. Commissions of up to 3.0% are due on the gross sales proceeds of the\ncommon stock sold under each ATM facility.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we sold an aggregate of 3,038,432 shares of common stock under our ATM facilities, at an average price of $0.83 per\nshare, for gross proceeds of $2.5 million and net proceeds of $2.2 million, after deducting commissions and other offering expenses payable by us. Approximately $0.1 million\nof the $2.2 million net proceeds were received on January 2, 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $98.2 million of common stock remaining and available to be sold under the 2023 ATM Facility.\nFrom January 1, 2024 through March 15, 2024, we sold an additional 12,321,365 shares of common stock under the 2023 ATM Facility, at an average price of $0.77\nper share, for gross proceeds of $9.5 million and net proceeds of $9.3 million, after deducting commissions and other offering expenses payable by us. As of March 15, 2024,\nwe had $88.7 million of common stock remaining and available to be sold under the 2023 ATM Facility, subject to certain conditions as specified in the agreement.\nWe have incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations in each year since inception and have only just begun to generate commercialization revenues from\nthe A&R Commercialization Agreement, following the December 2022 EU regulatory approval of Ebvallo, which is subject to the terms of the HCRx Agreement. We do not\nmaintain any meaningful milestone or royalty payments from Pierre Fabre relative to the Initial Territory until the applicable royalty cap under the HCRx Agreement is met, if at\nall. We continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations and expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future. As a\nresult, we will need additional capital to fund our operations, which we may raise through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, other third party funding and other\ncollaborations, strategic alliances and partnering arrangements. We may borrow funds on terms that may include restrictive covenants, including covenants that restrict the\noperation of our business, liens on assets, high effective interest rates and repayment provisions that reduce cash resources and limit future access to capital markets. In addition,\nwe expect to continue to opportunistically seek access to additional funds through additional public or private equity offerings or debt financings including by utilizing the 2023\nATM Facility, through potential collaboration, partnering or other strategic arrangements, or a combination of the foregoing. To the extent that we raise additional capital by\nissuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration or partnering arrangements,\nwe may be required to relinquish some of our rights to our technologies or rights to market and sell our products in certain geographies or grant licenses or other rights on terms\nthat are not favorable to us.\nCash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in accordance with our investment policy, primarily with a view to liquidity and capital preservation. Currently,\nour cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are held in bank and custodial accounts and consist of money market funds, U.S. Treasury, and corporate debt obligations.\nOur cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balances as of the dates indicated were as follows:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 25,841 $ 92,942\nShort-term investments 25,884 149,877\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments $ 51,725 $ 242,819\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nWe lease our corporate headquarters in Thousand Oaks, California, under a non-cancellable lease agreement for approximately 51,160 square feet of office space. The\ninitial term of this lease expires in February 2026. The contractual obligations during the initial term are $8.5 million in aggregate. We have the option to extend the lease for an\nadditional period of five years after the initial term.\n89\nWe lease office space in South San Francisco, California under a non-cancellable lease agreement. In December 2021, we entered into a second amendment to extend\nthe lease term through May 2025. The amended lease agreement does not include an option to extend the lease term. In October 2022, we entered into a sub-lease agreement\nwith a third party for this office space. The sub-lease term commenced in November 2022 and expires in May 2025, with no option to extend the sub-lease term. Subsequently,\nwe have moved our corporate headquarters to our office space in Thousand Oaks, California.\nIn May 2019, we entered into a lease agreement for approximately 8,800 square feet of office and lab space in Aurora, Colorado. In February 2021, we further amended\nthis lease to add an additional 2,861 square feet of lab space. In November 2023, we entered into an amended lease agreement for our office and lab space in Aurora, Colorado,\nto extend the term of our lease agreement through April 2025. The contractual obligations during the lease term are not material.\nIn March 2021, we entered into a lease agreement for approximately 33,659 square feet of office, lab and warehouse space in Thousand Oaks, California. The initial\n10.5-year term of this lease commenced in August 2021 and the contractual obligations during the initial term are $21.0 million in aggregate. We have the option to extend this\nlease for two additional five-year periods after the initial term.\nIn February 2017, we entered into a lease agreement (ATOM Lease) for approximately 90,580 square feet of office, lab and cellular therapy manufacturing space in\nThousand Oaks, California. The initial 15-year term of this lease commenced in February 2018, and the contractual obligations during the initial term are $16.4 million in\naggregate. We have the option to extend this lease for two additional periods of ten and nine years, respectively, after the initial term. In April 2022, we assigned the ATOM\nLease to FDB in connection with the closing of the sale of the ATOM Facility to FDB. We remain joint and severally liable for obligations related to the ATOM Lease. See Note\n8 – “Leases” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report for further information on our\nlease obligations.\nWe enter into contracts in the normal course of business with clinical research organizations for clinical studies, with CMOs for clinical and commercial materials, and\nwith other vendors for preclinical studies and supplies and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination for convenience\nfollowing a notice period. We have non-cancellable minimum commitments for products and services, subject to agreements with a term of greater than one year with clinical\nresearch organizations and CMOs. See Note 10 – “Commitments and Contingencies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8. Financial\nStatements and Supplementary Data of this report for further information on our contractual obligations and commitments.\nCash Flows\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nThe following table details the primary sources and uses of cash for each of the periods set forth below:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nNet cash (used in) provided by:\nOperating activities $ (192,977) $ (270,430)\nInvesting activities 123,866 202,956\nFinancing activities 2,010 53,084\nNet decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (67,101) $ (14,390)\nOperating activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $193.0 million in 2023 as compared to $270.4 million in 2022. The decrease of $77.4 million was primarily due to the $40.0\nmillion received from Pierre Fabre in 2023 for development milestones met in December 2022, with no similar cash flows received in 2022.The remaining decrease was due to\nlower cash operating expenses in 2023 as compared to 2022, primarily due to lower compensation-related costs resulting from lower headcount driven by the sale of the ATOM\nfacility in April 2022 and the August 2022 reduction in force, partially offset by an increase in net working capital from the capitalization of costs into inventory following the\nDecember 2022 EC regulatory approval of Ebvallo.\n90\nInvesting activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities in 2023 consisted of $208.7 million received from maturities and sales of available-for-sale securities, partially offset by $83.6\nmillion used to purchase available-for-sale securities and $1.2 million in purchases of property and equipment.\nNet cash provided by investing activities in 2022 consisted primarily of $293.0 million received from maturities and sales of available-for-sale securities, partially offset\nby $180.6 million used to purchase available-for-sale securities and $4.2 million in purchases of property and equipment.\nFinancing activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities in 2023 consisted primarily of $2.1 million of net proceeds from ATM facilities and $0.9 million of net proceeds from\nemployee stock award transactions.\nNet cash provided by financing activities in 2022 consisted primarily of $21.9 million of net proceeds from ATM facilities, $30.6 million of net proceeds from the sale\nof future royalties and $1.9 million of net proceeds from employee stock award transactions.\nOperating Capital Requirements and Plan of Operations\nWe expect that existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, combined with certain anticipated payments from the A&R Commercialization Agreement,\nas well as cost reductions from completed workforce reductions and operating efficiencies resulting from our planned transition of substantially all activities relating to tab-cel\nat the time of the BLA transfer to Pierre Fabre, will enable us to fund our planned operations into 2027. Such anticipated payments are estimates based on assumptions and plans\nthat are subject to change and such changes could materially impact our expected cash runway. These assumptions include the receipt of future payments that are dependent\nupon the successful filing and approval of the tab-cel BLA, as well as the completion of specific development and regulatory activities by us and actions taken by third parties,\nand are, therefore, uncertain at this time. We do not know when, or if, we will generate sufficient revenue from commercialization to offset our operating expenses. We\nanticipate that we will continue to generate losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect the accumulated losses to increase as we continue the development of, and seek\nregulatory approvals for, our product candidates and begin to commercialize any approved products. We are subject to all of the risks inherent in the development of new\nproducts, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. We anticipate that\nwe will need to raise substantial additional funding to finance our planned operations in the long-term.\nOur operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us, and we may need additional funds sooner than planned. We do not have any\ncommitted external source of funds other than milestone and royalty payments that we may receive under the A&R Commercialization Agreement, subject to the terms of the\nHCRx Agreement. We do not retain any meaningful milestone or royalty payments related to the Initial Territory from Pierre Fabre until the applicable royalty cap under the\nHCRx Agreement is met, if at all.\nOur existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2023 will not be sufficient to fund our planned operations for at least the next 12\nmonths after the date of issuance of these financial statements. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for at least 12 months\nafter the issuance of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nIn order to complete the process of obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product candidates that have not received approval, we will require substantial\nadditional funding. We expect to continue to opportunistically seek access to additional funds through additional public or private equity offerings or debt financings, through\npotential collaboration, partnering or other strategic arrangements, or a combination of the foregoing. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding on acceptable terms, we could\nbe forced to delay, limit, reduce or terminate preclinical studies, clinical studies or other development activities for one or more of our product candidates.\nWe have based our projections of operating capital requirements on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect and we may use all of our available capital resources\nsooner than we expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products, we are\nunable to estimate the exact amount of our operating capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n•the timing, costs and results of our ongoing and planned clinical and preclinical studies for our product candidates;\n91\n•our success in establishing and maintaining manufacturing relationships with CMOs;\n•the number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue;\n•the outcome, timing and costs of seeking regulatory approvals;\n•subject to receipt of regulatory approval, costs associated with the commercialization of our product candidates by our partners and the amount of revenues received\nfrom commercial sales of our product candidates;\n•the timing of proceeds from, and our ability to perform under, the A&R Commercialization Agreement, subject to the HCRx Agreement, as well as the terms and timing\nof any future commercialization, collaboration, licensing, partnering or other arrangements that we may establish;\n•the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make in connection with the licensing, filing, prosecution, maintenance, defense and enforcement of any\npatents or patent applications or other intellectual property rights;\n•the extent to which we in-license or acquire other products and technologies; and\n•the timing of the qualification of our CMOs’ manufacturing facilities.\nUntil we are able to generate a sufficient amount of net cash inflows from operations, which we may never do, meeting our long-term capital requirements is in large\npart reliant on access to public and private equity and debt capital markets, augmented by cash generated from operations and interest income earned on the investment of our\ncash balances. We expect to continue to seek access to the equity and debt capital markets to support our development efforts and operations. To the extent that we raise\nadditional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. To the extent that we raise additional funds through commercialization,\ncollaboration or partnering arrangements, we may be required to relinquish some of our rights to our technologies or rights to market and sell our products in certain\ngeographies, grant licenses or other rights on terms that are not favorable to us, or issue equity that may be substantially dilutive to our stockholders.\nAs a result of economic conditions, general global economic uncertainty, political change and other factors, we do not know whether additional capital will be available\nwhen needed, or that, if available, we will be able to obtain additional capital on reasonable terms. If we are unable to raise additional capital due to the volatile global financial\nmarkets, general economic uncertainty or other factors, we will be forced to delay, limit, reduce or terminate preclinical studies, clinical studies or other development activities\nfor one or more of our product candidates.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nInterest Rate Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2023, we had total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $51.7\nmillion. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates, particularly because our\ninvestments are in short-term securities. Our available-for-sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase, which could result\nin a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity. We currently do not hedge our interest rate risk exposure. Due to the short-term duration of\nour investment portfolio and the low risk profile of our investments, an immediate change in interest rates of 100 basis points would not result in a material change in the fair\nmarket value of our portfolio.\nThe primary objectives of our investment activities are capital preservation and liquidity, while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our\ninvestments without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments in a variety\nof securities, including money market funds, U.S. Treasury, government agency and corporate debt obligations, commercial paper and asset-backed securities. These securities\nare all classified as available-for-sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of\naccumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Our holdings of the securities of any one issuer, except for obligations of the U.S. Treasury, U.S. Treasury-guaranteed\nsecurities or money market funds, do not exceed 5% of our portfolio.\n92\nItem 8.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial\nposition of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31,\n2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the\nCompany’s recurring losses from operations raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also\ndescribed in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our\naudits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an\naudit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the\npurpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are\nnot, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n94\nCommercialization Revenue and Deferred Revenue – Accounting for Out- License Agreement – Refer to Notes 2 and 5 to the Financial Statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company has entered into certain out-license agreements with Pierre Fabre.\nDuring 2021, the Company entered into a Commercialization Agreement with Pierre Fabre Medicament (“Pierre Fabre”). Under the terms of the agreement, the Company\ngranted Pierre Fabre a license to commercialize and distribute Ebvallo in an initial territory and became responsible for manufacturing and supplying Ebvallo to Pierre Fabre,\nalong with related cell selection services.\nIn 2022, the Company entered into an Amendment Agreement to the Pierre Fabre Commercialization Agreement (the “PF Amendment No. 1”). Under the terms of the PF\nAmendment No. 1, Atara became entitled to an additional milestone payment in exchange for, among other things, a reduction in: (i) royalties Atara is eligible to receive, and\n(ii) the price mark up on supply purchased by Pierre Fabre. Additionally, Atara also agreed to extend the time period for provision of certain services to Pierre Fabre under the\nPierre Fabre Commercialization Agreement.\nIn 2023, the Company entered into an amended and restatement Pierre Fabre Commercialization Agreement (the “A&R Commercialization Agreement”). Under the terms of\nthe A&R Commercialization Agreement, the Company granted Pierre Fabre an expanded license to commercialize and distribute Ebvallo in all other countries in the world and\nremains responsible for manufacturing and supplying Ebvallo to Pierre Fabre, along with related cell selection services until transfer of responsibility to Pierre Fabre.\nThe Company recognizes revenue on the commercialization agreements with Pierre Fabre as they satisfy their performance obligations and when a customer obtains control of\nthe promised goods or services. The revenue related to the commercialization agreements with Pierre Fabre is recognized within commercialization revenue within the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. As of December 31, 2023, the Company recognized $7.89 million of commercialization revenue and deferred\nrevenue amounted to $115.4 million, of which $77.8 million is included in current liabilities and $37.6 million is included in long-term liabilities.\nWe identified accounting for the commercialization agreements, the revenue recognized, and the estimated deferred revenue to be recognized as revenue as a critical audit\nmatter. Given the judgments necessary to determine the accounting literature to apply to a commercialization agreement, the method to estimate and measure the progress\ntoward the completion of the performance obligations and the estimated contractual term over which the performance obligations would be completed, auditing such judgments\nand estimates required extensive audit effort due to the complexity of the commercialization agreements and the high degree of auditor judgment applied when performing audit\nprocedures and evaluating the results of those procedures.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to determining the accounting literature to apply to the agreements, assessing management's method for measuring progress and evaluating\nmanagement’s estimation of the contract term over which the performance obligations will be completed included the following, among others:\n•We tested the operating effectiveness of controls over commercialization revenue, including those related to the evaluation of contract modifications, identification of\nperformance obligations and the determination of the timing and amount of revenue recognized.\n•We reviewed and obtained an understanding of the Company’s revenue generating agreements and related transactions during and at the end of the year via review of\ninternal and external presentations, news and publications, and discussions with management.\n•We evaluated the Company’s conclusions related to the accounting for contract modifications.\n•We evaluated management’s determination that the agreements are within the scope of ASC 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\n•We evaluated management's determination of the contractual term and the appropriateness of management's method to measure its progress over that term.\n95\n•We evaluated the assumptions used in the estimates of total costs and the estimated measure of progress for recognizing revenues by:\noPerforming corroborating inquiries with the Company's project and business development managers, and comparing the assumptions used in the estimates to\nmanagement's work plans, cost estimates and costs reported to date, and material rights allocated, accumulated and earned.\noComparing costs incurred for activities completed to date to the costs forecasted for those activities.\noComparing material rights accumulated and earned for activities completed to date to the fulfilment of performance obligations forecasted for those activities.\noTesting the mathematical accuracy of management’s revenue and current and long-term deferred revenue balances based on the estimated revenue to be recognized\nover time.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSan Francisco,

(Atara, we, our or the Company) was incorporated in August 2012 in Delaware. Atara is a leader in T-cell immunotherapy, leveraging its\nnovel allogeneic Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) T-cell platform to develop transformative therapies for patients with cancer and autoimmune disease.\nWe have several T-cell immunotherapies in clinical development and are progressing multiple next-generation allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR T)\nprograms. Our most advanced T-cell immunotherapy program, tab-cel® (tabelecleucel), has received marketing authorization approval under the proprietary name Ebvallo™\nby the European Commission (EC) for commercial sale and use in the European Union (EU) and by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for\ncommercial sale and use in the United Kingdom (UK). Tab-cel is currently in Phase 3 development in the US. In October 2021, we entered into a commercialization\nagreement (Pierre Fabre Commercialization Agreement) with Pierre Fabre Medicament (Pierre Fabre), as amended in September 2022, pursuant to which we granted to Pierre\nFabre an exclusive, field-limited license to commercialize and distribute Ebvallo in Europe and select emerging markets in the Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe and\nCentral Asia (the Initial Territory), following regulatory approval. In October 2023, we amended and restated the Pierre Fabre Commercialization Agreement (A&R\nCommercialization Agreement). Pursuant to the A&R Commercialization Agreement, Pierre Fabre’s exclusive rights to research, develop, manufacture, commercialize and\ndistribute Ebvallo are expanded to include all other countries in the world (Additional Territory) in addition to the Initial Territory (together, the Territory), subject to our\nperformance of certain obligations. See Note 5 for further information. In December 2022, we sold a portion of our right to receive royalties and certain milestones in Ebvallo\nunder the Pierre Fabre Commercialization Agreement to HCR Molag Fund L.P. (HCRx) for a total investment amount of $31.0 million, subject to a repayment cap between\n185% and 250% of the total investment amount by HCRx. See Note 6 for further information.\nWe have licensed rights to T-cell product candidates from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK), rights related to our next-generation CAR T programs\nfrom MSK, and rights to know-how and technology from the Council of the Queensland Institute of Medical Research (QIMR Berghofer). See Note 8 for further information.\nIn January 2022, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies California, Inc. (FDB) and, for certain limited purposes,\nFUJIFILM Holdings America Corporation, to sell all of the Company’s right, title and interest in and to certain assets related to the Atara T-Cell Operations and\nManufacturing facility (ATOM Facility) located in Thousand Oaks, California for $100 million in cash, subject to potential post-closing adjustments pursuant to the asset\npurchase agreement (the Fujifilm Transaction). The closing of the Fujifilm Transaction occurred on April 4, 2022, at which time 136 of our ATOM Facility employees\ntransitioned to FDB as part of the transaction. We also entered into a Master Services and Supply Agreement and related Statements of Work with FDB (collectively, the\nFujifilm MSA) which became effective upon the closing and could extend for up to ten years. Pursuant to the Fujifilm MSA, FDB will supply us with specified quantities of\nour cell therapy product candidates and any products approved by regulatory authorities, manufactured in accordance with cGMP standards. See Note 8 for further\ninformation.\nIn November 2023, we announced a reduction in force that reduced our workforce by approximately 30%. We recognized $6.7 million in total for severance and\nrelated benefits for employees laid off under the reduction in force. These charges are one-time termination benefits and are all cash charges. Refer to Note 9 for further\ninformation.\nCertain prior year amounts, which are not material, have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation in the consolidated statements of operations and\ncomprehensive income (loss) and the notes to consolidated financial statements.\n2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Atara and our wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated\nin consolidation.\nSegment and Geographic Information\nWe operate and manage our business as one operating and reportable segment, which is the business of developing therapeutics. Our Chief Executive Officer, who is\nour chief operating decision maker, reviews financial information on an aggregate basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance.\nSubstantially all of our assets are located in the U.S.\n101\nAll commercialization and collaboration revenue recognized in 2023 related to our agreements with Pierre Fabre, a French company. Of the $63.6 million license\nand collaboration revenue recognized in 2022, $61.8 million related to our agreements with Bayer, a German company, and $1.8 million related to our agreements with\nPierre Fabre, a French company.\nUse of Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), which\nrequires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The level of uncertainty in\nestimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Significant estimates and assumptions relied upon in preparing\nthese financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, accrued research and development expenses, stock-based compensation expense, liability related to\nthe sale of future revenues and income taxes. Additionally, we use available market information to assess the fair value of our short-term investments. Actual results could\ndiffer materially from those estimates. If actual amounts differ from estimates, we include the updates in our consolidated results of operations in the period the actual\namounts become known. Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material effect on our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nLiquidity Risk\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since inception and have relied primarily on public and private equity financings and receipts from commercialization\nand license and collaboration agreements to fund our operations. As we continue to incur losses, our transition to profitability will depend on the successful development,\napproval and commercialization of product candidates and on the achievement of sufficient revenues to support our cost structure. We may never achieve sustained\noperating cash inflows or profitability.\nGoing Concern\nWe have incurred operating losses since inception and we expect that existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2023, will not\nbe sufficient to fund our planned operations for at least 12 months after the issuance of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Although we anticipate the\nreceipt of certain payments from the amended and restated Pierre Fabre Commercialization Agreement in 2024 and 2025, such payments are contingent upon the successful\nfiling and approval of the tab-cel BLA, as well as the completion of specific development and regulatory activities by us and actions taken by third parties, and are,\ntherefore, uncertain at this time.\nTo alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, we plan to secure additional capital, potentially through a\ncombination of public or private security offerings; use of our ATM facility as described in Note 9; and/or strategic transactions. We may also need to raise additional\nfunding as required based on the status of our development programs and our projected cash flows. Although we have been successful in raising capital in the past, and\nexpect to continue to raise capital as required, there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining sufficient funding on terms acceptable to us to fund continuing\noperations, if at all, or identify and enter into any strategic transactions that will provide the capital that we will require. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding on\nacceptable terms, we could be forced to delay, limit, reduce or terminate preclinical studies, clinical studies or other development activities for one or more of our product\ncandidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Accordingly, we have concluded that substantial\ndoubt exists with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern for at least 12 months after the issuance of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The\nconsolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nConcentration of Credit Risk and Other Uncertainties\nWe place cash and cash equivalents in the custody of financial institutions that management believes are of high credit quality, the amount of which at times, may\nbe in excess of the amount insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. We also make short-term investments in money market funds; U.S. Treasury, government\nagency and corporate debt obligations; commercial paper; certificates of deposit; and asset-backed securities, which can be subject to certain credit risk. We strive to\nmitigate this credit risk by investing in high-grade instruments, limiting our exposure to any one issuer and monitoring the ongoing creditworthiness of the financial\ninstitutions and issuers.\n102\nCurrency Translation\nTransactions and monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the current exchange rate on the\ntransaction date and as of each balance sheet date, respectively, with gains or losses on foreign exchange changes recognized in interest and other income (expense), net in\nthe consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2023 were not\nmaterial.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments\nCash and cash equivalents are defined as highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase.\nInvestments with original maturities of greater than 90 days are classified as short-term investments on the balance sheet.\nAs our entire investment portfolio is considered available for use in current operations, we classify all investments as available-for-sale and as current assets, even\nthough the stated maturity may be more than one year from the current balance sheet date. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and\nlosses reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is a separate component of stockholders’ equity in the consolidated balance sheet.\nThe amortized cost of securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, which are recorded to interest income in the\nconsolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nChanges in the fair value of available-for-sale securities impact the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss only when such securities are sold, if\nan allowance for credit losses is recognized or if an impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of\neach security’s cost basis. We regularly review our investment portfolio to determine if any security is impaired, which would require us to record an allowance for credit\nlosses or impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair\nvalue of a security is less than its cost, our intent to sell or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost\nbasis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and, as necessary, the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related. This assessment could change\nin the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security. Realized gains and losses, allowances for credit losses and impairments on\navailable-for-sale securities, if any, are recorded to other income (expense), net in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nFair Value Measurement\nThe carrying amounts of certain of our financial instruments including cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable and accrued\nliabilities approximate fair value due to their short maturities. Short-term investments are comprised of available-for-sale securities, which are carried at fair value.\nFinancial Instruments\nOur financial assets are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using the following hierarchy to prioritize valuation inputs, in accordance with applicable GAAP:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access\nLevel 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves\nLevel 3: Inputs that are unobservable data points that are not corroborated by market data\nWe review the fair value hierarchy classification on a quarterly basis. Changes in the ability to observe valuation inputs may result in a reclassification of levels of\ncertain securities within the fair value hierarchy. We recognize transfers into and out of levels within the fair value hierarchy in the period in which the actual event or change\nin circumstances that caused the transfer occurs. There have been no transfers between Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 in any periods presented.\nFinancial assets and liabilities are considered Level 2 when their fair values are determined using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived\nprincipally from or corroborated by observable market data such as pricing for similar securities, recently executed transactions, cash flow models with yield curves, and\nbenchmark securities. In addition, Level 2 financial instruments are\n103\nvalued using comparisons to like-kind financial instruments and models that use readily observable market data as their basis. U.S. Treasury, government agency and\ncorporate debt obligations, commercial paper and asset-backed securities are valued primarily using market prices of comparable securities, bid/ask quotes, interest rate\nyields and prepayment spreads and are included in Level 2.\nFinancial assets and liabilities are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar\ntechniques, and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable. We have no Level 3 financial assets or liabilities.\nAccounts Receivable, net\nAccounts receivable are recorded net of estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established and which result from discounts and chargebacks that\nare offered within contracts between us and a limited number of specialty pharmacies and a specialty distributor in the United States. These reserves are classified as\nreductions of accounts receivable.\nWe estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts using the current expected credit loss model, or CECL model. Under the CECL model, the allowance for doubtful\naccounts reflects the net amount expected to be collected from the accounts receivable. We evaluate the collectability of these cash flow based on the asset’s amortized cost,\nthe risk of loss even when that risk is remote, losses over an asset’s contractual life, and other relevant information available to us. Accounts receivable balances are written\noff against the allowance when it is probable that the receivable will not be collected. Given the nature and history of our accounts receivable, we determined that an\nallowance for doubtful accounts was not required for the periods presented.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value, on a specific identification basis. We use actual costs to determine our cost basis for\ninventories. Inventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods.\nWe begin capitalizing costs as inventory when the product candidate receives regulatory approval and when the manufacturing facility producing such inventory is\nqualified by the relevant regulatory agency. Prior to regulatory approval and qualification, we record such production costs related to product candidates as research and\ndevelopment expenses. Any manufactured product that is available for commercial sale is recorded to inventory; to the extent it is later used for clinical studies, such\ninventory costs are then recorded within research and development expenses.\nWe periodically assess the recoverability of our inventory and reduce the carrying value of the inventory when items are determined to be obsolete, defective or in\nexcess of forecasted sales requirements. Inventory write-downs for excess, defective and obsolete inventory are recorded as a cost of sales.\nProperty and Equipment, net\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from three to five\nyears, except for leasehold improvements, which are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvement or the lease\nterm. Costs incurred to acquire, construct or install property and equipment during the construction stage of a capital project or costs incurred to purchase and develop\ninternal use software during the application development stage are recorded as construction in progress. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.\nLong-lived Assets\nWe evaluate the carrying amount of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may not be recoverable. An\nimpairment loss would be recognized when estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than the carrying\namount of the asset. To date, there have been no such impairment losses.\n104\nAsset Retirement Obligation (ARO)\nAn ARO is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of long-lived assets pertaining to leasehold improvements. These liabilities are initially recorded at fair\nvalue and the related asset retirement costs are capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related assets by the same amount as the liability. Asset retirement costs\nare subsequently depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets. Subsequent to initial recognition, we record period-to-period changes in the ARO liability resulting\nfrom the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows. We derecognize ARO liabilities when the\nrelated obligations are settled.\nLeases\nWe determine if a contract is or contains a lease at contract inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease assets, other current liabilities, and operating\nlease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our policy is to not recognize right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities for short-term operating leases with terms of\n12 months or less; we recognize short-term lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Long-term operating lease ROU assets and long-term\noperating lease liabilities are presented separately and operating lease liabilities payable in the next twelve months are recorded in other current liabilities. Finance lease\nROU assets are recorded in other assets and the related finance lease liabilities are presented in other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities.\nLease assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. The\nlease term includes renewal options that we are reasonably certain of exercising as of the commencement date. None of the lease terms used to calculate the future minimum\nlease payments at commencement date include renewal options. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the\ninformation available at commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. The incremental borrowing rate for our leases is determined based on\nlease term and currency in which lease payments are made, adjusted for impacts of collateral. Lease assets also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease\nincentives and initial direct costs incurred. Operating lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance lease\nassets are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the asset’s estimated useful life.\nOur facilities and equipment operating leases have lease and non-lease components and we have made a policy election to account for the lease and non-lease\ncomponents as a single lease component.\nWe are considered the sub-lessor for certain of our leases where we have entered into a sub-lease agreement with or have assigned our lease to another party. Rental\nincome was not material for any period presented and we record rental income as a reduction to rent expense within operating expenses.\nWe analyze whether or not amendments to existing leases classify as a lease modification or a full or partial termination of the existing lease. To the extent a partial\nlease termination is identified, our accounting policy is to decrease the existing right-of-use asset on a basis proportionate to the reduction in lease liability resulting from the\npartial termination.\nAccruals of Research and Development Costs\nWe record accruals for estimated research and development costs based on an evaluation of our vendors’ progress towards completion of specific tasks, using data\nsuch as patient enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to us by our vendors regarding their actual costs incurred. Payments for these activities are based\non the terms of individual contracts and payment timing may differ significantly from the period in which the services are performed. We determine accrual estimates\nthrough reports from and discussions with internal personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or state of completion of studies, or the services completed. Our\nestimates of accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date are based on the facts and circumstances known at the time. Costs that are paid in advance of performance are\ndeferred as a prepaid asset and recognized as expense as the services are provided.\nSale of Future Revenues\nTo the extent that we account for the sale of future revenues as debt in accordance with ASC 470, we amortize the liability and recognize interest expense related to\nthe sale of future revenues using the effective interest rate method over the estimated life of the underlying agreement. The liability and related interest expense are based on\nour current estimate of expected future payments over the life of the arrangement. We re-assess the amount and timing of expected payments each reporting period using a\ncombination of internal projections and forecasts from external resources and record interest expense on the carrying value of the liability using the imputed effective\ninterest rate on a prospective basis.\n105\nRevenue Recognition\nFor contracts that are determined to be within the scope of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 (Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09),\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers, and all subsequent amendments (collectively, ASC 606), revenue is recognized as we satisfy performance obligations and when a\ncustomer obtains control of the promised goods or services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to receive in\nexchange for these goods and services. To achieve this core principle, we apply the following five steps (i) identify the contract with the customer; (ii) identify the\nperformance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v)\nrecognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when we determine that collection of substantially all\nconsideration for goods and services that are transferred is probable based on the customer’s intent and ability to pay the promised consideration.\nPerformance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being\ndistinct and are distinct in the context of the contract. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised goods and services, we apply judgment to determine whether\npromised goods and services are both capable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met, the promised goods and services are\naccounted for as a combined performance obligation.\nThe transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods and services to the customer. To the\nextent the transaction price includes variable consideration, we estimate the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing either\nthe expected value method or the most likely amount method, depending on the nature of the variable consideration. Variable consideration is included in the transaction\nprice if, in our judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. Any estimates, including the effect of the\nconstraint on variable consideration, are evaluated at each reporting period for any changes. Determining the transaction price requires significant judgment, which is\ndiscussed in further detail for our out-license agreements in Note 5. Our out-license agreements do not contain a significant financing component.\nIf the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple\nperformance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis unless the transaction price\nis variable and meets the criteria to be allocated entirely to a performance obligation or to a distinct service that forms part of a single performance obligation. The\nconsideration to be received is allocated among the separate performance obligations based on relative standalone selling prices. We typically determine standalone selling\nprices using an expected cost plus margin approach model.\nWe satisfy performance obligations either over time or at a point in time. Revenue is recognized over time if either (i) the customer simultaneously receives and\nconsumes the benefits provided by our performance, (ii) our performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced or (iii)\nour performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity and we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. We evaluate\nthe measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjust the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. If we do not satisfy a performance\nobligation over time, the related performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time by transferring control of a promised good or service to a customer.\nAs discussed in further detail in Note 5, the terms of our customer contracts include potential payments to us for some or all of the following: nonrefundable, upfront\nfees; development, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments; research and development funding payments; royalties on the net sales of licensed products; and\ntransition plan cost reimbursements for certain development, safety, regulatory, and process science services. These payments relate to promised goods or services for which\nrevenue will be recognized upon our satisfaction of the underlying performance obligations.\nLicenses of intellectual property: If the license of our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in an\narrangement, we recognize revenues from consideration allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit\nfrom the license. For licenses that are combined with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether\nthe combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing\nrevenue.\nUpfront payments: Upfront payments and fees are recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt or when due and may require deferral of revenue recognition to a future\nperiod until we have satisfied our obligations under these arrangements.\n106\nMilestone payments: At the inception of each arrangement that includes development milestone payments, we evaluate the probability of reaching the milestones\nand estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur in\nthe future, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. The transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone\nselling price basis, for which we recognize revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. At the end of each subsequent reporting period,\nwe re-evaluate the probability of achievement of such development milestones and any related constraint and, if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction\nprice. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect license and collaboration revenues and the consolidated statements of\noperations and comprehensive loss in the period of adjustment.\nRoyalties: For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on levels of sales, if the license is deemed to be the predominant\nitem to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the\nroyalty has been allocated has been satisfied, or partially satisfied. To date, we have not recognized material royalty revenue resulting from our out-licensing agreements.\nTransition plan cost reimbursements: Reimbursements for certain development, safety, regulatory and manufacturing services are recorded as revenue as we\nperform the services and related obligations identified within the transition plans for our customers.\nCertain judgments affect the application of our revenue recognition policy. For example, we record short-term and long-term deferred revenue based on our best\nestimate of when such revenue will be recognized. Short-term deferred revenue consists of amounts that are expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months, and\nlong-term deferred revenue consists of amounts that we expect will be recognized after the next 12 months. This estimate is based on forecasted patient demand, our current\noperating plan and expected dates of technology transfer, and if these items should change in the future, we may recognize a different amount of deferred revenue over the\nnext 12-month period.\nCost of commercialization revenue\nCost of commercialization revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with cell selection services performed for Pierre Fabre, in-license sales-related\nmilestone costs, period manufacturing expenses and adjustments to reduce inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Costs incurred to produce Ebvallo prior to\nregulatory approval, referred to as zero cost inventories, have been recorded as research and development expense in our consolidated statement of operations and\ncomprehensive income (loss). All tab-cel (Ebvallo) sold to Pierre Fabre in the year ended December 31, 2023 was zero cost inventories. Once we begin selling Ebvallo\nproduced after receiving regulatory approval and in a qualified manufacturing facility, and as revenue is recognized on such Ebvallo sales, cost of commercialization\nrevenue will also include direct and indirect costs related to the production of Ebvallo. Such costs include, but are not limited to, CMO costs, quality testing and validation,\nmaterials used in production, and an allocation of compensation, benefits and overhead costs associated with employees involved with production.\nIn 2023 and 2022, cost of commercialization revenue included adjustments of $6.6 million and $0.0 million, respectively, to write-off of inventories and to reflect\nthem at the lower of cost or net realizable value.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense consists of costs incurred in performing research and development activities, including compensation and benefits for research\nand development employees; expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations and investigative sites that conduct clinical and preclinical studies;\nexpense incurred under agreements with contract manufacturing organizations related to acquiring and manufacturing clinical study materials and other supplies to support\nthe manufacture of our product candidates; payments under licensing and research and development agreements; other outside services and consulting costs, and facilities,\ninformation technology and overhead expenses. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nWe account for stock-based compensation expense, including the expense of restricted common stock awards, grants of restricted stock units (RSUs), and stock\noptions that may be settled in shares of our common stock, based on the fair values of the equity instruments issued. The fair value is determined on the measurement date,\nwhich is generally the date of grant. The fair value of our RSUs is measured at the closing market price of our common stock on the measurement date. The fair value for\nour stock option awards is determined at the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model.\n107\nIn determining the fair value of stock option awards granted, we use the Black-Scholes valuation model and assumptions include:\nExpected term – We derived the expected term using the “simplified” method (the expected term is determined as the average of the time-to-vesting and the\ncontractual life of the options), as we have limited historical information to develop expectations about future exercise patterns and post vesting employment termination\nbehavior.\nExpected volatility – In 2021 and 2022, volatility was estimated using an average of Atara’s historical volatility and comparable public companies’ volatility for\nsimilar terms. Beginning in 2023, volatility is based solely on Atara’s stock price historical volatility.\nExpected dividend – We have not historically declared or paid dividends to our stockholders and have no plans to pay dividends; therefore, we assumed an expected\ndividend yield of 0%.\nRisk-free interest rate – The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield on U.S. Treasury securities with the expected term of the associated award.\nFor awards with performance-based vesting criteria, we assess the probability of the achievement of the performance conditions at the end of each reporting period\nand begin to recognize the share-based compensation costs when it becomes probable that the performance conditions will be met. For awards that are subject to both\nservice and performance conditions, no expense is recognized until it is probable that performance conditions will be met. Stock-based compensation expense for awards\nwith time-based vesting criteria is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Stock-based compensation expense for awards with\nperformance and other vesting criteria is recognized as expense under an accelerated graded vesting model. We account for forfeitures of stock-based awards as they occur.\nDefined Contribution Plan\nWe have one qualified 401(k) plan covering all eligible employees. Under the plan, employees may contribute up to the statutory allowable amount for any\ncalendar year. We make matching contributions, equal to 50% of each dollar contributed up to the first 6% of an individual’s eligible earnings, up to the annual IRS\nmaximum. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 we recorded matching contributions of approximately $1.9 million and $2.3 million, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. We record deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of\ntemporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the\ndifferences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be\nrealized. Based on the available evidence, we are unable, at this time, to support the determination that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be utilized\nin the future. Accordingly, we recorded a full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. We intend to maintain valuation allowances until sufficient evidence\nexists to support their reversal.\nTax benefits related to uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained during an audit. Interest and\npenalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are included within the provision for income tax.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) is defined as a change in equity of a business enterprise during a period resulting from transactions from non-owner sources. Our other\ncomprehensive income (loss) is comprised solely of unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities and is presented net of taxes. There have not been any material\nreclassifications from other comprehensive income (loss) to net loss recorded during any period presented.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nWe consider the applicability and impact of any Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). Other than the\nASUs listed below, all other ASUs were assessed and determined to be either not applicable to Atara or are expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated financial\nstatements.\n108\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The amendment requires\ndisclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment profit or\nloss, an amount and description of its composition for other segment items, and interim disclosures of a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets. Additionally, all\ndisclosure requirements under the guidance are also required for public entities with a single reportable segment. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning\nafter December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We are currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on\nour disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires enhancements to\ncertain income tax disclosures, most notably the income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our disclosures.\nAdditionally, on March 6, 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Final Rule No. 33-11275, The Enhancement and Standardization of\nClimate-Related Disclosures for Investors. The rule requires registrants to provide climate related disclosures in their annual reports, including, but not limited to, material\nScope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions (for large accelerated filers and accelerated filers); governance and oversight of material climate-related risks; the material impact of\nclimate risks on the registrant’s strategy, business model, and outlook; risk management processes for material climate-related risks; and material climate targets and goals.\nBased on our current small reporting company and non-accelerated filer status, certain elements of the rule are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026,\nwith the remaining requirements effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. We will evaluate the SEC rule to determine its impact on our future financial\nreporting requirements and related disclosures.\n3.Net Loss per Common Share\nBasic net loss per common share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and pre-funded warrants outstanding\nduring the period, without consideration of common share equivalents. Diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number\nof shares of common stock, pre-funded warrants and common share equivalents outstanding for the period. The pre-funded warrants are included in the computation of basic\nand diluted net loss per common share as the exercise price is negligible and the pre-funded warrants are fully vested and exercisable. Common share equivalents are only\nincluded in the calculation of diluted net loss per common share when their effect is dilutive.\nPotential dilutive securities, which include unvested RSUs, unvested performance-based RSUs and performance-based options to purchase common stock for which\nestablished performance criteria have been achieved as of the end of the respective periods, vested and unvested options to purchase common stock and shares to be issued\nunder our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP), have been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share as the effect is antidilutive. Therefore, the\ndenominator used to calculate both basic and diluted net loss per common share is the same in all periods presented.\nThe following table represents the potential common shares issuable pursuant to outstanding securities as of the dates listed that were excluded from the\ncomputation of diluted net loss per common share, as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect:\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2022\nUnvested RSUs 6,261,213 6,698,858\nVested and unvested options 10,706,651 10,336,634\nESPP share purchase rights 185,843 86,782\nTotal 17,153,707 17,122,274\n109\n4.Financial Instruments\nThe following tables summarize the estimated fair value and related valuation input hierarchy of our available-for-sale securities as of each period end:\nTotal Total Total Total\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized Estimated\nAs of December 31, 2023: Input Level Cost Gain Loss Fair Value\n(in thousands)\nMoney market funds Level 1 $ 14,376 $ — $ — $ 14,376\nU.S. Treasury obligations Level 2 9,928 1 — 9,929\nCorporate debt obligations Level 2 26,089 — (205) 25,884\nTotal available-for-sale securities 50,393 1 (205) 50,189\nLess: amounts classified as cash equivalents (24,304) (1) — (24,305)\nAmounts classified as short-term investments $ 26,089 $ — $ (205) $ 25,884\nTotal Total Total Total\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized Estimated\nCost Gain Loss\nAs of December 31, 2022: Input Level Fair Value\n(in thousands)\nMoney market funds Level 1 $ 78,033 $ — $ — $ 78,033\nU.S. Treasury obligations Level 2 63,013 3 (394) 62,622\nGovernment agency obligations Level 2 8,086 — (48) 8,038\nCorporate debt obligations Level 2 82,598 4 (1,513) 81,089\nCommercial paper Level 2 996 — — 996\nAsset-backed securities Level 2 6,343 — (119) 6,224\nTotal available-for-sale securities (2,074\n239,069 7 ) 237,002\nLess: amounts classified as cash equivalents (87,122) (3) — (87,125)\nAmounts classified as short-term investments $ 151,947 $ 4 $ (2,074) $ 149,877\nThe amortized cost and fair value of our available-for-sale securities by contractual maturity were as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2023 As of December 31, 2022\nAmortized Estimated Amortized Estimated\nCost Fair Value Cost Fair Value\n(in thousands) (in thousands)\nMaturing within one year $ 50,393 $ 50,189 $ 202,323 $ 201,359\nMaturing in one to five years — — 36,746 35,643\nTotal available-for-sale securities $ 50,393 $ 50,189 $ 239,069 $ 237,002\nWe considered the current and expected future global economic and market conditions, including, but not limited to, the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East and\nincreased tensions between the U.S. and China, and determined that our investments have not been significantly impacted. As of December 31, 2023, no significant facts or\ncircumstances were present to indicate a deterioration in the creditworthiness of the issuers of the available-for-sale securities we hold, and we have no requirement or\nintention to sell these securities before maturity or recovery of their amortized cost basis. For all securities with a fair value less than its amortized cost basis, we determined\nthe decline in fair value below amortized cost basis to be non-credit related and no allowance for losses has been recorded. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022, we did not recognize any impairment losses on our investments.\nWe have elected the practical expedient to exclude the applicable accrued interest from both the fair value and the amortized cost basis of our available-for-sale\nsecurities for purposes of identifying and measuring an impairment. We present accrued interest receivable related to our available-for-sale securities in other current assets,\nseparate from short-term investments, on our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, accrued interest receivable was $0.3 million and $0.8 million,\nrespectively. Our accounting policy is to not measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivables and to write-off any uncollectible accrued interest\nreceivable as a reversal of interest income in a timely manner, which we consider to be in the period in which we determine the accrued interest will not be collected by us. We\nhave not written off any accrued interest receivables for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n110\nIn addition, restricted cash collateralized by money market funds is a financial asset measured at fair value and is a Level 1 financial instrument under the fair value\nhierarchy.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash within the consolidated balance sheets that sum to the total of the same\nsuch amounts in the consolidated statement of cash flows:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 25,841 $ 92,942\nRestricted cash – short-term 146 146\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 25,987 $ 93,088\n5.Out-license Agreements\nPierre Fabre Commercialization Agreement\nIn October 2021, we entered into the Pierre Fabre Commercialization Agreement, pursuant to which, we granted to Pierre Fabre an exclusive, field-limited license to\ncommercialize and distribute Ebvallo in Europe and select emerging markets in the Initial Territory following regulatory approval. In September 2022, we entered into\nAmendment No. 1 to the Pierre Fabre Commercialization Agreement (the PF Amendment). Under the terms of the PF Amendment, following European Commission approval\nof Ebvallo for EBV+ PTLD and subsequent filing of the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) transfer to Pierre Fabre, we are entitled to receive an additional $30\nmillion milestone payment in exchange for, among other things, a reduction in: (i) royalties we are eligible to receive as a percentage of net sales of Ebvallo in the Territory,\nand (ii) the supply price mark up on Ebvallo purchased by Pierre Fabre. Additionally, we agreed to extend the time period for provision of certain services to Pierre Fabre in\nthe Initial Territory at our cost pursuant to the Pierre Fabre Commercialization Agreement. In December 2022, we sold a portion of our right to receive royalties and certain\nmilestone payments related to Ebvallo in the Initial Territory under the Pierre Fabre Commercialization Agreement to HCRx for a total investment amount of $31.0 million,\nsubject to a repayment cap between 185% and 250% of the total investment amount by HCRx. See Note 6 for further information related to the agreement with HCRx.\nIn October 2023, we entered into the A&R Commercialization Agreement with Pierre Fabre. Pursuant to the A&R Commercialization Agreement, Pierre Fabre’s\nexclusive rights to research, develop, manufacture, commercialize and distribute tab-cel are expanded to include all other countries in the world (Additional Territory) in\naddition to the Initial Territory (together, the Territory), subject to our performance of certain obligations as described below.\nPierre Fabre paid us an upfront cash payment of $45.0 million for the exclusive license grant for the Initial Territory in the fourth quarter of 2021. In December 2022,\nwe met the contractual right to receive $40.0 million in milestone payments upon certain regulatory milestones, for which the cash was received in January 2023. Subject to\nthe terms of the royalty purchase agreement with HCRx, as described in Note 6, we are entitled to receive an aggregate of up to $308.0 million in remaining milestone\npayments upon achieving certain regulatory and commercial milestones in addition to double-digit tiered royalties as a percentage of net sales of Ebvallo in the Initial\nTerritory, until the later of 12 years after the first commercial sale in each such country, the expiration of specified patent rights, or the expiration of all regulatory exclusivity\nfor Ebvallo on a country-by-country basis. In December 2023, upon the effective date of the A&R Commercialization Agreement, we met the contractual right to receive an\nadditional upfront cash payment of $20.0 million for the expanded exclusive license grant in the Additional Territory, for which the cash was received in January 2024. We\nwill also be entitled to receive an aggregate of up to $620.0 million in additional payments upon achieving certain regulatory and commercial milestones relating to tab-cel in\nthe Additional Territory. We will be eligible to receive significant double-digit tiered royalties as a percentage of net sales of tab-cel in the Additional Territory until the later\nof 12 years after the first commercial sale in each such country, the expiration of specified patent rights in each such country, or the expiration of all regulatory exclusivity for\ntab-cel on a country-by-country basis.\nWe have entered into a separate manufacturing and supply agreement with Pierre Fabre for us to manufacture Ebvallo for Pierre Fabre to use in the Initial Territory\nbased on a fixed price through December 31, 2023 and at a price equal to cost plus a margin for orders placed after December 31, 2023, subject to a maximum annual\nincrease. Pierre Fabre will assume the responsibility and cost for the manufacture and supply of tab-cel (Ebvallo) in the Territory upon the Manufacturing Transition Date,\nwhich is defined as the earlier of: i) all activities relating to the transfer of tab-cel manufacturing, pursuant to the A&R Commercialization Agreement, from Atara to Pierre\nFabre have been completed to the reasonable satisfaction of both parties, or ii) December 31, 2025, through the remainder of the term of the A&R Commercialization\nAgreement. Pierre and we are to use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve this prior to the earlier transfer date from Atara to Pierre Fabre of the first marketing\nauthorization in the Additional Territory or the\n111\nfirst BLA (PF Transfer Date). Prior to the Manufacturing Transition Date, we are responsible for manufacturing and supplying tab-cel (Ebvallo) to Pierre Fabre in the\nTerritory. Without transfer of the manufacturing technology, no other party can manufacture Ebvallo.\nCell selection is the process of identifying the appropriate cell line from available tab-cel inventory to be used for a patient. We are responsible for the performance of\ncell selection services in the Initial Territory at our cost through the earlier of the PF Transfer Date, June 30, 2025 or a date otherwise agreed to by Pierre Fabre and us. To the\nextent that the transfer of cell selection technology occurs subsequent to June 30, 2025, we will be responsible for the performance of cell selection services in the Initial\nTerritory at Pierre Fabre’s cost until cell selection technology is transferred to Pierre Fabre. Without transfer of the cell selection technology, no other party can provide such\nservices. We are responsible for the performance of cell selection services in the Additional Territory through the earlier of the PF Transfer Date or a date otherwise agreed to\nby Pierre Fabre and us, at the sole expense of Pierre Fabre.\nAs part of the Pierre Fabre Commercialization Agreement, we formed a joint steering committee (JSC) with Pierre Fabre that provides oversight, decision making and\nimplementation guidance regarding the commercialization activities, the responsibilities of which has been expanded to cover the incremental scope of the A&R\nCommercialization Agreement.\nDuring the applicable period specified in the A&R Commercialization Agreement, we will be responsible for various development, safety, process science, and\nregulatory activities, including obtaining regulatory approval in the United States for tab-cel for EBV-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease. Pierre Fabre will\npay us for these services in accordance with the A&R Commercialization Agreement. Pierre Fabre will be responsible, at its cost, for obtaining and maintaining all other\nrequired regulatory approvals and for commercialization and distribution of tab-cel in the Additional Territory, including conducting any other clinical study required. We will\nown any intellectual property rights developed solely by us under the Agreement.\nAccounting Analysis\nIdentification of the Contract\nWe assessed this arrangement in accordance with ASC 606 and concluded that the promises in the A&R Commercialization Agreement represent transactions with a\ncustomer.\nIdentification of the Promises and Performance Obligations\nWe identified four performance obligations under the A&R Commercialization Agreement, consisting of the following material promises:\n(1)the transfer of intellectual property rights in the form of a license in the Initial Territory, the obligation to participate in the JSC, a material right for purchases\nassociated with the manufacture and supply of Ebvallo and the performance of cell-selection services. We concluded that the individual promises are not distinct\nbecause Pierre Fabre cannot benefit from the license without the other services and vice versa, since Pierre Fabre is not capable of carrying out the manufacturing and\nsupply and cell selection services on their own, until the transfer of the related technologies occur. Consequently, these promises represent a single performance\nobligation, collectively referred to as the Initial Territory Obligation.\n(2)the transfer of intellectual property rights in the form of a license in the Additional Territory, the manufacture and supply of tab-cel and the performance of cell-\nselection services, as well as the promises to transfer the related technologies, and perform certain development, safety and regulatory services. We concluded that the\npromises are not distinct because Pierre Fabre cannot benefit from the license without the other services and vice versa. Consequently, these promises represent a single\nperformance obligation, collectively referred to as the Additional Territory Obligation.\n(3)performance of certain process science services, referred to as the Process Sciences Obligation\n(4)the sale of certain intermediate inventory used in the production of tab-cel in existence on the Manufacturing Transition Date, referred to as the Intermediate\nInventory Obligation.\nDetermination of the Transaction Price\nUnder the Pierre Fabre Commercialization Agreement, we determined that the $45.0 million upfront payment constituted the entire consideration to be included in the\ntransaction price at the outset of the arrangement, and the $40.0 million in development milestones achieved in December 2022 were added to the transaction price upon\nmeeting the related milestone criteria. The remaining potential development and commercial milestone payments that we are eligible to receive were excluded from the\ntransaction price, as the milestone amounts were fully constrained based on the probability of achievement or have not been earned. None of the future royalty and sales-based\nmilestone payments were included in the transaction price, as the potential payments represent sales-based\n112\nconsideration. We will reevaluate the transaction price at the end of each reporting period and as uncertain events are resolved or other changes in circumstances occur, and, as\nnecessary, we will adjust our estimate of the transaction price.\nUpon the effective date of the A&R Commercialization Agreement, the $20.0 million additional upfront payment received and estimated revenue for the development,\nsafety, regulatory and process science services were added to the transaction price. The remaining potential development and commercial milestone payments that we are\neligible to receive were excluded from the transaction price, as the milestone amounts were fully constrained based on the probability of achievement or have not been earned.\nNone of the future royalty and sales-based milestone payments were included in the transaction price, as the potential payments represent sales-based consideration. Any\nconsideration associated with the Intermediate Inventory Obligation was excluded from the transaction price as the amount was fully constrained based on uncertainty\nsurrounding available inventory on the Manufacturing Transition Date.\nWe will reevaluate the transaction price at the end of each reporting period and as uncertain events are resolved or other changes in circumstances occur, and, as\nnecessary, we will adjust our estimate of the transaction price.\nAllocation of the Transaction Price to Performance Obligations\nThe transaction price was allocated to each performance obligation based on their relative standalone selling price. We developed the estimated standalone selling\nprice for each of the A&R Commercialization Agreement performance obligations with the objective of determining the price at which we would sell such an item if it were to\nbe sold regularly on a standalone basis.\nRecognition of Revenue\nCommercialization revenue associated with the Initial Territory Obligation will be recognized over the period during which the material right exists, which would end\nupon the Manufacturing Transition Date. Based on these considerations and our forecast of the timing and associated costs of the purchases related to the manufacture and\nsupply of Ebvallo and estimated timing of technology transfer, we estimate the material right in the Initial Territory will exist for approximately one to two years. We reassess\nthis evaluation each reporting period. Commercialization revenue associated with sales of Ebvallo to Pierre Fabre under the Initial Territory Obligation is deferred until we\nhave performed the associated cell selection services, or once cell selection technology transfer to Pierre Fabre has been complete. At that point, Pierre Fabre would be able to\nutilize the Ebvallo it had purchased from us on its own.\nCommercialization revenue associated with the Additional Territory Obligation and the Process Sciences Obligation will be recognized using a cost-based input\nmethod based on the amount of actual costs incurred relative to the total budgeted costs expected to be incurred for the respective performance obligations. A cost-based input\nmethod of revenue recognition requires us to make estimates of costs to complete our performance obligation. In making such estimates, significant judgment is required to\nevaluate assumptions related to cost estimates. The cumulative effect of revisions to estimated costs to complete our performance obligation will be recorded in the period in\nwhich changes are identified and amounts can be reasonably estimated. We expect to recognize revenue associated with the Additional Territory Obligation and the Process\nSciences Obligation over a period of approximately two years. We reassess this evaluation each reporting period. The transfer of control occurs over the respective time period\nand, in our judgment, is the best measure of progress towards satisfying the performance obligation. A significant change in these assumptions and estimates could have a\nmaterial impact on the timing and amount of revenue recognized in future periods. We expect to recognize revenue associated with the Intermediate Inventory Obligation at a\npoint in time on the Manufacturing Transition Date, which is when title and risk of loss, and thus, control, of the intermediate inventory transfers to Pierre Fabre.\nDeferred revenue activity related to commercialization revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 was as follows:\nTotal\n(in thousands)\nDeferred revenue, December 31, 2022 85,000\n$\nAdditions 38,170\nRecognized into commercialization revenue (7,775 )\nDeferred revenue December 31, 2023 115,395\nLess: deferred revenue – current portion (77,833 )\nDeferred revenue – long-term, December 31, 2023 $ 37,562\n113\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized $5.0 million of revenue that was included in the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022.\nCosts incurred relating to performing the services within the Additional Territory Obligation and Process Sciences Obligation consist of third party expenses and for\ntime incurred by our employees to satisfy requirements set forth by the A&R Commercialization Agreement. These costs are included in research and development expenses\nin the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) during the year ended December 31, 2023. Such costs were not material for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\nUnder the A&R Commercialization Agreement, we conduct an early access program observational study at the sole cost and expense of Pierre Fabre. We recognize the\ncosts incurred associated with this study within research and development expenses, which is directly offset by revenue recorded within license and collaboration revenue. The\nlicense and collaboration revenue associated with the early access program for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $0.7 million, as compared to $1.8 million for the year\nDecember 31, 2022.\nBayer Agreements\nIn December 2020, we entered into a research, development and license agreement (Bayer License Agreement) with Bayer AG (Bayer) pursuant to which we granted\nto Bayer an exclusive, field-limited license under the applicable patents and know-how owned or controlled by us and our affiliates covering or related to ATA2271 and\nATA3271 (the Licensed Products).\nUnder the terms of the Bayer License Agreement, we were responsible at our cost for all mutually agreed preclinical and clinical activities for ATA2271 through the\nfirst in human Phase 1 clinical study in collaboration with MSK, following which Bayer was responsible for the further development of ATA2271 at its cost. Bayer was\nresponsible for the development of ATA3271, except for certain mutually agreed preclinical, translational, manufacturing and supply chain activities to be performed by us\nrelating to ATA3271, in each case at Bayer’s cost. Bayer was also solely responsible for commercializing the Licensed Products at its cost.\nIn March 2021, we entered into a Technology Transfer Agreement with Bayer (the Bayer Tech Transfer Agreement), which was contemplated as part of the Bayer\nLicense Agreement, to transfer to Bayer the ATA3271 manufacturing process being developed as part of the CMC services in the Bayer License Agreement.\nIn March 2021, we also entered into a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Bayer (the Bayer Manufacturing Agreement), which was contemplated as part of the\nBayer License Agreement, to manufacture Phase 1 and 2 allogeneic mesothelin-directed CAR T-cell therapies for Bayer to use in clinical trials at a price based on our costs\nplus a reasonable margin, which is consistent with our standalone selling price. Collectively, the Bayer License Agreement, the Manufacturing and Supply Agreement and the\nTechnology Transfer Agreement are referred to as “the Bayer Agreements”.\nIn May 2022, Bayer notified us of its decision to terminate the Bayer Agreements, and on August 2, 2022, we entered into the Termination, Amendment and Program\nTransfer Agreement with which terminated the Bayer Agreements (the Bayer Termination Agreement) with an effective date of July 31, 2022. Upon the termination effective\ndate, full product development and commercialization rights related to ATA2271 and ATA3271 reverted to Atara. In return for certain activities performed by Atara prior to\nthe termination effective date, Bayer paid Atara $4.2 million in September 2022. Utilizing the cost-based input method, we recognized license and collaboration revenue of\n$61.8 million for 2022. As a result of the termination, no license and collaboration revenue related to the Bayer Agreements was recognized for the year ended December 31,\n2023, and there was no deferred revenue related to the Bayer Agreements as of December 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022.\n6.Liability Related to the Sale of Future Revenues\nIn December 2022, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the HCRx Agreement) with HCR Molag Fund, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, (HCRx). In\nexchange for a payment of $31.0 million (the Investment Amount) to Atara, net of certain transaction expenses, HCRx obtained the right to receive certain Ebvallo royalties\nand milestone payments payable by Pierre Fabre under the Pierre Fabre Commercialization Agreement up to an agreed upon multiple of the Investment Amount.\nUnder the HCRx Agreement, HCRx is entitled to receive tiered royalties on net sales of Ebvallo in the Initial Territory in amounts ranging from the mid-single digits to\ndouble digits based on annual net sales. HCRx is also entitled to certain milestone payments due to Atara from Pierre Fabre. The total royalties and milestones payable to\nHCRx are capped between 185% and 250% of the Investment Amount, depending upon the timing of such royalties and milestones. Upon meeting the cap amount, HCRx’s\nright to receive royalties and milestone payments will terminate and all rights will revert to Atara. To the extent a certain milestone within the\n114\nPierre Fabre Commercialization Agreement is not achieved on or prior to June 30, 2026, we will be required to make a one-time cash payment in the amount of $9.0 million to\nHCRx, and HCRx shall transfer all of its right, title and interest in this certain $9.0 million milestone payment to Atara. This payment, if required, would be included in the\ncalculation of aggregate payments made to HCRx.\nThe gross proceeds of the Investment Amount of $31.0 million were recorded as a liability related to the sale of future revenues, net of transaction costs of $0.4\nmillion, and is be amortized using the effective interest method over the life of the arrangement.\nTo determine the amortization of the recorded liability, we are required to estimate the total amount of future payments to be received by HCRx. The sum of these\namounts less the $31.0 million proceeds we received will be recorded as interest expense over the life of the HCRx Agreement. We will estimate the effective interest rate\nused to record non-cash interest expense under the HCRx Agreement based on the estimate of future royalty payments to be received by HCRx. As of December 31, 2023, the\nannual effective interest rate was approximately 12%. Over the life of the arrangement, the actual effective interest rate will be affected by the amount and timing of the actual\nand forecasted royalty and milestone payments to HCRx. At each reporting date, we reassess our estimate of the timing and amounts of future payments made to HCRx, and\nprospectively adjust the effective interest rate and amortization of the liability as necessary.\nThe following table presents the changes in the liability related to the sale of future revenues under the HCRx Agreement for the year ended December 31, 2023:\n(in thousands)\nLiability related to sale of future revenues as of December 31, 2022 $ 30,236\nAccretion of interest expense on liability related to sale of future revenues 4,792\nAmortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs 79\nRepayment of the liability (31)\nLiability related to sale of future revenues as of December 31, 2023 35,076\nLess: current portion classified within other accrued liabilities (453)\nLong-term liability related to sale of future revenues $ 34,623\n7.Sale of ATOM Facility\nOn April 4, 2022, we completed the sale of the ATOM Facility to FDB for net proceeds of $94.8 million, after deducting transaction costs of $4.6 million and other\nadjustments to the purchase price. The sale resulted in a gain of $50.2 million included within other income (expense), net for the year end December 31, 2022. As disclosed\nin Note 8, although we have assigned the lease for the ATOM Facility to FDB, we have not received novation from the landlord. Therefore, the lease-related assets and\nliabilities for the ATOM Facility remain on our balance sheet. Refer to the summary of assets sold and gain on sale of the ATOM Facility:\n(in thousands)\nNet proceeds from sale of ATOM Facility $ 94,765\nAssets sold:\nOther current assets $ 190\nProperty and equipment, net 44,299\nOther assets 39\nLess: Assets sold 44,528\nGain on sale of ATOM Facility $ 50,237\nIn connection with the sale, we entered into a Transition Services Agreement (TSA) with FDB, pursuant to which we assisted FDB in the transition of certain\nfunctions, including, but not limited to, information technology, finance and technical operations. FDB reimbursed us at cost for all third party expenses incurred in\nconjunction with the TSA and for time incurred by our employees to satisfy requirements set forth by the TSA. The reimbursements are recorded as reductions to the related\nOperating expenses and the amounts associated with reimbursements for employee time incurred were not material for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The\nTSA was terminated in March 2023.\n8.Leases\nWe lease office space for our corporate headquarters in Thousand Oaks, California. In November 2018, we entered into a lease agreement for this office space that\nexpires in February 2026 and for which we have the option to extend the lease for an additional period of five years after the initial term.\n115\nIn March 2021, we entered into a new lease agreement for approximately 33,659 square feet of office, lab and warehouse space in Thousand Oaks, California. During\nthe third quarter of 2021, the initial 10.5-year lease term commenced, upon substantial completion of the landlord’s work as defined under the agreement. Base rent is subject\nto annual increases of 3% with each annual anniversary of the rent commencement date. We have the option to extend this lease for two additional five-year periods after the\ninitial term. Additionally, in 2021, we entered into an amended lease agreement for our office and lab space in Aurora, Colorado, to add additional lab space.\nIn November 2023, we entered into an amended lease agreement for our office and lab space in Aurora, Colorado, to extend the term of the lease agreement to April\n2025.\nIn February 2017, we entered into a lease agreement (the ATOM Lease) for approximately 90,580 square feet of office, lab and cellular therapy manufacturing space in\nThousand Oaks, California. The initial 15-year term of the headlease commenced on February 15, 2018, upon the substantial completion of landlord’s work as defined under\nthe agreement. In April 2022, we assigned the ATOM Lease to FDB in connection with the closing of the sale of the ATOM Facility to FDB. Under ASC 842, we are\nconsidered to be the sub-lessor of the ATOM Lease. We have not received novation from the landlord and therefore have not been relieved of our primary obligations under\nthe headlease. Therefore, the ROU asset and lease liability for the ATOM Facility remain on our balance sheet.\nWe evaluated our vendor contracts to identify embedded leases and determined that the Fujifilm MSA contained items that constituted a lease under ASC 842, Leases,\nas Atara has the right to substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset and can direct the use of the asset. We concluded that the Fujifilm MSA contains\nan embedded operating lease for certain dedicated processing rooms for the manufacturing of Atara product and an embedded finance lease for certain freezers dedicated for\nour use. The Fujifilm MSA includes contractual obligations in the form of payments for the processing rooms and the freezers, each over a term of five years. As a result, we\nadded ROU assets and lease liabilities for the processing rooms and freezers for the initial term of the lease in the amounts of $50.8 million and $4.8 million, respectively. In\nNovember 2023, we agreed to forego the use of one processing room for approximately one year in return for a reduction in contractual obligations under the Fujifilm MSA.\nWe have the option to subsequently reclaim the processing room or release it to FDB for the remainder of the initial term.\nWe lease office space in South San Francisco, California under a non-cancellable lease agreement. In December 2021, we entered into a second amendment with the\nlandlord to extend the lease term through May 2025. The amended lease agreement does not include an option to extend the lease term. In connection with the amended lease,\nwe are required to maintain a letter of credit in the amount of $0.1 million to the landlord. In October 2022, we entered into a sub-lease agreement with a third party for this\noffice space. The sub-lease term commenced in November 2022 and expires in May 2025, with no option to extend the sub-lease term. We have not received novation from\nthe landlord and therefore have not been relieved of our primary obligations under the headlease. Therefore, the ROU asset and lease liability for the South San Francisco\noffice remain on our balance sheet.\nThe maturities of lease liabilities under our operating and finance leases as of December 31, 2023 were as follows:\nOperating Leases Finance Leases\nYears Ending December 31, (in thousands)\n2024 $ 17,209 $ 1,219\n2025 18,486 1,263\n2026 17,271 1,285\n2027 5,760 436\n2028 3,319 —\nThereafter 12,459 —\nTotal lease payments $ 74,504 $ 4,203\nLess: amount representing interest (17,547) (673)\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 56,957 $ 3,530\nBalance as of December 31, 2023\nOther current liabilities $ 11,264 $ 915\nOperating lease liabilities – long-term 45,693 —\nOther long-term liabilities — 2,615\nTotal $ 56,957 $ 3,530\n116\nThe components of lease cost were as follows:\nYear Ended Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\n(in thousands)\nOperating lease cost:\nOperating lease cost $ 17,192 $ 14,245\nShort-term lease cost 201 386\nTotal operating lease cost $ 17,393 $ 14,631\nFinance lease cost:\nAmortization expense $ 976 $ 872\nInterest on lease liabilities 416 373\nTotal finance lease cost $ 1,392 $ 1,245\nOther information related to leases was as follows:\nYear Ended Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\n(in thousands, except lease term and discount rate)\nSupplemental Cash Flows Information\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of\nlease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows for operating leases $ 16,660 $ 13,417\nOperating cash flows for finance leases 416 335\nFinancing cash flows for finance leases 947 518\nOperating lease assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations: $ 312 $ 50,779\nFinance lease assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations: — 4,795\nNon-cash (decrease) increase to operating lease assets due to remeasurement of lease\nliabilities: (1,589) —\nWeighted Average Remaining Lease Term\nOperating leases 5.2 years 5.9 years\nFinance leases 3.3 years 4.2 years\nWeighted Average Discount Rate\nOperating leases 11.4% 9.9%\nFinance leases 10.4% 10.4%\nAsset Retirement Obligation\nOur asset retirement obligation (ARO) consists of a contractual requirement to remove the tenant improvements at the ATOM Facility in Thousand Oaks, California\nand restore the facility to a condition specified in the lease agreement. Although we assigned the ATOM Lease to FDB in connection with the closing of the sale of the ATOM\nFacility to FDB in April 2022, we have not received novation from the landlord. Therefore, the ARO associated with the ATOM Facility remains on our balance sheet. We\nrecorded an estimate of the fair value of our ARO liability in other long-term liabilities and the ARO asset as a long-term asset in the period incurred. The fair value of the\nARO asset is amortized over the lease term. The fair value of our ARO was estimated by discounting projected cash flows over the estimated life of the related assets using\nour credit adjusted risk-free rate. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the ARO asset and liability were not material.\n117\n9.Restructuring\nOn August 8, 2022 we announced a strategic reduction in workforce of approximately 20% to focus our activities as an organization centered on research and\ndevelopment. The workforce reduction included total restructuring charges of $6.0 million, comprised primarily of severance payments, wages for the 60-day notice period in\naccordance with the California Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act and continuing health care coverage for a period of time after separation. In\nmost cases, the severance payments were paid as a lump sum in October 2022. Certain of the notified employees had employment agreements which provided for separation\nbenefits in the form of salary continuation; these benefits were paid between October 2022 and November 2023, and there are no further payments required for this reduction\nin workforce as of December 31, 2023. All of the costs were cash expenditures and represented one-time termination benefits.\nOn November 1, 2023 we announced a strategic reduction in workforce of approximately 30%. The workforce reduction resulted in total restructuring charges of $6.7\nmillion, comprised primarily of severance payments and wages for the 60-day notice period in accordance with the California WARN Act. In most cases, the severance\npayments were paid as a lump sum in January 2024. All of the costs are cash expenditures and represent one-time termination benefits.\nThe following is a summary of restructuring charges associated with the reductions in force for the periods presented:\nYear Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nResearch and development expense $ 5,619 $ 2,544\nGeneral and administrative expense 1,111 3,420\nTotal restructuring charges $ 6,730 $ 5,964\nThe following restructuring liability activity was recorded in connection with the reduction in force for the year ended December 31, 2023, with all of the $4.9\nmillion liability balance as of December 31, 2023 included within other current liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet:\nYear ended December 31, Year ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nLiability balance, January 1 $ 1,545 $ —\nRestructuring charges 6,730 5,964\nCash payments (3,352) (4,419)\nLiability balance, December 31 $ 4,923 $ 1,545\n10.Commitments and Contingencies\nMSK Agreements\nIn June 2015, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with MSK for three clinical stage T-cell therapies. We are required to make payments to MSK based on\nachievement of specified regulatory and sales-related milestones, as well as mid-single-digit percentage tiered royalty payments based on future sales of products resulting\nfrom the development of the licensed product candidates, if any. In addition, under certain circumstances, we are required to make certain minimum annual royalty payments\nto MSK, which are creditable against earned royalties owed for the same annual period. We are also required to pay a low double-digit percentage of any consideration we\nreceive for sublicensing the licensed rights. The license agreement expires on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis on the latest of: (i) expiration of the last\nlicensed patent rights related to each licensed product, (ii) expiration of any market exclusivity period granted by law with respect to each licensed product, and (iii) a\nspecified number of years after the first commercial sale of the licensed product in each country. Upon expiration of the license agreement, we will retain non-exclusive rights\nto the licensed products.\nIn May and December 2018, we licensed additional technology from MSK. We are obligated to make additional milestone payments based on achievement of\nspecified development, regulatory and sales-related milestones as well as mid-single-digit percentage tiered royalty payments based on future sales of products resulting from\nthe development of the licensed product candidates, if any.\nIn March 2021, we amended and restated our license agreement with MSK to terminate our license to certain rights and license additional know-how rights not\notherwise covered by our existing agreements.\n118\nQIMR Berghofer Agreements\nIn October 2015, we entered into an exclusive license agreement and a research and development collaboration agreement with QIMR Berghofer. Under the terms of\nthe license agreement, we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to develop and commercialize allogeneic T-cell therapy programs utilizing technology and know-how\ndeveloped by QIMR Berghofer. In September 2016, the exclusive license agreement and research and development collaboration agreement were amended and restated.\nUnder the amended and restated agreements, we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to develop and commercialize additional T-cell programs, as well as the option to\nlicense additional technology that we exercised in June 2018. We further amended and restated our license agreement and research and development collaboration agreements\nwith QIMR Berghofer in August 2019, August 2020 and December 2021, in each case, to terminate our license to certain rights. Our current license agreement also provides\nfor various milestone and royalty payments to QIMR Berghofer based on future product sales, if any. Under the terms of our current research and development collaboration\nagreement, we are also required to reimburse the cost of agreed-upon development activities related to programs developed under the collaboration. These payments are\nexpensed on a straight-line basis over the related development periods. The agreement also provides for various milestone payments to QIMR Berghofer based on\nachievement of certain developmental and regulatory milestones.\nOther In-license and Collaboration Agreements\nFrom time to time, we have entered into other license and collaboration agreements with other parties. For example, we licensed rights related to our MSK-partnered\nnext-generation CAR T programs from the National Institutes of Health in December 2018.\nMilestones and royalties under each of the above agreements are contingent upon future events and will be recorded as expense when the underlying milestones are\nachieved or royalties are earned. Sales related milestone and royalty costs related to Ebvallo are recorded in cost of commercialization revenue, whereas regulatory milestone\ncosts are recorded in research and development expense. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no material outstanding obligations for milestones and royalties\nunder our in-license and collaboration agreements.\nCRL Manufacturing Agreement\nIn December 2019, we entered into a Commercial Manufacturing Services Agreement (the CRL MSA) with Cognate BioServices, Inc., which was acquired by Charles\nRiver Laboratories Inc. (CRL) in March 2021.\nPursuant to the CRL MSA, CRL provides manufacturing services for our product and certain of our product candidates. We further amended the CRL MSA to extend\nthe term until the earlier of March 31, 2024 or upon receipt of certain batches of our product and product candidates. We are currently in negotiations with CRL for a new\ncommercial drug product supply agreement to be effective upon the expiration of the CRL MSA. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into a new\ncommercial drug product supply agreement with CRL on terms favorable or acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to enter into a new commercial drug product supply\nagreement or extend the CRL MSA, we may need to identify alternative sources of drug product supply.\nFujifilm Master Services and Supply Agreement\nIn January 2022, we entered into the Fujifilm MSA, which became effective upon the closing of the sale of the ATOM Facility on April 4, 2022 and could extend for\nup to ten years. Pursuant to the Fujifilm MSA, FDB will supply us with specified quantities of our cell therapy products and product candidates, manufactured in accordance\nwith cGMP standards. We have certain non-cancellable minimum commitments to purchase products and services over the first five years of the Fujifilm MSA. The Fujifilm\nMSA does not obligate us to purchase products and product candidates exclusively from FDB.\nOther Research, Development and Manufacturing Agreements\nWe may enter into other contracts in the normal course of business with clinical research organizations for clinical trials, with CMOs for product, product candidates\nand clinical supplies, and with other vendors for preclinical studies, supplies and other services for our operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination\non notice. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there were no material amounts accrued related to contract termination charges.\n119\nMinimum Commitments\nThe non-cancellable minimum commitments for products and services, subject to agreements with a term of greater than one year with clinical research\norganizations and CMOs, excluding those recognized on our balance sheet, as of December 31, 2023 are set forth below:\nRemaining Minimum Commitment as of December 31,\nCalendar Year 2023\n(in thousands)\n2024 14,085\n2025 13,308\n2026 9,605\n2027 3,388\nTotal $ 40,386\nWe have incurred $19.4 million and $14.2 million against such minimum commitments for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we have accrued $11.2 million and $9.2 million in research and development expenses related to minimum\npurchase commitments.\nIndemnification Agreements\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and provide for indemnification for\ncertain liabilities. The exposure under these agreements is unknown because it involves claims that may be made against us in the future but have not yet been made. To date,\nwe have not paid any claims or been required to defend any action related to our indemnification obligations. However, we may record charges in the future as a result of\nthese indemnification obligations. We also have indemnification obligations to our directors and executive officers for specified events or occurrences, subject to some limits,\nwhile they are serving at our request in such capacities. There have been no claims to date and we consider the fair value of these indemnification agreements to be minimal.\nAccordingly, we did not record liabilities for these agreements as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nContingencies\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation, which arise in the normal course of our business or\notherwise. The ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and unfavorable outcomes could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRegardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of the defense costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. We are not currently\ninvolved in any material legal proceedings.\n11.Stockholders’ Equity\nOur authorized capital stock consists of 520,000,000 shares, all with a par value of $0.0001 per share, of which 500,000,000 shares are designated as common stock\nand 20,000,000 shares are designated as preferred stock. There were no shares of preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nEquity Offerings\nAs part of our July 2019 underwritten public offering, we issued and sold pre-funded warrants to purchase 2,945,026 shares of common stock in an underwritten\npublic offering pursuant to a shelf registration on Form S-3.\nEach pre-funded warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $0.0001 per share and expires seven years from the date of\nissuance. These warrants were recorded as a component of stockholders’ equity within additional paid-in capital. Per the terms of the warrant agreement, a holder of the\noutstanding warrants is not entitled to exercise any portion of any pre-funded warrant if, upon exercise of the warrant, the holder’s ownership (together with its affiliates) of\nour common stock or combined voting power of our securities beneficially owned by such holder (together with its affiliates) would exceed 9.99% after giving effect to the\nexercise (the Maximum Ownership Percentage). Upon at least 61 days’ prior notice to us by the holder, any holder may increase or decrease the Maximum Ownership\nPercentage to any other percentage not to exceed 19.99%. During the year ended December 31, 2023, 361,260 of the July 2019 pre-funded warrants were exercised, and, as of\nDecember 31, 2023, pre-funded warrants to purchase 2,527,266 shares of our common stock from the July 2019 offering were outstanding.\n120\nIn May 2020, we issued and sold pre-funded warrants to purchase 2,866,961 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $11.3199 per warrant in an\nunderwritten public offering pursuant to a shelf registration on Form S-3.\nIn December 2020, we issued and sold pre-funded warrants to purchase 2,040,816 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $24.4999 per warrant in an\nunderwritten public offering pursuant to a shelf registration on Form S-3.\nThe terms of the pre-funded warrants issued and sold as part of the 2020 public offerings were similar to those issued and sold in 2019. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 1,898,578 and 656,107 of the May 2020 and December 2020 pre-funded warrants, respectively, were exercised. As of December 31, 2023, 968,383 and\n1,384,709 of the pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of our common stock issued and sold as part of the May 2020 and December 2020 underwritten public offerings,\nrespectively, were outstanding.\nIn January 2024, we issued and sold pre-funded warrants to purchase 27,272,727 shares of common stock at a price of $0.5499 per warrant in a registered direct\noffering pursuant to a shelf registration on Form S-3. The gross proceeds from this sale were $15.0 million, resulting in net proceeds of $14.8 million, after deducting\nunderwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.\nEach of the January 2024 pre-funded warrants issued entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $0.0001 per share, with no\nexpiration date. These warrants were recorded as a component of stockholders’ equity within additional paid-in capital. Per the terms of the warrant agreement, a holder of the\noutstanding warrants is not entitled to exercise any portion of any pre-funded warrant if, upon exercise of the warrant, the holder’s ownership (together with its affiliates) of\nour common stock or combined voting power of our securities beneficially owned by such holder (together with its affiliates) would exceed 9.99% after giving effect to the\nexercise (Maximum Ownership Percentage). Upon at least 61 days’ prior notice to us by the holder, any holder may increase or decrease the Maximum Ownership Percentage\nto any other percentage not to exceed 19.99%.\nATM Facilities\nIn the past three years, we have entered into two separate sales agreements with Cowen and Company, LLC (Cowen): in November 2021 (the 2021 ATM Facility) and\nin November 2023 (the 2023 ATM Facility). Each ATM facility provides or provided for the sale, in our sole discretion, of shares of our common stock having an aggregate\noffering price of up to $100.0 million, through Cowen, as our sales agent. We filed a registration statement on Form S-3 registering the offer and sale of these shares under the\nSecurities Act (the 2023 Registration Statement). Upon the effectiveness of the 2023 Registration Statement, the 2021 ATM Facility was terminated, and no further sales can\nbe made under the 2021 ATM Facility. The issuance and sale of these shares by us pursuant to the ATM facilities are deemed “at the market” offerings defined in Rule 415\nunder the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), and were registered under the Securities Act. Commissions of up to 3.0% are due on the gross sales proceeds\nof the common stock sold under each ATM facility.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we sold an aggregate of 1,618,672 shares of common stock under the ATM facilities, at an average price of $13.84 per\nshare, for gross proceeds of $22.4 million and net proceeds of $22.0 million, after deducting commissions and other offering expenses payable by us.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we sold an aggregate of 3,038,432 shares of common stock under the ATM facilities, at an average price of $0.83 per\nshare, for gross proceeds of $2.5 million and net proceeds of $2.2 million, after deducting commissions and other offering expenses payable by us. Approximately $0.1\nmillion of the $2.2 million net proceeds were received on January 2, 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $98.2 million of common stock remaining and available to be sold under the 2023 ATM Facility.\nFrom January 1, 2024 through March 15, 2024, we sold an additional 12,321,365 shares of common stock under the 2023 ATM Facility, at an average price of $0.77\nper share, for gross proceeds of $9.5 million and net proceeds of $9.3 million, after deducting commissions and other offering expenses payable by us. As of March 15, 2024,\nwe had $88.7 million of common stock remaining and available to be sold under the 2023 ATM Facility, subject to certain conditions as specified in the agreement.\n121\nEquity Incentive Plans\nIn March 2014, we adopted the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (2014 EIP), which was amended and restated on October 15, 2014 upon the pricing of our initial public\noffering (IPO).\nThe 2014 EIP provides for annual increases in the number of shares available for issuance thereunder on the first business day of each fiscal year, beginning with 2015\nand ending in 2024, equal to five percent of the number of shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding as of such date or a lesser number of shares as determined by\nour board of directors.\nUnder the terms of the 2014 EIP, we may grant stock options, RSAs and RSUs to employees, directors, consultants and other service providers. RSUs generally vest\nover two to four years. The fair value of RSUs, including those with performance conditions, is determined as the closing stock price on the date of grant. The 2014 EIP\nexpires March 31, 2024, after which no new awards can be granted. All awards granted prior to the 2014 EIP expiration continue to remain outstanding and governed in\naccordance with the rules set forth in the 2014 EIP and the terms of the associated grant notice.\nIn February 2018, we adopted the 2018 Inducement Plan (Inducement Plan), under which we may grant options, stock appreciation rights, RSAs and RSUs to new\nemployees. In November 2020, September 2021 and June 2022, we amended the Inducement Plan to reserve an additional 1,500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock\nfor issuance under the Inducement Plan in each case.\nStock options are granted with exercise prices at no less than 100% of the fair value of the shares on the date of grant as determined by the board of directors,\nprovided, however, that the exercise price of an option granted to a 10% shareholder cannot be less than 110% of the fair value of the shares on the date of grant. The\nestimated fair value of the shares is generally equal to the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the measurement date. Options granted generally vest over\ntwo to four years and expire in seven to ten years.\nIn 2022, we granted performance-based stock options to certain of our employees that provide for the issuance of stock options to purchase common stock if specified\nCompany performance criteria related to business development initiatives are achieved. The number of performance-based awards that ultimately vests depends upon if\nperformance criteria are achieved within a specified timeline, as well as the employee’s continuous service, as defined in the 2014 EIP, through the date of vesting. None of\nthe performance criteria were achieved and the awards were subsequently forfeited.\nAs of December 31, 2023, a total of 20,326,356 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the 2014 EIP, of which 5,714,772 shares were available for\nfuture grant and 14,611,584 shares were subject to outstanding options and RSUs, including performance-based awards. As of December 31, 2023, 4,773,147 shares of\ncommon stock were reserved for issuance under the Inducement Plan, of which 2,397,366 shares were available for future grant and 2,375,781 shares were subject to\noutstanding options and RSUs.\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe following is a summary of RSU activity under our 2014 EIP and Inducement Plan:\nRSUs\nWeighted\nAverage\nGrant Date\nShares Fair Value\nBalance as of December 31, 2022 6,708,608 $ 10.61\nGranted 5,635,916 $ 3.57\nForfeited (2,388,808) $ 7.91\nVested (3,688,003) $ 8.89\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 6,267,713 $ 6.32\nThe weighted average grant date fair value of RSUs granted during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $3.57 and $8.26, respectively. The estimated\nfair value of RSUs that vested in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $32.8 million and $34.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, there was $35.9\nmillion of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.0 years. The aggregate\nintrinsic value of the RSUs outstanding as of December 31, 2023 was $3.2 million.\n122\nUnder our RSU settlement procedures, for some of the RSUs granted to our employees, we withhold shares at settlement to cover the estimated payroll withholding\ntax obligations. During 2023, we settled 3,688,003 shares underlying RSUs, of which 51,244 shares underlying RSUs were net settled by withholding 18,203 shares. The\nvalue of the shares underlying RSUs withheld was $0.1 million, based on the closing price of our common stock on the settlement date. During 2022, we settled 2,247,296\nshares underlying RSUs, of which 114,444 shares underlying RSUs were net settled by withholding 43,524 shares. The value of the shares underlying RSUs withheld was\n$0.6 million, based on the closing price of our common stock on the settlement date. The value of RSUs withheld in each period was remitted to the appropriate taxing\nauthorities and has been reflected as a financing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nStock Options\nThe following is a summary of stock option activity under our 2014 EIP and Inducement Plan:\nWeighted Average\nRemaining Aggregate\nWeighted Average Contractual Intrinsic Value\nShares Exercise Price Term (Years) (in thousands)\nBalance as of December 31, 2022 10,645,555 $ 16.88 6.4 $ 42\nGranted 4,693,897 3.64\nExercised — —\nForfeited or expired (4,619,801) 15.60\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 10,719,651 $ 11.63 6.5 $ —\nVested and expected to vest as of\nDecember 31, 2023 10,719,651 $ 11.63 6.5 $ —\nExercisable as of December 31, 2023 6,389,752 $ 15.40 5.1 $ —\nAggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the closing stock price of our common stock on December 31, 2023 and the exercise price of outstanding,\nin-the-money options. As of December 31, 2023, there was $16.6 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to stock options that is expected to be\nrecognized over a weighted average period of 1.9 years. This excludes unrecognized stock-based compensation expense for performance-based stock options that were\ndeemed not probable of vesting in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nNo options for shares of our common stock were exercised during the year ended December 31, 2023. Options for 15,989 shares of our common stock were exercised\nduring the year ended December 31, 2022, with an intrinsic value of $0.1 million. As we believe it is more likely than not that no stock option related tax benefits will be\nrealized, we do not record any net tax benefits related to exercised options.\nThe fair value of each option issued was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The following table summarizes the weighted-\naverage assumptions used as inputs to the Black-Scholes model and resulting weighted-average grant date fair values of stock options granted during the periods indicated:\nYear ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nAssumptions:\nExpected term (years) 5.80 6.0\nExpected volatility 83.9% 73.2%\nRisk-free interest rate 4.2% 2.1%\nExpected dividend yield 0.0% 0.0%\nFair Value:\nWeighted-average estimated grant date fair value per share $ 2.62 $ 5.88\nOptions granted 4,693,897 3,615,971\nTotal estimated grant date fair value $ 12,298,010 $ 21,261,909\nThe estimated fair value of stock options that vested in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $17.0 million and $23.2 million, respectively.\n123\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn May 2014, we adopted the 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“2014 ESPP”), which became effective on October 15, 2014 upon the pricing of our IPO. The\n2014 ESPP permits eligible employees to purchase common stock at a discount through payroll deductions during defined offering periods. Eligible employees can purchase\nshares of the Company’s common stock at 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock at (i) the beginning of the offering period or (ii) at the end of the\npurchase period. We recorded $0.7 million and $1.1 million of expense related to the 2014 ESPP in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. A total of\n896,246 and 417,081 shares were purchased under the ESPP during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023, there was $0.1 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the ESPP that is expected to be recognized by the end\nof second quarter of 2024.\nThe 2014 ESPP provides for annual increases in the number of shares available for issuance thereunder on the first business day of each fiscal year, beginning with\n2015 and ending in 2024, equal to the lower of (i) one percent of the number of shares of our common stock outstanding as of such date, (ii) 230,769 shares of our common\nstock, or (iii) a lesser number of shares as determined by our board of directors. As of December 31, 2023, there were 2,279,049 shares authorized under the 2014 ESPP.\nReserved Shares\nThe following shares of common stock were reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans as of December 31, 2023:\nTotal Shares\nReserved\n2014 Equity Incentive Plan 20,326,356\n2018 Inducement Plan 4,773,147\n2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan 10,593\nTotal reserved shares of common stock 25,110,096\nStock-based Compensation Expense\nThe following is a summary of stock-based compensation expense for the periods presented:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nResearch and development $ 26,529 $ 31,363\nGeneral and administrative 18,857 22,475\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ 45,386 $ 53,838\n12.Income Taxes\nLosses before provision for income taxes were as follows in each period presented:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nUnited States $ (276,360) $ (228,395)\nForeign 249 105\nTotal loss before provision for income taxes $ (276,111) $ (228,290)\nThe components of provision for income taxes were as follows in each period presented:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nCurrent provision for income taxes:\nState $ 1 $ —\nForeign 14 12\nTotal current provision for income taxes $ 15 $ 12\n124\nA reconciliation of statutory tax rates to effective tax rates were as follows in each of the periods presented:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nFederal income taxes at statutory rate 21.0% 21.0%\nResearch tax credits 4.3% 7.8%\nStock-based compensation (4.5%) (3.8%)\nOther (0.4%) (0.2%)\nChange in valuation allowance (20.4%) (24.8%)\nEffective tax rate 0.0% 0.0%\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the net tax effects of (a) temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting\npurposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and (b) operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities\nwere as follows for each of the dates presented:\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nDeferred tax assets:\nNet operating loss carryforwards $ 323,581 $ 302,591\nCapitalized research expenses 72,229 50,522\nTax credit carryforwards 30,580 19,427\nStock-based compensation 14,033 19,201\nDeferred revenue 17,018 10,069\nOperating lease liabilities 12,035 15,857\nLicense fees 5,926 6,877\nOther 11,187 13,169\nTotal deferred tax assets 486,589 437,713\nValuation allowance (474,982) (422,493)\nTotal deferred tax assets 11,607 15,220\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nOperating lease assets (11,607) (15,220)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities (11,607) (15,220)\nNet deferred tax assets (liabilities) $ — $ —\nBeginning January 1, 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures in the current year and\nrequires taxpayers to capitalize such expenses pursuant to Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 174. The capitalized expenses are amortized over a 5-year period for domestic\nexpenses and a 15-year period for foreign expenses. As a result of this provision of the Tax Act, deferred tax assets related to capitalized research expenses pursuant to IRC\nSection 174 increased by $21.7 million and $43.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These increases were partially offset by\namortization on research expenses capitalized in prior years.\nOur tax credit carryforwards increased by $11.2 million, as compared to 2022, due to research and development and orphan drug credits generated during the current\nyear.\nWe regularly evaluate the positive and negative evidence in determining the realizability of our deferred tax assets. Based upon the weight of available evidence,\nwhich includes our historical operating performance and reported cumulative net losses since inception, we maintained a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax\nassets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. We intend to maintain a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support\nreversal of the valuation allowance. The valuation allowance increased by $52.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 due to the increase in our net deferred tax\nassets.\nIn August 2022, the CHIPS and Science Act (CHIPS Act) and the IRA were enacted, neither of which are expected to have a material impact to our financial\nstatements.\n125\nThe American Rescue Plan Act (ARA) was signed into law on March 11, 2021. We do not expect the ARA to have a material impact on our financial statements,\nhowever, given the potential changes to IRC Section 162(m) effective in 2027 as a result of the ARA, we will continue to monitor and assess.\nUnder the Tax Act, federal NOLs generated in tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018 may be carried forward indefinitely, but the utilization of such federal\nNOLs is limited to 80% of taxable income in future years. Since enactment, the IRS and Treasury have issued final and proposed regulations including clarifying guidance on\nseveral topics addressed by the Tax Act. Not all states conform to the Tax Act or and other states have varying conformity to the Tax Act.\nAs of December 31, 2023, for federal income tax purposes, we had NOL carryforwards of approximately $1.1 billion of which $23.3 million begin to expire in 2035\nand the remaining may be carried forward indefinitely, research & development tax credits of $34.6 million which begin to expire in 2032, and orphan drug tax credits of\n$111.8 million which begin to expire in 2035. For state income tax purposes, we had NOL carryforwards of approximately $1.3 billion which begin to expire in 2030, research\n& development tax credits of $43.5 million which may be carried forward indefinitely, and California Completes tax credit of $2.0 million, which begins to expire in 2025.\nUnder IRC Section 382, as amended, substantial restrictions exist on the utilization of NOL and tax credit carryforwards in the event a corporation experienced an\n“ownership change.” Generally, a Section 382 “ownership change” occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who owns at least 5% of a corporation’s\nstock increases its ownership by more than 50 percentage points over its lowest ownership percentage within a specified testing period. Similar rules may apply under state\ntax laws. Accordingly, our ability to utilize NOL and tax credit carryforwards may be limited as a result of such ownership changes, and such a limitation could result in the\nexpiration of carryforwards before they are utilized.\nWe have completed a Section 382 study of transactions in our stock through December 31, 2023. The study concluded that we have experienced ownership changes\nsince inception. However, this is not expected to result in the expiration of tax attribute carryforwards prior to utilization.\nThe changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 are as\nfollows:\n(In thousands)\nBalance as of January 1, 2022 144,067\nGross increases for tax positions related to current year 7,683\nGross increases for tax positions related to prior year —\nGross decreases for tax positions related to prior year (785)\nBalance as of December 31, 2022 150,965\nGross increases for tax positions related to current year 5,538\nGross increases for tax positions related to prior year 3,843\nGross decreases for tax positions related to prior year —\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 $ 160,346\nWe currently have a full valuation allowance against our U.S. net deferred tax assets, which would impact the timing of the effective tax rate benefit should any\nuncertain tax position be favorably settled in the future. The reversal of unrecognized tax benefits would not affect our effective tax rate to the extent we continue to maintain\na full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.\nOur policy is to account for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of the income tax provision. We have no accrued interest and\npenalties as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 due to available tax losses.\nOur significant jurisdictions are the U.S. federal jurisdiction and the California state jurisdiction. All of our tax years remain open to examination by the U.S. federal\nand California tax authorities. We also file in other state, local and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, and such tax years remain open to examination.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we are not permanently reinvested with respect to its foreign earnings and have not recorded deferred income taxes and withholding taxes\nas these taxes are immaterial to the financial statements.\n126\n13.Supplemental Balance Sheet Information\nInventories\nInventories consist of the following as of each period:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nRaw Materials $ 2,335 $ 1,214\nWork-in-process 7,371 372\nTotal inventories $ 9,706 $ 1,586\nProperty and equipment, net\nProperty and equipment consisted of the following as of each period end:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nLeasehold improvements $ 904 $ 875\nLab equipment 15,540 14,797\nMachinery and equipment 572 572\nComputer equipment and software 1,279 1,149\nFurniture and fixtures 1,272 1,297\nConstruction in progress 158 32\nProperty and equipment, gross\n19,725 18,722\nLess: accumulated depreciation (15,869) (12,422)\nProperty and equipment, net $ 3,856 $ 6,300\nDepreciation expense was $3.7 million and $4.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOther current liabilities\nOther current liabilities consisted of the following as of each period end:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nAccrued operating expenses\n$ 19,007 $\n7,435\nCurrent portion of operating lease liabilities 11,264 12,806\nCurrent portion of finance lease liabilities 915 834\nOther accrued liabilities 640 319\nTotal other current liabilities $ 31,826 $ 21,394\n14.Subsequent Events\nIn January 2024, we announced a reduction in force of approximately 25% of total workforce. We expect to recognize approximately $4.5 million in total severance\nand related benefits as a result of this reduction in force, consisting primarily of severance payments and wages for the 60-day notice period in accordance with the California\nWARN Act. In most cases, the severance will be paid in the first half of 2024. Certain of the notified employees had employment agreements which provided for separation\nbenefits in the form of salary continuation; these benefits will be paid from February 2024 through January 2025. The majority of the associated costs represent cash\nexpenditures.\n127\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined\nin Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2023. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have\nconcluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2023 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or\nsubmit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is\naccumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely discussion regarding\nrequired disclosures. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how\nwell designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must\nreflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to\ntheir costs.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-\n15(f) and 15d-15(f). Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 based on the criteria\nestablished in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nBased on the results of its evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nInherent Limitations on Controls and Procedures\nOur management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal\ncontrols will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurances that the objectives of the\ncontrol system are met. The design of a control system reflects resource constraints; the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because there are inherent\nlimitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been or\nwill be detected. As these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not\neliminate, these risks. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns occur because of simple error or\nmistake. Controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any\nsystem of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. While our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide\nreasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all future conditions. Over time,\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures. Because of the inherent\nlimitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nWe intend to review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures on an ongoing basis and to improve our controls and\nprocedures over time and to correct any deficiencies that we may discover in the future. While our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as\nof December 31, 2023, the design of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, was effective, future events affecting our\nbusiness may cause us to significantly modify our disclosure controls and procedures.\n128\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended December 31, 2023 which were identified in connection with our\nevaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting. We have not experienced any material impact to our internal controls over financial reporting despite the fact that many of our employees are working\nremotely. We are continually monitoring and assessing our remote working situation to minimize the impact to the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls.\nItem 9B. Other Information\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2023, none of the Company's directors or executive officers adopted or terminated any contract, instruction or written\nplan for the purchase or sale of Company securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading\narrangement” as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nItem 9C.

If the Parties do not agree on the existence of a Product Material Adverse Effect within the Notice Review Period, then\neither Party may refer the matter for determination of the occurrence of a Product Material Adverse Effect in accordance with Section 16.12(c).\nIf Partner does not deliver the Recission Notice to Atara within the Schedule Review Period, then Partner shall be deemed to have accepted the\nupdated Schedule 11.2, and Schedule 11.2 attached to this Agreement as of the Execution Date shall be deemed to be superseded by the\nupdated Schedule 11.2.\n(b) All provisions of this Agreement shall become effective automatically upon the earliest to occur of:\n(i) the date of Atara’s delivery of a Closing Notice to Partner;\n(ii) if Partner does not deliver the Recission Notice to Atara prior to the expiration of the Schedule\nReview Period, the date of expiration of the Schedule Review Period; or\n(iii) if, pursuant to and in accordance with Section 16.2(a), (A) Partner delivers the Recission Notice to\nAtara, (B) Atara delivers the Objection Notice to Partner, (C) a Party refers the dispute regarding the existence of a Product Material\nAdverse Effect for determination by arbitration in accordance with Section 16.12(c), and (D) the final award rendered by the tribunal is\nthat no such Product Material Adverse Effect exists, the date of such final award,\nin any case (i), (ii) or (iii), without the need for further action by the Parties (such date, as applicable, the “Effective Date”).\n(c) Upon the occurrence of the Effective Date, the Original Commercialization Agreement shall automatically terminate,\nwithout the need for further action by the Parties. For clarity, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Original\nCommercialization Agreement shall continue in full force and effect unless and until the occurrence of the Effective Date.\n16.3 Entire Agreement.\nBeginning on the Effective Date, this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, together with the Exhibits and all written\namendments, modifications and supplements thereto constitute the entire agreement between the Parties and all prior negotiations, proposals\nand writings pertaining to this Agreement or the subject matter thereof (including the Original Commercialization Agreement), are hereby\nsuperseded.

Incentive Compensation is considered\nto have been received by a Covered Officer in the fiscal year during which the applicable financial reporting measure was attained or purportedly\nattained, even if the payment or grant of such Incentive Compensation occurs after the end of that period.\n“Recoverable Incentive Compensation” means Incentive Compensation received during the Recovery Period.\n“Recovery Period” means the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare the\nAccounting Restatement, as determined in accordance with this definition, or any transition period that results from a change in the Company’s\nfiscal year (as set forth in Section 5608(b)(i)(D) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules). The date on which the Company is required to prepare an\nAccounting Restatement is the earlier to occur of (A) the date the Board or a Board committee (or authorized officers of the Company if Board\naction is not required) concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement or\n(B) the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement.\n4. RECOUPMENT\na. Recoupment Generally. Pursuant to the provisions of this Policy, if there is an Accounting Restatement, the amount to be recovered will\nbe the excess of (i) the Recoverable Incentive Compensation received by the Covered Officer based on the erroneous data and calculated without regard\nto any taxes paid or withheld, over (ii) the Incentive Compensation that would have been received by the Covered Officers had it been calculated based\non the restated financial information, as determined by the Board. For Incentive Compensation based on stock price or TSR, where the amount of\nerroneously awarded compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in the Accounting Restatement, then the\nBoard shall determine the amount to be recovered based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or TSR\nupon which the Incentive Compensation was received and the Company shall document the determination of that estimate and provide it to Nasdaq.\nb. Sources of Recoupment. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Board, in its discretion, may use any legal or equitable remedies\nthat are available to the Company to seek recoupment from a Covered Officer, including but not limited to, recoupment from any of the following\nsources: direct repayment of Recoverable Incentive Compensation previously paid to the Covered Officer; future payments of other Incentive\nCompensation; and cancellation of outstanding Incentive Compensation. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company may also offset the\nrecoupment amount owed to the Company against any compensation or other amounts owed by the Company to the Covered Officer. Covered Officers\nshall be solely responsible for any tax consequences to them that result from the recoupment or recovery of any amount pursuant to this Policy, and the\nCompany shall have no obligation to administer the Policy in a manner that avoids or minimizes any such tax consequences.\n2\n4880-6590-2613v.5\nc. No-Fault Recovery. Recoupment under this Policy shall be required regardless of whether the Covered Officer or any other person was at\nfault or responsible for accounting errors that contributed to the need for the Accounting Restatement or engaged in any misconduct.\nd. Exceptions. The compensation recouped under this Policy shall not include Incentive Compensation received by a Covered Officer (i)\nprior to beginning service as a Covered Officer or (ii) if he or she did not serve as a Covered Officer at any time during the performance period\napplicable to the Incentive Compensation in question. The Board may determine not to seek recovery from a Covered Officer in whole or part to the\nextent it determines in its sole discretion that such recovery would be impracticable because (A) the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in\nenforcing recovery would exceed the recoverable amount (after having made a reasonable attempt to recover the erroneously awarded Incentive\nCompensation and providing corresponding documentation of such attempt to Nasdaq), (B) recovery would violate the home country law that was\nadopted prior to November 28, 2022, as determined by an opinion of counsel licensed in the applicable jurisdiction that is acceptable to and provided to\nNasdaq, or (C) recovery would likely cause the Company’s 401(k) plan or any other tax-qualified retirement plan to fail to meet the requirements of\nSection 401(a)(13) or Section 411(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations thereunder.\n5. SEVERABILITY\nIf any provision of this Policy or the application of any such provision to any Covered Officer shall be adjudicated to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable\nin any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Policy, and the invalid, illegal or unenforceable\nprovisions shall be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to render any such provision or application enforceable.\n6. NO IMPAIRMENT OF OTHER REMEDIES\nThis Policy shall be without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that the Company, or the Board may have, and does not preclude the Company\nfrom taking any other action to enforce a Covered Officer’s obligations to the Company, whether arising under applicable law (including pursuant to\nSection 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002), regulation or pursuant to the terms of any other policy of the Company, employment agreement, equity\naward, cash incentive award or other agreement applicable to a Covered Officer, including termination of employment, institution of civil proceedings,\nor reporting of any misconduct to appropriate government authorities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall be no duplication of recovery of the\nsame Incentive Compensation under this Policy and any other such rights or remedies.\n7. NO INDEMNIFICATION\nThe Company shall not indemnify any Covered Officer or pay or reimburse the premium for any insurance policy to cover any losses incurred\nby such Covered Officer under this Policy or any claims relating to the Company’s enforcement of rights under this Policy.\n3\n4880-6590-2613v.5"
