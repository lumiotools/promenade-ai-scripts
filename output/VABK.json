For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized net income of $12.4 million, or $2.30 per diluted share, compared to $16.1 million, or $2.99 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. \n\n[ ![Virginia National Bankshares Corporation \\(PRNewsfoto/Virginia National Bankshares\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1500288/Virginia_National_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1500288/Virginia_National_Logo.html)\n\nThe decline in year-to-date 2024 net income compared to 2023 is primarily the result of 1) increased cost of funds and 2) the receipt in the prior year of bank-owned life insurance proceeds as a result of the death of a former employee, which was offset by an increase in interest income and a decline in operating expenses. \n\n**_President and Chief Executive Officer's comments:_** \"Our measures to reduce ongoing overhead costs are paying off for us as evidenced through reduced noninterest expenses,\" stated Glenn W. Rust, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"In addition, we continue to put new loans on the books, increasing loan balances 11% during 2024 and 19% year-over-year, and our credit quality metrics remain strong. Our capital and liquidity positions continue to be solid and stable.\"\n\n**_Key Performance Indicators_**** _Third Quarter 2024 Compared to Second Quarter 2024_**\n\n  *     * Return on average assets increased to 1.15% from 1.05%\n    * Return on average equity increased to 11.44% from 11.07%\n    * Net interest margin (FTE)1 improved to 3.24% from 3.04%\n    * Loan-to-deposit ratio increased to 88.1% from 84.3%\n    * Efficiency ratio (FTE)1 improved to 58.6% from 62.7%\n\n\n\n**_September 2024 Balance Sheet Highlights_**\n\n  * The Company continued to experience loan growth in the third quarter of 2024. Gross loans outstanding as of September 30, 2024 totaled $1.2 billion, an increase of $122.8 million, or 11.2%, compared to December 31, 2023 and an increase of $195.0 million, or 19.1%, compared to September 30, 2023.\n  * As of September 30, 2024, the Company had unused borrowing facilities in place of approximately $160.4 million and held no brokered deposits.\n  * Securities balances declined $141.9 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024; funds from the maturities of investments were repurposed to higher yielding assets in the form of loans.\n  * The Company utilizes a third-party to offer multi-million-dollar FDIC insurance to customers with balances in excess of single-bank limits through Insured Cash Sweep® (ICS) plans. Deposit balances held in ICS plans amounted to $145.6 million as of September 30, 2024, $151.5 million as of December 31, 2023 and $128.7 million as of September 30, 2023.\n  * Total deposits decreased $29.2 million, or 2.1% from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 and increased $9.6 million, or 0.7% year-over-year.\n  * Outstanding borrowings declined $14.0 million, or 21.1%, from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, as management made a concerted effort to stabilize overall cost of funds.\n\n\n\n**_Loans and Asset Quality_**\n\n  * Credit performance remains strong with nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets of 0.33% as of September 30, 2024, 0.17% as of December 31, 2023 and 0.13% as of September 30, 2023.\n  * Nonperforming assets amounted to $5.3 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $2.7 million as of December 31, 2023 and $2.0 million as of September 30, 2023;\n    * Ten loans to nine borrowers are in non-accrual status, totaling $2.1 million, as of September 30, 2024, compared to $1.9 million as of December 31, 2023 and $1.1 million as of September 30, 2023.\n    * Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest amounted to $3.2 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $880 thousand as of December 31, 2023 and $854 thousand as of September 30, 2023. The past due balance as of September 30, 2024 is comprised of four loans totaling $3.1 million which are 100% government-guaranteed, and four student loans totaling $66 thousand.\n    * The Company currently holds no other real estate owned.\n  * The period-end Allowance for Credit Losses (\"ACL\") as a percentage of total loans was 0.70% as of September 30, 2024, 0.77% as of December 31, 2023 and 0.76% as of September 30, 2023. The proportionate increase in government-guaranteed loans over the respective periods is the driver of the decrease in the ACL as a percentage of total loans. Balances in government-guaranteed loans have increased $111.1 million during the first nine months of 2024 and have increased $141.3 million since September 30, 2023. Such loans are 100% government-guaranteed and do not require an ACL.\n  * The fair value mark that was allocated to the acquired loans was $21.3 million as of April 1, 2021, with a remaining balance of $7.3 million as of September 30, 2024.\n  * For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a net recovery of provision for credit losses of $114 thousand, as the recovery of a previously charged-off loan nearly offset the increase in provision required for new loan balances; this balance includes a $111 thousand recovery of provision for unfunded reserves, as a result of a decline in unfunded construction commitments.\n\n\n\n**_Net Interest Income_**\n\n  * Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of $12.0 million increased $924 thousand, or 8.3%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, as the increase in interest income earned on assets outweighed the interest expense on deposit accounts and borrowings.\n  * Net interest margin (FTE), (a non-GAAP financial measure)1, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.24%, compared to 2.89% and 3.04% for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and the three months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase as compared to the third quarter of 2023 was primarily due to the increase in yield on loans, described below.\n  * Yield on loans was 5.85% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.53% for the prior year same period, and was 5.73% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.81% for the prior year same period. The accretion of the credit mark related to purchased loans positively impacted interest income by 25 bps in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 27 bps in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * The overall cost of funds, including noninterest-bearing deposits, of 207 bps incurred in the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 35 bps from 172 bps in the same period in the prior year. Overall, the cost of interest-bearing deposits increased period over period, from a cost of 226 bps to 271 bps. Management believes that the Bank's cost of funds stabilized during the first half of 2024, as the cost of funds and cost of interest bearing deposits is relatively unchanged during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n\n\n**_______________________________________________________________________**\n\n1 | See \"Reconciliation of Certain Quarterly Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" at the end of this release.  \n---|---  \n  \n**_Noninterest Income_** Noninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased $1.2 million, or 45.1%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the recognition of bank-owned life insurance proceeds during the prior period due to the death of a former employee, as well as lower wealth management, deposit account, debit card, credit card and ATM fees. \n\n**_Noninterest Expense_** Noninterest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased $397 thousand, or 4.8%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease is primarily the result of lower compensation and occupancy costs, as a result of right-sizing the branch network from the merger, and reduced marketing, advertising and promotion expense.\n\n**_Book Value_** Book value per share increased to $30.89 as of September 30, 2024, compared to $25.29 as of September 30, 2023, and tangible book value per share (a non-GAAP financial measure)1 was $28.68 as of September 30, 2024 compared to $22.83 as of September 30, 2023. These values increased as net retained income increased and unrealized losses in the investment portfolio declined period over period.\n\n**_Income Taxes_** The effective tax rates amounted to 18.5% and 15.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which are lower than the statutory rate, due to the recognition of low-income housing tax credits and the effect of tax-exempt income from municipal bonds and income from bank owned life insurance policies.\n\n**_Dividends_** Cash dividends of $1.8 million, or $0.33 per share, were declared and paid during the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**_Share Repurchase Plan_** Year-to-date, the Company has repurchased 20,350 shares at an average price of $27.42 per share. No shares were repurchased during the third quarter of 2024.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________\n\n1  | See \"Reconciliation of Certain Quarterly Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" at the end of this release.  \n---|---  \n  \n**About Virginia National Bankshares Corporation**\n\nVirginia National Bankshares Corporation, headquartered in Charlottesville, Virginia, is the bank holding company for Virginia National Bank.

For the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized net income of $7.8 million, or $1.45 per diluted share, compared to $11.4 million, or $2.13 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2023. \n\n[ ![Virginia National Bankshares Corporation \\(PRNewsfoto/Virginia National Bankshares\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1500288/Virginia_National_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1500288/Virginia_National_Logo.html)\n\nThe declines in 2024 net income compared to 2023 for the quarterly and year-to-date periods are the result of 1) increased cost of funds and 2) the accretion of the credit mark related to purchased loans when satisfied by the borrower, which was significantly larger in the second quarter of 2023 when compared to the same period of 2024.\n\n**_President and Chief Executive Officer's comments:_** \"Loan balances continued to increase during the second quarter of this year, with organic growth and continued purchases of the government-guaranteed portions of USDA and SBA loans,\" stated Glenn W. Rust, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"We increased our loan balances 6% during the first half of the year, 19% year-over-year and our credit quality metrics remain solid. Our capital and liquidity positions continue to be strong and stable. We are also pleased to report that Virginia National Bankshares Corporation has been included again in the Russell 2000, which reconstituted at the end of the second quarter. Inclusion will likely enhance stock liquidity through trading by index funds and benchmarked investment strategies.\"\n\n**_Key Performance Indicators_**** _Second quarter 2024 compared to fourth quarter 2023_**\n\n  *     *       *         * Return on average assets increased to 1.05% from 0.79%\n        * Return on average equity increased to 11.07% from 9.03%\n        * Net interest margin (FTE)1 improved to 3.04% from 2.89%\n        * Loan-to-deposit ratio increased to 84.3% from 77.5%\n        * Efficiency ratio (FTE)1 improved to 62.7% from 64.0%\n\n\n\n**_June 2024 Balance Sheet Highlights_**\n\n  * The Company continued to experience loan growth in the second quarter of 2024. Gross loans outstanding as of June 30, 2024 totaled $1.2 billion, an increase of $65.5 million, or 6.0%, compared to December 31, 2023 and an increase of $184.9 million, or 19.0%, compared to June 30, 2023.\n  * Outstanding borrowings declined $36.5 million, or 54.9%, from December 31, 2023 to June 30, 2024 and declined $29.7 million, or 49.7% year-over year, as management made a concerted effort to stabilize overall cost of funds.\n  * As of June 30, 2024, the Company had unused borrowing facilities in place of approximately $196.7 million.\n  * The Company holds no brokered deposits.\n  * The Company utilizes a third-party to offer multi-million-dollar FDIC insurance to customers with balances in excess of single-bank limits through Insured Cash Sweep® (ICS) plans. Deposit balances held in ICS plans amounted to $144.8 million as of June 30, 2024, $151.5 million as of December 31, 2023 and $132.8 million as of June 30, 2023.\n  * Total deposits decreased $35.3 million, or 2.5% from December 31, 2023 to June 30, 2024 and increased $25.8 million, or 1.9% year-over-year.\n  * Securities balances declined $137.6 million from December 31, 2023 to June 30, 2024; funds from the maturities of investments were repurposed to higher yielding assets in the form of loans and to reduce the level of outstanding borrowings.\n\n\n\n**_Loans and Asset Quality_**\n\n  * Credit performance remains strong with nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets of 0.25% as of June 30, 2024, 0.17% as of December 31, 2023 and 0.08% as of June 30, 2023.\n  * Nonperforming assets amounted to $4.0 million as of June 30, 2024, compared to $2.7 million as of December 31, 2023 and $1.3 million as of June 30, 2023;\n    * Ten loans to nine borrowers are in non-accrual status, totaling $2.4 million, as of June 30, 2024, compared to $1.9 million as of December 31, 2023 and $1.2 million as of June 30, 2023.\n    * Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest amounted to $1.6 million as of June 30, 2024, compared to $880 thousand as of December 31, 2023 and $107 thousand as of June 30, 2023. The past due balance as of June 30, 2024 is comprised of four loans totaling $1.5 million which are 100% government-guaranteed, and seven student loans totaling $63 thousand.\n    * The Company currently holds no other real estate owned.\n  * The period-end Allowance for Credit Losses (\"ACL\") as a percentage of total loans was 0.69% as of June 30, 2024, 0.77% as of December 31, 2023 and 0.81% as of June 30, 2023. The proportionate increase in government-guaranteed loans over the respective periods is the driver of the decrease in the ACL as a percentage of total loans. Balances in government-guaranteed loans have increased $42.4 million during the second quarter of 2024 and have increased $130.2 million since June 30, 2023. Such loans are 100% government-guaranteed and do not require an ACL.\n  * The fair value mark that was allocated to the acquired loans was $21.3 million as of April 1, 2021, with a remaining balance of $8.2 million as of June 30, 2024.\n  * For the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded a net recovery of provision for credit losses of $338 thousand, primarily due to the recovery of a previously charged-off loan; this balance is net of a $180 thousand provision for unfunded commitments.\n\n\n\n**_Net Interest Income_**\n\n  * Net interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2024 of $11.2 million decreased $2.5 million, or 18.4%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, as the increase in interest expense on deposit accounts and borrowings outweighed the increase in interest income earned on assets.\n  * Net interest margin (FTE), (a non-GAAP financial measure)2, for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was 3.04%, compared to 2.89% and 3.83% for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and the three months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. The increase as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 was primarily due to the increase in yield on loans, increasing from 5.47% to 5.71% for the periods noted, while the decline when compared to the prior year second quarter was due to increased cost of funds.\n  * Yield on loans was 5.71% for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 6.35% for the prior year same period, and was 5.67% for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 5.96% for the prior year same period. The accretion of the credit mark related to purchased loans positively impacted interest income by 31 bps in the second quarter of 2024, compared to 88 bps in the second quarter of 2023, fluctuating primarily due to the treatment of the credit mark under CECL2. When a purchased loan, which was identified as purchased credit-deteriorated as of the date of the acquisition, is satisfied by the borrower, the remaining mark is recognized as interest income in accordance with CECL.\n  * The overall cost of funds, including noninterest-bearing deposits, of 210 bps incurred in the three months ended June 30, 2024 increased 77 bps from 133 bps in the same period in the prior year. Overall, the cost of interest-bearing deposits increased period over period, from a cost of 174 bps to 274 bps. Management believes that the Bank's cost of funds has stabilized during the first half of 2024, as the cost of funds and cost of interest bearing deposits is relatively unchanged from the three months ended March 31, 2024.\n\n\n\n**_Noninterest Income_**\n\nNoninterest income for the three months ended June 30, 2024 decreased $354 thousand, or 17.3%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to lower wealth management, deposit account, debit card, credit card and ATM fees. \n\n**_Noninterest Expense_**\n\nNoninterest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2024 decreased $442 thousand, or 5.2%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023. This decrease is primarily the result of lower compensation, occupancy and data processing costs, as a result of right-sizing the branch network from the merger, and reduced marketing, advertising and promotion expense.\n\n**_Book Value_**\n\nBook value per share increased to $28.70 as of June 30, 2024, compared to $26.54 as of June 30, 2023, and tangible book value per share (a non-GAAP financial measure)1 was $26.43 as of June 30, 2024 compared to $24.01 as of June 30, 2023. These values increased as net retained income increased and unrealized losses in the investment portfolio remained relatively constant period over period.\n\n**_Income Taxes_**\n\nThe effective tax rates amounted to 18.3% and 18.4% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which are lower than the statutory rate, due to the recognition of low-income housing tax credits and the effect of tax-exempt income from municipal bonds and income from bank owned life insurance policies.\n\n**_Dividends_**\n\nCash dividends of $1.8 million, or $0.33 per share, were declared and paid during the second quarter of 2024.\n\n**_Share Repurchase Plan_**\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, the Company continued its share repurchase plan, repurchasing 19,476 shares at an average price of $27.32 per share. Year-to-date, the Company has repurchased 20,350 shares at an average price of $27.42 per share.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________\n\n1 See \"Reconciliation of Certain Quarterly Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" at the end of this release.\n\n2 For more information regarding the adoption of FASB's Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (\"CECL\") effective January 1, 2023, refer to the Company's first quarter 2023 Form 10-Q.\n\n**About Virginia National Bankshares Corporation**\n\nVirginia National Bankshares Corporation, headquartered in Charlottesville, Virginia, is the bank holding company for Virginia National Bank.

Actual results may differ materially from\nthose included in the forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including, without limitation, the effects of and changes in: general economic and\nmarket conditions, including the effects of declines in real estate values, an increase in unemployment levels and general economic contraction as a result of COVID-\n19 or other pandemics; fluctuations in interest rates, deposits, loan demand, and asset quality; assumptions that underlie the Company’s allowance for loan losses; the\npotential adverse effects of unusual and infrequently occurring events, such as weather-related disasters, terrorist acts or public health events, and of governmental and\nsocietal responses thereto; the performance of vendors or other parties with which the Company does business; competition; technology; changes in laws, regulations\nand guidance; changes in accounting principles or guidelines; performance of assets under management; expected revenue synergies and cost savings from the recently\ncompleted merger with Fauquier may not be fully realized or realized within the expected timeframe; the businesses of the Company and Fauquier may not be\nintegrated successfully or such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected; revenues following the merger may be lower than expected;\ncustomer and employee relationships and business operations may be disrupted by the merger; and other factors impacting financial services businesses. Many of these\nfactors and additional risks and uncertainties are described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and other reports\nfiled from time to time by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These statements speak only as of the date made, and the Company does not\nundertake to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes or events that may occur after this release.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and prevailing practices in the banking\nindustry. However, management uses certain non-GAAP measures to supplement the evaluation of the Company’s performance, including (i) net interest income\n(FTE), (ii) efficiency ratio (FTE), (iii) net interest margin (FTE) and (iv) tangible book value per share. Management believes presentations of these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures provide useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper understanding of the operating results of the Company’s core businesses. These non-\nGAAP disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP\nperformance measures that may be presented by other companies.\n1\nCorporate Overview\nExperienced Management\nSeasoned Executive Leadership\nGlenn W.
