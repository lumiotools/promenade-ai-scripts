(“Theratechnologies” or the “Company”) (TSX: TH) (NASDAQ: THTX), a biopharmaceutical company focused on development and commercialization of innovative therapies, today announced data from two poster presentations, focusing on the association between excess visceral abdominal fat (EVAF) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in people with HIV (PWH), and on the use of tesamorelin to reduce such risk.\n\nIn a poster presentation at IDWeek 2024 in Los Angeles, Calif., investigators from the Visceral Adiposity Measurement and Observations Study (VAMOS) reported that EVAF is one of several risk factors that contribute to heightened CVD risk in PWH who are on modern anti-retroviral therapy (ART) regimens. In a separate poster presentation, researchers demonstrated that the EVAF-lowering properties of tesamorelin, a growth hormone-releasing factor (GHRF), enable a reduction in CVD risk in PWH.\n\n“The two studies presented at IDWeek 2024 suggest that excess visceral abdominal fat is an overlooked risk factor for cardiovascular disease in people with HIV, and that use of tesamorelin for visceral abdominal fat reduction may contribute to lowering cardiovascular disease risk,” said Christian Marsolais, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of Theratechnologies. “We hope greater awareness of EVAF, and of strategies to address this risk factor, lead to improved outcomes in people with HIV being treated with ART medicines.”\n\n**VAMOS Data**\n\nVAMOS, a cross-sectional, multicenter observational study, is the first trial designed to improve the understanding of the impact of EVAF on CVD, steatotic liver disease, insulin resistance, and other metabolic parameters in PWH who are on modern ART regimens. The investigators examined the impact of EVAF (defined as visceral fat surface area ≥130 cm2 by CT scan) on traditional CVD risk factors and overall cardiovascular (CV) risk in 170 participants with HIV. The prevalence of EVAF in the study was 58%, and the mean visceral fat area was 148 cm2. Among participants with EVAF, values for the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR; p≤0.0001) and triglyceride:high-density lipoprotein (TG:HDL) ratios (p=0.0013) were higher than in those without EVAF. Investigators noted a positive correlation between EVAF and HOMA-IR (ρ=0.43, p≤0.0001) and TG:HDL ratios (ρ=0.33, p≤0.0001).\n\nImportantly, greater EVAF was associated with a higher 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk (p≤0.0001). The investigators also found that increasing visceral fat surface area was inversely associated with growth hormone (GH) levels (ρ=-0.17, p=0.03), and that participants with EVAF had lower GH levels overall (p=0.05).\n\n“Excess visceral abdominal fat, or EVAF, is the key characteristic of central adiposity, a condition that is still prevalent in today’s population of people living with HIV, even among those who were never exposed to earlier anti-retroviral agents,” commented VAMOS investigator, John Koethe M.D., Associate Professor of Medicine at Vanderbilt University. “As the quantity of visceral fat rises, 10-year ASCVD risk scores increase, as well as traditional risk factors including insulin resistance and lipid levels. Together, these factors contribute to the heightened risk of cardiovascular disease we see in people with HIV, which is a particular concern among aging individuals. Additionally, the relationship we observed between EVAF and decreased growth hormone levels appears to support a focus on the growth hormone axis to impact EVAF.”\n\n**Tesamorelin CV Risk Data**\n\nResearchers examined data from two phase 3 randomized studies to assess the impact of tesamorelin-induced reduction of EVAF on CVD outcomes in 543 PWH. They calculated 10-year ASCVD risk scores for participants at baseline and at 26 weeks of tesamorelin treatment. The percentages of participants on lipid-lowering therapies, antihypertensive treatment, or diabetes medications were 44%, 37%, and 18%, respectively.\n\nAlthough most participants had low CVD risk at baseline, 44% had borderline to high CVD risk. Participants on tesamorelin tended toward a modest reduction in 10-year ASCVD risk scores, with an estimated change of -0.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.89%, 0.05%). The reduction in CVD risk was relatively larger among subjects with higher CVD risk at baseline (p=0.038 for the overall trend among all participants). These reductions in ASCVD risk scores were driven primarily by reductions in total cholesterol, independent of lipid-lowering therapies.\n\n“Our analysis provides evidence that tesamorelin may contribute to a reduction in forecasted cardiovascular disease risk in persons with HIV, particularly among individuals at the highest baseline risk,” stated investigator Lindsay Fourman, M.D., Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. “Given the high prevalence of obesity and central adiposity in this population, a strategy that selectively reduces excess visceral abdominal fat may be particularly effective in CVD risk management.”\n\nIDWeek 2024, taking place October 16-19, is the joint annual meeting of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, the HIV Medicine Association, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists.\n\n**About Theratechnologies**\n\nTheratechnologies (TSX: TH) (NASDAQ: THTX) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies addressing unmet medical needs.

(“Theratechnologies” or the “Company”) (TSX: TH) (NASDAQ: THTX), a biopharmaceutical company focused on development and commercialization of innovative therapies, today disclosed the study design and baseline characteristics of participants in the Prospective Observational Study of Multidrug-Resistant Patient Outcomes with and without Ibalizumab in a Real-World Setting: United States (PROMISE-US). The study seeks to fill a critical gap in long-term clinical outcomes for heavily treatment-experienced (HTE) people with HIV (PWH), while illuminating factors contributing to maintenance of virologic control.\n\nIn a poster presentation at IDWeek 2024 in Los Angeles, Calif., PROMISE-US investigators reported that ibalizumab, a CD4-directed post-attachment inhibitor of HIV, was more frequently selected for use in advanced, HTE participants with lower CD4 cell counts and higher viral loads, compared to regimens not containing ibalizumab. Despite the use in more advanced patients, ibalizumab demonstrated good durability, with the majority of subjects staying on therapy for more than 24 months.\n\n“The phenomenon of multidrug resistance is most prevalent in persons with HIV with extensive prior exposure to antiretroviral therapies, making it challenging to establish and maintain virologic control, due to the limited availability of medications for constructing a fully suppressive regimen,” stated presenting author, Charlotte-Paige Rolle, M.D., MPH, Director of Research Operations, Orlando Immunology Center. “Given the need for more options to treat this subset of PWH and to understand how they respond to treatment, we designed PROMISE-US to compare the long-term efficacy and safety of ibalizumab-based regimens to other regimens used in heavily treatment-experienced individuals in the real-world setting.”\n\nPROMISE-US ([ClinicalTrials.gov](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=m8qnIdOpUICm6foHo1CpSpFuo7Ea7pDBzl8_zV6EnPiKnWRNul5BYk9LVuYlPAle3eZLagQOcJ5uPeZWvz7KaSkczjTkoRsvebcRz7j474k=) identifier: NCT05388474) is a phase 4, multicenter, retrospective and prospective, observational, non-interventional registry study. The study is designed to assess risk factors and predictors of virologic and immunologic response in HTE PWH and specific sub-populations and is the first real-world registry study that captures patient-reported outcomes such as satisfaction and adherence to treatment in this specific patient population.\n\nThe study’s primary objective is to evaluate the long-term efficacy and durability of ibalizumab in combination with other antiretroviral (ARV) therapies by comparing the clinical outcomes of patients receiving ibalizumab (Cohort 2) versus matched patients not receiving ibalizumab (Cohort 1).\n\nAs of November 2023, a total of 114 participants were enrolled: 70 in Cohort 1, 42 on ibalizumab, and two screen failures. Baseline characteristics, including race, ethnicity, sex, gender, and time since diagnosis, were well matched between both cohorts. The use of ibalizumab was associated with HTE patients with higher viral loads (p = 0.0629) and declining CD4 T cells (p = 0.001), compared to those subjects not taking ibalizumab.\n\nThe PROMISE-US researchers also investigated the use of the capsid inhibitor lenacapavir, for HTE PWH, in combination with ibalizumab. This subset of Cohort 2 exhibited the highest viral loads and lowest CD4 counts at baseline, although the sample size is small (n = 12). As of the time of analysis, 80% of participants (n = 21) in Cohort 2 had remained on ibalizumab for greater than 12 months. Ibalizumab was well tolerated, with no infusion reactions reported.\n\n“As more agents with novel mechanisms of action become available and HIV researchers and clinicians are paying increasing attention to multidrug resistance, we continue to analyze data from PROMISE-US to understand the long-term safety and efficacy of ibalizumab, particularly with regard to its suitability for combination with long-term injectable therapies,” said Christian Marsolais, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of Theratechnologies. “We also seek further understanding of the factors that contribute to maintaining virologic response in heavily treatment-experienced individuals with HIV, a population with a high unmet need for reliable, sustainable antiretroviral therapy. We are proud to be the first company to establish a registry to capture long-term clinical outcomes for heavily treatment-experienced patients with multidrug-resistant HIV-1 in a real-world setting and look forward to sharing additional data from this ongoing study.”\n\nIDWeek 2024 is the joint annual meeting of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, the HIV Medicine Association, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists.\n\n**About Theratechnologies** Theratechnologies (TSX: TH) (NASDAQ: THTX) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies addressing unmet medical needs.
