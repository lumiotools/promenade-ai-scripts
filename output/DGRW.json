          "content": "Market Insights | October 2024\nSTOCK MARKET IDEAS FOR\nFED RATE CUTS\nJeff Weniger, CFA, Head of Equity Strategy\nKey Takeaways:\n• Pairing DLN for its downside resilience with QGRW’s growth exposure could provide\ninvestors with a diversified mix. This strategy may offer a balance between stability and\npotential growth in various market conditions.\n• Sector performance after rate cuts has been uneven, with Consumer Discretionary and\nHealth Care historically outperforming while Communication Services and Utilities\nunderperformed.\n• The impact of rate cuts on broader markets is uncertain. While rate cuts sometimes\nboost returns (e.g., post-1998), the cycles that commenced in 2001, 2007 and 2019 were\nfollowed by stock market declines.\nThis report covers these three major strategies: the WisdomTree U.S. LargeCap Dividend Fund\n(DLN), the WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth Fund (DGRW) and the WisdomTree U.S. Quality\nGrowth Fund (QGRW). For ease in the text, I’ll refer to them by their tickers.\nWisdomTree.com/investments\n2\nPerhaps the most asked question we are getting is, “How should investors play Fed rate cuts?”\nI’ll give some ideas for the grizzly bears, the ebullient bulls, the undecided and everyone in between.\nLet’s start with rates themselves. Figure 1 shows the distribution of moves in the 3-month T-Bill against attendant\nmoves in 10-Year T-Note yields, tabulated from 1962 to 2024. As I write, the Street anticipates 110 basis points\n(bps) of Fed rate cuts between now and the December 18 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. Since\n2024’s final Federal Reserve (Fed) gathering is about one quarter from now, the table presents quarterly changes\nin short-term rates, run monthly.\nThe far-left column is where to focus if you’re on board with the Street’s Fed Funds consensus. In the past, the\nmarket saw 45 scenarios (14+18+13 in the northwest corner of the table) where 10-Year Treasury rates fell during\nquarters when short-term rates dropped precipitously. In only 10 instances (8+2 in the table) did T-Note yields\nrise amid tumbling short rates.\nFigure 1: Number of Occurrences: Quarterly Interest Rate Changes, 1962–2024\nCount of Quarterly Interest Rate Changes, 1962-2024\nWisdomTree.com/investments\nyrusaerT\nraeY-01\n3-Month Treasury\nYield Fell Yield Fell Yield Rose Yield Rose\nYield Fell -1.0% Yield Rose 1.0%\nNumber of Occurrences between -0.5% between 0.0% between 0.0% between 0.5%\nor More or More\nand -1.0% and -0.5% and 0.5% and 1.0%\nYield Fell -1.0% or More 14 6 4 4 1 0\nYield Fell between -0.5% and -1.0% 18 16 39 11 4 0\nYield Fell between 0.0% and -0.5% 13 30 90 99 12 1\nYield Rose between 0.0% and 0.5% 8 14 71 149 44 13\nYield Rose between 0.5% and 1.0% 2 0 18 35 14 14\nYield Rose 1.0% or More 0 0 2 7 9 11\nTotal Count 55 66 224 305 84 39\nSource: Refinitiv, 1/31/1962–8/31/2024. Time series is rolling monthly observations of quarterly changes. For example, the first observation is\nJan–Apr 1962, then Feb–May 1962 and so on.\n3\nSource: WisdomTree PATH software, as of 9/19/24. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. You cannot invest directly in a\nmarket index. Performance data quoted represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and\nprincipal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their\noriginal cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. For the most recent month-end and\nstandardized performance, please visit the Fund’s website at USIN, DGRW, DLN, QGRW. The gross expense ratio for each fund is:\nUSIN, 0.15%; DGRW, 0.28%; DLN, 0.28%; and QGRW, 0.28%.\nAs to whether the Fed follows through and meets the consensus, I suppose we should ask if inflation is benign\nenough to justify slashing rates as aggressively as the Street anticipates. Looking into the bowels of the Consumer\nPrice Index (CPI) report, 57% of the subcomponents were at or below the Fed’s 2% inflation bogey in both July\nand August (figure 3). That is higher than when the Fed began cutting rates in 1995, 1998, 2001 and 2007, but not\nas high as when Powell engaged his first set of rate cuts in 2019.\nFigure 3: 57% of CPI Components Are in Deflation or Disinflation\n80%\n75% 2019\n70%\n65%\n60%\n55%\n50%\n45%\n40%\n35%\n30%\n25%\n20%\n15%\n10%\n5%\n0%\nWisdomTree.com/investments\n9891 1991 3991 5991 7991 9991 1002 3002 5002 7002 9002 1102 3102 5102 7102 9102 1202 3202 5202\nFor readers who believe the bond market will abide, I consulted the 2024 action since bonds turned the April 25,\n2024, low in USIN, the WisdomTree 7-10 Year Laddered Treasury Fund.\nAs bond yields fell, we saw a generalized melt-up across strategies, with the market paying little attention to the\nGrowth-Blend-Value spectrum.\nFigure 2: U.S. Equity Funds’ Returns during Fixed Income’s Summer Run\nTicker 4/25/24 - 9/19/24 Return (%) Category\nUSIN 9.5% Intermediate Bonds\nQGRW 15.8% Growth\nS&P 500 13.8% Blend\nDGRW 13.4% Blend\nDLN 12.6% Value\nPercentage of CPI Components < +2% in Last Year\n= Date of First Fed Rate Cut\n57%\n1998\n1995 2007\n2001\nRampant Inflation\nNot Shown on Chart: Greenspan Cutting Rates in 1989\nSources: Refinitiv, BLS, as of August 2024, using 19 to 21 of the largest line items in the CPI report, depending on inception date.\n4\nFor the pessimistically inclined reader, here is a grizzly chart. With manufacturing struggling, the market’s\neconomic soft landing thesis rests on the ISM Services PMI keeping its head above water. Historically, Fed rate\ncuts have given no such assurance, at least as far as the three 21st century cycles are concerned (figure 4).\nFigure 4: Fed Funds vs. ISM Services PMI\n8%\n7%\n6%\n5%\n4% 5.00%\n3%\n2%\n1%\n0% 70\n65\n60\n55\n50\n45\n40\n35\nSources: Refinitiv, ISM, as of August 2024. The current Fed Funds Rate is the upper bound of a 4.75%–5.00% range, as of 9/20/2024.\nFor the cautious, bearish or concerned reader (I’ll discuss the optimistically inclined Funds later), it may be\nof interest to see which mandates held up during the ugly 2022 action, when the market declined 24.5% from\nJanuary 3 to October 12 (figure 5). DLN, the value fund, really shined in that period. That is because it watched in\nfutility in 2021 as its dividend screens largely ignored stay-at-home stocks, COVID-19 themes and the like. When\nthe floor dropped out from underneath that stuff in 2022, DLN outperformed the S&P 500 by about 1,000 bps. Our\nblend Fund, DGRW, saved nearly nine percentage points relative to the S&P in that down market.\nFigure 5: Looking at the Funds During the 2022 Bear\nTicker 1/3/22 - 10/12/22 Return (%) Category\nQGRW Wasn't Launched Yet Growth\nDLN -14.3% Value\nDGRW -15.7% Blend\nS&P 500 -24.5% Blend\nWisdomTree.com/investments\n3991 5991 7991 9991 1002 3002 5002 7002 9002 1102 3102 5102 7102 9102 1202 3202 5202\n= First Rate Cut\nFed Funds Target Rate\n(Left Scale)\nISM Services PMI\nSurvey (Right Scale)\nBegan\n51.5% in 1997\nSource: WisdomTree PATH Software.

The hedge fund Long Term Capital Management was blowing up, threatening\nsystemic risk due to its severe leverage. Rate cuts lubricated the system’s gears, perpetuating the market’s bull\nrun, which had been in fast and furious mode since the end of the Gulf War at the beginning of that decade. The\nS&P 500 made its peak in August 2000. Figure 6 shows the S&P 500 trouncing long-term bonds after Greenspan’s\n1998 rate cuts.\nFigure 6: Stocks Relative to 30-Year Treasuries\n7%\n6%\n5%\n4%\n3%\n2%\n1%\n0% 5.5\n5.0\n4.5\n4.0\n3.5\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\nSource: Refinitiv, as of 9/20/24. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. You cannot invest directly in a market index.\nHowever, the three cycles after that one had no such luck. Greenspan’s next attempt at a magic trick commenced\nin the opening days of January 2001. It didn’t work. The bear market that had started in 2000 would ultimately\npersist to October 2002.\nThe next policy easing was former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke’s attempt to stem severe losses in the 2007–2009\npanic. That didn’t work either.\nFinally, we will never know the alternate history of 2019–2020, where lockdowns never happened. The market\ntanked from February to March 2020, just months after Jay Powell’s 2019 rate cuts.\nI’ve never been sure how to treat 2020 in the context of Powell’s 2019 actions, but the fact is the Fed did cut rates\nand the stock market did tank a little while afterward. We have to mark it as three in a row.\nWisdomTree.com/investments\n4991 6991 8991 0002 2002 4002 6002 8002 0102 2102 4102 6102 8102 0202 2202 4202 6202\nFed Funds Rate\n(Left Scale)\nGreen Line UP: Stocks Beating Bonds\nRed Line DOWN: Bonds Beating Stocks\nS&P 500 vs. 30-Year Treasury\n(Total Return, Right Scale)\n12/31/1994 = 1.0\n6\nSECTORS\nThe historic record for sector rotation is a mixed bag.\nThere have been eleven clearly identifiable “first rate cut” dates since the Ford administration (figure 7). In eight\nof those, Consumer Discretionary and Health Care beat the broad market over the subsequent 12 months.\nOf the poor performers, Telecom shows up as having a notoriously awful track record after the Fed’s first cut.\nHowever, that sector deserves two asterisks. Firstly, it was part of the notorious “TMT” bubble—Tech, Media and\nTelecom—at the turn of the century, so maybe we should draw a line through both the post-1998 mania and also\nthe 2001 collapse.\nThe second asterisk is the evolution of that sector itself. In 2018, Standard & Poor’s added social media and gaming\ncompanies to the old Telecom basket, renaming it Communication Services. Now the sector is a hodgepodge of\nphone companies, video games and dopamine spikes. Keep that in mind as you review the historic record.\nFigure 7: Total Return, 12 Months after First Fed Rate Cut\nDate of\nU.S. Total Basic Consumer Consumer\nFirst Rate Cut Financials Industrials Technology Energy Health Care Telecom Utilities Real Estate\nMarket Materials Discretionary Staples\nof the Cycle\n11/19/74 38.5% 27.6% 40.8% 29.5% 47.2% 53.6% 49.1% 30.2% 31.4% 21.0% 42.4% 102.6%\n5/15/80 25.9% 30.9% 39.1% 25.2% 34.3% 31.2% 21.1% 21.3% 27.6% 20.4% 7.4% 57.3%\n11/17/81 27.3% 28.4% 30.1% 55.8% 19.2% 53.4% 39.3% -10.6% 34.7% 14.1% 23.2% 50.7%\n7/15/82 53.9% 79.9% 60.9% 90.0% 68.4% 67.3% 36.6% 43.9% 35.1% 35.1% 31.9% 101.9%\n10/10/84 18.3% 34.1% 14.3% 1.3% 16.9% 14.7% 26.6% 10.5% 29.8% 23.6% 22.7% 29.5%\n7/13/90 12.3% 16.5% 2.8% -3.6% 13.6% 9.6% 21.1% 4.9% 24.1% 2.5% 12.2% -6.0%\n7/6/95 23.1% 25.2% 28.9% 14.2% 7.6% 16.7% 31.3% 27.6% 32.9% 20.4% 14.3% 22.6%\n9/29/98 22.1% 8.6% 41.6% 73.8% 6.4% 26.4% -4.7% 11.6% -0.8% 41.0% -2.6% -8.0%\n1/3/01 -11.5% -8.7% -9.8% -29.2% 4.1% -1.1% 0.1% -8.1% -5.6% -20.5% -20.3% 9.4%\n9/18/07 -17.0% -32.7% -18.0% -18.8% -7.9% -12.9% -0.6% -11.4% -8.0% -30.1% -13.2% -9.6%\n8/1/19 13.6% -11.5% 3.5% 44.3% 7.6% 23.9% 6.3% -36.4% 22.0% 13.6% 1.2% -3.4%\nMedian 22.1% 25.2% 28.9% 25.2% 13.6% 23.9% 21.1% 10.5% 27.6% 20.4% 12.2% 22.6%\nAverage 18.8% 18.0% 21.3% 25.7% 19.8% 25.7% 20.6% 7.6% 20.3% 12.8% 10.8% 31.5%\n% Time Sector\n64% 64% 36% 55% 73% 64% 27% 73% 27% 27% 64%\nOutperformed\nSource: Refinitiv, using Datastream total return aggregates, 12/31/1973–8/30/2024.\nThe other poorly performing sector is Utilities, which only outperformed in the 12 months after the first cut in\nthree of the 11 cycles.\nOf note for this cycle: many investors are treating Utilities as a backdoor play on artificial intelligence (AI) due to\nthe gobbling of electricity by data centers. That makes it a bit of a special situation in this cycle.\nWisdomTree.com/investments\n7\nEarlier this summer, Utilities’ relative performance appeared tied at the hip with interest rates.

The gross expense ratio for each fund is: DGRW, 0.28%; DLN,\n0.28%; and QGRW, 0.28%.\nIn summary, it looks like the market wants to reward stocks of all stripes, as was the case in a couple of the 1990s\nrate cutting cycles. However, the cycles of this century have a poor track record for stock market performance in\nthe months (and sometimes years) after the Fed’s first set of cuts. In other words, the Fed waited too long in 2001,\n2007 and 2019, so we respect the argument that maybe they made the same mistake this time around too.\nA DLN-QGRW barbell may be an opportune approach, as the former has developed a reputation for downside\nresilience. That could pay off if it turns out the Fed has in fact goofed things up. The latter, QGRW, has been our big\nwinner in the post-2022 bull market, stacked as it is with Magnificent 7 members. Combining the two makes for a\nmix that scores highly on profitability metrics, which I suspect will be of utmost importance if the market catches\nan adverse economic surprise.\nWisdomTree.com/investments\n9\nPlease see the WisdomTree Glossary for definitions of terms.\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION\nInvestors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund before investing. For\na prospectus or, if available, the summary prospectus containing this and other important information about the Fund, call\n866.909.9473 or visit WisdomTree.com/investments. Read the prospectus or, if available, the summary prospectus carefully\nbefore investing.\nThere are risks associated with investing, including the possible loss of principal.\nDLN, DGRW: Funds focusing their investments on certain sectors increase their vulnerability to any single economic or regulatory\ndevelopment. This may result in greater share price volatility. Dividends are not guaranteed, and a company currently paying dividends\nmay cease paying dividends at any time.\nQGRW: Growth stocks, as a group, may be out of favor with the market and underperform value stocks or the overall equity market. Growth\nstocks are generally more sensitive to market movements than other types of stocks. The Fund is non-diversified, as a result, changes in the\nmarket value of a single security could cause greater fluctuations in the value of Fund shares than would occur in a diversified fund. The\nFund invests in the securities included in, or representative of, its Index regardless of their investment merit. The Fund does not attempt\nto outperform its Index or take defensive positions in declining markets and the Index may not perform as intended.\nUSIN: Because the Fund is new, it has limited performance history. U.S. Treasury obligations may provide relatively lower returns than\nthose of other securities. Changes to the financial condition or credit rating of the U.S. government may cause the value to decline. Fixed\nincome securities are subject to interest rate, credit, inflation, and reinvestment risks. Generally, as interest rates rise, the value of fixed\nincome securities falls.\nPlease read each Fund’s prospectus for specific details regarding each Fund’s risk profile.\nYou cannot invest directly in an index.\nThe Global Industry Classification Standard (“GICS”) was developed by and is the exclusive property and a service mark of MSCI Inc.

Read the prospectus or, if available, the summary prospectus carefully before investing.There are risks associated with investing, including the possible loss of principal.\n\nThis material contains the opinions of the authors, which are subject to change. There is no guarantee that any strategies discussed will work under all market conditions. This material represents an assessment of the market environment at a specific time and is not intended to be a forecast of future events or a guarantee of future results. \n\nImportant Risk Information\n\nThere are risks associated with investing, including the possible loss of principal. \n\nQGRW: Growth stocks, as a group, may be out of favor with the market and underperform value stocks or the overall equity market. Growth stocks are generally more sensitive to market movements than other types of stocks. The Fund is non-diversified, as a result, changes in the market value of a single security could cause greater fluctuations in the value of Fund shares than would occur in a diversified fund. The Fund invests in the securities included in, or representative of, its Index regardless of their investment merit. The Fund does not attempt to outperform its Index or take defensive positions in declining markets and the Index may not perform as intended.\n\nIHDG: Foreign investing involves special risks, such as risk of loss from currency fluctuation or political or economic uncertainty. To the extent the Fund invests a significant portion of its assets in the securities of companies of a single country or region, it is likely to be impacted by the events or conditions affecting that country or region. Dividends are not guaranteed and a company currently paying dividends may cease paying dividends at any time. Investments in currency involve additional special risks, such as credit risk and interest rate fluctuations. Derivative investments can be volatile and these investments may be less liquid than other securities, and more sensitive to the effect of varied economic conditions. As this Fund can have a high concentration in some issuers, the Fund can be adversely impacted by changes affecting those issuers. The Fund invests in the securities included in, or representative of, its Index regardless of their investment merit and the Fund does not attempt to outperform its Index or take defensive positions in declining markets. Due to the investment strategy of this Fund it may make higher capital gain distributions than other ETFs.\n\nDGRW, DGRS: Funds focusing their investments on certain sectors increase their vulnerability to any single economic or regulatory development. This may result in greater share price volatility. Dividends are not guaranteed and a company’s future abilities to pay dividends may be limited. A company currently paying dividends may cease paying dividends at any time.\n\nDXJ: Foreign investing involves special risks, such as risk of loss from currency fluctuation or political or economic uncertainty. The Fund focuses its investments in Japan, thereby increasing the impact of events and developments in Japan that can adversely affect performance. Investments in currency involve additional special risks, such as credit risk, interest rate fluctuations, derivative investments which can be volatile and may be less liquid than other securities, and more sensitive to the effect of varied economic conditions. As this Fund can have a high concentration in some issuers, the Fund can be adversely impacted by changes affecting those issuers. Due to the investment strategy of this Fund it may make higher capital gain distributions than other ETFs. Dividends are not guaranteed, and a company currently paying dividends may cease paying dividends at any time.\n\nEPI: Foreign investing involves special risks, such as risk of loss from currency fluctuation or political or economic uncertainty. This Fund focuses its investments in India, thereby increasing the impact of events and developments associated with the region which can adversely affect performance. Investments in emerging, offshore or frontier markets such as India are generally less liquid and less efficient than investments in developed markets and are subject to additional risks, such as risks of adverse governmental regulation and intervention or political developments. As this Fund has a high concentration in some sectors, the Fund can be adversely affected by changes in those sectors. Due to the investment strategy of this Fund it may make higher capital gain distributions than other ETFs.\n\nUSFR: Securities with floating rates can be less sensitive to interest rate changes than securities with fixed interest rates, but may decline in value. Fixed income securities will normally decline in value as interest rates rise. The value of an investment in the Fund may change quickly and without warning in response to issuer or counterparty defaults and changes in the credit ratings of the Fund's portfolio investments. Due to the investment strategy of this Fund it may make higher capital gain distributions than other ETFs.\n\nAGGY: Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk; their value will normally decline as interest rates rise. Fixed income investments are also subject to credit risk, the risk that the issuer of a bond will fail to pay interest and principal in a timely manner, or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Investing in mortgage- and asset-backed securities involves interest rate, credit, valuation, extension and liquidity risks and the risk that payments on the underlying assets are delayed, prepaid, subordinated or defaulted on. Due to the investment strategy of the Fund, it may make higher capital gain distributions than other ETFs.\n\nWTBN: Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk; their value will normally decline as interest rates rise. Fixed income investments are also subject to credit risk, the risk that the issuer of a bond will fail to pay interest and principal in a timely manner, or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. While the Fund attempts to limit credit and counterparty exposure, the value of an investment in the Fund may change quickly and without warning in response to issuer or counterparty defaults and changes in the credit ratings of the Fund’s portfolio investments. The Fund invests in the securities included in, or representative of, its Index regardless of their investment merit, and the Fund does not attempt to outperform its Index or take defensive positions in declining markets.\n\nMTGP: Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk; their value will normally decline as interest rates rise. In addition, when interest rates fall income may decline. Fixed income investments are also subject to credit risk, the risk that the issuer of an investment will fail to pay interest and principal in a timely manner, or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that investment to decline. Investing in mortgage- and asset-backed securities involves interest rate, credit, valuation, extension and liquidity risks and the risk that payments on the underlying assets are delayed, prepaid, subordinated or defaulted on. Liquidity risk may result from the lack of an active market, reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants to make a market in fixed income securities, and may be magnified in a rising interest rate environment and/or with respect to particular types of securities, such as securitized credit securities. Non-agency and other securitized debt are subject to heightened risks as compared to agency-backed securities. High yield or “junk” bonds have lower credit ratings and involve a greater risk to principal. Derivative investments can be volatile and these investments may be less liquid than other securities, and more sensitive to the effects of varied economic conditions. Unlike typical exchange-traded funds, the Fund is actively managed using proprietary investment strategies and processes and there can be no guarantee that these strategies and processes will be successful or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Due to the investment strategy of the Fund, it may make higher capital gain distributions than other ETFs.\n\nHYIN: The Fund invests in alternative credit sectors through investments in underlying closed-end investment companies (“CEFs”), including those that have elected to be regulated as business development companies (“BDCs”), and real estate investment trusts (“REITs”). The value of a CEF can decrease due to movements in the overall financial markets. BDCs generally invest in less mature private companies, which involve greater risk than well-established, publicly traded companies and are subject to high failure rates among the companies in which they invest. By investing in REITs, the Fund is exposed to the risks of owning real estate, such as decreases in real estate values, overbuilding, increased competition and other risks related to local or general economic conditions. The Fund invests in the securities included in, or representative of, its Index regardless of their investment merit, and the Fund does not attempt to outperform its Index or take defensive positions in declining markets.\n\nPlease read each Funds’ prospectus for specific details regarding the Funds’ risk profiles.\n\nWisdomTree Funds are distributed by Foreside Fund Services, LLC.\n\n© 2024 WisdomTree, Inc. “WisdomTree” is a registered mark of WisdomTree, Inc. \n"
