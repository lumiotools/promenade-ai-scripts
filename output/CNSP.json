(NASDAQ:CNSP)](https://pr.report/4i0z) (\"CNS\" or the \"Company\"), a biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of novel treatments for primary and metastatic cancers in the brain and central nervous system, today announced the presentation of updated results from the on-going potentially pivotal study evaluating [Berubicin](https://pr.report/4i10), the Company's novel anthracycline and the first anthracycline to appear to cross the blood-brain barrier, in a randomized, controlled study vs. Lomustine, which has been considered to be a standard of care in this recurrent glioblastoma population. This was a poster presentation at the [29th Annual Meeting of the Society for Neuro-Oncology](https://pr.report/4i11) held November 21-24, 2024 in Houston, TX.\n\nThe poster titled, \"Update on a Potentially Pivotal Trial CNS-201: A Randomized, Controlled Trial of Berubicin Vs. Lomustine After First-Line Therapy for Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM),\" was presented bySandra Silberman, MD, PhD, Chief Medical Officer of CNS Pharmaceuticals. The presented poster is now available on the [Company's website](https://pr.report/4i12). The data presented at the SNO Annual Meeting include comparative demographics, disposition of patients, MGMT promoter methylation status and safety, showing that the balance between the randomized arms has been maintained through enrollment of 239 patients into the study.\n\n\"Berubicin is being evaluated to demonstrate its potential to provide a much needed clinical benefit for GBM patients. Our team continues to make progress advancing this important clinical program toward the finish line and we look forward to reporting the primary data analysis in the first half of 2025,\" commented Dr. Silberman.\n\nSummary of Updated Results from the Potentially Pivotal Study:\n\nAll patients enrolled show comparable demographics within each arm, including age, gender, race, BSA, and KPS. In addition, patients with unmethylated MGMT comprise approximately 40% in both arms, allowing for a reasonable comparison of efficacy irrespective of the methylation status.\n\nThere is a slightly greater percentage of patients on the Berubicin arm compared to the Lomustine arm that have completed the study (84.7% vs. 78.9%), but a greater percentage of patients on the Lomustine arm have withdrawn from the study (11.0% vs. 19.7%), the most common reasons being patient preference (4.9% vs. 9.2%) and death (1.2% vs. 5.3%).\n\nAll grades of any reported adverse events and those of Grade 3-5 in severity occurring in more than 10% of patients are shown to be relatively similar in the Berubicin and Lomustine arms. A slightly greater percentage of patients with all grades or Grades 3-5 with anaemia, headache, and decrease in neutrophil counts were shown in patients receiving Berubicin, while a significantly greater percentage of patients with a decrease in platelet counts and thrombocytopenia occurred in patients receiving Lomustine.\n\nThe primary endpoint of the study is Overall Survival (OS), a rigorous endpoint the FDA has recognized as the basis for approval of oncology drugs when a statistically significant improvement can be shown relative to a randomized control arm.\n\nAs previously announced in April 2024, the Company completed enrollment with 252 patients in this study evaluating Berubicin vs. Lomustine for the treatment of GBM. In December 2023, the Company announced the successful completion of its pre-planned interim futility analysis of efficacy and safety and received a recommendation from the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) to continue the study without modification.\n\nCNS Pharmaceuticals expects to report primary analysis data from its potentially pivotal study of Berubicin in the first half of 2025. For more information about this trial, visit [clinicaltrials.gov](https://pr.report/4i13) and reference identifier NCT04762069.\n\nThe FDA has granted CNS Pharmaceuticals Fast Track Designation for Berubicin, which enables more frequent interactions with the agency for guidance on expediting the development and review process. Additionally, the Company has received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for using Berubicin to treat malignant glioma, which may provide seven years of marketing exclusivity upon approval of a New Drug Application (NDA).\n\nAbout Berubicin\n\nBerubicin is an anthracycline, a class of anticancer agents that are among the most powerful chemotherapy drugs and effective against more types of cancer than any other class of chemotherapeutic agents. Anthracyclines are designed to utilize natural processes to induce deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage in targeted cancer cells by interfering with the action of topoisomerase II, a critical enzyme enabling cell proliferation. Berubicin treatment of brain cancer patients appeared to demonstrate positive responses that include one durable complete response in a Phase 1 human clinical trial conducted by Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Berubicin was developed by Dr. Waldemar Priebe, Professor of Medicinal Chemistry at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.\n\nAbout CNS Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nCNS Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing a pipeline of anti-cancer drug candidates for the treatment of primary and metastatic cancers of the brain and central nervous system.\n\nThe Company's lead drug candidate, Berubicin, is a novel anthracycline and the first anthracycline to appear to cross the blood-brain barrier. Berubicin is currently in development for the treatment of a number of serious brain and CNS oncology indications including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), an aggressive and incurable form of brain cancer.\n\nThe Company's second drug candidate, TPI 287, is an abeotaxane which stabilizes microtubules and inhibits cell division, causing apoptosis and cell death. Similar to Berubicin, TPI 287 has shown the potential to cross the blood-brain barrier and treat CNS tumors. TPI 287 has been well tolerated in over 350 patients to date, including in clinical trials as a monotherapy and in combination with bevacizumab for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma, neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma, as well as refractory prostate cancer and melanoma, and in tauopathy disease, which can result in dementia.\n\nFor more information, please visit [www.CNSPharma.com](https://pr.report/4i14), and connect with the Company on [X](https://pr.report/4i15), [Facebook](https://pr.report/4i16), and[ LinkedIn](https://pr.report/4i17).\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nSome of the statements in this press release are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which involve risks and uncertainties.

(“we”, “our”, the “Company”) is a clinical pharmaceutical company organized as a Nevada corporation on July 27, 2017 to focus on the development of anti-cancer drug candidates.\n\nOn August 25, 2022, the stockholders of the Company approved an amendment to the Company’s amended and restated articles of incorporation (the “Amendment”) to effect the reverse stock split at a ratio in the range of 1-for-2 to 1-for-30. The reverse stock split became effective on November 28, 2022 on a 1-for-30 basis without any change in the par value per share, which remained at $0.001. The reverse stock split has been retroactively adjusted throughout these financial statements and footnotes.\n\nOn April 30, 2024, the stockholders of the Company approved an amendment to the Company’s amended and restated articles of incorporation (the “Amendment”) to effect the reverse stock split at a ratio in the range of 1-for-2 to 1-for-50. The reverse stock split became effective on June 4, 2024 on a 1-for-50 basis without any change in the par value per share, which remained at $0.001. The reverse stock split has been retroactively adjusted throughout these financial statements and footnotes.\n\n**Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**\n\n**Basis of Presentation **- The accompanying unaudited financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Stated of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim unaudited financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. The unaudited financial statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary in order to make the condensed financial statements not misleading. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the final results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. For more complete financial information, these unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2023 included in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024 (“Form 10-K”). Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal period, as reported in the Form 10-K, have been omitted.\n\n**Liquidity and Going Concern -** These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the ability of the Company to obtain equity financings to continue operations. The Company has a history of and expects to continue to report negative cash flows from operations and a net loss. Management believes that the cash on hand is sufficient to fund its planned operations into but not beyond the near term. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company may seek additional funding through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, government or other third-party funding, commercialization, marketing and distribution arrangements, other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements and delay planned cash outlays or a combination thereof. Management cannot be certain that such events or a combination thereof can be achieved.\n\n7  \n---  \n  \n**Cash and Cash Equivalents -** The Company considers all highly liquid accounts with original maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents. Periodically, the Company may carry cash balances at financial institutions in excess of the federally insured limit of $250,000.

As of December 31, 2021, the Company has received reports of the WPD expenditures related to this agreement, has conducted due inquiry into validating those expenditures, and has determined that WPD has exercised commercially reasonable development efforts and has therefore fulfilled the terms of the agreement necessary to secure their rights under the sublicense in perpetuity subject to the ongoing obligations of the sublicense. In consideration for the rights granted under the sublicense agreement, to the extent we are required to make any payments to HPI pursuant to the HPI License as a result of this sublicense agreement, WPD agreed to advance us such payments, and to pay us a royalty equal to 1% of such payments. WPD is a Polish corporation that is majority-owned by an entity controlled by Dr. Priebe, our founder.\n\nOn August 31, 2018, the Company entered into a sublicense agreement with Animal Life Sciences, LLC (“ALI”), pursuant to which we granted ALI an exclusive sublicense, even as to us, for the patent rights we licensed pursuant to the HPI License solely for the treatment of cancer in non-human animals through any type of administration. In consideration for the rights granted under the sublicense agreement, ALI agreed to issue us membership interests in ALI equal to 1.52% of the outstanding ALI membership interests. As additional consideration for the rights granted, to the extent we are required to make any payments to HPI pursuant to the HPI License as a result of this sublicense agreement, ALI agreed to advance us such payments, and to pay us a royalty equal to 1% of such payments. Dr. Waldemar Priebe, our founder, is also the founder of ALI.\n\n15  \n---  \n  \nOn June 10, 2020, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation (“ODD”) for Berubicin for the treatment of malignant gliomas. ODD from the FDA is available for drugs targeting diseases with less than 200,000 cases per year. ODD may enable market exclusivity of 7 years from the date of approval of an NDA in the United States. During that period the FDA generally could not approve another product containing the same drug for the same designated indication. Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same active ingredient for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. The ODD now constitutes our primary intellectual property protections although the Company is exploring if there are other patents that could be filed related to Berubicin to extend additional protections.\n\nOn July 24, 2021, the Company received Fast Track Designation from the FDA for Berubicin. Fast Track Designation is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need.\n\n**_WP1244 Portfolio_**\n\nOn January 10, 2020, Company entered into a Patent and Technology License Agreement (the “WP1244 Agreement”) with The Board of Regents of The University of Texas System, an agency of the State of Texas, on behalf of The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (“UTMDACC”). Pursuant to the WP1244 Agreement, the Company obtained a royalty-bearing, worldwide, exclusive license to certain intellectual property rights, including patent rights, related to the Company’s recently announced WP1244 drug technology. In consideration, the Company must make payments to UTMDACC including an up-front license fee, annual maintenance fee, milestone payments and royalty payments (including minimum annual royalties) on sales of licensed products developed under the WP1244 Agreement. The term of the WP1244 Agreement expires on the last to occur of: (a) the expiration of all patents subject to the WP1244 Agreement, or (b) fifteen years after execution; provided that UTMDACC has the right to terminate this WP1244 Agreement in the event that the Company fails to meet certain commercial diligence milestones. The commercial diligence milestones are as follows (i) initiated PC toxicology to support filing of Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) or New Drug Application (“NDA”) for the Licensed Product within the eighteen (18) month period following the Effective Date (ii) file and IND for the Licensed Product within three (3) year period following the Effective Date and (iii) Commencement of Phase I Study within the five (5) year period following the Effective Date. The Company has not met the commercial diligence milestones and has not paid the annual maintenance fee required as of the date hereof. On April 25, 2024, UTMDACC provided notice to the Company of its intent to terminate the WP1244 Agreement if the Company fails to pay the annual maintenance fee of $50,000, as well as $1,300 in expenses. On May 25, 2024 the WP1244 Agreement was terminated. There are no termination penalty provisions in the Agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company paid $52,537 and $45,092, respectively.\n\n**_Nasdaq Capital Markets Listing Qualifications_**\n\nOn September 12, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Staff of Nasdaq notifying the Company that for the previous 30 consecutive business days the Company’s common stock had not maintained a closing bid price of $1.00 per share (the “Minimum Bid Price Requirement”) required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). Normally, a company would be afforded a 180-calendar day period to demonstrate compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. However, pursuant to Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(iv), the Company is not eligible for any compliance period specified in Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) because the Company effected one or more reverse stock splits over the prior two-year period with a cumulative ratio of 250 shares or more to one.\n\nThe Company requested a hearing before a Hearings Panel (the “Panel”), but prior to such hearing, on October 30, 2024 the Panel provided the Company a temporary exception to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement until March 11, 2025. The Panel noted that it reserves the right to reconsider the terms of this exception based on any event, condition or circumstance that exists or develops that would, in the opinion of the Panel, make continued listing of the Company’s securities on Nasdaq inadvisable or unwarranted. The Panel notification advised the Company that the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council may, on its own motion, determine to review any Panel decision within 45 calendar days after issuance of the written decision. If the Listing Council determines to review the Panel’s decision in the Company’s matter, it may affirm, modify, reverse, dismiss or remand the decision to the Panel.\n\n16  \n---  \n  \n**Note 6 – Subsequent Events**\n\nOn October 23, 2024, the Company entered into a placement agency agreement (the “Placement Agency Agreement”) with A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners (the “Placement Agent”) in connection with the sale by the Company of: (i) 3,700,000 shares (the “Shares”) of the Company’s common stock, and (ii) pre-funded warrants to purchase 13,947,060 shares of common stock (the “Pre-Funded Warrants”), in a registered direct offering (the “Offering”). The per share purchase price of each share of common stock was $0.17 per share and the purchase price for each Pre-Funded Warrant was $0.169 per Pre-Funded Warrant. In connection with the Offering, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with certain institutional investors that participated in the Offering. The gross proceeds to the Company from the Offering were approximately $3.0 million, before deducting the Placement Agent fees and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company.\n\nPursuant to the terms of the AGP ATM Sales Agreement, the Company originally was permitted to sell from time to time through AGP, as sales agent or principal, shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share with initial aggregate sales price of up to $5.2 million. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company has sold 6,393,243 Shares pursuant to the Agreement for net proceeds of approximately $1.6 million.\n\nSubsequent to September 30, 2024, a total of 13,947,060 Warrants (exercisable into one share of common stock at a price per share of $0.001) were exercised by investors.\n\n17  \n---  \n  \n**ITEM 2.** | **MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**  \n---|---  \n  \n_You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.

(“HPI”) and The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (“UTMDACC”) and own pursuant to a collaboration and asset purchase agreement with Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Reata”).\n\n19  \n---  \n  \nWe believe our lead drug candidate, Berubicin, may be a significant development in the treatment of Glioblastoma and other CNS malignancies, and if approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), could give Glioblastoma patients an important new therapeutic alternative to the current standard of care. Glioblastomas are tumors that arise from astrocytes, which are star-shaped cells making up the supportive tissue of the brain. These tumors are usually highly malignant (cancerous) because the cells reproduce quickly, and they are supported by a large network of blood vessels. Berubicin is an anthracycline, which is a class of drugs that are among the most powerful and extensively used chemotherapy drugs known. Based on limited clinical data, we believe Berubicin is the first anthracycline that appears to cross the blood brain barrier (“BBB”) in significant concentrations targeting brain cancer cells. While our focus is currently on the development of Berubicin, we are also in the process of attempting to secure intellectual property rights to additional compounds that we plan to develop into drugs to treat CNS and other cancers.\n\nBerubicin was discovered at UTMDACC by Dr. Waldemar Priebe, the founder of the Company. Through a series of transactions, Berubicin was initially licensed to Reata. Reata initiated several Phase I clinical trials with Berubicin for CNS malignancies, one of which was for malignant gliomas, but subsequently allowed their IND with the FDA to lapse for strategic reasons. This required us to obtain a new IND for Berubicin before beginning further clinical trials. On December 17, 2020, we announced that our IND application with the FDA for Berubicin for the treatment of Glioblastoma Multiforme was in effect. We initiated this trial for patient enrollment during the second quarter of 2021 with the first patient dosed during the third quarter of 2021 to investigate the safety and efficacy of Berubicin in adults with Glioblastoma Multiforme who have failed first-line therapy. The first patient on the trial was treated during the third quarter of 2021. Correspondence between the Company and the FDA resulted in modifications to our initial trial design, including designating overall survival (OS) as the primary endpoint of the study. OS is a rigorous endpoint that the FDA has recognized as a basis for approval of oncology drugs when a statistically significant improvement can be shown relative to a randomized control arm. \n\nThe current trial being conducted will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Berubicin in patients with Glioblastoma Multiforme who have failed primary treatment for their disease, and results will be compared to the safety and efficacy of Lomustine, a current standard of care in this setting, with a 2 to 1 randomization of the 252 patients to Berubicin or Lomustine. Patients receiving Berubicin are administered a 2-hour IV infusion of 7.5 mg/m2 berubicin hydrochloride daily for three consecutive days followed by 18 days off (a 21-day cycle). Lomustine is administered orally once every six weeks. The trial design included a pre-planned, non-binding interim futility analysis. We reached the criteria required by the study protocol to conduct this interim futility analysis, which an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (“DSMB”) is responsible for conducting. The DSMB’s charter mandated that they review the primary endpoint, Overall Survival, as well as secondary endpoints and safety data to determine whether the efficacy data for the risk-benefit profile warrants modification or discontinuation of the study. On December 18, 2023, we released the DSMB’s recommendation which was to continue the study without modification. Management remains blinded to the data underlying the recommendation of the DSMB. Even if Berubicin is approved, there is no assurance that patients will choose an infusion treatment, as compared to the current standard of care, which requires oral administration.\n\nWe do not have manufacturing facilities and all manufacturing activities are contracted out to third parties. Additionally, we do not have a sales organization.\n\nOn November 21, 2017, we entered into a Collaboration and Asset Purchase Agreement with Reata (the “Reata Agreement”). Pursuant to the Reata Agreement we purchased all of Reata’s intellectual property and development data regarding Berubicin, including all trade secrets, knowhow, confidential information and other intellectual property rights.\n\nOn December 28, 2017, we obtained the rights to a worldwide, exclusive royalty-bearing, license to the chemical compound commonly known as Berubicin from HPI in an agreement we refer to as the HPI License. HPI is affiliated with Dr. Priebe, who controls a majority of our shares. Under the HPI License we obtained the exclusive right to develop certain chemical compounds for use in the treatment of cancer anywhere in the world. In the HPI License we agreed to pay HPI: (i) development fees of $750,000 over a three-year period beginning November 2019; (ii) a 2% royalty on net sales; (iii) a $50,000 per year license fee; (iv) milestone payments of $100,000 upon the commencement of a Phase II trial and $1.0 million upon the approval of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) for Berubicin; and (v) 134 shares of our common stock. The patents we licensed from HPI expired in March 2020. On May 14, 2024, the Company provided notice to HPI of its intent to terminate the HPI License effective on or about July 14, 2024.\n\n20  \n---  \n  \nOn June 10, 2020, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation (“ODD”) for Berubicin for the treatment of malignant gliomas. ODD from the FDA is available for drugs targeting diseases with less than 200,000 cases per year. ODD may enable market exclusivity of 7 years from the date of approval of a NDA in the United States. During that period the FDA generally could not approve another product containing the same drug for the same designated indication. Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same active ingredient for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. The ODD now constitutes our primary intellectual property protections although the Company is exploring if there are other patents that could be filed related to Berubicin to extend additional protections.\n\nWe believe we have obtained all rights and intellectual property necessary to develop Berubicin. As stated earlier, it is our plan to obtain additional intellectual property covering other compounds which, subject to the receipt of additional financing, may be developed into drugs for brain and other cancers.\n\nOn January 10, 2020, we entered into a Patent and Technology License Agreement (the “WP1244 Agreement”) with The Board of Regents of The University of Texas System, an agency of the State of Texas, on behalf of the UTMDACC. Pursuant to the WP1244 Agreement, we obtained a royalty-bearing, worldwide, exclusive license to certain intellectual property rights, including patent rights, related to our portfolio of WP1244 drug technology. On April 25, 2024, UTMDACC provided notice to us if its intent to terminate the WP1244 Agreement if we fail to pay the annual maintenance fee of $50,000, as well as $1,300 in expenses. On May 25, 2024 the WP1244 Agreement was terminated. There are no termination penalty provisions in the Agreement.\n\n**Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023**\n\n_General and Administrative Expense_\n\nGeneral and administrative expense was approximately $1,384,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately $1,123,000 for the comparable period in 2023. The increase in general and administrative expense was mainly attributable to increases of approximately $269,000 in legal and professional expenses, $63,000 in stock- based compensation and $12,000 in other expenses, which were offset by decreases of approximately $60,000 in marketing , advertising expenses and $23,000 in insurance expense.\n\n_Research and Development Expense_\n\nResearch and development expense was approximately $4,245,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately $3,411,000 for the comparable period in 2023. The increase in research and development expenses during the period were mainly attributed to license expenses related to the Cortice Agreements entered during the quarter.\n\n_Net Loss_\n\nThe net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately $5,606,000 compared to approximately $4,523,000 for the comparable period in 2023. The change in net loss is attributable to an increase in CRO expenses related to continued progress with our potentially pivotal Phase II clinical trial of Berubicin, as well as increases in legal and professional fees and other expenses.\n\n21  \n---  \n  \n**Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023**\n\n_General and Administrative Expense_\n\nGeneral and administrative expense was approximately $3,910,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately $3,662,000 for the comparable period in 2023. The increase in general and administrative expense was mainly attributable to increases of approximately $449,000 in professional expenses and $11,000 in other expenses, which were offset by decreases of approximately $106,000 in marketing and advertising expense, $77,000 in insurance expense and $18,000 in travel expenses and $11,000 in stock- based compensation.\n\n_Research and Development Expense_\n\nResearch and development expense was approximately $7,792,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately $9,824,000 for the comparable period in 2023. The decrease in research and development expenses during the period were mainly attributed to the timing of research organization (CRO) expenses related to continued progress with our Phase II clinical trial. Our CRO expenditures are primarily for labor related to activating selected trial sites, managing patient enrollment processes, collecting and managing data from patient treatments throughout the trial, processing reimbursement to the sites for patient treatment, and assisting with necessary submissions to amend the IND. CRO expenditures are expected to continue to decline throughout the remainder of the trial as the final patients complete treatment and enter follow-up.\n\n_Net Loss_\n\nThe net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately $11,681,000 compared to approximately $13,476,000 for the comparable period in 2023. The change in net loss is attributable to a decrease in CRO expenses related to continued progress with our potentially pivotal Phase II clinical trial of Berubicin, as well as decreases in contract labor.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nOn September 30, 2024, we had cash of approximately $6,973,000 and we had a working capital of approximately $3,331,000. We fund our operations from proceeds from equity sales.\n\nOn January 29, 2024, we completed a public offering of (i) 44,314 shares of our common stock; (ii) pre-funded warrants to purchase 222,354 shares of common stock; (iii) Series A Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 266,667 shares of common stock; and (iv) Series B Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 266,667 shares of common stock. The combined purchase price of one share of common stock and accompanying Series A & B common warrants was $15 and the combined purchase price of one pre-funded warrant and accompanying Series A & B common warrants was $14.95 (with the pre-funded warrants having an exercise price of $0.001). The closing of the sales of these securities occurred on February 1, 2024. The gross proceeds from the offering were approximately $4.0 million, before deducting the placement agent’s fees and other offering expenses.\n\nOn June 14, 2024, we entered into agreements with institutional investors for the sale of 336,000 shares of our common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase 30,000 shares of common stock in lieu thereof (the “June 14 Pre-Funded Warrants”) in a registered direct offering. In a concurrent private placement, we also sold to the investors unregistered warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 366,000 shares of common stock (the “June 14 Common Warrants”). The combined purchase price of one share of common stock (or pre-funded warrant in lieu thereof) and accompanying June 14 Common Warrant was $3.75. The gross proceeds from the offering were approximately $1.37 million, resulting in net proceeds, after payment of commissions and expenses, received by us of $1,203,267.\n\n22  \n---  \n  \nOn June 26, 2024, we entered into agreements with institutional investors for the sale of 568,000 shares of our common stock in a registered direct offering. In a concurrent private placement, we also sold to the investors unregistered warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 568,000 shares of common stock (the “June 26 Common Warrants”). The combined purchase price of one share of common stock and accompanying June 26 Common Warrant was $2.45. The gross proceeds from the offering were approximately $1.39 million resulting in net proceeds, after payment of commissions and expenses, received by the Company of $1,221,146.\n\nOn July 26, 2024, the Company entered into a Sales Agreement (the “AGP ATM Sales Agreement”) with A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners (“AGP”). Pursuant to the terms of the AGP ATM Sales Agreement, the Company originally was permitted to sell from time to time through AGP, as sales agent or principal, shares of the Company’s common stock with initial aggregate sales price of up to $5.2 million. On July 30, 2024, the Company increased the aggregate sales price of common shares that may be sold under the AGP ATM Sales Agreement to $25.0 million (not including the original $5.2 million). As of September 30, 2024, the Company has sold 30,004,761 shares of common stock pursuant to the Agreement for net proceeds of approximately $10.6 million.\n\nOn October 23, 2024, the Company entered into a placement agency agreement (the “Placement Agency Agreement”) with A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners (the “Placement Agent”) in connection with the sale by the Company of: (i) 3,700,000 shares (the “Shares”) of the Company’s common stock, and (ii) pre-funded warrants to purchase 13,947,060 shares of common stock (the “Pre-Funded Warrants”), in a registered direct offering (the “Offering”). The per share purchase price of each share of common stock was $0.17 per share and the purchase price for each Pre-Funded Warrant was $0.169 per Pre-Funded Warrant. In connection with the Offering, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with certain institutional investors that participated in the Offering. The closing of the Offering occurred on October 24, 2024. The gross proceeds to the Company from the Offering were approximately $3.0 million, before deducting the Placement Agent fees and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company.\n\nPursuant to the terms of the AGP ATM Sales Agreement, the Company originally was permitted to sell from time to time through AGP, as sales agent or principal, shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share with initial aggregate sales price of up to $5.2 million. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company has sold 6,393,243 Shares pursuant to the Agreement for net proceeds of approximately $1.6 million.\n\nOur plan of operations is primarily focused on completing a clinical trial for Berubicin. Our current expectation is that our cash on hand as of the date of this filing is sufficient to fund our operations through the first quarter of 2025. We currently expect to release final top-line data for our potentially pivotal trial of Berubicin in the first half of 2025. If capital is available to fund TPI 287 clinical preparations and drug manufacturing for a potentially pivotal Phase 2 trial of TPI 287, we would need to raise an additional $4.0 million to support near-term development of that program. The timing and costs of clinical trials are difficult to predict and trial plans may change in response to evolving circumstances and as such the foregoing estimates may prove to be inaccurate. \n\n**Summary of Cash Flows**\n\n_Cash used in operating activities_\n\nNet cash used in operating activities was approximately $11,642,000 and $11,604,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and mainly included payments made for clinical trial preparation, officer compensation, insurance, marketing and professional fees to our consultants, attorneys and accountants. \n\n_Cash provided by financing activities_\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities was approximately $18,067,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, related to the sale of common stock and exercise of warrants, which were offset by the repayment of notes payable and payment of deferred offering costs. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $2,460,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, related to the sale of common stock and exercise of warrants, which were offset by the repayment of notes payable.\n\n23  \n---  \n  \n**Off-balance Sheet Arrangements**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\n\n**Purchase Commitments**\n\nWe do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures, although we are required to pay certain milestones fees to HPI, Reata and Cortice as described in the section “Overview” above.\n\n**JOBS Act Accounting Election**\n\nThe Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, exempts an “emerging growth company” such as us from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\n\n**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements, including the notes thereto. As a result, management is required to routinely make judgments and estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or assumptions. Management determined there were no critical accounting estimates.\n\n**Item 3.** | **Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk**  \n---|---  \n  \nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item.\n\n**Item 4.** | **Controls and Procedures**  \n---|---  \n  \n**Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting**\n\nWe maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that material information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer, who serves as our principal executive officer, and our chief financial officer, who serves as our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\n\n24  \n---  \n  \nUnder the supervision, and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness, as of September 30, 2024, of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nBased upon such evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were, and continue to be, ineffective because of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting due to lack of segregation of duties (resulting from the limited number of personnel available), limited access to timely and complete information regarding the status of costs incurred in the activation of investigational sites and costs from treating patients in our study which is a result of the use of a third-party Contract Research Organization (“CRO”) to manage the study, and the lack of formal documentation of our control environment. Management is commencing actions to address the lack of formal documentation of our control environment, although this will not address the lack of segregation of duties. Management is also working with the CRO to improve the timeliness and completeness of the data reported to the Company to address this material weakness, as well as conducting increased analytical analysis of such data to be performed by the Company.\n\nIn light of the material weakness described above, we continue to perform additional analysis and other post-closing procedures to ensure our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, we believe that the financial statements included in this report fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. Additional experienced personnel will be hired in the accounting and finance department, appropriate consultants will be retained, and our accounting system will be upgraded as soon as it becomes economically feasible and sustainable.\n\nOther than as described above, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent calendar quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n25  \n---  \n  \n**PART II - OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n**Item 1.** | **Legal Proceedings**  \n---|---  \n  \nFrom time to time in the ordinary course of our business, we may be involved in legal proceedings, the outcomes of which may not be determinable. The results of litigation are inherently unpredictable. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, require significant amounts of management time and result in diversion of significant resources. We are not able to estimate an aggregate amount or range of reasonably possible losses for those legal matters for which losses are not probable and estimable. We have insurance policies covering potential losses where such coverage is cost effective.\n\nWe are not at this time involved in any legal proceedings.\n\n**Item 1A.** | **Risk Factors**  \n---|---  \n  \nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors set forth below and discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC, which are incorporated herein by reference. The risks described in such reports are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.\n\n**If we are unable to maintain compliance with the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock may be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and could make it more difficult for shareholders to sell their shares.**\n\nOur common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, and we are therefore subject to its continued listing requirements, including requirements with respect to the market value of publicly-held shares, market value of listed shares, minimum bid price per share, and minimum stockholder's equity, among others, and requirements relating to board and committee independence. If we fail to satisfy one or more of the requirements, we may be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market.\n\nOn September 12, 2024, we received a letter from the Staff of Nasdaq notifying us that for the previous 30 consecutive business days our common stock had not maintained a closing bid price of $1.00 per share (the “Minimum Bid Price Requirement”) required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). Normally, a company would be afforded a 180-calendar day period to demonstrate compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. However, pursuant to Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(iv), we were not eligible for any compliance period specified in Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) because we effected one or more reverse stock splits over the prior two-year period with a cumulative ratio of 250 shares or more to one. We requested a hearing before a Hearings Panel (the “Panel”), but prior to such hearing, on October 30, 2024 the Panel provided us a temporary exception to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement until March 11, 2025. The Panel noted that it reserves the right to reconsider the terms of this exception based on any event, condition or circumstance that exists or develops that would, in the opinion of the Panel, make continued listing of our securities on Nasdaq inadvisable or unwarranted. The Panel notification advised us that the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council may, on its own motion, determine to review any Panel decision within 45 calendar days after issuance of the written decision. If the Listing Council determines to review the Panel’s decision in our matter, it may affirm, modify, reverse, dismiss or remand the decision to the Panel.\n\n26  \n---  \n  \nWe were previously not in compliance with the minimum $2,500,000 stockholders’ equity requirement for continued listing set forth in Listing Rule 5550(b) (the “Equity Requirement”). On September 10, 2024, we received a letter from the Nasdaq Office of General Counsel that we had demonstrated compliance with the Equity Requirement and that the matter is closed. According to the letter, pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(B), we are subject to a Mandatory Panel Monitor for a period of one year from the date of the letter. If, within that one-year monitoring period, the Staff finds us again out of compliance with the Equity Requirement, notwithstanding Listing Rule 5810(c)(2), we will not be permitted to provide the Staff with a plan of compliance with respect to that deficiency and Staff will not be permitted to grant additional time for us to regain compliance with respect to that deficiency, nor will we be afforded an applicable cure or compliance period pursuant to Listing Rule 5810(c)(3). Instead, Staff will issue a Delist Determination Letter and we will have an opportunity to request a new hearing with the initial Panel or a newly convened Hearings Panel if the initial Panel is unavailable. We will have the opportunity to respond/present to the Hearings Panel as provided by Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(C). Our common stock may be at that time delisted from Nasdaq.\n\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to meet the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market and could be subject to delisting at a future time. Delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market would adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing through the public or private sale of equity securities, may significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and may negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock. Delisting also could have other negative results, including the potential loss of employee confidence, the loss of institutional investors or interest in business development opportunities. \n\n**Item 2.** | **Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds**  \n---|---  \n  \nExcept as previously disclosed on Form 8-K, we have not issued any unregistered securities during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Item 3.** | **Defaults Upon Senior Securities**  \n---|---  \n  \nNone.\n\n**Item 4.** | **Mine Safety Disclosures**  \n---|---  \n  \nNot applicable.\n\n**Item 5.** | **Other Information**  \n---|---  \n  \nDuring the period covered by this Quarterly Report, none of the Company’s directors or executive officers has adopted or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (each as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).\n\n27  \n---  \n  \n**Item 6.** | **Exhibits**  \n---|---  \n  \n**INDEX TO EXHIBITS**\n\n**Exhibit** **Number** | **Description**  \n---|---  \n4.1 | [Form of Common Warrant issued in July 3, 2024 offering](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1729427/000168316824004667/cns_ex0401.htm) (incorporated by reference to exhibit 4.1 of the Form 8-K filed July 3, 2024)  \n4.2 | [Form of Pre-Funded Warrant](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1729427/000168316824007371/cns_ex0401.htm) (incorporated by reference to exhibit 4.1 of the Form 8-K filed October 24, 2024)  \n10.1 | [Financial Advisory Agreement dated July 3, 2024 by and among CNS Pharmaceuticals, Inc., A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1729427/000168316824004501/cns_ex1002.htm) (incorporated by reference to exhibit 10.2 of the Form 8-K filed June 26, 2024)  \n10.2 | [Form of Securities Purchase Agreement](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1729427/000168316824004667/cns_ex1001.htm) (incorporated by reference to exhibit 10.1 of the Form 8-K filed July 3, 2024)  \n10.3 | [Sales Agreement, dated July 26, 2024, by and between CNS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1729427/000168316824005070/cns_ex0101.htm) (incorporated by reference to exhibit 1.1 of the Form 8-K filed July 26, 2024)  \n10.4 | [Form of Waiver and Consent, dated July 26, 2024](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1729427/000168316824005070/cns_ex1001.htm) (incorporated by reference to exhibit 10.1 of the Form 8-K filed July 26, 2024)  \n10.5+ | [Exclusive License Agreement between CNS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Cortice Biosciences, Inc.](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1729427/000168316824005118/cns_ex1001.htm) (incorporated by reference to exhibit 10.1 of the Form 8-K filed July 30, 2024)  \n10.6 | [Stock Purchase Agreement between CNS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Cortice Biosciences, Inc.](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1729427/000168316824005118/cns_ex1002.htm) (incorporated by reference to exhibit 10.2 of the Form 8-K filed July 30, 2024)  \n10.7 | [Placement Agency Agreement dated October 23, 2024, between CNS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1729427/000168316824007371/cns_ex0101.htm) (incorporated by reference to exhibit 1.1 of the Form 8-K filed October 24, 2024)  \n10.8 | [Form of Securities Purchase Agreement](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1729427/000168316824007371/cns_ex1001.htm) (incorporated by reference to exhibit 10.1 of the Form 8-K filed October 24, 2024)  \n31.1* | [Certification of the Principal Executive Officer pursuant to Rule 13a-14(a) or 15d-14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.](#cns_ex3101.htm)  \n31.2* | [Certification of the Principal Financial Officer pursuant to Rule 13a-14(a) or 15d-14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.](#cns_ex3102.htm)  \n32.1*(1) | [Certification of the Principal Executive Officer pursuant to 18 U.S.C.

(“we”, “our”, the “Company”) is a clinical pharmaceutical company organized as a Nevada corporation on July 27, 2017 to focus on the development of anti-cancer drug candidates.\n\nOn August 25, 2022, the stockholders of the Company approved an amendment to the Company’s amended and restated articles of incorporation (the “Amendment”) to effect the reverse stock split at a ratio in the range of 1-for-2 to 1-for-30. The reverse stock split became effective on November 28, 2022 on a 1-for-30 basis without any change in the par value per share, which remained at $0.001. The reverse stock split has been retroactively adjusted throughout these financial statements and footnotes.\n\nOn April 30, 2024, the stockholders of the Company approved an amendment to the Company’s amended and restated articles of incorporation (the “Amendment”) to effect the reverse stock split at a ratio in the range of 1-for-2 to 1-for-50. The reverse stock split became effective on June 4, 2024 on a 1-for-50 basis without any change in the par value per share, which remained at $0.001. The reverse stock split has been retroactively adjusted throughout these financial statements and footnotes.\n\n**Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**\n\n**Basis of Presentation** - The accompanying unaudited financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Stated of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim unaudited financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. The unaudited financial statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary in order to make the condensed financial statements not misleading. Operating results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the final results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. For more complete financial information, these unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2023 included in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024 (“Form 10-K”). Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal period, as reported in the Form 10-K, have been omitted.\n\n**Liquidity and Going Concern -** These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the ability of the Company to obtain equity financings to continue operations. The Company has a history of and expects to continue to report negative cash flows from operations and a net loss. Management believes that the cash on hand is sufficient to fund its planned operations into but not beyond the near term. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company may seek additional funding through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, government or other third-party funding, commercialization, marketing and distribution arrangements, other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements and delay planned cash outlays or a combination thereof. Management cannot be certain that such events or a combination thereof can be achieved.\n\n7  \n---  \n  \n**Cash and Cash Equivalents -** The Company considers all highly liquid accounts with original maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents. Periodically, the Company may carry cash balances at financial institutions in excess of the federally insured limit of $250,000. The amount in excess of the FDIC insurance as of June 30, 2024 was $1,241,559. The Company has not experienced losses on these accounts and management believes, based upon the quality of the financial institutions, that the credit risk with regard to these deposits is not significant.\n\n**Stock-based Compensation -** Employee and non-employee share-based compensation is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period for stock options and restricted stock units.\n\n**Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”)** - Our RSUs vest over four years from the date of grant. The fair value of RSUs is the market price of our common stock at the date of grant.\n\n**Performance Units (“PUs”)** - The PUs vest based on our performance against predefined share price targets and the achievement of Positive Interim, Clinical Data as defined by the Board.\n\n**Loss Per Common Share **- Basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per common share is determined using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents. In periods when losses are reported, the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding excludes common stock equivalents, because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. As of June 30, 2024, the Company’s potentially dilutive shares and options, which were not included in the calculation of net loss per share, included warrants to purchase 1,551,422 common shares, unvested restricted stock units of 5,475 common shares, unvested performance units of 577 and options for 12,177 common shares, respectively. As of June 30, 2023, the Company’s potentially dilutive shares and options, which were not included in the calculation of net loss per share, included warrants to purchase 45,399 common shares, unvested restricted stock units of 193 common shares, unvested performance units of 577 and options for 2,591 common shares, respectively.\n\n**Note 3 – Note Payable**\n\nOn November 28, 2023, the Company entered into a short-term note payable for an aggregate of $329,571, bearing interest at 9.74% per year to finance certain insurance policies. Principal and interest payments related to the note will be repaid over an 11-month period with the final payment due on October 8, 2024. As of June 30, 2024 the Company’s note payable balance was $123,248.\n\n**Note 4 – Equity**\n\nThe Company has authorized 75,000,000 shares of common stock having a par value of $0.001 per share. In addition, the Company authorized 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock to be issued having a par value of $0.001. The specific rights of the preferred stock shall be determined by the board of directors. On May 2, 2024, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to increase the number of the Company’s authorized shares of common stock from 75,000,000 shares to 300,000,000 shares.\n\nOn August 25, 2022, the stockholders of the Company approved an amendment to the Company’s amended and restated articles of incorporation (the “Amendment”) to effect the reverse stock split at a ratio in the range of 1-for-2 to 1-for-30, with such ratio to be determined in the discretion of the Company’s board of directors and with such reverse stock split to be effected at such time and date, if at all, as determined by the Company’s board of directors in its sole discretion prior to the one-year anniversary of the annual meeting.\n\n8  \n---  \n  \nPursuant to such authority granted by the Company’s stockholders, the Company’s board of directors approved a one-for-thirty (1:30) reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock and the filing of the Amendment to effectuate the reverse split. The reverse stock split became effective on November 28, 2022 on a 1-for-30 basis without any change in the par value per share, which remained at $0.001.\n\nOn April 30, 2024, the stockholders of the Company approved an amendment to the Company’s amended and restated articles of incorporation (the “Amendment”) to effect the reverse stock split at a ratio in the range of 1-for-2 to 1-for-50, with such ratio to be determined in the discretion of the Company’s board of directors and with such reverse stock split to be effected at such time and date, if at all, as determined by the Company’s board of directors in its sole discretion prior to the one-year anniversary of the annual meeting.\n\nPursuant to such authority granted by the Company’s stockholders, the Company’s board of directors approved a one-for-fifty (1:50) reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock and the filing of the Amendment to effectuate the reverse split. The reverse stock split became effective on June 4, 2024 on a 1-for-50 basis without any change in the par value per share, which remained at $0.001.\n\nOn April 30, 2024, the Company held its scheduled 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders at which the Company’s stockholders approved amendments to the Company's 2020 Equity Plan (the “2020 Plan”) including an increase in the number of shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, authorized for issuance under the 2020 Plan by 70,000 shares. As amended, the number of shares of the common stock that may be issued under the 2020 Plan is 86,916 shares (this includes the 70,000 share increase).\n\n**Common Stock**\n\nOn January 29, 2024, the Company entered into a placement agency agreement with A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners (“AGP”) and Maxim Group LLC (“Maxim” and collectively with AGP, the “Placement Agents”) (the “Placement Agreement”) for the public offering by the Company of (i) 44,314 shares (the “Shares”) of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”) (ii) pre-funded warrants to purchase 222,354 shares of Common Stock (the “Pre-Funded Warrants”); (iii) Series A Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 266,667 shares of Common Stock (the “Series A Warrants”); and (iv) Series B Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 266,667 shares of Common Stock (the “Series B Warrants”, and together with the Series A Warrants, the “Common Warrants)).

The amendment extends the term of employment under the Employment Agreement, which was originally for a three-year period, for additional twelve-month periods, unless and until either the Company or Mr. Climaco provides written notice to the other party not less than sixty days before such anniversary date that such party is electing not to extend the term. If the Company provides notice of its election not to extend the term, Mr. Climaco may terminate his employment at any time prior to the expiration of the term by giving written notice to the Company at least thirty days prior to the effective date of termination, and upon the earlier of such effective date of termination or the expiration of the term, Mr. Climaco shall be entitled to receive the same severance benefits as are provided upon a termination of employment by the Company without cause.

On November 13, 2019, the Company closed its IPO, thereby fulfilling all conditions precedent and completing the acquisition of the intellectual property discussed in the HPI agreement. During the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized $25,000 and $25,000 related to this agreement. Unrelated to this agreement, from time to time, the Company purchases pharmaceutical products from HPI which are necessary for the manufacturing of Berubicin API and drug product in related party transactions which are reviewed and approved by the Company’s audit committee based upon the standards of providing superior pricing and time to delivery than that available from unrelated third parties. On May 14, 2024, the Company provided notice to HPI of its intent to terminate the HPI License effective on or about July 14, 2024.\n\nOn August 30, 2018, we entered into a sublicense agreement with WPD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“WPD”). Pursuant to the agreement, the Company granted WPD an exclusive sublicense, even as to us, for the patent rights we licensed pursuant to the HPI License within the following countries: Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Macedonia, Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Croatia, Slovenia, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Chechnya, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Greece, Austria, and Russia. The sublicense agreement provides that WPD must use commercially reasonable development efforts to attempt to develop and commercialize licensed products in the above mentioned territories, which means the expenditure of at least $2.0 million on the development, testing, regulatory approval or commercialization of the licensed products during the three year period immediately following the date of the sublicense agreement. In the event that WPD fails to use commercially reasonable development efforts by the foregoing three-year deadline, we have the right to terminate this sublicense agreement. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has received reports of the WPD expenditures related to this agreement, has conducted due inquiry into validating those expenditures, and has determined that WPD has exercised commercially reasonable development efforts and has therefore fulfilled the terms of the agreement necessary to secure their rights under the sublicense in perpetuity subject to the ongoing obligations of the sublicense. In consideration for the rights granted under the sublicense agreement, to the extent we are required to make any payments to HPI pursuant to the HPI License as a result of this sublicense agreement, WPD agreed to advance us such payments, and to pay us a royalty equal to 1% of such payments. WPD is a Polish corporation that is majority-owned by an entity controlled by Dr. Priebe, our founder.\n\nOn August 31, 2018, the Company entered into a sublicense agreement with Animal Life Sciences, LLC (“ALI”), a related party, pursuant to which we granted ALI an exclusive sublicense, even as to us, for the patent rights we licensed pursuant to the HPI License solely for the treatment of cancer in non-human animals through any type of administration. In consideration for the rights granted under the sublicense agreement, ALI agreed to issue us membership interests in ALI equal to 1.52% of the outstanding ALI membership interests. As additional consideration for the rights granted, to the extent we are required to make any payments to HPI pursuant to the HPI License as a result of this sublicense agreement, ALI agreed to advance us such payments, and to pay us a royalty equal to 1% of such payments. Dr. Waldemar Priebe, our founder, is also the founder and a shareholder of ALI.\n\n14  \n---  \n  \nOn June 10, 2020, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation (“ODD”) for Berubicin for the treatment of malignant gliomas. ODD from the FDA is available for drugs targeting diseases with less than 200,000 cases per year. ODD may enable market exclusivity of 7 years from the date of approval of an NDA in the United States. During that period the FDA generally could not approve another product containing the same drug for the same designated indication. Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same active ingredient for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. The ODD now constitutes our primary intellectual property protections although the Company is exploring if there are other patents that could be filed related to Berubicin to extend additional protections.\n\nOn July 24, 2021, the Company received Fast Track Designation from the FDA for Berubicin. Fast Track Designation is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need.\n\n**_WP1244 Portfolio_**\n\nOn January 10, 2020, Company entered into a Patent and Technology License Agreement (the “WP1244 Agreement”) with The Board of Regents of The University of Texas System, an agency of the State of Texas, on behalf of The University of Texas M.

In consideration, the Company must make payments to UTMDACC including an up-front license fee, annual maintenance fee, milestone payments and royalty payments (including minimum annual royalties) on sales of licensed products developed under the WP1244 Agreement. The term of the WP1244 Agreement expires on the last to occur of: (a) the expiration of all patents subject to the WP1244 Agreement, or (b) fifteen years after execution; provided that UTMDACC has the right to terminate this WP1244 Agreement in the event that the Company fails to meet certain commercial diligence milestones. The commercial diligence milestones are as follows (i) initiated PC toxicology to support filing of Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) or New Drug Application (“NDA”) for the Licensed Product within the eighteen (18) month period following the Effective Date (ii) file and IND for the Licensed Product within three (3) year period following the Effective Date and (iii) Commencement of Phase I Study within the five (5) year period following the Effective Date. The Company has not met the commercial diligence milestones and has not paid the annual maintenance fee required as of the date hereof. On April 25, 2024, UTMDACC provided notice to the Company of its intent to terminate the WP1244 Agreement if the Company fails to pay the annual maintenance fee of $50,000, as well as $1,300 in expenses. On May 25, 2024 the WP1244 Agreement was terminated. There are no termination penalty provisions in the Agreement. During the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company paid $1,994 and $27,341, respectively.\n\n**_Nasdaq Capital Markets Listing Qualifications_**\n\nOn August 17, 2023, the Company was notified by the Listing Qualifications Department (the “Staff”) of the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) that the Company was not in compliance with the minimum $2,500,000 stockholders’ equity requirement for continued listing set forth in Listing Rule 5550(b).

(“HPI”) and The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (“UTMDACC”) and own pursuant to a collaboration and asset purchase agreement with Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Reata”).\n\n18  \n---  \n  \nWe believe our lead drug candidate, Berubicin, may be a significant development in the treatment of Glioblastoma and other CNS malignancies, and if approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), could give Glioblastoma patients an important new therapeutic alternative to the current standard of care. Glioblastomas are tumors that arise from astrocytes, which are star-shaped cells making up the supportive tissue of the brain. These tumors are usually highly malignant (cancerous) because the cells reproduce quickly, and they are supported by a large network of blood vessels. Berubicin is an anthracycline, which is a class of drugs that are among the most powerful and extensively used chemotherapy drugs known. Based on limited clinical data, we believe Berubicin is the first anthracycline that appears to cross the blood brain barrier (“BBB”) in significant concentrations targeting brain cancer cells. While our focus is currently on the development of Berubicin, we are also in the process of attempting to secure intellectual property rights to additional compounds that we plan to develop into drugs to treat CNS and other cancers.\n\nBerubicin was discovered at UTMDACC by Dr. Waldemar Priebe, the founder of the Company. Through a series of transactions, Berubicin was initially licensed to Reata. Reata initiated several Phase I clinical trials with Berubicin for CNS malignancies, one of which was for malignant gliomas, but subsequently allowed their IND with the FDA to lapse for strategic reasons. This required us to obtain a new IND for Berubicin before beginning further clinical trials. On December 17, 2020, we announced that our IND application with the FDA for Berubicin for the treatment of Glioblastoma Multiforme was in effect. We initiated this trial for patient enrollment during the second quarter of 2021 with the first patient dosed during the third quarter of 2021 to investigate the safety and efficacy of Berubicin in adults with Glioblastoma Multiforme who have failed first-line therapy. The first patient on the trial was treated during the third quarter of 2021. Correspondence between the Company and the FDA resulted in modifications to our initial trial design, including designating overall survival (OS) as the primary endpoint of the study. OS is a rigorous endpoint that the FDA has recognized as a basis for approval of oncology drugs when a statistically significant improvement can be shown relative to a randomized control arm. \n\nThe current trial being conducted will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Berubicin in patients with Glioblastoma Multiforme who have failed primary treatment for their disease, and results will be compared to the safety and efficacy of Lomustine, a current standard of care in this setting, with a 2 to 1 randomization of the 252 patients to Berubicin or Lomustine. Patients receiving Berubicin are administered a 2-hour IV infusion of 7.5 mg/m2 berubicin hydrochloride daily for three consecutive days followed by 18 days off (a 21-day cycle). Lomustine is administered orally once every six weeks. The trial design included a pre-planned, non-binding interim futility analysis. We reached the criteria required by the study protocol to conduct this interim futility analysis, which an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (“DSMB”) is responsible for conducting. The DSMB’s charter mandated that they review the primary endpoint, Overall Survival, as well as secondary endpoints and safety data to determine whether the efficacy data for the risk-benefit profile warrants modification or discontinuation of the study. On December 18, 2023, we released the DSMB’s recommendation which was to continue the study without modification. Management remains blinded to the data underlying the recommendation of the DSMB. Even if Berubicin is approved, there is no assurance that patients will choose an infusion treatment, as compared to the current standard of care, which requires oral administration.\n\nWe do not have manufacturing facilities and all manufacturing activities are contracted out to third parties. Additionally, we do not have a sales organization.\n\nOn November 21, 2017, we entered into a Collaboration and Asset Purchase Agreement with Reata (the “Reata Agreement”). Pursuant to the Reata Agreement we purchased all of Reata’s intellectual property and development data regarding Berubicin, including all trade secrets, knowhow, confidential information and other intellectual property rights.\n\nOn December 28, 2017, we obtained the rights to a worldwide, exclusive royalty-bearing, license to the chemical compound commonly known as Berubicin from HPI in an agreement we refer to as the HPI License. HPI is affiliated with Dr. Priebe, who controls a majority of our shares. Under the HPI License we obtained the exclusive right to develop certain chemical compounds for use in the treatment of cancer anywhere in the world. In the HPI License we agreed to pay HPI: (i) development fees of $750,000 over a three-year period beginning November 2019; (ii) a 2% royalty on net sales; (iii) a $50,000 per year license fee; (iv) milestone payments of $100,000 upon the commencement of a Phase II trial and $1.0 million upon the approval of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) for Berubicin; and (v) 134 shares of our common stock. The patents we licensed from HPI expired in March 2020. On May 14, 2024, the Company provided notice to HPI of its intent to terminate the HPI License effective on or about July 14, 2024.\n\n19  \n---  \n  \nOn June 10, 2020, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation (“ODD”) for Berubicin for the treatment of malignant gliomas. ODD from the FDA is available for drugs targeting diseases with less than 200,000 cases per year. ODD may enable market exclusivity of 7 years from the date of approval of a NDA in the United States. During that period the FDA generally could not approve another product containing the same drug for the same designated indication. Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same active ingredient for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. The ODD now constitutes our primary intellectual property protections although the Company is exploring if there are other patents that could be filed related to Berubicin to extend additional protections.\n\nWe believe we have obtained all rights and intellectual property necessary to develop Berubicin. As stated earlier, it is our plan to obtain additional intellectual property covering other compounds which, subject to the receipt of additional financing, may be developed into drugs for brain and other cancers.\n\nOn January 10, 2020, we entered into a Patent and Technology License Agreement (the “WP1244 Agreement”) with The Board of Regents of The University of Texas System, an agency of the State of Texas, on behalf of the UTMDACC. Pursuant to the WP1244 Agreement, we obtained a royalty-bearing, worldwide, exclusive license to certain intellectual property rights, including patent rights, related to our portfolio of WP1244 drug technology. On April 25, 2024, UTMDACC provided notice to us if its intent to terminate the WP1244 Agreement if we fail to pay the annual maintenance fee of $50,000, as well as $1,300 in expenses. On May 25, 2024 the WP1244 Agreement was terminated. There are no termination penalty provisions in the Agreement.\n\n**Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended June 30, 2023**\n\n_General and Administrative Expense_\n\nGeneral and administrative expense was approximately $1,412,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to approximately $1,180,000 for the comparable period in 2023. The increase in general and administrative expense was mainly attributable to increases of approximately $333,000 in legal and professional expenses, which were offset by decreases of approximately $65,000 in marketing and advertising expenses, $34,000 in insurance expense and $2,000 in other expenses.\n\n_Research and Development Expense_\n\nResearch and development expense was approximately $1,117,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to approximately $2,846,000 for the comparable period in 2023. The decrease in research and development expenses during the period were mainly attributed to the timing of research organization (CRO) expenses related to continued progress with our potentially pivotal Phase II clinical trial of Berubicin. Our CRO expenditures are primarily for labor related to activating selected trial sites, managing patient enrollment processes, collecting and managing data from patient treatments throughout the trial, processing reimbursement to the sites for patient treatment, and assisting with necessary submissions to amend the IND. CRO expenditures are expected to continue to decline throughout the remainder of the trial as the final patients complete treatment and enter follow-up.\n\n_Net Loss_\n\nThe net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was approximately $2,531,000 compared to approximately $4,021,000 for the comparable period in 2023. The change in net loss is attributable to a decrease in CRO expenses related to continued progress with our potentially pivotal Phase II clinical trial of Berubicin, as well as decreases in legal and professional fees and other expenses.\n\n20  \n---  \n  \n**Results of Operations for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 Compared to the Six Months Ended June 30, 2023**\n\n_General and Administrative Expense_\n\nGeneral and administrative expense was approximately $2,526,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to approximately $2,539,000 for the comparable period in 2023. The increase in general and administrative expense was mainly attributable to increases of approximately $179,000 in legal and professional expenses, which were offset by decreases of approximately $75,000 in stock- based compensation, $46,000 in marketing and advertising expense and $54,000 in insurance expense.\n\n_Research and Development Expense_\n\nResearch and development expense was approximately $3,547,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to approximately $6,413,000 for the comparable period in 2023. The decrease in research and development expenses during the period were mainly attributed to the timing of research organization (CRO) expenses related to continued progress with our Phase II clinical trial. Our CRO expenditures are primarily for labor related to activating selected trial sites, managing patient enrollment processes, collecting and managing data from patient treatments throughout the trial, processing reimbursement to the sites for patient treatment, and assisting with necessary submissions to amend the IND. CRO expenditures are expected to continue to decline throughout the remainder of the trial as the final patients complete treatment and enter follow-up.\n\n_Net Loss_\n\nThe net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was approximately $6,076,000 compared to approximately $8,953,000 for the comparable period in 2023. The change in net loss is attributable to a decrease in CRO expenses related to continued progress with our potentially pivotal Phase II clinical trial of Berubicin, as well as decreases in legal and professional fees and other expenses.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nOn June 30, 2024, we had cash of approximately $1,492,000 and we had a working capital deficit of approximately $4,617,000. We fund our operations from proceeds from equity sales.\n\nOn January 29, 2024, we completed a public offering of (i) 44,314 shares of our common stock; (ii) pre-funded warrants to purchase 222,354 shares of common stock; (iii) Series A Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 266,667 shares of common stock; and (iv) Series B Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 266,667 shares of common stock. The combined purchase price of one share of common stock and accompanying Series A & B common warrants was $15 and the combined purchase price of one pre-funded warrant and accompanying Series A & B common warrants was $14.95 (with the pre-funded warrants having an exercise price of $0.001). The closing of the sales of these securities occurred on February 1, 2024. The gross proceeds from the offering were approximately $4.0 million, before deducting the placement agent’s fees and other offering expenses.\n\nOn June 14, 2024, we entered into agreements with institutional investors for the sale of 336,000 shares of our common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase 30,000 shares of common stock in lieu thereof (the “June 14 Pre-Funded Warrants”) in a registered direct offering. In a concurrent private placement, we also sold to the investors unregistered warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 366,000 shares of common stock (the “June 14 Common Warrants”). The combined purchase price of one share of common stock (or pre-funded warrant in lieu thereof) and accompanying June 14 Common Warrant was $3.75. The gross proceeds from the offering were approximately $1.37 million, resulting in net proceeds, after payment of commissions and expenses, received by us of $1,203,267.\n\nOn June 26, 2024, we entered into agreements with institutional investors for the sale of 568,000 shares of our common stock in a registered direct offering. In a concurrent private placement, we also sold to the investors unregistered warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 568,000 shares of common stock (the “June 26 Common Warrants”). The combined purchase price of one share of common stock and accompanying June 26 Common Warrant was $2.45. The gross proceeds from the offering were approximately $1.39 million resulting in net proceeds, after payment of commissions and expenses, received by the Company of $1,221,146.\n\nOn July 26, 2024, the Company entered into a Sales Agreement (the “AGP ATM Sales Agreement”) with A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners (“AGP”). Pursuant to the terms of the AGP ATM Sales Agreement, the Company originally was permitted to sell from time to time through AGP, as sales agent or principal, shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share with initial aggregate sales price of up to $5.2 million. On July 30, 2024, the Company increased the aggregate sales price of common shares that may be sold under the AGP ATM Sales Agreement to $25.0 million (not including the original $5.2 million). As of August 14, 2024, the Company has sold 28,704,761 Shares pursuant to the Agreement for net proceeds of approximately $10.5 million.\n\nOur plan of operations is primarily focused on completing a clinical trial for Berubicin. Our current expectation is that our cash on hand as of the date of this filing is sufficient to fund our operations through the first quarter of 2025. We currently expect to release final top-line data for our potentially pivotal trial of Berubicin in the first half of 2025. If capital is available to fund TPI 287 clinical preparations and drug manufacturing for a potentially pivotal Phase 2 trial of TPI 287, we would need to raise an additional $4.0 million to support near-term development of that program. The timing and costs of clinical trials are difficult to predict and trial plans may change in response to evolving circumstances and as such the foregoing estimates may prove to be inaccurate.\n\nWe will need to raise additional capital in the near term in order to continue to meet the Nasdaq minimum equity requirement. If we are unable to raise sufficient funds, we may be delisted by Nasdaq and we will be required to develop and implement an alternative plan to further extend payables, reduce overhead or scale back our business plan until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further operations. There can be no assurance that such a plan will be successful and if it is not successful we may need to cease operations entirely.\n\n**Summary of Cash Flows**\n\n_Cash used in operating activities_\n\nNet cash used in operating activities was approximately $4,842,000 and $8,227,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and mainly included payments made for clinical trial preparation, officer compensation, insurance, marketing and professional fees to our consultants, attorneys and accountants. \n\n_Cash provided by financing activities_\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities was approximately $5,785,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, related to the sale of common stock and exercise of warrants, which were offset by the repayment of notes payable and payment of deferred offering costs. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $2,451,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2023, related to the sale of common stock and exercise of warrants, which were offset by the repayment of notes payable.\n\n22  \n---  \n  \n**Off-balance Sheet Arrangements**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\n\n**Purchase Commitments**\n\nWe do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures, although we are required to pay certain milestones fees to HPI, Reata and Cortice as described in the section “Overview” above.\n\n**JOBS Act Accounting Election**\n\nThe Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, exempts an “emerging growth company” such as us from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\n\n**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements, including the notes thereto. As a result, management is required to routinely make judgments and estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or assumptions. Management determined there were no critical accounting estimates.\n\n**Item 3.** | **Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk**  \n---|---  \n  \nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. \n\n**Item 4.** | **Controls and Procedures**  \n---|---  \n  \n**Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting**\n\nWe maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that material information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer, who serves as our principal executive officer, and our chief financial officer, who serves as our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\n\n23  \n---  \n  \nUnder the supervision, and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness, as of June 30, 2024, of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nBased upon such evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer have concluded that, as of June 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were, and continue to be, ineffective because of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting due to lack of segregation of duties (resulting from the limited number of personnel available), limited access to timely and complete information regarding the status of costs incurred in the activation of investigational sites and costs from treating patients in our study which is a result of the use of a third-party Contract Research Organization (“CRO”) to manage the study, and the lack of formal documentation of our control environment. Management is commencing actions to address the lack of formal documentation of our control environment, although this will not address the lack of segregation of duties. Management is also working with the CRO to improve the timeliness and completeness of the data reported to the Company to address this material weakness, as well as conducting increased analytical analysis of such data to be performed by the Company.\n\nIn light of the material weakness described above, we continue to perform additional analysis and other post-closing procedures to ensure our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, we believe that the financial statements included in this report fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. Additional experienced personnel will be hired in the accounting and finance department, appropriate consultants will be retained, and our accounting system will be upgraded as soon as it becomes economically feasible and sustainable.\n\nOther than as described above, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent calendar quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n24  \n---  \n  \n**PART II - OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n**Item 1.** | **Legal Proceedings**  \n---|---  \n  \nFrom time to time in the ordinary course of our business, we may be involved in legal proceedings, the outcomes of which may not be determinable. The results of litigation are inherently unpredictable. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, require significant amounts of management time and result in diversion of significant resources. We are not able to estimate an aggregate amount or range of reasonably possible losses for those legal matters for which losses are not probable and estimable. We have insurance policies covering potential losses where such coverage is cost effective.\n\nWe are not at this time involved in any legal proceedings.\n\n**Item 1A.** | **Risk Factors**  \n---|---  \n  \nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors set forth below and discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC, which are incorporated herein by reference. The risks described in such reports are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.\n\n**If we are unable to maintain compliance with the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock may be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and could make it more difficult for shareholders to sell their shares.**\n\nOur common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, and we are therefore subject to its continued listing requirements, including requirements with respect to the market value of publicly-held shares, market value of listed shares, minimum bid price per share, and minimum stockholder's equity, among others, and requirements relating to board and committee independence. If we fail to satisfy one or more of the requirements, we may be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market.\n\nOn August 17, 2023, we were notified by the Listing Qualifications Department (the “Staff”) of the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) that we were not in compliance with the minimum $2,500,000 stockholders’ equity requirement for continued listing set forth in Listing Rule 5550(b). On February 27, 2024, the Staff notified us that we did not comply with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement set forth under Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). On February 14, 2024, we were notified that because we had not regained compliance with the Nasdaq equity requirement, our securities would be delisted unless it requested a hearing. On February 21, 2024, we requested a hearing, which was held on April 18, 2024.\n\nOn May 6, 2024, we received notification from the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (“Panel”) that it has granted an extension until July 15, 2024, to demonstrate compliance with Listing Rules 5550(a)(2) and 5550(b). On July 12, 2024, we requested an extension of this time period until August 12, 2024. On July 19, 2024, the Panel granted the requested extension until August 12, 2024, which date represented the full extent of the Panel’s discretion to grant continued listing while we are non-compliant with Listing Rule 5550(b).\n\nOn July 5, 2024, we received a letter from the Nasdaq Staff notifying we had regained compliance with Bid Price Rule as a result of the closing bid price of our common stock being at $1.00 per share or greater for the 20 consecutive business days from June 5, 2024, through July 3, 2024.\n\n25  \n---  \n  \nOn August 7, 2024, we filed a Form 8-K with the SEC indicating that as of that date, our shareholders’ equity was above the $2.5 million continued listing equity requirement as set forth in Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). As of the date hereof, we have not received any notice from Nasdaq on our compliance status.\n\nDelisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market would adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing through the public or private sale of equity securities, may significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and may negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock. Delisting also could have other negative results, including the potential loss of employee confidence, the loss of institutional investors or interest in business development opportunities. \n\n**Item 2.** | **Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds**  \n---|---  \n  \nExcept as previously disclosed on Form 8-K, we have not issued any unregistered securities during the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**Item 3.** | **Defaults Upon Senior Securities**  \n---|---  \n  \nNone.\n\n**Item 4.** | **Mine Safety Disclosures**  \n---|---  \n  \nNot applicable.\n\n**Item 5.** |

(“we”, “our”, the “Company”) is a clinical pharmaceutical company organized as a Nevada corporation on July 27, 2017 to focus on the development of anti-cancer drug candidates.\n\nOn August 25, 2022, the stockholders of the Company approved an amendment to the Company’s amended and restated articles of incorporation (the “Amendment”) to effect the reverse stock split at a ratio in the range of 1-for-2 to 1-for-30. The reverse stock split became effective on November 28, 2022 on a 1-for-30 basis without any change in the par value per share, which remained at $0.001. The reverse stock split has been retroactively adjusted throughout these financial statements and footnotes.\n\n**Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**\n\n**Basis of Presentation** - The accompanying unaudited financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Stated of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim unaudited financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. The unaudited financial statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary in order to make the condensed financial statements not misleading. Operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the final results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. For more complete financial information, these unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2023 included in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024 (“Form 10-K”). Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal period, as reported in the Form 10-K, have been omitted.\n\n**Liquidity and Going Concern -** These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the ability of the Company to obtain equity financings to continue operations. The Company has a history of and expects to continue to report negative cash flows from operations and a net loss. Management believes that the cash on hand is sufficient to fund its planned operations into but not beyond the near term. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company may seek additional funding through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, government or other third-party funding, commercialization, marketing and distribution arrangements, other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements and delay planned cash outlays or a combination thereof. Management cannot be certain that such events or a combination thereof can be achieved.\n\n**Cash and Cash Equivalents -** The Company considers all highly liquid accounts with original maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents. Periodically, the Company may carry cash balances at financial institutions in excess of the federally insured limit of $250,000. The amount in excess of the FDIC insurance as of March 31, 2024 was $565,226. The Company has not experienced losses on these accounts and management believes, based upon the quality of the financial institutions, that the credit risk with regard to these deposits is not significant.\n\n7  \n---  \n  \n**Stock-based Compensation -** Employee and non-employee share-based compensation is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period for stock options and restricted stock units.\n\n**Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”)** - Our RSUs vest over four years from the date of grant. The fair value of RSUs is the market price of our common stock at the date of grant.\n\n**Performance Units (“PUs”)** - The PUs vest based on our performance against predefined share price targets and the achievement of Positive Interim, Clinical Data as defined by the Board.\n\n**Loss Per Common Share **- Basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per common share is determined using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents. In periods when losses are reported, the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding excludes common stock equivalents, because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. As of March 31, 2024, the Company’s potentially dilutive shares and options, which were not included in the calculation of net loss per share, included warrants to purchase 39,785,731 common shares, unvested restricted stock units of 7,144 common shares, unvested performance units of 28,563 and options for 341,190 common shares, respectively. As of March 31, 2023, the Company’s potentially dilutive shares and options, which were not included in the calculation of net loss per share, included warrants to purchase 3,524,252 common shares, unvested restricted stock units of 9,523 common shares, unvested performance units of 28,563 and options for 126,489 common shares, respectively. \n\n**Note 3 – Note Payable**\n\nOn November 28, 2023, the Company entered into a short-term note payable for an aggregate of $329,571, bearing interest at 9.74% per year to finance certain insurance policies. Principal and interest payments related to the note will be repaid over an 11-month period with the final payment due on October 8, 2024. As of March 31, 2024 the Company’s note payable balance was $213,104.\n\n**Note 4 – Equity**\n\nThe Company has authorized 75,000,000 shares of common stock having a par value of $0.001 per share. In addition, the Company authorized 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock to be issued having a par value of $0.001. The specific rights of the preferred stock shall be determined by the board of directors. On May 2, 2024, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to increase the number of the Company’s authorized shares of common stock from 75,000,000 shares to 300,000,000 shares.\n\nOn August 25, 2022, the stockholders of the Company approved an amendment to the Company’s amended and restated articles of incorporation (the “Amendment”) to effect the reverse stock split at a ratio in the range of 1-for-2 to 1-for-30, with such ratio to be determined in the discretion of the Company’s board of directors and with such reverse stock split to be effected at such time and date, if at all, as determined by the Company’s board of directors in its sole discretion prior to the one-year anniversary of the annual meeting.\n\nPursuant to such authority granted by the Company’s stockholders, the Company’s board of directors approved a one-for-thirty (1:30) reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock and the filing of the Amendment to effectuate the reverse split. The reverse stock split became effective on November 28, 2022 on a 1-for-30 basis without any change in the par value per share, which remained at $0.001.\n\n8  \n---  \n  \n**Common Stock**\n\nOn January 29, 2024, the Company entered into a placement agency agreement with A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners (“AGP”) and Maxim Group LLC (“Maxim” and collectively with AGP, the “Placement Agents”) (the “Placement Agreement”) for the public offering by the Company of (i) 2,215,667 shares (the “Shares”) of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”) (ii) pre-funded warrants to purchase 11,117,667 shares of Common Stock (the “Pre-Funded Warrants”); (iii) Series A Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 13,333,334 shares of Common Stock (the “Series A Warrants”); and (iv) Series B Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 13,333,334 shares of Common Stock (the “Series B Warrants”, and together with the Series A Warrants, the “Common Warrants)). The Common Warrants and Pre-Funded Warrants are collectively referred to herein as the (“Warrants”). The combined purchase price of one share of Common Stock and accompanying Common Warrants was $0.30 and the combined purchase price of one Pre-Funded Warrant and accompanying Common Warrants was $0.299. In connection with the offering, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with certain institutional investors that participated in the offering. As of April 1, 2024, 2,204,667 of the Pre-Funded Warrants have been exercised. The closing of the sales of these securities occurred on February 1, 2024. The net proceeds to the Company from the offering were $3,331,000, after deducting the placement agents’ fees and other offering expenses.\n\n**Stock Options**\n\nIn 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the CNS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2017 Stock Plan (the “2017 Plan”). The 2017 Plan allows for the Board of Directors to grant various forms of incentive awards for up to 66,667 shares of common stock.\n\nIn 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the CNS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2020 Stock Plan (the “2020 Plan”). The 2020 Plan allows for the Board of Directors to grant various forms of incentive awards for up to 100,000 shares of common stock. The 2020 Plan was amended effective as of August 9, 2023, which was approved by the Company’s stockholders at the Company’s annual meeting on September 14, 2023. The amendment increased the 2020 Plan by 745,800 shares of common stock.\n\nOn January 19, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the issuance of 12,420 options to Ms. Mahery as compensation for her appointment to our Board of Directors. The options have a ten-year term at an exercise price of $0.253 and vest in 36 equal monthly installments succeeding the issuance date. The total fair value of these option grants at issuance was $2,728.\n\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized $192,375 and $272,446 of stock-based compensation, respectively, related to outstanding stock options. At March 31, 2024, the Company had $528,432 of unrecognized expenses related to outstanding options.\n\nThe following table summarizes the stock option activity for the three months ended March 31, 2024:\n\nSchedule of stock option activity  \n---  \nOptions | Weighted-Average Exercise Price Per Share  \nOutstanding, December 31, 2023 | 328,770 | $| 20.35  \nGranted | 12,420 | 0.25  \nExercised | – | –  \nForfeited | – | –  \nExpired | – | –  \nOutstanding, March 31, 2024 | 341,190 | $| 19.62  \nExercisable, March 31, 2024 | 99,920 | $| 58.39  \n  \n9  \n---  \n  \nThe aggregate fair value of the options measured during the three months ended March 31, 2024 were calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the following assumptions:\n\nSchedule of assumptions for options  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended** **December 31, 2024**  \nFair value of common stock on measurement date | $0.253 per share  \nRisk free interest rate (1) | 3.80%  \nVolatility (2) | 113.08%   \nDividend yield (3) | 0%  \nExpected term (in years) | 6.5  \n(1) | The risk-free interest rate was determined by management using the market yield on U.S. Treasury securities with comparable terms as of the measurement date.  \n---|---  \n(2) | The trading volatility was determined by calculating the volatility of the Company's peer group.  \n(3) | The Company does not expect to pay a dividend in the foreseeable future.  \n  \nAs of March 31, 2024, the outstanding stock options have a weighted average remaining term of 8.35 years and aggregate intrinsic value of options vested and outstanding of $1,354.

The other terms of such warrants will remain unchanged.\n\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company received $12,405 in cash proceeds from the exercise of 2,204,667 warrants issued at an exercise price of $0.299 and 34,000 warrants previously issued at an exercise price of $0.30.\n\nThe following table summarizes the stock warrant activity for the three months ended March 31, 2024:\n\nSchedule of stock warrant activity  \n---  \nWarrants | Weighted-Average Exercise Price Per Share  \nOutstanding, December 31, 2023 | 4,240,063 | $| 3.88  \nGranted | 37,784,335 | 0.30  \nExercised | (2,238,667| ) | 0.30  \nForfeited | – | –  \nExpired | – | –  \nOutstanding, March 31, 2024 | 39,785,731 | $| 0.59  \nExercisable, March 31, 2024 | 39,785,731 | $| 0.59  \n  \nAs of March 31, 2024, the outstanding and exercisable warrants have a weighted average remaining term of 3.65 years and had no aggregate intrinsic value.\n\n10  \n---  \n  \n**Restricted Stock Units**\n\nOn April 28, 2022, the Compensation Committee approved cash bonuses totaling $213,000 to the officers of the Company.

At March 31, 2024, the Company had $47,699 of unrecognized expenses related to outstanding RSUs.\n\nThe following table summarizes the RSUs activity for the three months ended March 31, 2024:\n\nSchedule of restricted stock units activity  \n---  \nRSUs | Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value  \nNon-vested, December 31, 2023 | 7,144 | $| 10.02  \nGranted | – | –  \nVested | – | –  \nForfeited | – | –  \nNon-vested, March 31, 2024 | 7,144 | $| 10.02  \n  \n**Performance Units**\n\nOn April 28, 2022, the Compensation Committee approved, the officers and employees were awarded a total of 28,563 PUs. For awards granted in 2022, they vest as follows: (i) 9,521 of the PU grant will vest if within 24 months from issuance the average the closing price of the Company’s common stock over a ten trading day period exceeds $60.00 (subject to pro rata adjustment for stock splits or similar events), (ii) 9,521 of the PU grant will vest if within 36 months from issuance the average the closing price of the Company’s common stock over a ten trading day period exceeds $120.00 (subject to pro rata adjustment for stock splits or similar events) and (iii) 9,521 of the PU grant will vest if within 24 months from issuance the Company achieves “Positive Interim, Clinical Data” as defined by the Board of Directors.

Reata also agreed to collaborate with the Company on the development of Berubicin, from time to time.\n\n12  \n---  \n  \nOn December 28, 2017, the Company entered into a Technology Rights and Development Agreement with Houston Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“HPI”). HPI is affiliated with Dr. Waldemar Priebe, our founder. Pursuant to this agreement, the Company obtained a worldwide exclusive license to the chemical compound commonly known as WP744. In exchange for these rights, the Company agreed to pay consideration to HPI as follows: (i) a royalty of 2% of net sales of any product utilizing WP744 for a period of ten years after the first commercial sale of such; and (ii) $100,000 upon beginning Phase II clinical trials (paid in 2021); and (iii) $200,000 upon the approval by the FDA of a New Drug Application for any product utilizing WP744; and (iv) a series of quarterly development payments totaling $750,000 beginning immediately after the Company’s raise of $7,000,000 of investment capital. In addition, the Company issued 6,667 shares of the Company’s common stock valued at $1.35 per share to HPI upon execution of the agreement. On November 13, 2019, the Company closed its IPO, thereby fulfilling all conditions precedent and completing the acquisition of the intellectual property discussed in the HPI agreement. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized $12,500 and $12,500 related to this agreement. Unrelated to this agreement, from time to time, the Company purchases pharmaceutical products from HPI which are necessary for the manufacturing of Berubicin API and drug product in related party transactions which are reviewed and approved by the Company’s audit committee based upon the standards of providing superior pricing and time to delivery than that available from unrelated third parties. On May 14, 2024, the Company provided notice to HPI of its intent to terminate the HPI License effective on or about July 14, 2024.\n\nOn August 30, 2018, we entered into a sublicense agreement with WPD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“WPD”). Pursuant to the agreement, the Company granted WPD an exclusive sublicense, even as to us, for the patent rights we licensed pursuant to the HPI License within the following countries: Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Macedonia, Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Croatia, Slovenia, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Chechnya, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Greece, Austria, and Russia. The sublicense agreement provides that WPD must use commercially reasonable development efforts to attempt to develop and commercialize licensed products in the above mentioned territories, which means the expenditure of at least $2.0 million on the development, testing, regulatory approval or commercialization of the licensed products during the three year period immediately following the date of the sublicense agreement. In the event that WPD fails to use commercially reasonable development efforts by the foregoing three-year deadline, we have the right to terminate this sublicense agreement. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has received reports of the WPD expenditures related to this agreement, has conducted due inquiry into validating those expenditures, and has determined that WPD has exercised commercially reasonable development efforts and has therefore fulfilled the terms of the agreement necessary to secure their rights under the sublicense in perpetuity subject to the ongoing obligations of the sublicense. In consideration for the rights granted under the sublicense agreement, to the extent we are required to make any payments to HPI pursuant to the HPI License as a result of this sublicense agreement, WPD agreed to advance us such payments, and to pay us a royalty equal to 1% of such payments. WPD is a Polish corporation that is majority-owned by an entity controlled by Dr. Priebe, our founder. \n\nOn November 21, 2022, CNS entered into an Investigational Medicinal Product Supply Agreement with Pomeranian Medical University (“PUM”) in Szczecin, Poland. CNS agreed to sell berubicin hydrochloride drug product (and related reference standards) to PUM at a discount to the historical cost of manufacturing so that PUM may conduct an investigator-initiated clinical trial of Berubicin in CNS lymphomas. PUM agreed to pay CNS the following payments: (i) PLN 5,870 upon delivery of 2 vials each of berubicin and berubicinol reference standards, (ii) PLN 873,201 upon delivery of a first batch of 150 berubicin drug product vials, and (iii) PLN 873,201 upon delivery of a second batch of 150 berubicin drug product vials. As of December 31, 2022, the reference standards were delivered, and the Company recognized $1,302 in accounts receivable and as a reduction to research and development expense. In April 2023, the first batch of berubicin drug product vials were delivered, and the Company recognized $196,303 in accounts receivable and as a reduction to research and development expense. As of December 31, 2023, the outstanding accounts receivable balance of $197,605 was collected in full.\n\nOn August 31, 2018, the Company entered into a sublicense agreement with Animal Life Sciences, LLC (“ALI”), a related party, pursuant to which we granted ALI an exclusive sublicense, even as to us, for the patent rights we licensed pursuant to the HPI License solely for the treatment of cancer in non-human animals through any type of administration. In consideration for the rights granted under the sublicense agreement, ALI agreed to issue us membership interests in ALI equal to 1.52% of the outstanding ALI membership interests. As additional consideration for the rights granted, to the extent we are required to make any payments to HPI pursuant to the HPI License as a result of this sublicense agreement, ALI agreed to advance us such payments, and to pay us a royalty equal to 1% of such payments. Dr. Waldemar Priebe, our founder, is also the founder and a shareholder of ALI, holds 38% of the membership interests of ALI.\n\n13  \n---  \n  \nOn June 10, 2020, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation (“ODD”) for Berubicin for the treatment of malignant gliomas. ODD from the FDA is available for drugs targeting diseases with less than 200,000 cases per year. ODD may enable market exclusivity of 7 years from the date of approval of an NDA in the United States. During that period the FDA generally could not approve another product containing the same drug for the same designated indication. Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same active ingredient for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. The ODD now constitutes our primary intellectual property protections although the Company is exploring if there are other patents that could be filed related to Berubicin to extend additional protections.\n\nOn July 24, 2021, the Company received Fast Track Designation from the FDA for Berubicin. Fast Track Designation is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need.\n\n**_WP1244 Portfolio_**\n\nOn January 10, 2020, Company entered into a Patent and Technology License Agreement (“Agreement”) with The Board of Regents of The University of Texas System, an agency of the State of Texas, on behalf of The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (“UTMDACC”). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company obtained a royalty-bearing, worldwide, exclusive license to certain intellectual property rights, including patent rights, related to the Company’s recently announced WP1244 drug technology. In consideration, the Company must make payments to UTMDACC including an up-front license fee, annual maintenance fee, milestone payments and royalty payments (including minimum annual royalties) on sales of licensed products developed under the Agreement. The term of the Agreement expires on the last to occur of: (a) the expiration of all patents subject to the Agreement, or (b) fifteen years after execution; provided that UTMDACC has the right to terminate this Agreement in the event that the Company fails to meet certain commercial diligence milestones. The commercial diligence milestones are as follows (i) initiated PC toxicology to support filing of Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) or New Drug Application (“NDA”) for the Licensed Product within the eighteen (18) month period following the Effective Date (ii) file and IND for the Licensed Product within three (3) year period following the Effective Date and (iii) Commencement of Phase I Study within the five (5) year period following the Effective Date. The Company has not met the commercial diligence milestones and has not paid the annual maintenance fee required as of the date hereof. On April 25, 2024, UTMDACC provided notice to the Company of its intent to terminate the WP1244 Agreement if the Company fails to pay the annual maintenance fee of $50,000, as well as $1,300 in expenses. As of the date hereof, the Company has not determined whether to cure the foregoing defaults. If the Company fails to cure the defaults, on May 25, 2024, the WP1244 Agreement will terminate.. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company paid $694 and $11,744, respectively.\n\nOn May 7, 2020, pursuant to the WP1244 Portfolio license agreement described above, the Company entered into a Sponsored Research Agreement with UTMDACC to perform research relating to novel anticancer agents targeting CNS malignancies. The Company agreed to fund approximately $1,134,000 over a two-year period. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company paid $334,000 and accrued $400,000 related to this agreement in research and development expenses in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company paid $800,000 to UTMDACC related to this agreement. The Company has no further payment obligations as of December 31, 2021. This agreement was extended and now expires on March 31, 2023. The principal investigator for this agreement is Dr. Waldemar Priebe, our founder. \n\n**_Nasdaq Capital Markets Listing Qualifications_**\n\nOn August 17, 2023, the Company was notified by the Listing Qualifications Department (the “Staff”) of the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) that the Company was not in compliance with the minimum $2,500,000 stockholders’ equity requirement for continued listing set forth in Listing Rule 5550(b).

(“HPI”) and The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (“UTMDACC”) and own pursuant to a collaboration and asset purchase agreement with Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Reata”).\n\nWe believe our lead drug candidate, Berubicin, may be a significant development in the treatment of Glioblastoma and other CNS malignancies, and if approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), could give Glioblastoma patients an important new therapeutic alternative to the current standard of care. Glioblastomas are tumors that arise from astrocytes, which are star-shaped cells making up the supportive tissue of the brain. These tumors are usually highly malignant (cancerous) because the cells reproduce quickly, and they are supported by a large network of blood vessels. Berubicin is an anthracycline, which is a class of drugs that are among the most powerful and extensively used chemotherapy drugs known. Based on limited clinical data, we believe Berubicin is the first anthracycline that appears to cross the blood brain barrier (“BBB”) in significant concentrations targeting brain cancer cells. While our focus is currently on the development of Berubicin, we are also in the process of attempting to secure intellectual property rights to additional compounds that we plan to develop into drugs to treat CNS and other cancers.\n\n17  \n---  \n  \nBerubicin was discovered at UTMDACC by Dr. Waldemar Priebe, the founder of the Company. Through a series of transactions, Berubicin was initially licensed to Reata. Reata initiated several Phase I clinical trials with Berubicin for CNS malignancies, one of which was for malignant gliomas, but subsequently allowed their IND with the FDA to lapse for strategic reasons. This required us to obtain a new IND for Berubicin before beginning further clinical trials. On December 17, 2020, we announced that our IND application with the FDA for Berubicin for the treatment of Glioblastoma Multiforme was in effect. We initiated this trial for patient enrollment during the second quarter of 2021 with the first patient dosed during the third quarter of 2021 to investigate the safety and efficacy of Berubicin in adults with Glioblastoma Multiforme who have failed first-line therapy. The first patient on the trial was treated during the third quarter of 2021. Correspondence between the Company and the FDA resulted in modifications to our initial trial design, including designating overall survival (OS) as the primary endpoint of the study. OS is a rigorous endpoint that the FDA has recognized as a basis for approval of oncology drugs when a statistically significant improvement can be shown relative to a randomized control arm. \n\nThe current trial being conducted will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Berubicin in patients with Glioblastoma Multiforme who have failed primary treatment for their disease, and results will be compared to the safety and efficacy of Lomustine, a current standard of care in this setting, with a 2 to 1 randomization of the 252 patients to Berubicin or Lomustine. Patients receiving Berubicin are administered a 2-hour IV infusion of 7.5 mg/m2 berubicin hydrochloride daily for three consecutive days followed by 18 days off (a 21-day cycle). Lomustine is administered orally once every six weeks. The trial design included a pre-planned, non-binding interim futility analysis. We reached the criteria required by the study protocol to conduct this interim futility analysis, which an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (“DSMB”) is responsible for conducting. The DSMB’s charter mandated that they review the primary endpoint, Overall Survival, as well as secondary endpoints and safety data to determine whether the efficacy data for the risk-benefit profile warrants modification or discontinuation of the study. On December 18, 2023, we released the DSMB’s recommendation which was to continue the study without modification. Management remains blinded to the data underlying the recommendation of the DSMB. Even if Berubicin is approved, there is no assurance that patients will choose an infusion treatment, as compared to the current standard of care, which requires oral administration.\n\nWe do not have manufacturing facilities and all manufacturing activities are contracted out to third parties. Additionally, we do not have a sales organization.\n\nOn November 21, 2017, we entered into a Collaboration and Asset Purchase Agreement with Reata (the “Reata Agreement”). Pursuant to the Reata Agreement we purchased all of Reata’s intellectual property and development data regarding Berubicin, including all trade secrets, knowhow, confidential information and other intellectual property rights.\n\nOn December 28, 2017, we obtained the rights to a worldwide, exclusive royalty-bearing, license to the chemical compound commonly known as Berubicin from HPI in an agreement we refer to as the HPI License. HPI is affiliated with Dr. Priebe, who controls a majority of our shares. Under the HPI License we obtained the exclusive right to develop certain chemical compounds for use in the treatment of cancer anywhere in the world. In the HPI License we agreed to pay HPI: (i) development fees of $750,000 over a three-year period beginning November 2019; (ii) a 2% royalty on net sales; (iii) a $50,000 per year license fee; (iv) milestone payments of $100,000 upon the commencement of a Phase II trial and $1.0 million upon the approval of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) for Berubicin; and (v) 6,667 shares of our common stock. The patents we licensed from HPI expired in March 2020. On May 14, 2024, the Company provided notice to HPI of its intent to terminate the HPI License effective on or about July 14, 2024.\n\nOn June 10, 2020, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation (“ODD”) for Berubicin for the treatment of malignant gliomas. ODD from the FDA is available for drugs targeting diseases with less than 200,000 cases per year. ODD may enable market exclusivity of 7 years from the date of approval of a NDA in the United States. During that period the FDA generally could not approve another product containing the same drug for the same designated indication. Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same active ingredient for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. The ODD now constitutes our primary intellectual property protections although the Company is exploring if there are other patents that could be filed related to Berubicin to extend additional protections.\n\n18  \n---  \n  \nWe believe we have obtained all rights and intellectual property necessary to develop Berubicin. As stated earlier, it is our plan to obtain additional intellectual property covering other compounds which, subject to the receipt of additional financing, may be developed into drugs for brain and other cancers.\n\nOn January 10, 2020, we entered into a Patent and Technology License Agreement (the “WP1244 Agreement”) with The Board of Regents of The University of Texas System, an agency of the State of Texas, on behalf of the UTMDACC. Pursuant to the WP1244 Agreement, we obtained a royalty-bearing, worldwide, exclusive license to certain intellectual property rights, including patent rights, related to our portfolio of WP1244 drug technology. In consideration, we must make payments to UTMDACC including an up-front license fee, annual maintenance fee, milestone payments and royalty payments (including minimum annual royalties) for sales of licensed products developed under the WP1244 Agreement. The term of the WP1244 Agreement expires on the last to occur of: (a) the expiration of all patents subject to the WP1244 Agreement, or (b) fifteen years after execution; provided that UTMDACC has the right to terminate the WP1244 Agreement in the event that we fail to meet certain commercial diligence milestones. We have not met the commercial diligence milestones and have not paid the annual maintenance fee required as of the date hereof. On April 25, 2024, UTMDACC provided notice to us if its intent to terminate the WP1244 Agreement if we fail to pay the annual maintenance fee of $50,000, as well as $1,300 in expenses. As of the date hereof, the we have not determined whether to cure the foregoing defaults. If we fail to cure the defaults, on May 25, 2024, the WP1244 Agreement will terminate.\n\nOn May 7, 2020, pursuant to the WP1244 portfolio license agreement described above, the Company entered into a Sponsored Research Agreement with UTMDACC to perform research relating to novel anticancer agents targeting CNS malignancies. The Company agreed to fund approximately $1,134,000 over a two-year period. The Company paid and recorded $334,000 in 2020 related to this agreement in research and development expenses in the Company’s Statements of Operations. The remaining $800,000 was paid in 2021. The principal investigator for this agreement is Dr. Priebe. The work conducted under this Sponsored Research Agreement has produced a new mesylate salt of WP1244 termed WP1874. We believe the enhanced solubility of this salt may increase its ability to be formulated for use in an IV infusion, while maintaining similar potency and toxicity characteristics. As such, WP1874 will be the primary focus in any development efforts of the WP1244 portfolio. This agreement was extended and expired on March 31, 2023.\n\n**Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023**\n\n_General and Administrative Expense_\n\nGeneral and administrative expense was approximately $1,114,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to approximately $1,359,000 for the comparable period in 2023. The decrease in general and administrative expense was mainly attributable to decreases of approximately $118,000 in legal and professional expenses, $20,000 in insurance expenses and $58,000 in stock compensation, $39,000 in travel expenses and $29,000 in other general and administrative expenses, which were offset by increases of approximately $19,000 in marketing and advertising expenses.\n\n_Research and Development Expense_\n\nResearch and development expense was approximately $2,430,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to approximately $3,568,000 for the comparable period in 2023. The decrease in research and development expenses during the period were mainly attributed to the timing of research organization (CRO) expenses related to continued progress with our Phase II clinical trial. Our CRO expenditures are primarily for labor related to activating selected trial sites, managing patient enrollment processes, collecting and managing data from patient treatments throughout the trial, processing reimbursement to the sites for patient treatment, and assisting with necessary submissions to amend the IND. CRO expenditures are expected to remain relatively consistent with the current quarter throughout the remainder of the trial as site activation efforts and the associated costs thereof transition into reimbursing clinical trial sites for patient treatment costs as site and patient enrollment increases. We expect to incur increased research and development costs in the future as we continue our Phase II clinical trial.\n\n19  \n---  \n  \n_Net Loss_\n\nThe net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was approximately $3,545,000 compared to approximately $4,932,000 for the comparable period in 2023. The change in net loss is attributable to an decrease in CRO expenses related to continued progress with our Phase II clinical trial, as well as decreases in legal and professional fees and other expenses. \n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nOn March 31, 2024, we had cash of approximately $815,000 and we had a working capital deficit of approximately $4,490,000. We fund our operations from proceeds from equity sales.\n\nOn January 29, 2024, we entered into a placement agency agreement with A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners (“AGP”) and Maxim Group LLC (“Maxim”) for the public offering of (i) 2,215,667 shares of our common stock; (ii) pre-funded warrants to purchase 11,117,667 shares of common stock; (iii) Series A Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 13,333,334 shares of common stock; and (iv) Series B Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 13,333,334 shares of common stock. The combined purchase price of one share of common stock and accompanying Series A & B common warrants was $0.30 and the combined purchase price of one pre-funded warrant and accompanying Series A & B common warrants was $0.299 (with the pre-funded warrants having an exercise price of $0.001). The closing of the sales of these securities occurred on February 1, 2024. The gross proceeds from the offering were approximately $4.0 million, before deducting the placement agent’s fees and other offering expenses.\n\nOur plan of operations is primarily focused on completing a clinical trial for Berubicin. We estimate that we will require additional financing of approximately $13 to $15 million to complete the potentially pivotal Phase 2 trial for Berubicin (taking into account our cash on hand as of March 31, 2024 of approximately $0.8 million) plus such additional working capital to fund our operations during the pendency of the trial (with such operations estimated at $4.5 to $5.0 million per annum). If capital is available to fund WP1244/WP1874 preclinical work to prepare for a Phase 1 trial, we would need to raise an additional $5.0 million to support near-term development of that program. Our current expectation is that our cash on hand is sufficient to fund our operations into the latter half of the second quarter of 2024. The timing and costs of clinical trials are difficult to predict and trial plans may change in response to evolving circumstances and as such the foregoing estimates may prove to be inaccurate.\n\nWe will need to raise very significant additional capital in the near term in order to meet our past due and future obligations and execute our business plan. If we are unable to raise sufficient funds, we will be required to develop and implement an alternative plan to further extend payables, reduce overhead or scale back our business plan until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further operations. There can be no assurance that such a plan will be successful and if it is not successful we may need to cease operations entirely.\n\n**Summary of Cash Flows**\n\n_Cash used in operating activities_\n\nNet cash used in operating activities was approximately $3,192,000 and $4,825,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and mainly included payments made for clinical trial preparation, officer compensation, insurance, marketing and professional fees to our consultants, attorneys and accountants. \n\n_Cash provided by financing activities_\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities was approximately $3,459,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, related to the sale of common stock and exercise of warrants, which were offset by the repayment of notes payable. Net cash used in financing activities was approximately $120,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, related to the repayment of notes payable, which were offset by the exercise of warrants.\n\n20  \n---  \n  \n**Off-balance Sheet Arrangements**\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\n\n**Purchase Commitments**\n\nWe do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures, although we are required to pay certain milestones fees to HPI as described in the section “Overview” above.\n\n**JOBS Act Accounting Election**\n\nThe Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, exempts an “emerging growth company” such as us from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\n\n**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements, including the notes thereto. As a result, management is required to routinely make judgments and estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or assumptions. Management determined there were no critical accounting estimates.\n\n**Item 3.** | **Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk**  \n---|---  \n  \nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. \n\n**Item 4.** | **Controls and Procedures**  \n---|---  \n  \n**Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting**\n\nWe maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that material information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer, who serves as our principal executive officer, and our chief financial officer, who serves as our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\n\n21  \n---  \n  \nUnder the supervision, and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness, as of March 31, 2024, of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nBased upon such evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer have concluded that, as of March 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were, and continue to be, ineffective because of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting due to lack of segregation of duties (resulting from the limited number of personnel available), limited access to timely and complete information regarding the status of costs incurred in the activation of investigational sites and costs from treating patients in our study which is a result of the use of a third-party Contract Research Organization (“CRO”) to manage the study, and the lack of formal documentation of our control environment. Management is commencing actions to address the lack of formal documentation of our control environment, although this will not address the lack of segregation of duties. Management is also working with the CRO to improve the timeliness and completeness of the data reported to the Company to address this material weakness, as well as conducting increased analytical analysis of such data to be performed by the Company.\n\nIn light of the material weakness described above, we continue to perform additional analysis and other post-closing procedures to ensure our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, we believe that the financial statements included in this report fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. Additional experienced personnel will be hired in the accounting and finance department, appropriate consultants will be retained, and our accounting system will be upgraded as soon as it becomes economically feasible and sustainable.\n\nOther than as described above, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent calendar quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n22  \n---  \n  \n**PART II - OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n**Item 1.** | **Legal Proceedings**  \n---|---  \n  \nFrom time to time in the ordinary course of our business, we may be involved in legal proceedings, the outcomes of which may not be determinable. The results of litigation are inherently unpredictable. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, require significant amounts of management time and result in diversion of significant resources. We are not able to estimate an aggregate amount or range of reasonably possible losses for those legal matters for which losses are not probable and estimable. We have insurance policies covering potential losses where such coverage is cost effective.\n\nWe are not at this time involved in any legal proceedings.\n\n**Item 1A.** | **Risk Factors**  \n---|---  \n  \nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors set forth below and discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC, which are incorporated herein by reference. The risks described in such reports are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.\n\n**If we are unable to maintain compliance with the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market by July 15, 2024, our common stock will be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and could make it more difficult for shareholders to sell their shares.**\n\nOur common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, and we are therefore subject to its continued listing requirements, including requirements with respect to the market value of publicly-held shares, market value of listed shares, minimum bid price per share, and minimum stockholder's equity, among others, and requirements relating to board and committee independence. If we fail to satisfy one or more of the requirements, we may be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market.\n\nOn August 17, 2023, we were notified by the Listing Qualifications Department (the “Staff”) of the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) that we were not in compliance with the minimum $2,500,000 stockholders’ equity requirement for continued listing set forth in Listing Rule 5550(b). On February 27, 2024, the Staff notified us that we did not comply with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement set forth under Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). On February 14, 2024, we were notified that because we had not regained compliance with the Nasdaq equity requirement, our securities would be delisted unless it requested a hearing. On February 21, 2024, we requested a hearing, which was held on April 18, 2024.\n\nOn May 6, 2024, we received notification from the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (“Panel”) that it has granted an extension until July 15, 2024, to demonstrate compliance with Listing Rules 5550(a)(2) and 5550(b). We intend to implement a plan to meet the milestones set forth by the Panel prior to July 15, 2024, but such plan will require, among other items, the completion of a significant financing for which we have no commitments.\n\nDelisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market would adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing through the public or private sale of equity securities, may significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and may negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock. Delisting also could have other negative results, including the potential loss of employee confidence, the loss of institutional investors or interest in business development opportunities.\n\n23  \n---  \n  \n**Item 2.** | **Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds**  \n---|---  \n  \nNone.\n\n**Item 3.** | **Defaults Upon Senior Securities**  \n---|---  \n  \nNone.\n\n**Item 4.** | **Mine Safety Disclosures**  \n---|---  \n  \nNot applicable.\n\n**Item 5.** | **Other Information**  \n---|---  \n  \nDuring the period covered by this Quarterly Report, none of the Company’s directors or executive officers has adopted or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (each as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).\n\nOn January 10, 2020, Company entered into a Patent and Technology License Agreement (“Agreement”) with The Board of Regents of The University of Texas System, an agency of the State of Texas, on behalf of The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (“UTMDACC”). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company obtained a royalty-bearing, worldwide, exclusive license to certain intellectual property rights, including patent rights, related to the Company’s recently announced WP1244 drug technology. In consideration, the Company must make payments to UTMDACC including an up-front license fee, annual maintenance fee, milestone payments and royalty payments (including minimum annual royalties) on sales of licensed products developed under the Agreement. The term of the Agreement expires on the last to occur of: (a) the expiration of all patents subject to the Agreement, or (b) fifteen years after execution; provided that UTMDACC has the right to terminate this Agreement in the event that the Company fails to meet certain commercial diligence milestones. The commercial diligence milestones are as follows (i) initiated PC toxicology to support filing of Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) or New Drug Application (“NDA”) for the Licensed Product within the eighteen (18) month period following the Effective Date (ii) file and IND for the Licensed Product within three (3) year period following the Effective Date and (iii) Commencement of Phase I Study within the five (5) year period following the Effective Date. The Company has not met the commercial diligence milestones and has not paid the annual maintenance fee required as of the date hereof. On April 25, 2024, UTMDACC provided notice to the Company if its intent to terminate the WP1244 Agreement if the Company fails to pay the annual maintenance fee of $50,000, as well as $1,300 in expenses. As of the date hereof, the Company has not determined whether to cure the foregoing defaults. If the Company fails to cure the defaults, on May 25, 2024, the WP1244 Agreement will terminate. There are no termination penalty provisions in the Agreement.\n\nOn December 28, 2017, the Company entered into a Technology Rights and Development Agreement with Houston Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“HPI”). Under the HPI License the Company obtained the exclusive right to develop certain chemical compounds for use in the treatment of cancer anywhere in the world. On May 14, 2024, the Company provided notice to HPI of its intent to terminate the HPI License effective on or about July 14, 2024. As the patents under HPI License have expired, the Company does not believe the termination of the HPI License will effect its ability to continue its development of Berubicin. There are no penalty provisions in the HPI License related to such termination.\n\n24  \n---  \n  \n**Item 6.** | **Exhibits**  \n---|---  \n  \n**INDEX TO EXHIBITS**\n\n**Exhibit** **Number** | **Description**  \n---|---  \n3.1 | [Certificate of Amendment to the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of CNS Pharmaceuticals, Inc., filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1729427/000168316824002961/cns_0301.htm) (incorporated by reference to exhibit 3.1 of the Form 8-K filed May 3, 2024)  \n4.1 | [Form of Series A Common Warrant issued in January 2024 offering](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1729427/000168316824000660/cns_ex0401.htm) (incorporated by reference to exhibit 4.1 of the Form 8-K filed February 2, 2024)  \n4.2 | [Form of Series B Common Warrant issued in January 2024 offering](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1729427/000168316824000660/cns_ex0402.htm) (incorporated by reference to exhibit 4.2 of the Form 8-K filed February 2, 2024)  \n4.3 | [Form of Pre-Funded Warrant issued in January 2024 offering](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1729427/000168316824000660/cns_ex0403.htm) (incorporated by reference to exhibit 4.3 of the Form 8-K filed February 2, 2024)  \n10.1 | [Placement Agent Agreement dated January 29, 2024 by and among CNS Pharmaceuticals, Inc., A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners and Maxim Group LLC](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1729427/000168316824000660/cns_ex0101.htm) (incorporated by reference to exhibit 1.1 of the Form 8-K filed February 2, 2024)  \n10.2 | [Form of Securities Purchase Agreement](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1729427/000168316824000660/cns_ex1001.htm) (incorporated by reference to exhibit 10.1 of the Form 8-K filed February 2, 2024)  \n10.3 | [Form of Amendment to Common Stock Purchase Warrants](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1729427/000168316824000660/cns_ex1002.htm) (incorporated by reference to exhibit 10.2 of the Form 8-K filed February 2, 2024)  \n10.4 | [CNS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2020 Equity Plan (as amended April 30, 2024)](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1729427/000168316824002961/cns_1001.htm) (incorporated by reference to exhibit 10.1 of the Form 8-K filed May 3, 2024)  \n31.1* | [Certification of the Principal Executive Officer pursuant to Rule 13a-14(a) or 15d-14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.](#cns_ex3101.htm)  \n31.2* | [Certification of the Principal Financial Officer pursuant to Rule 13a-14(a) or 15d-14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.](#cns_ex3102.htm)  \n32.1*(1) | [Certification of the Principal Executive Officer pursuant to 18 U.S.C.
