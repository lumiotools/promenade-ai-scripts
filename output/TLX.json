Telix’s development program will initially focus on the treatment of bladder cancer, rounding out its urology franchise, which includes late-stage therapeutic programs for kidney and prostate cancers.\n\nFAP is a pan-cancer marker expressed in the tumor microenvironment of epithelial cancers and on the surface of some specific cancer types, including sarcomas and mesotheliomas.\n\nTelix has entered into asset purchase and exclusive worldwide in-licence agreements for a suite of clinically validated FAP-targeting therapeutic and precision medicine (diagnostic) radiopharmaceutical candidates developed by Professor Frank Roesch and his collaborators at the Institute of Nuclear Chemistry at the Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz, Germany. The next-generation therapeutic assets are differentiated by a novel structure that drives extended tumor retention while minimizing off-target uptake, potentially overcoming the limitations seen with first-generation compounds. The diagnostic and therapeutic compounds have been clinically validated in over 500 patients across a variety of solid tumors and are the subject of multiple peer-review publications1.\n\nRichard Valeix, Chief Executive Officer, Telix Therapeutics, said, “We are delighted to partner with Professor Roesch and his team on this exciting frontier of radiopharmaceuticals. Telix will gain access to assets that are already significantly de-risked, with clinically demonstrated safety profile and efficacy. We will develop these assets in bladder cancer as a primary indication, in line with our focus on urological cancers, and explore the potential of FAP as a pan-cancer target, adding significant value to our pipeline.”\n\nFrank Roesch, professor emeritus, said, “Over the past two years, our FAP inhibitor-based theranostic candidates have seen extensive preclinical and clinical evaluation. Collaboration has been very important, and I am grateful to many colleagues around the world who have contributed to advancing the molecules to this point. We are excited to be working with Telix as a leader in radiopharmaceutical innovation, development and commercialization, to further develop and bring these drug candidates to regulatory approval. The ultimate goal is to improve the diagnostic precision and therapeutic outcomes of cancer patients in need.”\n\nVisit the Telix corporate website to view an interactive explainer on FAP: [Attack on Stroma](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=7Vyjcnove3GGTZAxFTxK7C7p_xz65Ib54NPjm7dzBpvSpA8SVL7OLEqgTtzyKw5GASBcEeW0rxqdUilPjGkQIoLFQVQXXORjyhcnOmqni7IxekPZvwXXT76pdXwG7_4ziYR59DbFihqLScn164bawdNpaZ1yBv5aIWN8mq9O2LqaL5GnmIy3X-qSG5vFj9Di8_nJQz7YWxOYQfPSWWFx6fRSdtrCUsh2rU5ZLjUdpw0=)\n\n**Deal terms and conditions**\n\nUnder an exclusive worldwide licence agreement with a German company controlled by Professor Roesch, SCV GmbH, and a concurrently-signed asset purchase agreement with German company Medianezia GmbH, which collectively hold the intellectual property rights to the FAP assets, Telix will pay €7 million in cash as of closing (inclusive of €700,000 paid at or prior to the signing of the agreements) and a further €3 million in 12 months’ time subject to any potential indemnity setoff. Telix will pay up to a further €132 million contingent upon achievement of certain clinical development and regulatory milestones related to both the diagnostic and therapeutic products under both agreements. An additional €20 million will be payable under the licence agreement on achievement of certain commercial milestones related to the diagnostic product; as well as royalties on net sales in the low to mid-single digits on the diagnostic product and an earlier formulation of the therapeutic product, if used.\n\nClosing of the licence agreement and asset purchase agreement is expected to occur simultaneously and is subject to customary closing conditions including, with respect to the acquisition of assets, assignment of patents rights and foreign direct investment (FDI) approval of Germany’s Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action. Telix cannot guarantee these transactions will close in any specific timeframe or upon the terms summarised herein, if at all.\n\n**About Telix Pharmaceuticals Limited **\n\nTelixTelix is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapeutic and diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals and associated medical technologies.

This provides Telix with both an additional commercial source of 225Ac and access to a platform technology that enables highly efficient, scalable isotope production for use in the development of next generation targeted alpha therapies (TATs), a strategic focus for Telix.\n\nEZAG is one of the world’s largest providers of isotope technology for medical, scientific and industrial use and a long-term partner of Telix. By combining EZAG’s technology with Telix’s rapidly expanding global manufacturing footprint, the collaboration will enhance capacity to produce 225Ac, to accelerate the development of Telix’s alpha therapy candidates and support eventual commercial demand.\n\n“This new collaboration is a significant step in the implementation of our actinium strategy,” said Dr. Harald Hasselmann, Chief Executive Officer of Eckert & Ziegler. “Eckert & Ziegler and Telix have a long-standing and multi-faceted business relationship. Combining the strengths of two leading players in radiopharmaceuticals and isotopes will create a collaboration for the supply of actinium-225-based radiotherapeutics, that are of high interest worldwide.”\n\nRaphaël Ortiz, Chief Executive Officer, Telix International, added: “Targeted alpha therapy is regarded as the next frontier in the field of radiopharmaceuticals and is a priority R&D focus for Telix. This collaboration will enable us to unlock the early investment we have made in alpha therapy candidates and further leverage our manufacturing facilities worldwide, including in Brussels South, for the production of this important alpha emitting isotope.”\n\nAlpha emitters such as 225Ac have the potential to deliver high amounts of energy to cancer tissue, while their short range can reduce the risk of damage to surrounding healthy cells, increasing the selectivity and potency of radiation treatment. In contrast, beta emitters such as lutetium-177 (177Lu) and iodine-131 (131I) have a longer penetration, which may suit bulky metastatic disease. The development of TATs is a priority research and development focus area for Telix and is highly complementary to the Company’s existing late-stage therapeutic pipeline. Experts believe the demand for 225Ac will increase significantly over the next decade.\n\nTelix’s R&D commitment to TAT is demonstrated in an extensive clinical-stage TAT pipeline:\n\nIn addition, the completed OPALESCENCE[ _[6]_](https://telixpharma.com/news-views/telix-and-eckert-ziegler-to-partner-on-actinium-225-production-technology/#_ftn6) and PERTINENCE[ _[7]_](https://telixpharma.com/news-views/telix-and-eckert-ziegler-to-partner-on-actinium-225-production-technology/#_ftn7) investigator-initiated trials have demonstrated CAIX-targeting and dosimetry proof-of-concept for alpha therapy in triple-negative breast cancer, and non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, respectively, using TLX250-CDx PET[ _[8]_](https://telixpharma.com/news-views/telix-and-eckert-ziegler-to-partner-on-actinium-225-production-technology/#_ftn8).\n\nRead the full media release [_here_](https://www.prnewswire.com/apac/news-releases/telix-and-eckert--ziegler-to-partner-on-actinium-225-production-technology-302303860.html)\n\n[ _[1]_](https://telixpharma.com/news-views/telix-and-eckert-ziegler-to-partner-on-actinium-225-production-technology/#_ftnref1) Prostate-specific membrane antigen.\n\n[_[2]_](https://telixpharma.com/news-views/telix-and-eckert-ziegler-to-partner-on-actinium-225-production-technology/#_ftnref2) Carbonic anhydrase IX.\n\n[_[3]_](https://telixpharma.com/news-views/telix-and-eckert-ziegler-to-partner-on-actinium-225-production-technology/#_ftnref3) TLX102 labelled with astatine-211.

          "content": "[Skip to content](#lfg-main-content)\n\n# Release Details\n\n## \n\nTelix Welcomes CMS Decision to Improve Payments for Diagnostic Radiopharmaceuticals\n\n04 Nov 2024 \n\n[PDF Version](/node/8666/pdf)\n\nTelix today welcomes the announcement by the United States (U.S.) Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) that it will pay separately for specialised diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals[[1]](https://telixpharmaceuticals.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/telix-welcomes-cms-decision-improve-payments-diagnostic#_ftn1) for Medicare Fee for Service patients in the hospital outpatient setting, beyond the transitional pass-through payment period (“pass-through”). This is a significant decision for patients and hospitals, with the change facilitating equitable access to advanced imaging agents for all patients into the future. \n\nIn 2025, the separate payments under the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) will be based on Mean Unit Cost (MUC), derived from hospital claims data and apply to any specialised diagnostic radiopharmaceutical without pass-through status and with a threshold per day cost greater than US$630. \n\nThe new rule ensures consistent reimbursement for Medicare Fee for Service patients, following expiry of pass-through status. For physicians and patients in the hospital outpatient setting this will enable purchasing decisions to be made based on the latest clinically significant diagnostic tools and evidence of utility, and not on purely on reimbursement structure. For commercial radiopharmaceutical innovators such as Telix, this provides greater certainty and consistency in pricing policy across all customer segments. \n\nThe new separate payment rule will apply to Illuccix® after its pass-through status expires, from July 1, 2025. It will also apply to Telix’s pipeline of investigational diagnostic imaging agents – TLX007-CDx, a new product for PSMA imaging of prostate cancer, TLX250-CDx (Zircaix®[[2]](https://telixpharmaceuticals.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/telix-welcomes-cms-decision-improve-payments-diagnostic#_ftn2)) for kidney cancer imaging, and TLX101-CDx (Pixclara®2) for brain cancer (glioma) imaging – if approved and reimbursed under CMS, and after pass-through expires.\n\nTelix has continued to invest in innovation in prostate cancer imaging for the benefit of physicians and patients. Should TLX007-CDx be approved in the U.S.[[3]](https://telixpharmaceuticals.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/telix-welcomes-cms-decision-improve-payments-diagnostic#_ftn3), Telix will be the only company with two PSMA-PET imaging agents on the market, enabling broader patient reach, including into currently underserved populations, and with greater flexibility to offer the product most suitable for a patient based on their clinical profile, indication and eligibility for reimbursement. This may be particularly beneficial for any Medicare patients currently subject to a copayment in hospital outpatient settings. \n\nKevin Richardson, Chief Executive Officer, Precision Medicine, Telix, said, “Telix welcomes the decision by CMS to unbundle payments for diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals, as it will provide certainty for patients and physicians seeking access to safe and effective diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals. Moreover, it will promote continued investment in bringing new imaging agents to market across a range of disease states, as there is a clear commercial pathway to recouping the investment in innovation and the significant infrastructure and operational costs of delivering high quality service to patients. As a leading innovator in precision medicine and diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals, we are pleased to see the reimbursement landscape change in favour of patients. This will ensure continued access to advanced imaging agents that provide meaningful information to drive treatment decisions and outcomes for cancer patients.” \n\nRead the full ASX release [here](https://telixpharma.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/TLX_CMS_payment_improvement_decision_for_radiopharma_diagnostics.pdf)\n\n[[1]](https://telixpharmaceuticals.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/telix-welcomes-cms-decision-improve-payments-diagnostic#_ftnref1) CMS press release 1 November 2024: <https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-announces-new-policies-reduce-maternal-mortality-increase-access-care-and-advance-health-equity>; CMS fact sheet 1 November 2024: <https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/cy-2025-medicare-hospital-outpatient-prospective-payment-system-and-ambulatory-surgical-center-0>\n\n[[2]](https://telixpharmaceuticals.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/telix-welcomes-cms-decision-improve-payments-diagnostic#_ftnref2) Brand name subject to final regulatory approval.\n\n[[3]](https://telixpharmaceuticals.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/telix-welcomes-cms-decision-improve-payments-diagnostic#_ftnref3) TLX007-CDx Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date March 24, 2025.
