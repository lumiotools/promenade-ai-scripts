Milne, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer at Astria Therapeutics. “We are excited about the opportunity for navenibart to be the market-leading therapy for HAE. We expect that navenibart’s profile, including infrequent dosing, low risk of pain, and trusted mechanism and modality, will give both patients and physicians confidence when choosing a medicine for HAE. We are engaged with regulators on finalizing our Phase 3 design and have manufactured clinical supplies for the Phase 3, which we expect to initiate in Q1 2025. STAR-0310 is also progressing as planned. We are on track with our IND submission before year-end and plan to initiate a Phase 1a trial in Q1 2025. We are intentionally designing the STAR-0310 program to capitalize on the learnings and address the liabilities of other OX40 and OX40L therapies to create what we believe will be the best-overall OX40 program. We plan to maintain this momentum and are looking forward to an exciting 2025.” \n\n**Navenibart (STAR-0215)**\n\n  * Navenibart was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Orphan Medicinal Product Designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of HAE. \n  * Astria is in discussion with global regulatory authorities and is finalizing the design for the Phase 3 trial of navenibart in people with HAE. Clinical supplies have been manufactured and are ready to support the Phase 3 trial. Pending regulatory feedback, the Company plans to initiate the Phase 3 program in Q1 2025 and expects top-line results by year-end 2026. The goal is to enable patients to choose what works best for them by developing both Q3M and Q6M dosing options. The Company believes navenibart will be life-changing for HAE patients and has the opportunity to become the market leading HAE treatment. \n  * Initial proof-of-concept results from the ALPHA-STAR Phase 1b/2 trial of navenibart in people with HAE demonstrate that administration of navenibart once or twice over six months reduced monthly attack rates by 90-96% in HAE patients at 3 and 6 months, supporting the potential for chronic administration of navenibart two or four times per year. Additionally, navenibart was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events and no discontinuations. The Company plans to report final data from ALPHA-STAR target enrollment in Q4 of 2024. \n  * All of the original 16 target enrollment patients from ALPHA-STAR have entered the ALPHA-SOLAR long-term open-label trial. Initial safety and efficacy data from ALPHA-SOLAR, with Q3M and Q6M administration, are expected mid-2025. \n  * Astria presented initial results from the ALPHA-STAR trial of navenibart at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venerology in September 2024 and Global Angioedema Forum (GAF) in October 2024 in Copenhagen, Denmark. Astria also presented the design of the ALPHA-SOLAR Long-Term Open-Label trial at GAF. \n  * Results presented at the American College of Allergy Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) conference in October 2024 and the Canadian Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (CSACI) conference in November 2024 demonstrated that navenibart induced rapid improvements in Quality of Life (QoL) and HAE attack rates in patients in the ALPHA-STAR trial. \n\n\n\n**STAR-0310**\n\n  * Astria is developing STAR-0310, a high affinity monoclonal antibody OX40 antagonist that incorporates YTE technology, for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). \n  * Preclinical results support the potential for STAR-0310 to have the best-in-class OX40 inhibitor profile. STAR-0310 exhibits a long mean half-life of 26 days in cynomolgus monkeys, compared to 10-14 days in a typical non-half-life extended IgG1 antibody, and has comparable potency to rocatinlimab. Additionally, by design there is significantly less antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) with STAR-0310 compared to rocatinlimab. Reduction in ADCC activity has the potential for a more favorable safety profile and potentially wider therapeutic window for STAR-0310. \n  * Astria is on track with our IND submission to FDA for STAR-0310 before year-end 2024 and plans to initiate a Phase 1a clinical trial in healthy subjects in the first quarter of 2025, with early proof-of-concept results expected in the third quarter of 2025. \n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**Cash Position:** As of September 30, 2024, Astria had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $344.3 million, compared to $246.5 million as of December 31, 2023. The Company expects that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to fund its operations into mid-2027, including all navenibart program activities through the completion of a planned Phase 3 pivotal trial as well as advancing the STAR-0310 OX40 program through submission of an IND and early proof-of-concept results from a Phase 1a clinical trial. Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $28.0 million, compared to $14.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. \n\n**R &D Expenses:** Research and development expenses were $20.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $13.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily associated with the STAR-0310 program’s manufacturing and IND-enabling activities in addition to an increase in external expenses to support a planned Phase 3 pivotal trial for navenibart. \n\n**G &A Expenses:** General and administrative expenses were $8.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $6.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses was attributable to stock-based compensation and company growth to support the advancement of our programs. \n\n**Operating Loss:** Loss from operations was $29.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $20.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. \n\n**Net Loss:** Net loss was $24.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $17.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. \n\n**Net Loss Per Share Basic and Diluted:** Net loss per share basic and diluted was $0.42 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss basic and diluted of $0.63 per share for the three months ended September 30, 2023. \n\n**About Astria Therapeutics:**\n\nAstria Therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company, and our mission is to bring life-changing therapies to patients and families affected by allergic and immunological diseases. Our lead program, navenibart (STAR-0215), is a monoclonal antibody inhibitor of plasma kallikrein in clinical development for the treatment of hereditary angioedema.
