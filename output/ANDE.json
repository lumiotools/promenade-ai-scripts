Reports Strong Third Quarter Results\n\nMAUMEE, Ohio, Nov. 4, 2024 /[PRNewswire](http://www.prnewswire.com/)/ -- The Andersons, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE) announces financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n[ ![The Andersons, Inc. logo. \\(PRNewsFoto/The Andersons, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/74436/THE_ANDERSONS_LOGO.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/74436/THE_ANDERSONS_LOGO.html)\n\n**Third Quarter Highlights:**\n\n  * **Company reported net income attributable to The Andersons of $27 million, or $0.80 per diluted share and adjusted net income of $25 million, or $0.72 per diluted share**\n  * **Adjusted EBITDA was $97 million, producing a record for the third quarter **\n  * **Renewables reported best-ever third quarter pretax income of $53 million and pretax income attributable to The Andersons of $28 million on strong operating performance and ethanol margins**\n  * **Trade generated increased year-over-year pretax income of $26 million and adjusted pretax income of $23 million**\n\n\n\n\"Overall, we are pleased with our third quarter results given the lower commodity prices and reduced volatility in the ag markets. Renewables had a very strong quarter with increased ethanol production and improved yields in a period of good but softening crush margins. Trade results were significantly better than last year and include improved performance in our assets. Increased volume and margins in our specialty liquids and manufactured product lines resulted in improved results in Nutrient & Industrial,\" said President and CEO Bill Krueger. \"Harvest is almost complete due to the near-perfect harvest weather, with both higher-than-normal quality and above trend-line yields. We have been able to buy grain at good basis values which should allow for carry opportunities into 2025. We continue to see the benefits of our portfolio mix with well-placed assets, a growing specialty ingredients business, efficient ethanol plant performance and merchandising opportunities across our businesses.\"\n\n\"We continue to pursue growth opportunities. Most recently, we announced the closing of an $85 million investment for a 65% ownership interest in Skyland Grain, LLC, which operates a large grain and agronomy footprint spread across Southwest Kansas, Eastern Colorado, and the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles. These assets extend our geographic footprint and support our existing merchandising presence in the region,\" continued Krueger. \"In addition, we announced a significant investment in our leased facility at the port of Houston to improve our current grain export program and add capacity for storing and exporting soybean meal. We continue to make progress on our longer-term Renewables projects, which are focused on lowering the carbon intensity of our high-performing ethanol plants. In addition to these projects, we continue our investment philosophy to improve efficiency and add capacity at our existing plants, as well as acquisition opportunities, which are in line with our strategy and generate appropriate returns.\"\n\n**$ in millions, except per share amounts**  \n---  \n**Q3 2024** | **Q3 2023** | **Variance** | **YTD 2024** | **YTD 2023** | **Variance**  \n**Pretax Income** | **$ 62.2** | $ 38.4 | $ 23.8 | **$ 133.5** | $ 77.8 | $ 55.7  \n**Pretax Income Attributable to the Company 1** | **38.1** | 17.6 | 20.5 | **85.8** | 73.7 | 12.1  \n**Adjusted Pretax Income** **Attributable to the Company 1** | **34.6** | 10.1 | 24.5 | **86.1** | 90.7 | (4.6)  \n**Trade 1** | **22.7** | 5.4 | 17.3 | **41.0** | 36.3 | 4.7  \n**Renewables 1** | **28.5** | 26.3 | 2.2 | **63.8** | 65.0 | (1.2)  \n**Nutrient & Industrial** | **(6.1)** | (8.5) | 2.4 | **15.4** | 23.7 | (8.3)  \n**Other 1** | **(10.5)** | (13.1) | 2.6 | **(34.1)** | (34.3) | 0.2  \n**Net Income Attributable to the Company** | **27.4** | 9.7 | 17.7 | **68.9** | 50.0 | 18.9  \n**Adjusted Net Income Attributable to the Company 1** | **24.7** | 4.6 | 20.1 | **69.8** | 63.7 | 6.1  \n**Diluted Earnings Per Share (\"EPS\")** | **0.80** | 0.28 | 0.52 | **2.01** | 1.46 | 0.55  \n**Adjusted EPS 1** | **0.72** | 0.13 | 0.59 | **2.04** | 1.86 | 0.18  \n**EBITDA 1** | **101.0** | 77.8 | 23.2 | **246.6** | 210.4 | 36.2  \n**Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations 1 ** | **$ 97.4** | $ 70.3 | $ 27.1 | **$ 246.9** | $ 270.0 | $ (23.1)  \n1 Non-GAAP financial measures; see appendix for explanations and reconciliations.  \n  \n**Cash, Liquidity, and Long-Term Debt Management**\n\n\"Our businesses continue to generate consistent cash flows throughout the shift in ag markets, and our debt remains at a modest level,\" said Executive Vice President and CFO Brian Valentine. \"With the strong cash flows and lower commodity prices, we continue to show a higher-than-normal cash position at this point in the year. We remain well below our long-term debt to EBITDA target of less than 2.5 times and are pleased with the strength of our balance sheet. We continue to evaluate new growth investments and acquisitions in a variety of strategic projects. We anticipate increased spending on growth projects in the fourth quarter and into 2025, in addition to the Skyland investment.\"\n\nThe company used cash from operating activities of $2 million and generated cash from operating activities of $489 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash from operations before working capital changes in the same periods was $86 million and $50 million, respectively. Cash spent on capital projects in the quarter totaled $38 million, a $4 million increase from 2023. \n\n**_Third Quarter Segment Overview_**\n\n**Trade Results Resilient in Less Volatile Ag Markets**\n\nThe Trade segment recorded pretax income of $26 million and adjusted pretax income of $23 million for the quarter compared to pretax income of $8 million and adjusted pretax income of $5 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nResults from our grain asset footprint were better than the prior year, due to strong elevation margins and space income, primarily related to corn and wheat. Trade's growing specialty ingredients business continued to benefit from recent growth investments. The merchandising business remained profitable with well-supplied commodity markets and limited volatility. As expected, farmer engagement ramped up during the quarter to bring significant old crop bushels to market and forward sell new crop in anticipation of an early and robust harvest. For comparison, prior year results include a $19 million pretax loss on a foreign currency issue.\n\nThe portfolio mix of assets, ingredients and merchandising businesses provides a solid foundation to benefit from large crops and carry markets, as well as tight, demand-driven markets. Assets are well-positioned for an early and large harvest, which should allow us to buy bushels at low basis levels. Domestic specialty ingredient demand is also expected to stay solid and should continue to support recent capital growth investments.\n\nTrade's third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $38 million, compared to $21 million in 2023.\n\n**Renewables had Record Quarter on Efficient Operations and Favorable Ethanol Margins**\n\nThe Renewables segment reported pretax income of $53 million and pretax income attributable to the company of $28 million in the third quarter. For the same period in 2023, the segment reported a pretax income of $47 million and pretax income attributable to the company of $26 million.\n\nMargins on ethanol production improved year-over-year on significantly lower corn basis in the eastern plants, despite a reduction in ethanol board crush margins in the quarter. Production facilities continued to operate efficiently with increased volume and higher ethanol yields. Plant co-product values were lower, with feed ingredients following the overall price reduction of corn; however, feed ingredient demand improved year-over-year. Renewable diesel feedstock volumes continue to grow albeit with compressed margins on industry fundamentals. All four plants completed their semi-annual maintenance shutdowns in the third quarter. A favorable ethanol margin environment should continue, supported by exports, higher blending rates and continued lower corn basis levels in the east.\n\nRenewables had third quarter EBITDA of $65 million in 2024, compared to $60 million in 2023.\n\n**Nutrient & Industrial Improved in Seasonally Quiet Quarter**\n\nThe Nutrient & Industrial segment reported a pretax loss of $6 million, compared to a loss of $8 million in 2023. Overall volumes improved during a seasonally slow third quarter, but margins in base nutrients have reset to more normalized levels and did not repeat the outsized margin opportunities seen in recent years. The engineered granules business saw significant improvement in the quarter on higher sales volume and margins, with continued focus on operational improvements in this business. Looking forward, the fourth quarter should benefit from high yields and an early harvest, allowing for fall applications.\n\nNutrient & Industrial's third quarter EBITDA was $5 million compared to breakeven EBITDA in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Income Taxes; Corporate**\n\nThe company recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 17% for the quarter. This rate was impacted by the tax treatment of noncontrolling interests and federal tax credits. We anticipate a full-year adjusted effective rate of approximately 14% - 18%.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe company will host a webcast on Tuesday, November 5, 2024, at 11 a.m. Eastern Time, to discuss its performance and provide its outlook for the remainder of 2024 and preliminary views for 2025.

Renewables had a very strong quarter with increased ethanol production and improved yields in a period of good but softening crush margins. Trade results were significantly better than last year and include improved performance in our assets. Increased volume and margins in our specialty liquids and manufactured product lines resulted in improved results in Nutrient & Industrial,\" said President and CEO Bill Krueger. \"Harvest is almost complete due to the near-perfect harvest weather, with both higher-than-normal quality and above trend-line yields. We have been able to buy grain at good basis values which should allow for carry opportunities into 2025. We continue to see the benefits of our portfolio mix with well-placed assets, a growing specialty ingredients business, efficient ethanol plant performance and merchandising opportunities across our businesses.\"\n\n\"We continue to pursue growth opportunities. Most recently, we announced the closing of an $85 million investment for a 65% ownership interest in Skyland Grain, LLC, which operates a large grain and agronomy footprint spread across Southwest Kansas, Eastern Colorado, and the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles. These assets extend our geographic footprint and support our existing merchandising presence in the region,\" continued Krueger. \"In addition, we announced a significant investment in our leased facility at the port of Houston to improve our current grain export program and add capacity for storing and exporting soybean meal. We continue to make progress on our longer-term Renewables projects, which are focused on lowering the carbon intensity of our high-performing ethanol plants. In addition to these projects, we continue our investment philosophy to improve efficiency and add capacity at our existing plants, as well as acquisition opportunities, which are in line with our strategy and generate appropriate returns.\"\n\n**$ in millions, except per share amounts**  \n---  \n**Q3 2024** | **Q3 2023** | **Variance** | **YTD 2024** | **YTD 2023** | **Variance**  \n**Pretax Income** | **$ 62.2** | $ 38.4 | $ 23.8 | **$ 133.5** | $ 77.8 | $ 55.7  \n**Pretax Income Attributable to the Company 1** | **38.1** | 17.6 | 20.5 | **85.8** | 73.7 | 12.1  \n**Adjusted Pretax Income** **Attributable to the Company 1** | **34.6** | 10.1 | 24.5 | **86.1** | 90.7 | (4.6)  \n**Trade 1** | **22.7** | 5.4 | 17.3 | **41.0** | 36.3 | 4.7  \n**Renewables 1** | **28.5** | 26.3 | 2.2 | **63.8** | 65.0 | (1.2)  \n**Nutrient & Industrial** | **(6.1)** | (8.5) | 2.4 | **15.4** | 23.7 | (8.3)  \n**Other 1** | **(10.5)** | (13.1) | 2.6 | **(34.1)** | (34.3) | 0.2  \n**Net Income Attributable to the Company** | **27.4** | 9.7 | 17.7 | **68.9** | 50.0 | 18.9  \n**Adjusted Net Income Attributable to the Company 1** | **24.7** | 4.6 | 20.1 | **69.8** | 63.7 | 6.1  \n**Diluted Earnings Per Share (\"EPS\")** | **0.80** | 0.28 | 0.52 | **2.01** | 1.46 | 0.55  \n**Adjusted EPS 1** | **0.72** | 0.13 | 0.59 | **2.04** | 1.86 | 0.18  \n**EBITDA 1** | **101.0** | 77.8 | 23.2 | **246.6** | 210.4 | 36.2  \n**Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations 1 ** | **$ 97.4** | $ 70.3 | $ 27.1 | **$ 246.9** | $ 270.0 | $ (23.1)  \n1 Non-GAAP financial measures; see appendix for explanations and reconciliations.  \n  \n**Cash, Liquidity, and Long-Term Debt Management**\n\n\"Our businesses continue to generate consistent cash flows throughout the shift in ag markets, and our debt remains at a modest level,\" said Executive Vice President and CFO Brian Valentine. \"With the strong cash flows and lower commodity prices, we continue to show a higher-than-normal cash position at this point in the year.

Trade's growing specialty ingredients business continued to benefit from recent growth investments. The merchandising business remained profitable with well-supplied commodity markets and limited volatility. As expected, farmer engagement ramped up during the quarter to bring significant old crop bushels to market and forward sell new crop in anticipation of an early and robust harvest. For comparison, prior year results include a $19 million pretax loss on a foreign currency issue.\n\nThe portfolio mix of assets, ingredients and merchandising businesses provides a solid foundation to benefit from large crops and carry markets, as well as tight, demand-driven markets. Assets are well-positioned for an early and large harvest, which should allow us to buy bushels at low basis levels. Domestic specialty ingredient demand is also expected to stay solid and should continue to support recent capital growth investments.\n\nTrade's third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $38 million, compared to $21 million in 2023.\n\n**Renewables had Record Quarter on Efficient Operations and Favorable Ethanol Margins**\n\nThe Renewables segment reported pretax income of $53 million and pretax income attributable to the company of $28 million in the third quarter. For the same period in 2023, the segment reported a pretax income of $47 million and pretax income attributable to the company of $26 million.\n\nMargins on ethanol production improved year-over-year on significantly lower corn basis in the eastern plants, despite a reduction in ethanol board crush margins in the quarter. Production facilities continued to operate efficiently with increased volume and higher ethanol yields. Plant co-product values were lower, with feed ingredients following the overall price reduction of corn; however, feed ingredient demand improved year-over-year. Renewable diesel feedstock volumes continue to grow albeit with compressed margins on industry fundamentals. All four plants completed their semi-annual maintenance shutdowns in the third quarter. A favorable ethanol margin environment should continue, supported by exports, higher blending rates and continued lower corn basis levels in the east.\n\nRenewables had third quarter EBITDA of $65 million in 2024, compared to $60 million in 2023.\n\n**Nutrient & Industrial Improved in Seasonally Quiet Quarter**\n\nThe Nutrient & Industrial segment reported a pretax loss of $6 million, compared to a loss of $8 million in 2023. Overall volumes improved during a seasonally slow third quarter, but margins in base nutrients have reset to more normalized levels and did not repeat the outsized margin opportunities seen in recent years. The engineered granules business saw significant improvement in the quarter on higher sales volume and margins, with continued focus on operational improvements in this business. Looking forward, the fourth quarter should benefit from high yields and an early harvest, allowing for fall applications.\n\nNutrient & Industrial's third quarter EBITDA was $5 million compared to breakeven EBITDA in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Income Taxes; Corporate**\n\nThe company recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 17% for the quarter. This rate was impacted by the tax treatment of noncontrolling interests and federal tax credits. We anticipate a full-year adjusted effective rate of approximately 14% - 18%.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe company will host a webcast on Tuesday, November 5, 2024, at 11 a.m. Eastern Time, to discuss its performance and provide its outlook for the remainder of 2024 and preliminary views for 2025.
