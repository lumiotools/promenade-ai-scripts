Completes Validation and Regulatory Submission for New Lupus and Rheumatoid Arthritis Biomarkers on the AVISE® CTD Platform\n\nNovember 14, 2024 at 4:30 PM EST\n\n[PDF Version](/node/9111/pdf)\n\n**Significant enhancements will equip clinicians with even more diagnostic clarity in the treatment of patients with autoimmune disease**\n\nCARLSBAD, Calif., Nov. 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [Exagen Inc.](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=_bfx6siR2H9IZzwwz6oPfVxTE3sL1io2iA-fVxcY4s6MiCHItSE_K4iZdXMe14FPU5SwM4EZNPRxcwoyF91s8A==), a leading provider of autoimmune testing, today announced the validation and regulatory submission for approval of new Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) biomarkers, to be incorporated into the AVISE CTD platform. Collectively, these new biomarkers will further improve the clinical utility of AVISE CTD, providing clinicians with the information they need to definitively diagnose patients and shorten their autoimmune diagnostic journeys.\n\nSince 2012, AVISE CTD has delivered diagnostic clarity where overlapping clinical symptoms and ambiguous disease states make it difficult to arrive at a differential diagnosis of a connective tissue disease (CTD). A lack of diagnostic clarity may lead to serial and repeat testing, increased morbidity, worsening mortality rates and growing healthcare costs.\n\n“The AVISE CTD enhancements are a direct result of our continuing commitment to develop and deliver testing solutions that address the challenges of clinicians searching for answers for suspected autoimmune patients,” said John Aballi, CEO, Exagen. “These coming enhancements exemplify how Exagen is raising the bar for autoimmune diagnostic testing while also empowering clinicians to deliver better patient care.”\n\nThe seven new biomarkers for AVISE CTD are as follows:\n\n  * **A new T Cell Lupus profile will include three new T Cell biomarkers (TC4d, TIgG, TIgM).**\n\n\n\nThese provide enhanced sensitivity for SLE as compared to conventional SLE biomarkers and serve as a complement to the AVISE Lupus profile also included in the test.\n\n  * **The RA profile will be enhanced with the addition of four biomarkers (anti-CarP and anti-RA33 biomarkers IgA, IgG, IgM).**\n\n\n\nProviders are given more data to confidently identify patients with RA and substantiate a seronegative RA diagnosis.\n\nThe AVISE CTD test that rheumatologists have come to know and trust is composed of multiple biomarker assays that assist in the clinical diagnosis of the most common CTDs, which included:\n\n  * SLE\n  * RA\n  * Sjögren's Disease\n  * Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD)\n  * Antiphospholipid Syndrome\n  * Myositis\n  * Systemic Sclerosis\n  * Graves’ Disease\n  * Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis\n\n\n\n“The addition of these biomarkers to the AVISE CTD test is an important milestone for those of us working with suspected autoimmune patients,” said Vasileios Kyttaris, MD, PhD, FACR. “We as clinicians now have an even clearer window into each individual patient’s health, which in turn may lead to a more definitive diagnosis.”\n\nAvailability of the AVISE CTD test enhancements are pending conditional approval by the New York State Department of Health.

An explanation of these non-GAAP financial measures is also included below under the heading “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures (unaudited).”\n\n**2024****Guidance**\n\nThe Company now expects 2024 full-year revenue of $55 million to $56 million, primarily reflecting the impact of one-time adjustments in the third quarter and reiterates adjusted EBITDA loss expectations of better than $12 million.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nA conference call to review third quarter 2024 financial results and to provide a business update is scheduled for today, November 12, 2024 at 8:30 AM Eastern Time (5:30 AM Pacific Time). Interested parties may access the conference call by dialing (201) 389-0918 (U.S.) or (877) 407-0890 (international). Additionally, a link to a live webcast of the call will be available in the Investor Relations section of Exagen's website at [investors.exagen.com](http://investors.exagen.com).\n\nParticipants are asked to join a few minutes prior to the call to register for the event. A replay of the conference call will be available until Tuesday, November 26, 2024, at 11:59 PM Eastern Time (8:59 PM Pacific Time). Interested parties may access the replay by dialing (201) 612-7415 (U.S.) or (877) 660-6853 (international) using passcode 13749452. A link to the replay of the webcast will also be available in the Investor Relations section of Exagen's website.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures (UNAUDITED)**\n\nIn this release, we use the metrics of adjusted EBITDA, which is not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) and is a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA excludes net loss interest income (expense), depreciation and amortization expense, and stock-based compensation expense.\n\nWe use adjusted EBITDA internally because we believe these metrics provide useful supplemental information in assessing our operating performance reported in accordance with GAAP. We believe adjusted EBITDA may enhance an evaluation of our operating performance because it excludes the impact of prior decisions made about capital investment, financing, investing and certain expenses we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance. However, this non-GAAP financial measure may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, even when the same or similarly titled terms are used to identify such measures, limiting their usefulness for comparative purposes.\n\nThis non-GAAP financial measure is not meant to be considered in isolation or used as a substitute for net loss reported in accordance with GAAP, should be considered in conjunction with our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, has no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP, is unaudited, and is not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. In addition, from time to time in the future, there may be other items that we may exclude for purposes of these non-GAAP financial measures, and we may in the future cease to exclude items that we have historically excluded for purposes of these non-GAAP financial measures. Likewise, we may determine to modify the nature of adjustments to arrive at these non-GAAP financial measures. Because of the non-standardized definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, the non-GAAP financial measure as used by us in this press release and the accompanying reconciliation table have limits in their usefulness to investors and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on non-GAAP financial measures.\n\n**About Exagen**\n\nExagen Inc.
