Such forward-looking statements concern our anticipated results and developments in our operations in future periods,\nplanned exploration and development of our properties, plans related to our business and other matters that may occur in the future. These statements relate to analyses and\nother information that are based on forecasts of future results, estimates of amounts not yet determinable and assumptions of management. These statements include, but are not\nlimited to, comments regarding:\n● The timing of the preparation, filing, and satisfaction of the conditions of our mine construction and operating permits for the CK Gold Project;\n● The timing and process of completing conditions surrounding our approved mine operating permit and closure plan for the CK Gold Project;\n● The assumptions and projections contained in the CK Gold Project Prefeasibility Study, including estimated mineral resources and mineral reserves, mine life,\nprojected operating and capital costs, projected production, internal rate of return (“IRR”) and Net Present Value (“NPV”) calculations, and the possibility of upside\npotential at the project;\n● The planned extensions of our leases;\n● Our planned expenditures during our fiscal year ended April 30, 2025;\n● Future exploration plans and expectations related to our properties;\n● Our ability to fund our business through April 30, 2025 with our current cash reserves based on our currently planned activities;\n● Our anticipation of future environmental and regulatory impacts; and\n● Our business and operating strategies.\nWe use the words “anticipate,” “continue,” “likely,” “estimate,” “expect,” “may,” “could,” “will,” “project,” “should,” “believe” and similar expressions (including negative\nand grammatical variations) to identify forward-looking statements. Statements that contain these words discuss our future expectations and plans, or state other forward-\nlooking information. Although we believe the expectations and assumptions reflected in those forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot assure you that these\nexpectations and assumptions will prove to be correct. Our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements as a result\nof various factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including:\n● Unfavorable results from our exploration activities;\n● Decreases in gold, copper or silver prices;\n● Whether we are able to raise the necessary capital required to continue our business on terms acceptable to us or at all, and the likely negative effect of volatility in\nmetals prices or unfavorable exploration results;\n● Whether we will be able to begin to mine and sell minerals successfully or profitably at any of our current properties at current or future metals prices;\n● Potential delays in our exploration activities or other activities to advance properties towards mining resulting from environmental consents or permitting delays or\nproblems, accidents, problems with contractors, disputes under agreements related to exploration properties, unanticipated costs and other unexpected events;\n● Our ability to retain key management and mining personnel necessary to successfully operate and grow our business;\n● Economic and political events affecting the market prices for gold, copper, silver, and other minerals that may be found on our exploration properties;\n● Volatility in the market price of our common stock; and\n● The factors set forth under “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nMany of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are based on\nreasonable assumptions, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known to us. Consequently, forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks\nand uncertainties and actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in or anticipated by the forward-looking statements. These\nstatements speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as required by law, we are not obligated to publicly release any revisions to these forward-\nlooking statements to reflect future events or developments. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us and persons acting on our behalf are\nqualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in this section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nDescriptions of agreements or other documents contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are intended as summaries and are not necessarily complete.

BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES\nOverview\nU.S. Gold Corp., formerly known as Dataram Corporation (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”), was re-incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada in 2016 and was\noriginally incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1967. Effective June 26, 2017, the Company changed its legal name to U.S. Gold Corp. from Dataram Corporation. On\nMay 23, 2017, the Company merged with Gold King Corp. (“Gold King”), in a transaction treated as a reverse acquisition and recapitalization, and the business of Gold King\nbecame the business of the Company. We are a gold, copper and precious metals development and exploration company pursuing exploration opportunities primarily in\nWyoming, Nevada and Idaho.\nWhile we are an exploration and development company that owns certain mining leases and other mineral rights comprising the CK Gold Project in Wyoming, the Keystone\nProject in Nevada and the Challis Gold Project in Idaho, most of our recent activity has focused on moving the CK Gold Project along the development pathway. The\nCompany’s CK Gold Project’s property contains proven and probable mineral reserves and accordingly is classified as a development stage property, as defined in subpart 1300\nof Regulation S-K (“S-K 1300”) promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). None of the Company’s other properties contain proven and probable\nmineral reserves and all activities are exploratory in nature. We do not currently have any revenue-producing activities.\nCorporate Organization Chart\nThe name, place of incorporation, continuance or organization and percent of equity securities that we own or control as of July 29, 2024 for each of our subsidiaries is set out\nbelow.\n4\nCorporate Address\nThe current address, telephone number of our offices are:\nU.S. Gold Corp.\n1910 E.

Drill core is checked, logged, marked for sampling and sawn in half. One-half of\neach drill core is maintained for future reference and the other half of each drill core is sent to ALS, an ISO 17025 accredited laboratory in Elko, Nevada to complete all sample\npreparation and assaying. Samples are analyzed by employing fire assaying with atomic absorption finish for gold, and four-acid ICP-MS analysis for silver and copper. For\nQA/QC protocol purposes, certified standards, blank samples and sample duplicates are inserted into the sample stream. We also periodically submit sample pulps to another\nindependent laboratory for check analysis. With respect to the CK Gold Project, and as part of the examination and preparation of a Technical Report under Reg. S-K 1300\nguidelines, QA/QC protocols have been independently checked. We retain core remnants, duplicates, pulps and rejects in one of several secured facilities.\nCK Gold Project, Wyoming\nThe CK Gold Project consists of certain mining leases and other mineral rights located in the historic Silver Crown Mining District of southeast Wyoming.\nLocation and Access\nThe CK Gold Project is located in southeastern Wyoming, approximately 20 miles west of the city of Cheyenne, on the southeastern margin of the Laramie Range (Figure 1).\nThe property covers about two square miles that include the S½ Section 25, NE¼ Section 35, and all of Section 36, T.14N., R.70W., Sixth Principal Meridian. Access to within\nan approximate 4.0 miles of the property is provided by public paved and maintained gravel roads. An agreement with the private landowner (The Ferguson Ranch Inc.\n(“Ferguson Ranch”)) provides access for the remaining distance to the main project area. The surface of S½ Section 25, NE¼ Section 35 is privately owned by the Ferguson\nRanch. An easement agreement providing access for exploration and potential development activities has been negotiated with an adjacent landowner. The fee for this easement\nis $10,000 per year, renewable each year prior to July 11. The surface of Section 36 is owned by the State of Wyoming and is currently leased to an adjacent landowner for\ngrazing. Currently, the surface of Section 36 is leased for grazing by the Ferguson Ranch and part of the option to lease the lands necessary for project development and\noperation is compensation to the Ferguson Ranch for loss of grazing, as and when areas are impacted.\nThe project is entirely located on mineral rights owned and administered by the State of Wyoming. There are no federal lands within or adjoining the CK Gold Project’s land\nposition. Curt Gowdy State Park lies northwest of the property, partially within Section 26. The state park’s southeastern boundary is approximately 1,000 feet northwest of the\nproperty and approximately 3,000 feet northwest of the mineralized area. The CK Gold Project’s property position consists of two State of Wyoming Metallic and Non- metallic\nRocks and Minerals Mining Leases.\nThrough Gold King, the project has acquired two 35-acre parcels immediately adjacent to Section 36 in Section 35, on the western boundary of the project area. This 70-acre\nlandholding provides a buffer to other occupied and unoccupied parcels to the west of the project area.\n7\nFigure 1 – CK Gold Project Location and Project Boundary\nRights to the CK Gold Project\nOur rights to the CK Gold Project arise under two State of Wyoming mineral leases:\n1) State of Wyoming Mining Lease No. 0-40828\nTownship 14 North, Range 70 West, 6th P.M., Laramie County, Wyoming:\nSection 36: All\n2) State of Wyoming Mining Lease No. 0-40858\nTownship 14 North, Range 70 West, 6th P.M., Laramie County, Wyoming:\nSection 25: S/2\nSection 35: NE/4\n8\nOwnership of the mineral rights remains in the possession of the State of Wyoming as conveyed to the State by the United States, evidenced by 1942 patents for Section 36, and\n1989 Order confirming title to Section 25 and 35. The State of Wyoming issued Mineral Leases for the mineral rights to Wyoming Gold Mining Company, Inc. (“Wyoming\nGold”) in 2013 and 2014. These leases were assigned to us on June 23, 2014.\nLease 0-40828 is a ten-year lease that was renewed within the past year and expires on February 1, 2033. Annual rental payments under this lease are $3.00 per acre. Lease 0-\n40858 is a ten-year lease that was renewed within the current year and expires on February 1, 2034. Annual rental payments under this lease are $3.00 per acre. Each lease is\nrenewable for successive ten-year terms by submitting a renewal application fee and paying a nominal fee of $50. We anticipate continuing to renew each lease beyond their\ncurrent expiration dates.\nEffective April 6, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Office of State Lands and Investments (“OSLI”) approved the recommendation from the staff of the OSLI fixing the\nproduction royalty rate at a flat 2.1% of net receipts received by us once the project is in operation. Additionally, once the project is in operation, the Board of Directors of the\nOSLI has the authority to reduce the royalty payable to the State. Additionally, original lease restrictions limiting operations on the lease areas, deemed critical mule deer\nhabitat, were lifted by OSLI after the company came to an arrangement with The Wyoming Department of Game and Fish (“Game and Fish”) to make a compensatory payment\nto Game and Fish to support habitat and conservation measures. The agreed amount to be paid by the Company to Game and Fish once development and operational impact\noccur amount to $300,000.\nInfrastructure\nGiven the project’s proximity to Cheyenne, the state capital of Wyoming and the Front Range metropolitan area, personnel needs, delivery of consumables, and infrastructure\nneeds are available both locally and regionally. The area has access to both BNSF and Union Pacific railroad lines, intersection of 2 major interstate highways, I-80 and I-25,\nand a regional airport.\nHigh voltage powerlines are approximately 2.4 km (1.5 mi) from the current project area. A connection to the local power provider and easement for transmission lines has been\nidentified and scoped. While there is a nearby line serving the local population, we anticipate that a new line to the project site, catering to approximately a 30-Megawatt load\nwill be constructed and talks have been conducted with the local power provider (Black Hills Energy), the designated provider for the area. Indicative rates including the\ninstallation of approximately 16-miles of line from a nearby sub-station have been received and incorporated into project engineering studies.\nIn February 2023, we entered into a Water Development and Purchase Agreement (“Water Agreement”) with the Board of Public Utilities (the “BOPU”) of the City of\nCheyenne. Under this Water Agreement, BOPU will provide a firm supply of up to 600 gallons per minute for the life of the project. It is anticipated that the water to be\nsupplied under this Water Agreement will come from the Lone Tree well field owned by BOPU. A pipeline from the Lone Tree well field to the project will be required to be\nconstructed. Minor water sources have been identified around the project site from monitoring well locations, and additional deeper well sites will be investigated in upcoming\nfields seasons with a view to securing an independent water supply.\nPermitting\nMine Operating Permit and Closure Plan (“MOP”)\nIn September 2022, we filed our mine operation and reclamation plan (“MOP”) with the WDEQ – Land Division (the “WDEQ”). In November 2022, we received notification\nfrom WDEQ that our MOP was deemed complete and that it was under technical review. In April 2023, we received a first round of technical comments and worked with the\nWDEQ to fully respond to their initial review. In May 2024, WDEQ issued us a letter of approval for the MOP. Per WDEQ’s letter of approval there were three conditions to\nthe MOP: (1) acceptance of a reclamation bond, in the amount of $5,010,000; (2) receipt of a water discharge permit from WDEQ and (3) receipt of the WDEQ Air Quality\nDivision permit. To date, the Company has received acceptance of the reclamation bond and obtained the water discharge permit. The Company expects to obtain the WDEQ\nAir Quality permit this calendar year.\nIndustrial Siting Permit (“ISP”)\nIn February 2023, we submitted our ISP with the Industrial Siting Division of the WDEQ. An ISP is required for all projects within the state of Wyoming when the projected\ncapital costs are anticipated to exceed $253.9 million. This threshold includes costs we may incur as well as costs incurred from other parties. The ISP’s intent is to ascertain the\nregional impacts during construction and mine operation and release state funds to local governments to offset anticipated impacts. Subsequent to the permit submission, a\nhearing was held with the Industrial Siting Commission in May 2023 whereby our ISP was approved. In June 2023, we received official notification from the state of Wyoming\nthat our ISP was granted.\n9\nHistory of Prior Operations and Exploration on the CK Gold Project\nLimited exploration and mining were conducted on the CK Gold Project’s property in the late 1880s and early 1900s. Approximately 300 tons of material was reported to have\nbeen produced from a now inaccessible 160-foot-deep shaft with two levels of cross-cuts. A few small adits and prospect pits with no significant production are scattered\nthroughout the property.\nSince 1938, at least nine historic (pre-Strathmore Minerals Corp.) drilling campaigns by at least seven companies plus the U.S. Bureau of Mines have been conducted at CK\nGold Project’s property, previously referred to as Copper King. The current project database contains 91 drill holes totaling 37,500 feet that were drilled before Wyoming Gold\nacquired the property. All but six of the drill holes are within the current resource area. Other work conducted at the CK Gold Project’s property by previous companies has\nincluded ground and aeromagnetic surveys as well as induced polarization surveys along with geochemical sampling, geologic mapping, and a number of metallurgical studies.\nWyoming Gold conducted an exploration drill program in 2007 and 2008. Thirty-five diamond core drill holes were completed for a total of 25,500 feet. The focus of that work\nwas to confirm and potentially expand the mineralized body outlined in the previous drill campaigns, increase the geologic and geochemical database leading to the creation of\nthe current geologic model and mineralization estimate, and to provide material for further metallurgical testing. The CK Gold Project’s historic assay database for some 120\nholes contains 8,357 gold assays and 8,225 copper assays. At least 10 different organizations or individuals conducted metallurgical studies on the gold-copper mineralization at\nthe request of prior operators between 1973 and 2009.\nGeology and Mineralization\nThe CK Gold Project is underlain by Proterozoic rocks that make up the southern end of the Precambrian core of the Laramie Range. Metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks\nof amphibolite-grade metamorphism are intruded by the 1.4-billion-year-old Sherman Granite and related felsic rocks. Within the project area, foliated granodiorite is intruded\nby aplitic quartz monzonite dikes, thin mafic dikes and younger pegmatite dikes. Shear zones with cataclastic foliation striking N60°E to N60°W are found in the southern part\nof the Silver Crown district, including at CK Gold. The granodiorite typically shows potassium enrichment, particularly near contacts with quartz monzonite. Copper and gold\nmineralization occur primarily in unfoliated to mylonitic granodiorite. The mineralization is associated with a N60°W-trending shear zone and disseminated and stockwork\ngold-copper deposits in the intrusive rocks. The mineralization style is consistent with a porphyry gold-copper deposit of Paleoproterozoic age. Hydrothermal alteration is\noverprinted on retrograde greenschist alteration and includes a central zone of silicification, followed outward by a narrow potassic zone, surrounded by propylitic alteration.\nHigher-grade mineralization occurs within a central core of thin quartz veining and stockwork mineralization that is surrounded by a ring of lower-grade disseminated\nmineralization. Disseminated sulfides and native copper with stockwork malachite and chrysocolla are present at the surface, and chalcopyrite, pyrite, minor bornite, primary\nchalcocite, pyrrhotite, and native copper are present at depth. Gold occurs as free gold and within chalcopyrite crystals.\nThe CK Gold Project’s property contains oxide, mixed oxide-sulfide, and sulfide rock types. At the stated cutoff grade of 0.015oz AuEq/ton, approximately 80% of the resource\nis sulfide material with the remaining 20% split evenly between the oxide and mixed rock types. There is consistent distribution of gold and copper, albeit generally low-grade,\nthroughout this potential open-pit type deposit.\nMineral Reserves and Mineral Resources\nMineral reserve and mineral resource estimates were calculated by Gustavson Associates LLC (now WSP USA, Inc.) through the effective date of November 15, 2021 as\nshown in the Technical Report Summary attached to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The mineral reserve and mineral resource tabulations shown below are based on\nassumed metals prices of $1,625/oz gold, $3.25/lb copper and $18.00/oz silver. These metals price assumptions are comprised of long-term metals forecasting (33%) and the\ntwo-year trailing average (67%). Based on the actual prices of these metals at the end of our fiscal year ($1,911/oz gold, $4.45/lb copper and $23.45/oz silver), based on the\nrespective London Metal Exchange, we believe that the price assumptions used in preparing our mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates at November 15, 2021 remain\nreasonable and, therefore, we believe the estimates prepared by Gustavson Associates LLC remain a reasonable estimate of our mineral resources and mineral reserves at April\n30, 2024.\n10\nCK Gold Project – Summary of Gold, Copper and Silver Mineral Resources at April 30, 2024 based on $1,625/oz gold, $3.25/lb copper and $18.00/oz silver\nAu Equivalent\nMass Gold (Au) Copper (Cu) Silver (Ag) (AuEq)\nTons Oz oz/ lbs Oz Oz oz/\n(000’s) (000’s) st (millions) % (000’s) oz/st (000’s) st\nMeasured (M) 1,000 6 0.019 2 0.196 100 0.05 2 0.024\nIndicated (I) 10,500 94 0.01 30 0.15 450 0.03 138 0.016\nM + I 11,500 100 0.014 32 0.16 550 0.039 140 0.018\nInferred 22,500 235 0.01 68.3 0.152 323 0.014 357 0.016\n(1) Resources tabulated at a cutoff grade of (0.0107 – 0.0088) AuEq oz/st, 0.009 AuEq oz/st average\n(2) Note only 3 significant figures shown, may not sum due to rounding\n(3) Estimates of mineral resources are exclusive of mineral reserves\nCK Gold Project – Summary of Gold, Copper and Silver Mineral Reserves at April 30, 2024 based on $1,625/oz gold, $3.25/lb copper and $18.00/oz silver\nAu Equivalent\nMass Gold (Au) Copper (Cu) Silver (Ag) (AuEq)\nTons Oz oz/ lbs Oz Oz oz/\n(000’s) (000’s) st (millions) % (000’s) oz/st (000’s) st\nProven (P1) 29,600 574 0.019 118 0.198 1,440 0.049 757 0.026\nProbable (P2) 40,700 440 0.011 130 0.16 1,220 0.03 679 0.017\nP1 + P2 70,400 1,010 0.014 248 0.176 2,660 0.038 1,440 0.02\n(1) Reserves tabulated at a cutoff grade of (0.0107 – 0.0088) AuEq oz./st, 0.009 AuEq Oz/st average\n(2) Note only 3 significant figures shown, may not sum due to rounding\nFor comparison, below are our mineral resources and mineral reserves at April 30, 2023:\nCK Gold Project – Summary of Gold, Copper and Silver Mineral Resources at April 30, 2023 based on $1,625/oz gold, $3.25/lb copper and $18.00/oz silver\nAu Equivalent\nMass Gold (Au) Copper (Cu) Silver (Ag) (AuEq)\nTons Oz oz/ lbs Oz Oz oz/\n(000’s) (000’s) st (millions) % (000’s) oz/st (000’s) st\nMeasured (M) 1,000 6 0.019 2 0.196 100 0.05 2 0.024\nIndicated (I) 10,500 94 0.01 30 0.15 450 0.03 138 0.016\nM + I 11,500 100 0.014 32 0.16 550 0.039 140 0.018\nInferred 22,500 235 0.01 68.3 0.152 323 0.014 357 0.016\n(1) Resources tabulated at a cutoff grade of (0.0107 – 0.0088) AuEq oz/st, 0.009 AuEq oz/st average\n(2) Note only 3 significant figures shown, may not sum due to rounding\n(3) Estimates of mineral resources are exclusive of mineral reserves\n11\nCK Gold Project – Summary of Gold, Copper and Silver Mineral Reserves at April 30, 2023 based on $1,625/oz gold, $3.25/lb copper and $18.00/oz silver\nAu Equivalent\nMass Gold (Au) Copper (Cu) Silver (Ag) (AuEq)\nTons Oz lbs Oz Oz\n(000’s) (000’s) oz/ st (millions) % (000’s) oz/st (000’s) oz/ st\nProven (P1) 29,600 574 0.019 118 0.198 1,440 0.049 757 0.026\nProbable (P2) 40,700 440 0.011 130 0.16 1,220 0.03 679 0.017\nP1 + P2 70,400 1,010 0.014 248 0.176 2,660 0.038 1,440 0.02\n(1) Reserves tabulated at a cutoff grade of (0.0107 – 0.0088) AuEq oz./st, 0.009 AuEq Oz/st average\n(2) Note only 3 significant figures shown, may not sum due to rounding\nMineral resources are reported at a gold equivalent grade (AuEq) cutoff grade, which considers metal recovery and pricing Cutoff grade varies with expected recovery for\ndelineated material types, but averages 0.009 short ton (oz/st) AuEq, equivalent to 0.31 grams per metric tonne (g/t) AuEq. Gold equivalent grade (Au/Eq) is used to simplify\ncutoff grade to a single equivalent metal (gold). The mineral resource is constrained inside an optimization shell which, combined with the cutoff grade, represents reasonable\nprospects for economic extraction. The mineral reserve estimate lies inside of a designed mine open pit. See Section 12.1 in the Technical Report Summary incorporated by\nreference in this Form 10-K for a discussion of pit optimization, cutoff grade and dilution.\nPrefeasibility Study (“PFS”)\nOn December 1, 2021, we released the results of our prefeasibility study (“PFS”). The PFS was prepared by Gustavson Associates LLC with an effective date of November 15,\n2021.\nThe following are highlights from the PFS:\n● 10-year Mine Life at 20,000 short tons per day process rate\n○ Average AuEq production: 108,500 ounces per year\n○ First three years: 135,300 AuEq ounces per year\n● Initial Capital: $221 million\n○ Potential attractive financing terms from equipment suppliers and development capital sources\n○ 2-year payback\n● Economics – 39.4% IRR before tax and 33.7% IRR after tax\n○ NPV (5%): $323 million and $266 million, before and after tax, respectively\n○ All in Sustaining Cost (“AISC”) at $800 per AuEq ounce\n○ Assumes $1,625/ounce gold price and $3.25/lb copper price\n○ Highly leveraged to increasing metals prices\n● Upside Potential\n○ Aggregate sales from mine waste rock, proven to be excellent quality\n○ Feasibility study level value engineering and plant optimization\n○ Ongoing metallurgical testing to enhance recovery of gold and copper\n○ Resource expansion potential at depth and to the south-east\n● Permitting and Development\n○ Project footprint under the jurisdiction of Wyoming agencies\n12\nThe economic projections in the PFS are subject to a variety of assumptions and qualifications that are described in more detail in the Technical Report Summary incorporated\nby reference into this Form 10-K. In summary, the low-grade copper, silver and gold deposit located on Wyoming State Land and under lease to US Gold Corp, is proposed as\nan open pit mine. The rate of extraction will be sufficient to feed minerals to the process plant at a rate of 20,000 tons per day, involving the removal of surrounding waste\nmaterial at a similar rate. The process plant serves to crush and grind the ore into a fine particle form in a slurry, whereupon the copper, silver and gold values can be separated\nfrom non-mineralized rock into a concentrate using froth flotation. The concentrate will be dried and shipped off site and sold to a smelter for final metal extraction. The waste\nmaterial will be filtered to recoup and recycle water back to the process plant, and the filtered tailings will be trucked and mechanically stacked onto a tailings pile. The process\nfacility is also on the same Wyoming State section less than a mile away from the mineralized orebody, with the entire operation some 20-miles west of Cheyenne. The\nmetallurgical test work supporting the extraction methodology was initially performed by a previous owner between 2009 and 2012, but the company has gathered additional\nrepresentative sample and conducted further extensive test work between 2020 and 2023. The results of the test work were incorporated into the prefeasibility study published\non December 1, 2021. We expect to update the prefeasibility study by the end of the third quarter of 2024 and finalize the feasibility study sometime thereafter.\nWe expense all mineral exploration costs as incurred. Although we have identified proven and probable mineral reserves on our CK Gold Project, development costs will be\ncapitalized when all the following criteria have been met, (a) we receive the requisite operating permits, (b) completion of a favorable Feasibility Study and (c) approval from\nour Board of Directors (our “Board”) authorizing the development of the ore body. Until such time all these criteria have been met, we record pre-development costs to expense\nas incurred. The current book value of our property is approximately $3.1 million, which is recorded in mineral properties and reflects the value that was attributed to the\npurchase of the CK Gold Project. We do not have any costs on our balance sheet related to plant or equipment as we have not incurred any such costs.\nRecent Activities\nWe submitted both of our major permit applications during the year-ended April 30, 2023, the MOP and Industrial Siting Permit (the “ISP”). We were granted our ISP in June\n2023 providing local governments the ability to receive state funds to mitigate impacts from the anticipated construction and operation of our CK Gold Project. In May 2024,\nwe received approval of the MOP subject to three conditions (reclamation bond approval, water discharge permit and air quality permit). Two of the three conditions have been\nmet (reclamation bond approval and water discharge permit) and we expect to meet the third condition (air quality permit) in calendar 2024.\nPrimarily in support of the feasibility study presently underway, during the 2021 field season, 47 core, reverse circulation rotary and conventional rotary holes were drilled at\nthe CK Gold Project. The primary purpose of the drilling program is to supplement the geotechnical and hydrological information.\nAdditional work centered around the capture and interpretation of environmental base line data encompassing sub-surface and surface water, fauna, flora, cultural, air quality,\nmeteorological conditions, wetlands and socio-economic factors in the project area. Since September 2020, over 3 1/2 years of monitoring data have been gathered and ongoing\nmonitoring in critical areas continues.\nAdditionally, a great deal of social outreach has been conducted to familiarize the immediate population and the Wyoming, Cheyenne and Laramie governmental and regulatory\nagencies.\nGeological Potential of the CK Gold Project\nPotential to expand the existing resource exists primarily at depth beyond current drilling depths and to the south of the proposed pit. Numerous drill holes end in significant\nmineralization. A geophysical anomaly to the southeast supports the trend extending from the proposed open pit as identified by step-out drilling from the current reserve\nboundary; however, to date exploration has not pinpointed mineralization that might be associated with the anomaly further to the southeast in what is thought to be fairly\ncomplex geologic conditions.\n13\nKeystone Project, Cortez Trend, Nevada\nLocation\nThe Keystone Project consists of 601 unpatented lode mining claims situated in Eureka County, Nevada. The claims making up the Keystone Project are situated in Eureka\nCounty, Nevada in Sections 2-4 and 9-11, Township 23 North, Range 48 East, and Sections 22- 28, and 33-36 Township 24 North, all Range 48 East of the Mount Diablo\nMeridian (Figures 2 and 3).\n14\nFigure 2 – Location of Keystone Project and Major Gold Trends in Nevada\n15\nFigure 3 – Keystone Project Claim Boundaries\nThe Keystone Project is accessible via unpaved roads. Navigation through the interior of the project is by off-road vehicle on exploration tracks.\nTitle and Ownership for Keystone Project\nThe Keystone Project consists of unpatented mining claims located on federal land administered by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”). An annual maintenance\nfee of $200 per claim per year must be paid to the Nevada BLM by September 1 of each year, and failure to make the payment on time renders the claims void. In addition to\nthe annual maintenance fee paid to the Nevada BLM, a $12 per claim fee is due to the Eureka County (NV) Clerk’s office as a record fee.\n16\nWe acquired the mining claims comprising the Keystone Project on May 27, 2016 from Nevada Gold Ventures, LLC and Americas Gold Exploration, Inc. (“Americas Gold”).\nSome of the Keystone claims are subject to pre-existing net smelter royalty (“NSR”) obligations. In addition, Nevada Gold Ventures, LLC retained additional NSR rights of\n0.5% with regard to certain claims and 3.5% with regard to certain other claims. The unpatented mining claims comprising the Keystone Project, with applicable NSR\nobligations, are as follows:\n1. Acquired 100% from Americas Gold; subject to a one percent (1%) NSR held by Wolfpack Gold Nevada Corp.; a two percent (2.0%) NSR with respect to\nprecious metals and one percent (1.0%) NSR with respect to all other metals and minerals held by Orion Royalty Company, LLC; and a one-half percent (0.5%)\nNSR to Nevada Gold Ventures, LLC\n27 unpatented lode mining claims situated in Eureka County, Nevada, in Sections 33 and 34, Township 24 North, Range 48 East, and Sections 3, 4, 9, and 10,\nTownship 23 North, Range 48 East, Mount Diablo Base Line and Meridian.\n2. Acquired 100% from Americas Gold; subject to a three and one-half percent (3.5%) NSR to Nevada Gold Ventures, LLC\n13 unpatented lode mining claims situated in Eureka County, Nevada, in Sections 27, 28 and 35, Township 24 North, Range 48 East, and Sections 2 and 3,\nTownship 23 North, Range 48 East, Mount Diablo Base Line and Meridian.\n3. Acquired 100% from Nevada Gold Ventures, LLC; subject to a three and one-half percent (3.5%) NSR to Nevada Gold Ventures, LLC\n28 unpatented lode mining claims situated in Eureka County, Nevada, in Sections 2 & 11, Township 23 North, Range 48 East, Mount Diablo Base Line and\nMeridian.\n4. Acquired 50% from Nevada Gold Ventures, LLC, 50% from Americas Gold, subject to a three and one-half percent (3.5%) NSR to Nevada Gold Ventures, LLC\n216 unpatented lode mining claims, alphabetically ordered, situated in Eureka County, Nevada, in Sections 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 33, 34, 35 & 36,\nTownship 24 North, Range 48 East, Mount Diablo Base Line and Meridian.\nUnder the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated May 25, 2016, under which we acquired the claims, we had the right to buy down 1% of the NSR owed to Nevada\nGold Ventures LLC at any time through the fifth anniversary of the closing date, May 25, 2021, for $2,000,000. In addition, we may buy down an additional 1% of the NSR\nowed to Nevada Gold Ventures, LLC anytime through the eighth anniversary of the closing date, May 25, 2024, for $5,000,000. We did not buy down any portion of the NSR.\nHistory of Prior Operations and Exploration on the Keystone Project\nNo comprehensive, modern-era, model-driven exploration has ever been conducted on the Keystone Project. Newmont drilled 6 holes in the old base metal and silver Keystone\nmine area in 1967 and encountered low-grade (+/- 0.02 opt) gold intercepts. Chevron staked the property in 1981-1983 and drilled 27 shallow drill holes, continued by an\nagreement with USMX that drilled an additional 19 shallow holes; significant amounts of low grade and anomalous gold were intersected, but results were considered\nuneconomic, and the project was dropped. In 1988 and 1989, Phelps Dodge acquired a southern portion of the district and drilled 6 holes, one of which contained gold\nmineralization in its total depth and was subsequently deepened in 1990 resulting in over 200’ of low-grade gold mineralization. About this time Coral Resources acquired a\nnorthern portion of the property and drilled 21 shallow holes to follow-up previous drill intercepts. 1995-1997, Golden Glacier, a junior company, acquired the north end of the\ndistrict, and Uranerz a portion of the southern area; 6 holes were drilled in the north and only 2 holes in the south, respectively. The entire district was dropped by all parties.\n17\nIn 2004, with the discovery of Cortez Hills and escalating gold prices, Nevada Pacific Gold, Great American Minerals (Don McDowell), and Tone Resources (Dave\nMathewson) competed in claim staking the entire district. Subsequently, Don McDowell, founder of Great American Minerals approached Placer Dome (prior to Barrick\nacquisition) who discovered Pipeline and Cortez Hills, and who correctly recognized the Keystone district potential. Placer Dome entered into separate joint venture agreements\nwith Nevada Pacific and Great American. The following year Barrick Gold bought Placer Dome and dropped all Placer Dome’s Nevada exploration projects and joint ventures,\nincluding Keystone. In 2006, Nevada Pacific and Tone were purchased by McEwen Mining. McEwen Mining drilled 35 holes mostly near the north end of the district; targeting\nthe range front pediment and the historic Keystone Mine. McEwen Mining dropped their Keystone claims and quit claimed them to Dave Mathewson and NV Gold Ventures.\nNV Gold Ventures and American Gold staked their own additional claims in the district. This expanded group of claims was acquired in the original Keystone Purchase\nAgreement. We have staked additional claims in the district, such as Potato Canyon, since acquiring the project.\nGeology and Mineralization\nTo date, a technical report has not been prepared on the Keystone Project. Keystone is positioned on the prolific Cortez gold trend. The Keystone Project is centered on a\ngranitic intrusion that warped the local Paleozoic stratigraphy into a dome, allowing for exposure of highly favorable Devonian, Carboniferous (Mississippian-Pennsylvania)\nand Permo- Triassic rocks including key likely host rocks for mineralization, the silty carbonate strata of the Horse Creek Formation and the Wenban limestone, as well as\npossible sandy clastic units of the Diamond Peak Formation. The Horse Canyon and Wenban rocks are the primary host rocks at the nearby Cortez Hills Mine and Gold Rush\ndeposit currently operated by Barrick Gold.\nIn 2022, a hyperspectral survey was conducted on the property identifying evidence of potential mineralization. Numerous anomalies often associated with mineralization were\nidentified. Field investigation of the anomalies commenced during the 2023 field season. In September 2023, we announced completion of a hyperspectral study, which yielded\nthe discovery of multiple high priority targets requiring further investigation and adding to the targets identified from the Company’s prior work at the project.\nInfrastructure and Facilities\nThe Keystone Project does not currently include any significant facilities. The Keystone Project sits some 10 miles to the southwest of Nevada Gold mines Cortez Complex.\nThe Cortez Complex, consisting of surface and underground mines, is served by roads and power, while water in the area is extracted from sub-surface water resources. The\nKeystone Project is served by paved and unpaved roads, which extend down trend from the Cortez Complex to the north and additional road and infrastructure to the north-east.\nThe whole area is some 30 miles to the south of the I-80 interstate corridor between the towns of Battle Mountain and Winnemucca, with Elko, Nevada being the dormitory\ntown for the majority of the workforce and support services.\nThe Challis Gold Project, Idaho\nLocation\nThe Challis Gold property is situated in the Salmon River Mountains, approximately 40 km (25 mi) southwest of the town of Salmon, Idaho, and 69 km (43 mi) north of the\nsmaller town of Challis (Figure 7). The project area is considered to be within the Cobalt Mining District, as the past-producing Blackbird Cobalt Mine is located 9.3 km (5.75\nmi) north-northwest of the property. The nearly-abandoned town of Cobalt, a previous company town for the Blackbird Mine, is along Panther Creek 9.7 km (6 mi) northeast of\nthe property. Meridian Gold’s Beartrack Mine, the closest of the larger gold mines in the region, is 24 km (15 mi) northeast of the Challis Gold Project. The central portion of\nthe property is located at approximately 45º 2’ North Latitude and 114º 20’ West Longitude. The claims are situated in the south-central portion of unsurveyed Township T20N,\nR18E.\n18\n19\n-Figure 7: The Challis Gold Project Location in Idaho\nTitle and Ownership for Challis Gold Project\nAll of the mining claims comprising the Musgrove property are unpatented lode mining claims that have been recorded in the Lemhi County Court House in Salmon, Idaho\nand filed with the US BLM office in Boise. An annual maintenance fee of $200 per claim per year must be paid to the BLM by September 1 of each year, and failure to make\nthe payment on time renders the claims void. In addition to the annual maintenance fee, $20 is due to the Lemhi County (ID) Recorder’s office as a notice of intent to hold\nfee.\nHistory of Prior Operations and Exploration\nEarly mining dates to the late 1880’s when gold was discovered at the nearby Yellow Jacket Mine and copper and cobalt was discovered north of the project area at the\nBlackbird Mine. Small scale intermittent mining was conducted in the project area from 1908 through the 1930’s at the Musgrove Mine and at the Smith-Gahan Mine.\nIn the mid-1980’s, alteration and quartz veining was identified located along the ridge north of Musgrove Creek A large block of claims covering the area was staked by an\nindependent geologist and then leased to Atlas Minerals. Atlas completed an extensive sampling program and, in 1991, drilled nine reverse circulation holes resulting in the\ndiscovery of significant mineralization at the Johny’s Point deposit.\nThe project was acquired by Newmont in 1992 as part of the Grassy Mountain Deposit acquisition. Newmont conducted an extensive exploration program between 1992 and\nthe fall of 1995 consisting of mapping and rock chip sampling. Twenty-seven core holes were completed consisting of nine holes in the Johny’s Point area and 18 holes testing\ntargets along strike from Johny’s Point. Newmont concluded that the project did not meet the potential for their size criteria and the project was dropped.\nIn 1996, Meridian Gold acquired the property and drilled an additional 20 core holes and three reverse circulation drill holes. The property was subsequently returned to the\nowner due to declining gold prices.\nIn 2003, Wave Exploration leased the property and completed a GIS compilation of the surface and drill hole data. Wave subsequently commissioned a technical report. In\n2004, Wave drilled two confirmation drill holes and two step out holes and completed a soil geochemical program northwest of Johny’s Point.\nIn 2005, Wave optioned the property to Journey Resources. In 2006 and 2007, Journey drilled nine reverse circulation drill holes and five core holes northwest of Johny’s Point.\nThere is no documented exploration activity from 2008 until 2018. On September 1, 2018, Journey Resources failed to pay the required claim payments to the Bureau of Land\nManagement and the claims were forfeited. Subsequently, Northern Panther Resources Corporation located or acquired new claims covering the project. In 2020, we acquired\nNorthern Panther Resources. In 2020, we contracted with Wright Geophysics to conduct a ground magnetic geophysical over the current claim block. This survey identified a\nprominent low magnetic linear feature that trends from the Musgrove Mine north-northwest for over two miles.\nGeology and Mineralization\nThe project is located within the Trans-Challis Fault System, a prominent NE-trending fault zone which crosscuts central Idaho and hosts numerous gold deposits. Host rocks\nconsist of quartzites and phyllites of the Precambrian Apple Creek Fm with minor mineralization within the Eocene Challis Volcanics. The Musgrove Mine – Johny’s Point\nmineral trend is within and adjacent to the Musgrove Fault, a northwest-trending fault that brings the Challis Volcanics into contact with the Precambrian rocks. This is a major\nstructural zone that forms the northern edge of the Panther Creek Graben.\nGold mineralization occurs within epithermal quartz veins, quartz vein stockworks, and silicified breccia. The mineralization displays the characteristics of a low sulfidation\nepithermal gold system. The Musgrove Mine – Johny’s Point mineral trend has been defined by a broad soil and rock chip gold and arsenic anomaly that extends a distance\n3000 feet and is up to 800 feet wide. Approximately 600 feet of this zone has been drilled with the remainder tested by wide spaced drilling.\n20\nInfrastructure and Facilities\nThe Challis Gold project does not currently include any significant facilities. The Challis property is located in the Salmon-Challis National Forest and served by paved and\nunpaved roads. There are historic workings in the area and there has been recent mining activity in the area. The site is somewhat remote from grid power and power lines\nwould have to be extended into the area, or onsite power generation used to support an eventual operation. There is water in the area from both surface and sub-surface sources.\nThe Bear Track operation, now closed but under renewed exploration, is some 16 miles as the crow flies to the northeast of the property. Historic mining was conducted;\nhowever, the facilities have been abandoned decades ago and the nearest habited area is a forest ranger station near Forney some 5-miles from site.\nCompetition\nWe do not compete directly with anyone for the exploration or removal of minerals from our property as we hold all interest and rights to the claims. Readily available\ncommodities markets exist in the U.S. and around the world for the sale of minerals. Therefore, we will likely be able to sell minerals that we are able to recover. We will be\nsubject to competition and unforeseen limited sources of supplies in the industry in the event spot shortages arise for supplies such as explosives or large equipment tires, and\ncertain equipment such as bulldozers and excavators and services, such as contract drilling that we will need to conduct exploration. If we are unsuccessful in securing the\nproducts, equipment and services we need, we may have to suspend our exploration plans until we are able to secure them.\nCompliance with Government Regulation\nWe will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the exploration of minerals in the United States\ngenerally. We will also be subject to the regulations of the BLM and the US Forest Service (“Forest Service”) with respect to mining claims on federal lands.\nFuture exploration drilling on any of our properties that consist of BLM or Forest Service land will require us to either file a Notice of Intent (NOI) or a Plan of Operations,\ndepending upon the amount of new surface disturbance that is planned. A Notice of Intent is required for planned surface activities that anticipate less than 5.0 acres of surface\ndisturbance, and usually can be obtained within a 30 to 60-day time period.\nEnvironmental Permitting Requirements\nVarious levels of governmental controls and regulations address, among other things, the environmental impact of mineral mining and exploration operations and establish\nrequirements for reclamation of mineral mining and exploration properties after exploration operations have ceased. With respect to the regulation of mineral mining and\nexploration, legislation and regulations in various jurisdictions establish performance standards, air and water quality emission limits and other design or operational\nrequirements for various aspects of the operations, including health and safety standards. Legislation and regulations also establish requirements for reclamation and\nrehabilitation of mining properties following the cessation of operations and may require that some former mining properties be managed for long periods of time after mining\nactivities have ceased.\nOur activities are subject to various levels of federal and state laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, including requirements for closure and reclamation\nof mineral exploration properties. Some of the laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response,\nCompensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Federal Land Policy and\nManagement Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and related state laws in Nevada. Additionally, much of our property is\nsubject to the federal General Mining Law of 1872, which regulates how mining claims on federal lands are located and maintained.\n21\nThe State of Nevada, where we focus mineral exploration efforts, requires mining projects to obtain a Nevada State Reclamation Permit pursuant to the Mined Land\nReclamation Act (the “Nevada MLR Act”), which establishes reclamation and financial assurance requirements for all mining operations in the state. New and expanding\nfacilities are required to provide a reclamation plan and financial assurance to ensure that the reclamation plan is implemented upon completion of operations. The Nevada\nMLR Act also requires reclamation plans and permits for exploration projects that will result in more than five acres of surface disturbance on private lands.\nThe State of Wyoming, where we focus mineral exploration and development efforts at the CK Gold Project, requires exploration and mining projects to obtain permits from\nthe Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (WDEQ), and various other state agencies. New and expanding facilities are required to provide a reclamation plan and\nfinancial assurance to ensure that the reclamation plan is implemented upon completion of operations. WDEQ in granting permits requires that reclamation plans and permits\nare in place and that bonds have been secured covering the cost of remediation of disturbances on both state and private land.\nExecutive Officers of U.S. Gold Corp.\nName Age Principal Occupation Officer/ Director Since\nEric Alexander 57 Chief Financial Officer - Principal Financial and Accounting Officer 2020\nof U.S. Gold Corp.\nGeorge M.

RISK FACTORS\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nIf we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of internal control, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud. Any inability to\nreport and file our financial results accurately and timely could harm our reputation and adversely impact the trading price of our common stock and our ability to file\nregistration statements pursuant to registration rights agreements and other commitments.\nEffective internal control is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, we may not\nbe able to manage our business as effectively as we would if an effective control environment existed, and our business and reputation with investors may be harmed. As a\nresult of our small size, any current internal control deficiencies may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operation and access to capital. As of April 30, 2024,\nmanagement has concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective.\nThere is substantial doubt about whether we can continue as a going concern.\nTo date, we have earned no revenues and have incurred accumulated net losses of $72.8 million. We have limited financial resources. As of April 30, 2024, we had cash and\ncash equivalents of $5.6 million and working capital of $6.1 million. Therefore, our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our achieving a future financing or\nstrategic transaction. However, there is no assurance that we will be successful pursuing a financing or strategic transaction. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt as to\nwhether our existing cash resources and working capital are sufficient to enable us to continue our operations for the next 12 months as a going concern. Ultimately, in the event\nthat we cannot obtain additional financial resources, or achieve profitable operations, we may have to liquidate our business interests and investors may lose their investment.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that our company will continue as a going concern. Continued operations are dependent on\nour ability to obtain additional financial resources or generate profitable operations. Such additional financial resources may not be available or may not be available on\nreasonable terms. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Such adjustments could be\nmaterial.\nWe have a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of our business and prospects.\nSince our inception, we have had no revenue from operations. We have no history of producing metals from any of our exploration properties. Our properties are exploration\nstage properties. Advancing properties from the exploration stage requires significant capital and time, and successful commercial production from a property, if any, will be\nsubject to completing feasibility studies, permitting and construction of the potential mine, processing plants, roads, and other related works and infrastructure. As a result, we\nare subject to all of the risks associated with developing and establishing new mining operations and business enterprises including:\n● completion of feasibility studies to verify potential mineral reserves and commercial viability, including the ability to find sufficient mineral reserves to support a\ncommercial mining operation;\n● the timing and cost, which can be considerable, of further exploration, preparing feasibility studies, permitting and construction of infrastructure, mining and\nprocessing facilities;\n23\n● the availability and costs of drill equipment, exploration personnel, skilled labor and mining and processing equipment, if required;\n● the availability and cost of appropriate smelting and/or refining arrangements, if required;\n● compliance with environmental and other governmental approval and permit requirements;\n● the availability of funds to finance exploration activities, as warranted;\n● potential opposition from non-governmental organizations, environmental groups, local groups or local inhabitants which may delay or prevent exploration activities;\n● potential increases in exploration, construction and operating costs due to changes in the cost of fuel, power, materials and supplies;\n● inability to secure fair and reasonable terms associated with mineral leases; and\n● potential shortages of mineral processing, construction and other facilities-related supplies.\nThe costs, timing and complexities of exploration activities may be increased by the location of our properties and demand by other mineral exploration and mining companies.\nIt is common in exploration programs to experience unexpected problems and delays during drill programs and, if ever commenced, development, construction and mine start-\nup. Accordingly, our activities may not ever result in profitable mining operations, and we may not succeed in establishing mining operations or profitably producing metals at\nany of our properties.\nWe will require significant additional capital to fund our business plan.\nWe will be required to expend significant funds to continue exploration and if warranted, develop our existing exploration properties and to identify and acquire additional\nproperties to diversify our properties portfolio. We have spent and will be required to continue to expend significant amounts of capital for drilling, geological and geochemical\nanalysis, assaying and feasibility studies with regard to the results of our exploration. We may not benefit from some of these investments if we are unable to identify any\ncommercially exploitable mineralized material.\nOur ability to obtain necessary funding for these purposes, in turn, depends upon a number of factors, including the status of the national and worldwide economy and the price\nof gold and copper. We may not be successful in obtaining the required financing or, if we can obtain such financing, such financing may not be on terms that are favorable to\nus. Failure to obtain such additional financing could result in delay or indefinite postponement of further exploration operations, development activities and the possible partial\nor total loss of our potential interest in our properties.\nOur actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions we make to prepare our financial statements, which could have a material impact on our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nIn connection with the preparation of our financial statements, including the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, our management is required under\nGAAP to make estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based on\nhistorical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments\nabout the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or\nconditions. Although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, they are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are\nbeyond our control. If management’s estimates and assumptions change or are not correct, our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nWe do not know if our properties contain any gold or other minerals that can be mined at a profit.\nAlthough the properties on which we have the right to explore for gold are known to have historic deposits of gold, there can be no assurance such deposits can be mined at a\nprofit. Whether a gold deposit can be mined at a profit depends upon many factors. Some but not all of these factors include: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size,\ngrade and proximity to infrastructure; operating costs and capital expenditures required to start mining a deposit; the availability and cost of financing; the price of gold, which\nis highly volatile and cyclical; and government regulations, including regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land use, importing and exporting of minerals and\nenvironmental protection.\nMost of our projects are in the exploration stage.\nAlthough we have established an estimate of mineral reserves on the CK Gold Project, there are no current estimates of mineral resources or mineral reserves at the Keystone\nProperty or Challis Gold Project. There is no assurance that we can establish the existence of any mineral reserves on those projects in commercially exploitable quantities. If\nwe do not establish the existence of mineral reserves or mineral resources on those projects, we may lose all of the funds that we expend on exploration.\nThe commercial viability of an established mineral deposit will depend on a number of factors including, by way of example, the size, grade and other attributes of the mineral\ndeposit, the proximity of the mineral deposit to infrastructure such as a smelter, roads and a point for shipping, government regulation and market prices. Most of these factors\nwill be beyond our control, and any of them could increase costs and make extraction of any identified mineral deposit unprofitable.\n24\nWe have no history of producing metals from our current mineral properties and there can be no assurance that we will successfully establish mining operations or\nprofitably produce precious metals.\nWe have no history of producing metals from our properties. We do not produce gold and do not currently generate operating earnings. While we seek to advance our projects\nand properties through exploration, such efforts will be subject to all of the risks associated with establishing new future potential mining operations and business enterprises,\nincluding:\n● the timing and cost, which are considerable, of the construction of mining and processing facilities;\n● the availability and costs of skilled labor and mining equipment;\n● compliance with environmental and other governmental approval and permit requirements;\n● the availability of funds to finance exploration activities;\n● potential opposition from non-governmental organizations, environmental groups, local groups or local inhabitants that may delay or prevent exploration activities;\nand\n● potential increases in construction and operating costs due to changes in the cost of labor, fuel, power, materials and supplies.\nIt is common in new mining operations to experience unexpected problems and delays. In addition, our management will need to be expanded. This could result in delays in the\ncommencement of potential mineral production and increased costs of production. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that our activities will result in any profitable mining\noperations or that we will ever successfully establish mining operations.\nWe may not be able to obtain all required permits and licenses to place any of our properties into future potential production.\nOur current and future operations, including additional exploration activities, require permits from governmental authorities and such operations are and will be governed by\nlaws and regulations governing prospecting, exploration, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, toxic substances, land use, environmental protection, mine\nsafety and other matters. Companies engaged in mineral property exploration generally experience increased costs, and delays in exploration and other schedules as a result of\nthe need to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permits. We cannot predict if all permits which we may require for continued exploration and development activities,\nwill be obtainable on reasonable terms, if at all. Costs related to applying for and obtaining permits and licenses may be prohibitive and could delay our planned exploration\nactivities. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permitting requirements may result in enforcement actions, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial\nauthorities causing exploration operations to cease or be curtailed, and may include corrective measures requiring capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment, or\nremedial actions.\nParties engaged in exploration operations may be required to compensate those suffering loss or damage by reason of the exploration activities and may have civil or criminal\nfines or penalties imposed for violations of applicable laws or regulations. Amendments to current laws, regulations and permits governing operations and activities of\nexploration companies, or more stringent implementation thereof, could have a material adverse impact on our operations and cause increases in capital expenditures or\nproduction costs or reduction in levels of exploration activities at our properties or require abandonment or delays in future activities.\nWe are subject to significant governmental regulations, which affect our operations and costs of conducting our business.\nOur current and future operations are and will be governed by laws and regulations, including:\n● laws and regulations governing mineral concession acquisition, prospecting, exploration and development and operation;\n● laws and regulations related to exports, taxes and fees;\n● labor standards and regulations related to occupational health and mine safety; and\n● environmental standards and regulations related to waste disposal, toxic substances, land use and environmental protection.\n25\nCompanies engaged in exploration activities often experience increased costs and delays in exploration and other schedules as a result of the need to comply with applicable\nlaws, regulations and permits. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permits may result in enforcement actions, including the forfeiture of mineral claims or\nother mineral tenures, orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities requiring operations to cease or be curtailed, and may include corrective measures requiring capital\nexpenditures, installation of additional equipment or costly remedial actions. We may be required to compensate those suffering loss or damage by reason of our mineral\nexploration activities and may have civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed for violations of such laws, regulations and permits. Existing and possible future laws,\nregulations and permits governing operations and activities of exploration companies, or more stringent implementation, could have a material adverse impact on our business\nand cause increases in capital expenditures or require abandonment or delays in exploration.\nOur business is subject to extensive environmental regulations that may make exploring, or related activities prohibitively expensive, and which may change at any time.\nAll of our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations that can substantially delay exploration and make exploration expensive or prohibit it altogether. We\nmay be subject to potential liabilities associated with the pollution of the environment and the disposal of waste products that may occur as the result of exploring and other\nrelated activities on our properties. We may have to pay to remedy environmental pollution, which may reduce the amount of money that we have available to use for\nexploration, or other activities, and adversely affect our financial position. If we are unable to fully remedy an environmental problem, we might be required to suspend\nexploration operations or to enter into interim compliance measures pending the completion of the required remedy. We have not purchased insurance for potential\nenvironmental risks (including potential liability for pollution or other hazards associated with the disposal of waste products from our exploration activities) and such\ninsurance may not be available to us on reasonable terms or at a reasonable price. All of our exploration will be subject to regulation under one or more local, state and federal\nenvironmental impact analyses and public review processes. It is possible that future changes in applicable laws, regulations and permits or changes in their enforcement or\nregulatory interpretation could have significant impact on some portion of our business, which may require our business to be economically re-evaluated from time to time.\nThese risks include, but are not limited to, the risk that regulatory authorities may increase bonding requirements beyond our financial capability. Inasmuch as posting of\nbonding in accordance with regulatory determinations is a condition to the right to operate under specific federal and state exploration operating permits, increases in bonding\nrequirements could prevent operations even if we are in full compliance with all substantive environmental laws.\nRegulations and pending legislation governing issues involving climate change could result in increased operating costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness.\nA number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impact of climate change. Legislation\nand increased regulation regarding climate change could impose significant costs on us, our venture partners and our suppliers, including costs related to increased energy\nrequirements, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs to comply with such regulations. Any adopted future climate change regulations could\nalso negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. Given the emotion, political significance and uncertainty around\nthe impact of climate change and how it should be dealt with, we cannot predict how legislation and regulation will affect our financial condition, operating performance and\nability to compete. Furthermore, even without such regulation, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about potential impacts on climate\nchange by us or other companies in our industry could harm our reputation. The potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and would\nbe particular to the geographic circumstances in areas in which we operate. These may include changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities, water shortages, changing\nsea levels and changing temperatures. These impacts may adversely impact the cost, production and financial performance of our operations.\n26\nThe values of our properties are subject to volatility in the price of gold and any other deposits we may seek or locate.\nOur ability to obtain additional and continuing funding, and our profitability in the event we commence future mining operations or sell the rights to mine, will be significantly\naffected by changes in the market price of gold. Gold prices fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors, all of which are beyond our control. Some of these factors\ninclude the sale or purchase of gold by central banks and financial institutions; interest rates; currency exchange rates; inflation or deflation; fluctuation in the value of the\nUnited States dollar and other currencies; speculation; global and regional supply and demand, including investment, industrial and jewelry demand; and the political and\neconomic conditions of major gold or other mineral producing countries throughout the world, such as Russia and South Africa. The price of gold or other minerals have\nfluctuated widely in recent years, and a decline in the price of gold could cause a significant decrease in the value of our properties, limit our ability to raise money, and render\ncontinued exploration activities of our properties impracticable. If that happens, then we could lose our rights to our properties and be compelled to sell some or all of these\nrights. Additionally, the future progression of our properties beyond the exploration stage is heavily dependent upon the level of gold prices remaining sufficiently high to make\nthe continuation of our properties economically viable. A decrease in the price of gold may adversely affect our financial condition and access to capital and result in a decrease\nin our stock price. The greater the decrease in the price of gold, the more likely it is that our stock price will decrease.\nOur property titles may be challenged, and we are not insured against any challenges, impairments or defects to our mineral claims or property titles.\nWe cannot guarantee that title to our properties will not be challenged. Title insurance is not available for our mineral properties, and our ability to ensure that we have obtained\nsecure rights to individual mineral properties or mining concessions may be severely constrained. Our unpatented Keystone claims were created and maintained in accordance\nwith the federal General Mining Law of 1872. Unpatented claims are unique U.S. property interests and are generally considered to be subject to greater title risk than other real\nproperty interests because the validity of unpatented claims is often uncertain. This uncertainty arises, in part, out of the complex federal and state laws and regulations under\nthe General Mining Law. We have obtained a title report on our Keystone claims but cannot be certain that all defects or conflicts with our title to those claims have been\nidentified. Further, we have not obtained title insurance regarding our purchase and ownership of the Keystone claims. Defending any challenges to our property titles may be\ncostly and may divert funds that could otherwise be used for exploration activities and other purposes. We cannot provide any assurances that there are no title defects affecting\nour properties. In addition, unpatented claims are always subject to possible challenges by third parties or contests by the federal government, which, if successful, may prevent\nus from exploiting our discovery of commercially extractable gold. Challenges to our title may increase its costs of operation or limit our ability to explore on certain portions\nof our properties. We are not insured against challenges, impairments or defects to our property titles, nor do we intend to carry extensive title insurance in the future.\nMarket forces or unforeseen developments may prevent us from obtaining the supplies and equipment necessary to explore for gold and other minerals.\nGold exploration, and mineral exploration in general, is a very competitive business. Competitive demands for contractors and unforeseen shortages of supplies and/or\nequipment could result in the disruption of our planned exploration activities. Current demand for exploration drilling services, equipment and supplies is robust and could\nresult in suitable equipment and skilled manpower being unavailable at scheduled times for our exploration program. The recent inflationary environment has also resulted in a\nsignificant increase in costs, including fuel. If we cannot find the equipment and supplies needed for our various exploration programs, we may have to suspend some or all of\nthem until equipment, supplies, funds and/or skilled manpower become available. Any such disruption in our activities may adversely affect our exploration activities and\nfinancial condition.\nJoint ventures and other partnerships may expose us to risks.\nWe may enter into future joint ventures or partnership arrangements with other parties in relation to the exploration, of a certain portion of the CK Gold, Keystone and Challis\nGold Properties in which we have an interest. Joint ventures can often require unanimous approval of the parties to the joint venture or their representatives for certain\nfundamental decisions such as an increase or reduction of registered capital, merger, division, dissolution, amendments of consenting documents, and the pledge of joint venture\nassets, which means that each joint venture party may have a veto right with respect to such decisions which could lead to a deadlock in the operations of the joint venture.\nFurther, we may be unable to exert control over strategic decisions made in respect of such properties. Any failure of such other companies to meet their obligations to us or to\nthird parties, or any disputes with respect to the parties’ respective rights and obligations, could have a material adverse effect on the joint ventures or their properties and\ntherefore could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial performance, cash flows and the price of the Common Shares.\n27\nWe may pursue acquisitions, divestitures, business combinations or other transactions with other companies, involving our properties or new properties, which could harm\nour operating results, may disrupt our business and could result in unanticipated accounting charges.\nAcquisitions of other companies or new properties, divestitures, business combinations or other transactions with other companies may create additional, material risks for our\nbusiness that could cause our results to differ materially and adversely from our expected or projected results. Such risk factors include the effects of possible disruption to the\nexploration activities and mine planning, loss of value associated with our properties, mismanagement of project development, additional risk and liability, indemnification\nobligations, sales of assets at unfavorable prices, failure to sell non-core assets at all, poor execution of the plans for such transactions, permit requirements, debt incurred or\ncapital stock issued to enter into such transactions, the impact of any such transactions on our financial results, negative stakeholder reaction to any such transaction and our\nability to successfully integrate an acquired company’s operations with our operations. If the purchase price of any acquired businesses exceeds the current fair values of the net\ntangible assets of such acquired businesses, we would be required to record material amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets, which could result in significant\nimpairment and amortization expense in future periods. These charges, in addition to the results of operations of such acquired businesses and potential restructuring costs\nassociated with an acquisition, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot forecast the number, timing or size\nof future transactions, or the effect that any such transactions might have on our operating or financial results. Any potential future transactions will be viewed on their merits\nby management and ultimately our Board at the time definitive proposals are received by the Company and viewed relative to the current circumstances of the Company and its\nbusiness. Furthermore, potential transactions, whether or not consummated, will divert our management’s attention and may require considerable cash outlays at the expense of\nour existing operations. In addition, to complete future transactions, we may issue equity securities, incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or have amortization expenses and\nwrite-downs of acquired assets, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe may experience difficulty attracting and retaining qualified management to meet the needs of our anticipated growth, and the failure to manage our growth effectively\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. In addition, we are dependent upon our employees being able to safely perform their jobs,\nincluding the potential for physical injuries or illness.\nWe are dependent on a relatively small number of key employees, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer and our Vice President –\nExploration and Technical Services. The loss of any officer could have an adverse effect on us. We have no life insurance on any individual, and we may be unable to hire a\nsuitable replacement for them on favorable terms, should that become necessary.\nOur success is also dependent on the contributions of highly skilled and experienced consultants and contractors. Our ability to achieve our operating goals depends upon our\nability to retain such consultants and contractors in order to execute on our strategy. There continues to be competition over highly skilled consultants and contractors in our\nindustry. If we lose key consultants, contractors, or one or more members of our senior management team, and we fail to develop adequate succession plans, our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be harmed.\nOur business is dependent upon our consultants and contractors being able to safely perform their jobs, including the potential for physical injuries or illness. If we experience\nperiods where our consultants and contractors are unable to perform their jobs for any reason, including as a result of illness, our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\n28\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nOur future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in\njurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as\nwell as certain discrete items. We are subject to review or audit by tax authorities. As a result, we may in the future receive assessments in multiple jurisdictions on various tax-\nrelated assertions. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, the determination of\nour provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment, and there could be situations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although\nwe believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial\nresults in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nOur activities may be adversely affected by unforeseeable and unquantifiable health risks, whether those effects are local, nationwide or global. Matters outside our control\nmay prevent us from executing on our exploration programs, limit travel of Company representatives, adversely affect the health and welfare of Company personnel or\nprevent important vendors and contractors from performing normal and contracted activities.\nThe risks we face related to contagious disease, or policies implemented by governments to protect against the spread of a disease, are unforeseeable and unquantifiable by us.\nWe, or our people, investors, contractors or stakeholders, may be prevented from free cross-border travel or normal attendance to activities in conducting Company business at\ntrade shows, presentations, meetings or other activities meant to promote or execute our business strategy and transactions. We may be prevented from receiving goods or\nservices from contractors. Decisions beyond our control, such as canceled events, restricted travel, barriers to entry or other factors may affect our ability to accomplish drilling\nprograms, technical analysis of completed exploration actions, equity raising activities, and other needs that would normally be accomplished without such limitations.\nWe use a variety of outsourced contractors to execute our exploration programs. Drilling contractors need to be able to access our projects and ensure social distancing\nrecommended safety standards While our contractors are currently able to access our projects, there can be no assurances that this access will continue if subsequent waves of\nthe infection or variant strains appear.\nAs an exploration and development company with no revenues, we are reliant on constantly raising additional capital to fund our operations. A continuation or worsening of the\nlevels of market disruption and volatility seen in the recent past could have an adverse effect on our ability to access capital, on our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition, and on the market price of our common stock. There are no assurances we will be able to raise additional capital on favorable terms in the foreseeable future.\nWe are dependent on information technology systems, which are subject to certain risks, including cybersecurity risks and data leakage risks.\nWe are dependent upon information technology systems in the conduct of our business. Any significant breakdown, invasion, virus, cyberattack, security breach, destruction or\ninterruption of these systems by employees, others with authorized access to our systems, or unauthorized persons could negatively impact our business. To the extent any\ninvasion, cyberattack or security breach results in disruption to our business, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, our data or confidential information, our reputation, business,\nresults of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against cyber security risks may not be\nsufficient. Although to date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyberattacks, we may suffer such losses in the future. We may be required to expend\nsignificant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures. We also may be subject to significant litigation, regulatory investigation and\nremediation costs associated with any information security vulnerabilities, cyberattacks or security breaches.\nThe Company could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective, not installed properly or not\nproperly integrated into operations. Various measures have been implemented to manage the risks related to the system implementation and modification, but system\nmodification failures could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position, and results of operations.\n29\nRISKS RELATED TO THE MINERAL EXPLORATION INDUSTRY\nExploring for gold is an inherently speculative business.\nNatural resource exploration and exploring for gold in particular is a business that by its nature is very speculative. There is a strong possibility that we will not discover gold or\nany other resources which can be mined or extracted at a profit. Although we have established the existence of mineral reserves at the CK Gold Project, we may be\nunsuccessful in bringing it into production on a profitable basis. Few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. Unusual or unexpected\ngeological formations, geological formation pressures, fires, power outages, labor disruptions, flooding, explosions, cave-ins, landslides and the inability to obtain suitable or\nadequate machinery, equipment or labor are just some of the many risks involved in mineral exploration programs and the subsequent expansion of potential gold deposits.\nEstimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources are subject to evaluation uncertainties that could result in project failure.\nOur exploration and future potential mining operations, if any, are and would be faced with risks associated with being able to accurately predict the quantity and quality of\nmineral resources or mineral reserves within the earth using statistical sampling techniques. Estimates of mineral resources or mineral reserves on our properties are made using\nsamples obtained from appropriately placed trenches, test pits and underground workings and intelligently designed drilling. There is an inherent variability of assays between\ncheck and duplicate samples taken adjacent to each other and between sampling points that cannot be reasonably eliminated. Additionally, there also may be unknown geologic\ndetails that have not been identified or correctly appreciated at the current level of accumulated knowledge about our properties. This could result in uncertainties that cannot be\nreasonably eliminated from the process of estimating potential mineral resources/reserves. If these estimates were to prove to be unreliable, we could implement an exploitation\nplan that may not lead to any commercially viable operations in the future.\nWe may be denied the government licenses and permits which we need to explore or mine on our properties.\nExploration activities usually require the granting of permits from various governmental agencies. For example, exploration drilling on unpatented mineral claims requires a\npermit to be obtained from the United States BLM, which may take several months or longer to grant the requested permit. Depending on the size, location and scope of the\nexploration program, additional permits may also be required before exploration activities can be undertaken. Prehistoric or Native American graveyards, threatened or\nendangered species, archeological sites or the possibility thereof, difficult access, excessive dust and important nearby water resources may all result in the need for additional\npermits before exploration activities can commence. As with all permitting processes, there is the risk that unexpected delays and excessive costs may be experienced in\nobtaining required permits. The needed permits may not be granted at all. Delays in or our inability to obtain necessary permits will result in unanticipated costs, which may\nresult in serious adverse effects upon our business.\nPossible amendments to the General Mining Law and other regulations could make it more difficult or impossible for us to execute our business plan.\nIn recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered a number of proposed amendments to the General Mining Law, as well as legislation that would make comprehensive\nchanges to the law. Although no such comprehensive legislation has been adopted to date, there can be no assurance that such legislation will not be adopted in the future. If\nadopted, such legislation, if it includes concepts that have been part of previous legislative proposals, could, among other things, (i) limit on the number of millsites that a\nclaimant may use, (ii) impose time limits on the effectiveness of plans of operation that may not coincide with mine life, (iii) impose more stringent environmental compliance\nand reclamation requirements on activities on unpatented mining claims and millsites, (iv) establish a mechanism that would allow states, localities and Native American tribes\nto petition for the withdrawal of identified tracts of federal land from the operation of the General Mining Law, (v) allow for administrative determinations that mining would\nnot be allowed in situations where undue degradation of the federal lands in question could not be prevented, (vi) impose royalties on gold and other mineral production from\nunpatented mining claims or impose fees on production from patented mining claims, and (vii) impose a fee on the amount of material displaced at a mine. Further, such\nlegislation, if enacted, could have an adverse impact on earnings from our exploration operations, could reduce future estimates of any reserves we may establish and could\ncurtail our future exploration activity on our unpatented claims.\n30\nOur ability to conduct exploration, and related activities may also be impacted by administrative actions taken by federal agencies.\nWe may not be able to maintain the infrastructure necessary to conduct exploration and development activities.\nOur exploration and development activities depend upon adequate infrastructure. Reliable roads, bridges, power sources and water supply are important factors which affect\ncapital and operating costs. Climate change or unusual or infrequent weather phenomena, sabotage, government or other interference in the maintenance or provision of such\ninfrastructure could adversely affect our exploration activities and financial condition.\nWe compete against larger and more experienced companies.\nThe mining industry is intensely competitive. Many large mining companies are primarily producers of precious or base metals and may become interested in the types of\ndeposits and exploration projects on which we are focused, which include gold, silver and other precious metals deposits or polymetallic deposits containing significant\nquantities of base metals, including copper. Many of these companies have greater financial resources, experience and technical capabilities than we do. We may encounter\nincreasing competition from other mining companies in our efforts to acquire mineral properties and hire experienced mining professionals. Increased competition in our\nbusiness could adversely affect our ability to attract necessary capital funding or acquire suitable mining properties or prospects for mineral exploration in the future.\nWe rely on contractors to conduct a significant portion of our exploration operations.\nA significant portion of our exploration operations are currently conducted in whole or in part by contractors. As a result, our exploration operations are subject to a number of\nrisks, some of which are outside our control, including:\n● negotiating agreements with contractors on acceptable terms;\n● the inability to replace a contractor and its operating equipment in the event that either party terminates the agreement;\n● reduced control over those aspects of operations which are the responsibility of the contractor;\n● failure of a contractor to perform under its agreement;\n● interruption of exploration operations or increased costs in the event that a contractor ceases its business due to insolvency or other unforeseen events;\n● failure of a contractor to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, to the extent it is responsible for such compliance; and\n● problems of a contractor with managing its workforce, labor unrest or other employment issues.\nIn addition, we may incur liability to third parties as a result of the actions of our contractors. The occurrence of one or more of these risks could adversely affect our results of\noperations and financial position.\nOur exploration activities may be adversely affected by the local climate or seismic events, which could prevent us from gaining access to our property year-round.\nEarthquakes, heavy rains, snowstorms, wildfires and floods could result in serious damage to or the destruction of facilities, equipment or means of access to our property, or\nmay otherwise prevent us from conducting exploration activities on our property. There may be short periods of time when the unpaved portion of the access road is impassible\nin the event of extreme weather conditions or unusually muddy conditions. During these periods, it may be difficult or impossible for us to access our property, make repairs, or\notherwise conduct exploration activities on them.\n31\nWe may be unable to secure surface access or to purchase required surface rights.\nAlthough we acquire the rights to some or all of the minerals in the ground subject to the mineral tenures that it acquires, or has a right to acquire, in most cases it does not\nthereby acquire any rights to, or ownership of, the surface to the areas covered by such mineral tenures. In such cases, applicable mining laws usually provide for rights of\naccess to the surface for the purpose of carrying on exploration activities, however, the enforcement of such rights through the courts can be costly and time consuming. It is\nnecessary to negotiate surface access or to purchase the surface rights if long-term access is required. There can be no guarantee that, despite having the right at law to access\nthe surface and carry on exploration activities, we will be able to negotiate satisfactory agreements with any such existing landowners/occupiers for such access or purchase of\nsuch surface rights, and therefore we may be unable to carry out planned exploration activities. In addition, in circumstances where such access is denied, or no agreement can\nbe reached, we may need to rely on the assistance of local officials or the courts in such jurisdiction the outcomes of which cannot be predicted with any certainty. Our inability\nto secure surface access or purchase required surface rights could materially and adversely affect our timing, cost or overall ability to develop any potential mineral deposits we\nmay locate.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control,\nincluding the following:\n● results of our operations and exploration efforts;\n● fluctuation in the supply of, demand and market price for gold and copper;\n● our ability to obtain working capital financing;\n● additions or departures of key personnel;\n● limited “public float” in the hands of a small number of persons whose sales or lack of sales could result in positive or negative pricing pressure on the market price for\nour common stock;\n● our ability to execute our business plan;\n● sales of our common stock and decline in demand for our common stock;\n● regulatory developments;\n● economic and other external factors;\n● investor perception of our industry or our prospects; and\n● period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time-to-time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular\ncompanies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As a result, you may be unable to resell your shares of\nour common stock at a desired price.\nVolatility in the price of our common stock may subject us to securities litigation.\nAs discussed above, the market for our common stock is characterized by significant price volatility when compared to seasoned issuers, and we expect that our share price will\ncontinue to be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have initiated securities class action litigation against a company following\nperiods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and\nliabilities and could divert management’s attention and resources.\nThere is currently a limited trading market for our common stock and we cannot ensure that one will ever develop or be sustained.\nAlthough our common stock is currently quoted on NASDAQ, there is limited trading activity. We can give no assurance that an active market will develop, or if developed,\nthat it will be sustained. If an investor acquires shares of our common stock, the investor may not be able to liquidate our shares should there be a need or desire to do so. There\ncan be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock either now or in the future. The market liquidity of our common stock is limited and\nmay be dependent on the market perception of our business, among other things. We may, in the future, take certain steps, including utilizing investor awareness campaigns,\npress releases, road shows and conferences to increase awareness of our business and any steps that we might take to bring us to the awareness of investors may require we\ncompensate consultants with cash and/or stock. There can be no assurance that there will be any awareness generated or the results of any efforts will result in any impact on\nour trading volume. Consequently, investors may not be able to liquidate their investment or liquidate it at a price that reflects the value of the business and trading may be at an\ninflated price relative to our performance due to, among other things, availability of sellers of our shares. If a market should develop, the price may be highly volatile. Because\nthere may be a low price for our shares of common stock, many brokerage firms or clearing firms may not be willing to effect transactions in the securities or accept our shares\nfor deposit in an account. Even if an investor finds a broker willing to effect a transaction in the shares of our common stock, the combination of brokerage commissions,\ntransfer fees, taxes, if any, and any other selling costs may exceed the selling price. Further, many lending institutions will not permit the use of low-priced shares of common\nstock as collateral for any loans.\n32\nSales, offers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nSales of substantial amounts of the common stock, or the availability of such securities for sale, could adversely affect the prevailing market prices for the common stock. A\ndecline in the market prices of the common stock could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of securities should we desire to do so. In addition, if our\nstockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or upon the expiration of any statutory holding period, under Rule 144, or upon the exercise of\noutstanding options or warrants, it could create a circumstance commonly referred to as an “overhang” in anticipation of which the market price of our common stock could\ndecline. The existence of an overhang, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, also could make it more difficult for us to raise additional financing through the sale\nof equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.\nOur issuance of additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock in exchange for services would dilute the proportionate ownership and\nvoting rights of existing stockholders and could have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock.\nOur Board may generally issue shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock without further approval by our stockholders, based upon such factors that\nour Board may deem relevant at that time. We have also issued securities as payment for services. It is possible that we will issue additional securities to pay for services in the\nfuture. We cannot give you any assurance that we will not issue additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock under circumstances we may\ndeem appropriate at the time.\nOur articles of incorporation allow for our Board to create new series of preferred stock without further approval by our stockholders, which could adversely affect the\nrights of the holders of our common stock.\nOur Board has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock. Board also has the authority to issue preferred stock without further\nstockholder approval. As a result, our Board could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon\nliquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of our common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares, together\nwith a premium, prior to the redemption of our common stock. In addition, our Board could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that has greater voting power\nthan our common stock or that is convertible into our common stock, which could decrease the relative voting power of our common stock or result in dilution to our existing\nstockholders.\nAnti-takeover provisions may impede the acquisition of our Company.\nCertain provisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes have anti-takeover effects and may inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination. These provisions are\nintended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with, and to obtain the approval of, our Board in connection with such a transaction. However, certain\nof these provisions may discourage a future acquisition of us, including an acquisition in which the stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. As a result,\nstockholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have the opportunity to do so.\n33\nThe Company does not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe anticipate that we will retain any future earnings to support operations and to finance the development of our business and do not expect to pay cash dividends in the\nforeseeable future. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that our\ncommon stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders have purchased their shares.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could\ndecline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We have relatively\nlittle research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If no additional industry analysts commence coverage of the Company, the trading price for our common stock\ncould be negatively impacted. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrades our common stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business,\nour stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could\ndecrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nWe may not meet the continued listing requirements of the NASDAQ, which could result in a delisting of our common stock.\nOur common stock is listed on the NASDAQ. We have in the past, and may in the future, be unable to comply with certain of the listing standards that we are required to meet\nto maintain the listing of our common shares on the NASDAQ. For instance, on November 7, 2019, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of the\nNASDAQ Stock Market indicating that, based upon the closing bid price of our common stock for the 30 consecutive business day period between September 26, 2019,\nthrough November 6, 2019, we did not meet the minimum bid price of $1.00 per share required for continued listing on the NASDAQ pursuant to NASDAQ Listing Rule\n5550(a)(2). On April 3, 2020, we received notice from the NASDAQ indicating that we have regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement under NASDAQ\nListing Rule 5550(a)(2), and the matter is now closed.\nIf NASDAQ delists our common stock from trading on its exchange for failure to meet the listing standards, we and our stockholders could face significant material adverse\nconsequences including:\n● a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n● a determination that our common stock is a “penny stock” which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly\nresulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our common stock;\n● a limited amount of analyst coverage; and\n● a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nDelisting could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business\ndevelopment opportunities.\nItem 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNot applicable.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nOur system of internal controls includes consideration of cybersecurity risks. We use technology and control procedures designed to mitigate cybersecurity risks, with our\nmanagement team working to monitor, identify, assess, and respond to potential cybersecurity incidents that may threaten the Company. The system of controls also focuses on\nsecurity awareness and training for employees with access to Company systems. Company management periodically reviews system and organization control reports (SOC 1,\nType 2) for key outsourced information systems to ensure that third-party data processing is subject to appropriate controls and security measures.\nWe have engaged with a third-party information technology firm to assess our vulnerabilities and help us mitigate cybersecurity-related risks.\n34\nManagement is responsible for the operational oversight of company-wide cybersecurity strategy, policy, and standards across relevant departments to assess and help prepare\nus to address cybersecurity risks. As part of our overall risk management system, we monitor and test our safeguards and train our employees on these safeguards. Personnel at\nall levels and departments are made aware of our cybersecurity policies through trainings and necessary implementations.\nOne of the key functions of our Board is informed oversight of our risk management process, including risks from cybersecurity threats. Our Board is responsible for\nmonitoring and assessing strategic risk exposure, and management is responsible for the day-to-day management of any material risks that may arise. Our Board receives\nperiodic updates from management regarding cybersecurity matters and is notified between such updates regarding any significant new cybersecurity threats or incidents, if\nany. We do not believe that there are currently any known risks from cybersecurity threats that are reasonably likely to materially affect us or our business strategy, results of\noperations or financial condition.\nAs of April 30, 2024, we have not identified an indication of a cybersecurity incident that would have a material impact on our business and consolidated financial statements.\nFor further discussion of cybersecurity risks, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nItem 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. To our knowledge, there are no material pending legal\nproceedings to which we are a party or of which any of our property is the subject.\nItem 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nPursuant to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, issuers that are operators, or that have a subsidiary that is an operator, of a coal or other mine in the United States are\nrequired to disclose specified information about mine health and safety in their periodic reports. These reporting requirements are based on the safety and health requirements\napplicable to mines under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the “Mine Act”) which is administered by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Mine Safety and Health\nAdministration (“MSHA”). During the twelve months period ended April 30, 2024, we and our properties or operations were not subject to regulation by MSHA under the\nMine Act and thus no disclosure is required under Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act.\n35\nPART II\nItem 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nMarket Information\nOur Common Stock is traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “USAU”.\nHolders of Common Stock\nOn July 26, 2024, we had 88 registered holders of record of our common stock, which number does not reflect beneficial stockholders who hold their stock in nominee or\n“street” name through various brokerage firms. On July 26, 2024, the closing sales price of our common stock as reported on NASDAQ Capital Market was $5.84 per share.\nDividends and Dividend Policy\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends on shares of its common stock in the foreseeable future as our Board intends to retain future earnings for use in our business. Any future\ndetermination as of the payment of dividends on our common stock will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations and such other factors as our Board seems\nrelevant.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities.\nThere were no sales of unregistered securities during the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024 that were not previously reported on a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or a Current\nReport on Form 8-K. None of the transactions involved any underwriters, underwriting discounts or commissions.\nItem 6. [RESERVED].\nItem 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nU.S. Gold Corp., formerly known as Dataram Corporation (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”), was originally incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1967 and was\nsubsequently re-incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada in 2016. Effective June 26, 2017, the Company changed its legal name to U.S. Gold Corp. from Dataram\nCorporation. On May 23, 2017, the Company merged with Gold King Corp. (“Gold King”), in a transaction treated as a reverse acquisition and recapitalization, and the\nbusiness of Gold King became the business of the Company. We are a gold and precious metals exploration company pursuing exploration and development properties. We own\ncertain mining leases and other mineral rights comprising the CK Gold Project in Wyoming, the Keystone Project in Nevada and the Challis Gold Project in Idaho. We have\nestablished an estimate of proven and probable mineral reserves under S-K 1300 at our CK Gold Project, where we are conducting exploration and pre-development activities,\nand all of our activities on our other properties are exploratory in nature.\nSummary of Activities for the Fiscal Year Ended April 30, 2024\nDuring the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024, we focused primarily on advancing our CK Gold Project in Wyoming with the approval of two major permits; our surface gold\nmine permit (mine operation and reclamation plan (“MOP”)) approved April 2024 and an Industrial Siting permit for the construction and operation of our CK Gold project\napproved May 2023, and continued engineering studies towards the completion of a revised prefeasibility study and feasibility study. Additional exploration and geologic\ninvestigations were undertaken, enhancing our understanding of the Keystone Project deposit in Nevada and continued analysis of the historic geological data on the Challis\nGold Project in Idaho. Management focused on investor relations and awareness, resulting in the completion of an equity financing in April 2024.\nAn overview of certain significant events follows:\nCK Gold Project, Wyoming\n● In May 2023, we received notification from the Industrial Siting Division of the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (“WDEQ”) that an Industrial Siting\nPermit was granted to us for the construction and operation of the proposed mine at the CK Gold Project.\n● In April 2024, we received a letter from the United States Army Corps of Engineers (“USACE”) confirming that the proposed CK Gold Project did not need a permit\nfrom the USACE for the activities outlined in the MOP. With the project being situated on Wyoming State and private land and falling under the jurisdiction of\nWyoming State authorities, this was the only direct nexus to Federal Government involvement in obtaining the necessary project permits.\n● In April 2024, we received notification from the Land Quality Division of the WDEQ that we received approval on our surface gold mine permit, subject to certain\nconditions.\n● In May 2024, we satisfied two of the three conditions associated with our MOP with 1) the approval of our Wyoming Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit\nand 2) acceptance by the WDEQ of our reclamation bond\n● During the year-ended April 30, 2024, we continued to advance towards approval of our Air Quality permit with the Air Quality Division of the WDEQ. Approval of\nthis air quality permit is the final condition associated with our MOP and is expected to be received this year.\n36\nKeystone Project, Cortez Trend, Nevada\n● We continue systematic exploration investigations at our highly prospective Keystone Project looking for potential drill targets. We conducted a hyperspectral survey\non the property identifying evidence of potential mineralization. Numerous anomalies often associated with mineralization were identified. Field investigation of the\nmost prospective anomalies was completed during the 2023 field season. Altered sedimentary outcrops containing anomalous gold grades were discovered which\nrequire additional investigation.\nChallis Gold Project, Idaho\n● We continue towards the completion of a Plan of Operations as the next phase of exploration.\nSales of Common Shares to raise a total of $4.9 million in cash\nOn April 19, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) with certain institutional and accredited investors in connection with\na registered direct offering of 1,400,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $3.50 per share and warrants to purchase 1,400,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise\nprice of $4.48 per share (the “Registered Offering”). The warrants are exercisable on October 19, 2024 and will expire on October 19, 2029. The aggregate gross proceeds of\nthe Registered Offering was $4,900,000 before deduction of legal related offering expenses of $72,309. The closing of the Registered Offering occurred on April 19, 2024.\nShareholder Meeting, Appointment of Directors and Corporate Matters\nOn April 26, 2024, we held our annual meeting of stockholders. At that meeting, among other matters, shareholders re-elected to our Board four of the five incumbent\nDirectors: Mr. Norman, Mr. Bee, Mr. Schafer and Mr. Waldkirch; and elected Ms. Johanna Fipke to our Board, replacing Ms. Tara Gilfillan, who did not stand for re-election.\nEach of the elected Directors will hold office until the next meeting of stockholders and until their successors are named and qualified or until their earlier resignation or\nremoval. The stockholders also ratified the appointment of our audit firm for our fiscal year ended April 30, 2024.\nResults of Operations\nNet Revenues\nWe are a development-stage company with no operations, and we did not generate any revenues for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024, as compared to the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023, were approximately $7,257,000 and $9,401,000,\nrespectively. The approximate $2,144,000 decrease in operating expenses for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024, as compared to the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023, is\ncomprised of (i) a decrease in compensation expense of approximately $437,000 primarily due to a decrease in stock based compensation, (ii) a decrease of approximately\n$336,000 in exploration expenses on our mineral properties due to the decrease in exploration activities and related consulting expenses at our CK Gold property, (iii) a\ndecrease in professional and consulting fees of approximately $1,204,000 primarily due to decreases in general strategic and permitting consulting services of $698,000,\ndecrease in legal fees of $64,000, decreases in director fees of $247,000 (primarily due to the decrease in director stock based compensation), decrease in investor relation fees\nof $244,000, offset marginally by an increase in accounting fees of $49,000 and (iv) a decrease in general and administrative expenses of approximately $167,000 due primarily\nto decreases related to advertising, insurance, research and development, and travel expenses.\n37\nLoss from Operations\nWe reported loss from operations of approximately $7,257,000 and $9,401,000 for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOther Income (Loss)\nWe reported other income of approximately $360,000 and $1,786,000 for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We reported a change in fair value of warrant\nliability of approximately $314,000 and $1,560,000 for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We reported a gain from the sale of asset (Maggie Creek) of\napproximately $0 and $763,000 for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We reported interest income and gain from settlement of asset retirement obligation\nof approximately $40,000 and $6,000, respectively, for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024, as compared to approximately $4,900 and $0 during the fiscal year ended April 30,\n2023, respectively. We reported a decrease in change in fair value due to modification of warrants of approximately $263,000 and decrease in offering cost related to warrant\nliability of approximately $279,000 for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023 as compared to none during the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024.\nNet Loss\nWe reported a net loss of approximately $6,897,000 and $7,614,000 for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table summarizes total current assets, liabilities and working capital at April 30, 2024, compared to April 30, 2023, and the changes between those periods:\nApril 30, 2024 April 30, 2023 Increase (decrease)\nCurrent Assets $ 6,523,111 $ 8,433,070 $ (1,909,959)\nCurrent Liabilities $ 452,790 $ 378,798 $ 73,992\nWorking Capital $ 6,070,321 $ 8,054,272 $ (1,983,951)\nAs of April 30, 2024, we had working capital of $6,070,321, as compared to working capital of $8,054,272 as of April 30, 2023, a decrease of $1,983,951.\nWe are obligated to file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). In addition, the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley”) and the rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board have imposed\nvarious requirements on public companies, including requiring changes in corporate governance practices. We expect to spend between $175,000 and $250,000 in legal and\naccounting expenses annually to comply with our reporting obligations and Sarbanes-Oxley. These costs could affect profitability and our results of operations.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting in accordance with U.S. GAAP and have been prepared assuming that we will\ncontinue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. For the years ended April 30, 2024\nand 2023, we incurred net losses in the amounts of approximately $6,897,000 and $7,614,000, respectively. For the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024, cash used in operating\nactivities was approximately $7,076,000. As of April 30, 2024, we had cash of approximately $5,574,000, working capital of approximately $6,070,000, and an accumulated\ndeficit of approximately $72,848,000. Our primary source of operating funds since inception has been equity financing. As of April 30, 2024, we may have sufficient cash to\nfund our corporate activities and general and administrative costs and currently undertaken project activities related to permitting and engineering studies over the next twelve\nmonths. However, in order to advance any of our projects past the aforementioned objectives, we do not have sufficient cash and will need to raise additional funds. These\nmatters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the issuance of these financial statements.\n38\nCash Used in Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities totaled approximately $7,076,000 and $8,691,000 for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net cash used in operating\nactivities during the year fiscal ended April 30, 2024, decreased primarily due to the i) decrease in net loss of approximately $717,000 as compared to the year fiscal ended\nApril 30, 2023 ii) increase in non-cash items of approximately $890,000 as compared to the years ended April 30, 2023. primarily due to the change in fair value of warrant\nliability, stock-based compensation and gain from sale of asset and iii) decrease in changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately $7,500 as compared to the fiscal\nyear ended April 30, 2023.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year fiscal ended April 30, 2024 was $0. Net cash used in investing activities during the years ended April 30, 2023 was\napproximately $2,572,000, primarily from proceeds received from the sale of Maggie Creek of $2,750,000 related to the Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated on\nNovember 9, 2022 and offset by approximately $178,000 primarily for the purchase of property and equipment.\nCash Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately $4,828,000 for the year fiscal ended April 30, 2024 primarily due to the sale of our common stock and warrants\nfor approximately $4,900,000 in April 2024, net of offering costs. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately $4,830,000 for the fiscal year ended April 30,\n2023, primarily due to the sale of our common stock and warrants for approximately $4,800,000 in April 2023, net of offering costs.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of April 30, 2024, we did not have, and do not have any present plans to implement, any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of recently issued accounting pronouncements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of\nthe consolidated balance sheet, and revenues and expenses for the period then ended. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates. Critical accounting estimates\nare those estimates made in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are\nreasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our critical accounting estimates are discussed below, including, to the extent\nmaterial and reasonably available, the impact such estimates have had, or are reasonably likely to have, on our financial condition or results of operations.\n39\nShare-Based Compensation\nShare-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of ASC 718, “Compensation—Stock Compensation” (“ASC 718”), which requires recognition in the\nfinancial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee or director is required\nto perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). ASC 718 also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services\nreceived in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award.\nMineral Rights\nCosts of leasing, exploring, carrying and retaining unproven mineral lease properties are expensed as incurred. We expense all mineral exploration costs as incurred. Where we\nhave identified proven and probable mineral reserves on any of our properties, development costs will be capitalized when all the following criteria have been met, a) we\nreceive the requisite operating permits, b) completion of a favorable Feasibility Study and c) approval from our Board authorizing the development of the ore body. Until such\ntime all these criteria have been met, we record pre-development costs to expense as incurred.\nWhen a property reaches the production stage, the related capitalized costs will be amortized on a units-of-production basis over the proven and probable reserves following the\ncommencement of production. The Company assesses the carrying costs of the capitalized mineral properties for impairment under ASC 360-10, “Impairment of Long-Lived\nAssets”, and evaluates its carrying value under ASC 930-360, “Extractive Activities—Mining”, annually. An impairment is recognized when the sum of the expected\nundiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the mineral properties. Impairment losses, if any, are measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the\nmineral properties over its estimated fair value.\nTo date, the Company has expensed all exploration and pre-development costs as none of its properties have satisfied the criteria above for capitalization.\nASC 930-805, “Extractive Activities—Mining: Business Combinations” (“ASC 930-805”), states that mineral rights consist of the legal right to explore, extract, and retain at\nleast a portion of the benefits from mineral deposits. Mining assets include mineral rights.\nAcquired mineral rights are considered tangible assets under ASC 930-805. ASC 930-805 requires that mineral rights be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. As a\nresult, the direct costs to acquire mineral rights are initially capitalized as tangible assets. Mineral rights include costs associated with acquiring patented and unpatented mining\nclaims.\nASC 930-805 provides that in measuring the fair value of mineral assets, an acquirer should take into account both:\n● The value beyond proven and probable reserves (“VBPP”) to the extent that a market participant would include VBPP in determining the fair value of the assets.\n● The effects of anticipated fluctuations in the future market price of minerals in a manner that is consistent with the expectations of market participants.\nLeases to explore for or use of natural resources are outside the scope of ASC 842, “Leases”.\nWarrant Liability\nWe account for the warrants issued in March 2022 and April 2023, respectively, in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815 “Derivatives and Hedging” whereby\nunder that provision these warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment and must be recorded as a liability. Accordingly, we classify these warrant instruments as\nliabilities at fair value and adjusts the instruments to fair value at each reporting period. This liability is re-measured at each balance sheet date until the warrants are exercised\nor expire, and any change in fair value will be recognized in our statement of operations. The fair value of these warrants is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model.\nSuch warrant classification is also subject to re-evaluation at each reporting period.\nItem 7A.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of April 30, 2024 and\n2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended April 30, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America.\nExplanatory Paragraph – Going Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 3, the\nCompany has a significant working capital deficiency, has incurred significant losses and needs to raise additional funds to meet its obligations and sustain its operations. These\nconditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The\nconsolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our\naudits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an\naudit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the\npurpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We\nbelieve that our audits provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit\ncommittee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex\njudgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.\n/s/ Marcum LLP\nMarcum LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2016 through 2018 and subsequently reappointed as the Company’s auditor in 2019.\nHouston, TX\nJuly 29, 2024\nF-1\nU.S. GOLD CORP.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAPRIL 30, 2024\nNOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nOrganization\nU.S. Gold Corp., formerly known as Dataram Corporation (the “Company”), was originally incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1967 and was subsequently re-\nincorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada in 2016. Effective June 26, 2017, the Company changed its name to U.S. Gold Corp. from Dataram Corporation. On May\n23, 2017, the Company merged with Gold King Corp. (“Gold King”), in a transaction treated as a reverse acquisition and recapitalization, and the business of Gold King\nbecame the business of the Company. The Company is a gold and precious metals exploration company pursuing exploration and development properties. The Company owns\ncertain mining leases and other mineral rights comprising the CK Gold Project in Wyoming, the Keystone Project in Nevada and the Challis Gold Project in Idaho. The\nCompany has established an estimate of proven and probable mineral reserves under S-K 1300 at its CK Gold Project, where the Company is conducting exploration and pre-\ndevelopment activities, and all of its activities on its other properties are exploratory in nature.\nThe Company’s CK Gold property contains proven and probable mineral reserves and accordingly is classified as a development stage property, as defined in subpart 1300 of\nRegulation S-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“S-K 1300”).\nUnless the context otherwise requires, all references herein to the “Company” refer to U.S. Gold Corp. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nNOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of presentation and principles of consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (“U.S. GAAP”), the instructions to Form 10-K, and the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for financial\ninformation, which includes the consolidated financial statements and presents the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries as of\nApril 30, 2024. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. It is management’s opinion that all material adjustments (consisting of normal recurring\nadjustments) have been made, which are necessary for a fair financial statement presentation.\nUse of Estimates and Assumptions\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the\ndate of the consolidated balance sheet, and revenues and expenses for the period then ended. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates. Significant estimates\nmade by management include, but are not limited to, valuation of mineral rights, stock-based compensation, the fair value of common stock, valuation of warrant liability, asset\nretirement obligations and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nRevision of Financial Statements\nDuring the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021 (“fiscal year 2021”), the Company determined that it had not appropriately recorded a deferred tax liability related to the acquisition\nof mineral rights in August 2020. This resulted in an understatement of deferred tax liability and a corresponding understatement of provision for income taxes during fiscal\nyear 2021. Based on an analysis of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 250 – “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections” (“ASC 250”), Staff Accounting Bulletin 99\n– “Materiality” and Staff Accounting Bulletin 108 – “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial\nStatements,” the Company determined that these errors were immaterial to the previously issued consolidated financial statements, and as such no restatement was necessary.\nCorrecting prior period financial statements for immaterial errors would not require previously filed reports to be amended.\nF-6\nU.S. GOLD CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAPRIL 30, 2024\nThe effect of this revision on the line items within the Company’s consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity as of April 30, 2022, was as follows:\nApril 30, 2022\nAs Previously Reported Revision As Revised\nAccumulated Deficit $ (57,905,928) $ (430,486) $ (58,336,414)\nTotal Stockholders’ Equity $ 23,657,801 $ (430,486) $ 23,227,315\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company has adopted ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC 820”), for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. ASC 820\nestablishes a common definition for fair value to be applied in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of fair value measurements, establishes a framework for\nmeasuring fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements.\nASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. Additionally, ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\nThese inputs are prioritized below:\nLevel 1:Observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2:Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.\nLevel 3:Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which, require the use of the reporting entity’s own assumptions.\nThe Company analyzes all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under the Financial Accounting Standard Board’s (“FASB”) accounting standard for\nsuch instruments. Under this standard, financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement.\nThe Company’s warrant liability for warrants issued in connection with equity financing in March 2022 and April 2023 (see Note 9) was estimated using a Monte Carlo\nsimulation model using Level 3 inputs.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash equivalents are comprised of certain highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased. The Company did not have any cash equivalents\non hand at April 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company places its cash with high credit quality financial institutions. The Company’s accounts at these institutions are insured by the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to $250,000. To reduce its risk associated with the failure of such financial institutions, the Company evaluates, at least\nannually, the rating of the financial institutions in which it holds deposits. At April 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had bank balances of approximately $5.2 million and $7.3\nmillion, respectively, exceeding the FDIC insurance limit on interest bearing accounts.\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets of $948,833 and $610,140 at April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, consist primarily of costs paid for future services which will\noccur within a year. Prepaid expenses principally include prepayments in cash and equity instruments for consulting, public relations, business advisory services, insurance\npremiums, mining claim fees, easement fees, options fees, and mineral lease fees which are being amortized over the terms of their respective agreements.\nProperty\nProperty is carried at cost. The cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets are retired or\ndisposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are included in income in the year of disposition.\nDepreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets, generally three to five years.\nF-7\nU.S. GOLD CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAPRIL 30, 2024\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully\nrecoverable, or at least annually. The Company recognizes an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the\nasset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset’s estimated fair value and its book value. The Company did not recognize any impairment\nduring the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023.\nMineral Rights\nCosts of leasing, exploring, carrying and retaining unproven mineral lease properties are expensed as incurred. The Company expenses all mineral exploration costs as incurred.\nWhere the Company has identified proven and probable mineral reserves on any of its properties, development costs will be capitalized when all the following criteria have\nbeen met, a) the Company receives the requisite operating permits, b) completion of a favorable Feasibility Study and c) approval from the Board of director’s authorizing the\ndevelopment of the ore body. Until such time all these criteria have been met the Company records pre-development costs to expense as incurred.\nWhen a property reaches the production stage, the related capitalized costs will be amortized on a units-of-production basis over the proven and probable reserves following the\ncommencement of production. The Company assesses the carrying costs of the capitalized mineral properties for impairment under ASC 360-10, “Impairment of Long-Lived\nAssets”, and evaluates their carrying value under ASC 930-360, “Extractive Activities—Mining”, annually. An impairment is recognized when the sum of the expected\nundiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the mineral properties. Impairment losses, if any, are measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the\nmineral properties over its estimated fair value.\nTo date, the Company has expensed all exploration and pre-development costs as none of its properties have satisfied the criteria above for capitalization.\nASC 930-805, “Extractive Activities—Mining: Business Combinations” (“ASC 930-805”), states that mineral rights consist of the legal right to explore, extract, and retain at\nleast a portion of the benefits from mineral deposits. Mining assets include mineral rights.\nAcquired mineral rights are considered tangible assets under ASC 930-805. ASC 930-805 requires that mineral rights be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. As a\nresult, the direct costs to acquire mineral rights are initially capitalized as tangible assets. Mineral rights include costs associated with acquiring patented and unpatented mining\nclaims.\nASC 930-805 provides that in measuring the fair value of mineral assets, an acquirer should take into account both:\n● The value beyond proven and probable reserves (“VBPP”) to the extent that a market participant would include VBPP in determining the fair value of the assets.\n● The effects of anticipated fluctuations in the future market price of minerals in a manner that is consistent with the expectations of market participants.\nLeases to explore for or use of natural resources are outside the scope of ASC 842, “Leases”.\nShare-Based Compensation\nShare-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of ASC 718, “Compensation—Stock Compensation” (“ASC 718”), which requires recognition in the\nfinancial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee or director is required\nto perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). ASC 718 also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services\nreceived in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award.\nF-8\nU.S. GOLD CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAPRIL 30, 2024\nAccounting for Warrants\nWarrants are accounted for in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance provided in ASC 815, “Derivatives and Hedging” (“ASC 815”) as either derivative liabilities\nor as equity instruments, depending on the specific terms of the agreements. The Company classifies as equity any contracts that (i) require physical settlement or net-share\nsettlement or (ii) give the Company a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in its own shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement). The Company classifies as\nassets or liabilities any contracts that (i) require net-cash settlement (including a requirement to net-cash settle the contract if an event occurs and if that event is outside the\ncontrol of the Company) or (ii) give the counterparty a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement). Instruments that are\nclassified as liabilities are recorded at fair value at each reporting period, with any change in fair value recognized as a component of change in fair value of derivative\nliabilities in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Company assessed the classification of its outstanding common stock purchase warrants as of the date of issuance and determined that such instruments, except for the\nwarrants discussed under Warrant Liability below, met the criteria for equity classification under the guidance in ASU 2017-11 “Earnings Per Share (Topic 260); Distinguishing\nLiabilities from Equity (Topic 480); Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): (Part I) Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Feature”. The Company has\nno outstanding warrants that contain a “down round” feature under Topic 815 of ASU 2017-11.\nWarrant Liability\nThe Company accounts for the 625,000 warrants and 870,000 warrants issued in March 2022 and April 2023 (the “Warrant Agreements”), respectively, in accordance with the\nguidance contained in ASC 815 “Derivatives and Hedging” whereby under that provision these warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment and must be recorded as a\nliability (see Note 9). Accordingly, the Company classifies these warrant instruments as liabilities at fair value and adjusts the instruments to fair value at each reporting period.\nThis liability is re-measured at each balance sheet date until the warrants are exercised or expire, and any change in fair value will be recognized in the Company’s statement of\noperations. The fair value of these warrants is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Such warrant classification is also subject to re-evaluation at each reporting\nperiod.\nOffering Costs\nOffering costs incurred consisted of legal, placement agent fees and other costs that were directly related to registered direct offerings. Offering costs were allocated to the\nseparable financial instruments issued in the registered direct offering based on the same proportion as the proceeds were allocated to the warrants and equity. Offering costs\nassociated with warrant liabilities are expensed as incurred, presented as offering costs related to warrant liability in the consolidated statements of operations. Offering costs\nassociated with the sale of common shares are charged against equity.\nRemediation and Asset Retirement Obligation\nAsset retirement obligations (“ARO”), consisting primarily of estimated reclamation costs at the Company’s CK Gold and Keystone properties, are recognized in the period\nincurred and when a reasonable estimate can be made, and recorded as liabilities at fair value. Such obligations, which are initially estimated based on discounted cash flow\nestimates, are accreted to full value over time through charges to accretion expense. Corresponding asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the\nrelated long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset’s remaining useful life. AROs are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from\nrevisions to the estimated timing or amount of reclamation and closure costs. The Company reviews and evaluates its AROs annually or more frequently at interim periods if\ndeemed necessary.\nForeign Currency Transactions\nThe reporting and functional currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the\nexchange rates prevailing on the transaction dates. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates\nprevailing at the balance sheet date with any transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the\nfunctional currency included in the results of operations as incurred. Translation adjustments, and transaction gains or losses, have not had, and are not expected to have, a\nmaterial effect on the results of operations of the Company and are included in general and administrative expenses.\nF-9\nU.S. GOLD CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAPRIL 30, 2024\nLeases\nThe Company accounts for leases in accordance with ASC Topic 842, Leases. Operating lease right of use assets (“ROU”) represent the right to use the leased asset for the\nlease term and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As most\nleases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the adoption date in determining the present value\nof future payments. Upon the election by the Company to extend the lease for additional years, that election will be treated as a lease modification and the lease will be\nreviewed for re-measurement. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in general and administrative\nexpenses in the statements of operations.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provision of ASC 740, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (“ASC 740”), which requires, among other things, an asset and\nliability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax\nconsequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax\nassets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be realized.\nThe Company follows the provision of ASC 740-10, “Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions” (“ASC 740-10”). When tax returns are filed, there may be uncertainty\nabout the merits of positions taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax\nposition is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position\nwill be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions.\nTax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized\nupon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefit associated with tax positions taken that exceed the amount measured as described above should\nbe reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing\nauthorities upon examination. The Company believes its tax positions are all more likely than not to be upheld upon examination. As such, the Company has not recorded a\nliability for uncertain tax benefits or for any related interest and penalties. In the event that the Company is assessed penalties and/or interest, penalties will be charged to other\noperating expense and interest will be charged to interest expense.\nThe Company follows ASC 740-10-25, “Definition of Settlement”, which provides guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for\nthe purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits and provides that a tax position can be effectively settled upon the completion and examination by a taxing\nauthority without being legally extinguished. For tax positions considered effectively settled, an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit, even if the tax position is\nnot considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statute of limitations remains open. The federal and state income tax\nreturns of the Company are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and state taxing authorities, generally for three years after they are filed.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAccounting standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material effect on the financial\nstatements upon adoption. The Company does not discuss recent pronouncements that are not anticipated to have an effect on or are unrelated to its financial condition, results\nof operations, cash flows or disclosures.\nIn June 2022, FASB issued ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) (“ASU 2022-03”). The amendments in ASU 2022-03 clarify that a contractual restriction on the\nsale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The amendments also\nclarify that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. The amendments in this Update also require additional\ndisclosures for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions. The provisions in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early\nadoption is permitted. The Company does not expect to early adopt this ASU. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on its\nconsolidated financial statements.\nF-10\nU.S. GOLD CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAPRIL 30, 2024\nOn May 1, 2023, the Company adopted FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326) (“ASU 2016-13”), which requires the immediate\nrecognition of management’s estimates of current and expected credit losses. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements or disclosures.\nIn December 2023, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”). The standard enhances income tax\ndisclosure requirements for all entities by requiring specified categories and greater disaggregation within the rate reconciliation table, disclosure of income taxes paid by\njurisdiction, and providing clarification on uncertain tax positions and related financial statement impacts. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024. The Company is currently assessing the impact of ASU 2023-09 on its disclosures.\nNOTE 3 — GOING CONCERN\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities\nin the normal course of business. As of April 30, 2024, the Company had cash of approximately $5.6 million, working capital of approximately $6.1 million which consists\nprimarily of cash and prepaid expenses and other current assets and an accumulated deficit of approximately $72.8 million. The Company had a net loss and cash used in\noperating activities of approximately $6.9 million and $7.1 million, respectively, for the year ended April 30, 2024. As a result of the utilization of cash in its operating\nactivities, and the development of its assets, the Company has incurred losses since it commenced operations. The Company’s primary source of operating funds since inception\nhas been equity financing. As noted in Note 10, in April 2024, the Company completed a registered offering which raised total gross proceeds of approximately $4.9 million\nbefore deducting fees and other estimated offering expenses. As of the date of filing the annual report for the year ended April 30, 2024, the Company has sufficient cash to\nfund its corporate activities and general and administrative costs and currently undertaken project activities related to permitting and engineering studies. However, in order to\nadvance any of its projects past the aforementioned objectives the Company does not have sufficient cash and will need to raise additional funds. These matters raise substantial\ndoubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the issuance of these consolidated financial statements.\nThe consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset amounts or the classification of liabilities that\nmight be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nNOTE 4 — MINERAL RIGHTS\nThe Company’s CK Gold property contains proven and probable mineral reserves and accordingly is classified as a development stage property, as defined in subpart 1300 of\nRegulation S-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“S-K 1300”). None of the Company’s other properties contain proven and probable mineral reserves\nand all activities are exploratory in nature.\nCK Gold Project\nThe Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Gold King Corp., a Nevada corporation, owns the Copper King gold and copper development project (the “CK Gold\nProperty”), which is comprised of two State of Wyoming Metallic and Non-metallic Rocks and Minerals Mining Leases covering an area of approximately 1.8 square miles\nlocated in the Silver Crown Mining District of southeast Wyoming.\nKeystone Project\nThe Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, U.S. Gold Acquisition Corporation, acquired the mining claims comprising the Keystone Project. The Keystone Project\nconsists of 601 unpatented lode mining claims situated in Eureka County, Nevada. Some of the Keystone Project claims are subject to pre-existing net smelter royalty (“NSR”)\nobligations.\nF-11\nU.S. GOLD CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAPRIL 30, 2024\nMaggie Creek Project\nOn November 9, 2022, the Company entered into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement (the “Assignment and Assumption Agreement”) with and among Orevada Metals,\nInc., the Company’s indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary (“Orevada”), Nevada Gold Mines LLC (“NGM”), Orogen Royalties Inc. (“Orogen”) and Renaissance Exploration,\nInc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Orogen (“RenEx”) whereby Orevada assigned its interest in that certain Exploration Earn-In Agreement with RenEx, dated February 19,\n2019 (the “Original Earn-In Agreement”), to NGM. Pursuant to the Original Earn-In Agreement, Orevada, by making certain payments and incurring certain exploration\nexpenditures, had the right to earn at least a 50% interest and up to a 70% interest in the Maggie Creek Property, owned by RenEx, in Eureka County, Nevada. Simultaneous\nwith this assignment, NGM and RenEx entered into an Amended and Restated Exploration Earn-In Agreement, pursuant to which NGM can earn a 100% interest in the Maggie\nCreek Property (the “NGM Option”).\nAs consideration for the assignment of the Original Earn-In Agreement to NGM, U.S. Gold received an upfront cash payment of $2,750,000 from NGM, and NGM agreed that\nif it exercises the NGM Option and acquires the Maggie Creek Property, it will grant to U.S. Gold a 0.5% Net Smelter Returns royalty on all gold and other recovered and\nsaleable minerals from the Maggie Creek Property (the “U.S. Gold Royalty”), pursuant to a separate royalty agreement (the “U.S. Gold Royalty Agreement”) between NGM\nand the Company, the terms of which have been fully agreed as part of this assignment. Under the U.S. Gold Royalty Agreement, NGM will have the right to buy back one-half\nof the U.S. Gold Royalty (reducing the royalty to 0.25% of Net Smelter Returns) for a fixed price of $500,000. In addition, the U.S. Gold Royalty Agreement will provide that\nthe Company waives the first $800,000 of production royalty payments owed to it, regardless of whether NGM exercises its buy-back rights. Under the U.S. Gold Royalty\nAgreement, NGM will also have a right of first refusal to purchase the U.S. Gold Royalty if the Company decides to sell that royalty. Under the U.S. Gold Royalty Agreement,\nNGM will also have a right of first refusal to purchase the U.S. Gold Royalty if the Company decides to sell that royalty. Accordingly, the Company recognized gain from sale\nof asset of $763,393 during the year ended April 30, 2023 as reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations in connection with the Assignment and\nAssumption Agreement.\nNorthern Panther Merger Agreement\nOn August 10, 2020, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement with Acquisition Corp., NPRC and the Stockholder Representative named therein, pursuant to which\nAcquisition Corp. merged with and into NPRC, with NPRC surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Consequently, the Company acquired mineral rights on a\ngold exploration project in Idaho called the Challis Gold project. The Challis Gold project contains 77 unpatented lode mining claims in Lemhi County, Idaho covering\napproximately 1,710 acres.\nAs of the dates presented, mineral properties consisted of the following:\nApril 30, 2024 April 30, 2023\nCK Gold Project $ 3,091,738 $ 3,091,738\nKeystone Project 1,028,885 1,028,885\nChallis Gold Project 10,249,632 10,249,632\nTotal $ 14,370,255 $ 14,370,255\nNOTE 5 — PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nAs of the dates presented, property consisted of the following:\nApril 30, 2024 April 30, 2023\nSite costs $ 203,320 $ 203,320\nLand 352,718 352,718\nComputer equipment 3,766 7,265\nVehicle 39,493 39,493\nTotal 599,297 602,796\nLess: accumulated depreciation (141,190) (111,871)\nTotal $ 458,107 $ 490,925\nFor the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, depreciation expense amounted to $32,818 and $36,505, respectively.\nF-12\nU.S. GOLD CORP.

The following table summarizes activity in the Company’s ARO for the years presented:\nApril 30, 2024 April 30, 2023\nBalance, beginning of year $ 285,764 $ 260,196\nAddition and changes in estimates (6,075) -\nAccretion expense 27,968 25,568\nBalance, end of year $ 307,657 $ 285,764\nFor the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, accretion expense amounted to $27,968 and $25,568, respectively.\nNOTE 7 – OPERATING LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES\nOn May 1, 2021, the Company entered into a lease agreement for a facility in Cheyenne, Wyoming. The initial term of the lease was for a two-year period from May 2021 to\nMay 2023 starting with a monthly base rent of $1,667. On January 30, 2023, the Company entered into a first lease amendment effective as of May 1, 2023, to extend this lease\nfor a period of one year expiring April 30, 2024. On January 11, 2024, the Company entered into a second lease amendment effective as of May 1, 2024, to extend this lease for\nanother period of one year expiring April 30, 2025, with an option to renew the lease for an additional one-year term. Under the second lease amendment, the monthly base rent\nincreased from $1,768 to $1,821 starting on May 1, 2024. The Company accounted for the lease extensions as lease modifications under ASC 842. On January 30, 2023, the\neffective date of the first lease amendment, the Company recorded an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and lease liability in the amount of $20,472 based on the net present\nvalue of lease payments discounted using an incremental borrowing rate of 8%. On January 11, 2024, the effective date of the second lease amendment, the Company recorded\nan adjustment to the right-of-use asset and lease liability in the amount of $20,936 based on the net present value of lease payments discounted using an incremental borrowing\nrate of 8%.\nOn September 1, 2021, the Company entered into a lease agreement for another facility in Cheyenne, Wyoming. The initial term of the lease was for a two-year period from\nSeptember 2021 through August 2023. On October 18, 2023, the Company entered into a lease amendment effective as of September 1, 2023, to extend the lease for a period of\ntwo years expiring August 31, 2025. The Company will not have an option to renew the lease past August 31, 2025, unless agreed to by the lessor and the Company. Pursuant to\nthe lease amendment, the monthly base rent increased to $3,265. On September 1, 2023, the effective date of the amendment, the Company recorded an adjustment to the right-\nof-use asset and lease liability in the amount of $72,672 based on the net present value of lease payments discounted using an incremental borrowing rate of 8%.\nDuring the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, lease expense of approximately $59,000 and $56,000, respectively, was included in general and administrative expenses as\nreflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nRight-of- use assets are summarized below:\nApril 30, 2024 April 30, 2023\nOperating leases $ 70,331 $ 32,080\nOperating Lease liabilities are summarized below:\nApril 30, 2024 April 30, 2023\nOperating lease, current portion $ 57,486 $ 32,080\nOperating lease, long term portion 12,845 -\nTotal lease liability $ 70,331 $ 32,080\nF-13\nU.S. GOLD CORP.

On January 7, 2022, the Company and the\ndirector mutually agreed to extend the term of the agreement for an additional 12 months under the same terms as the January 2021 agreement (the “January 2022 Extension”).\nIn consideration for the services provided pursuant to the January 2022 Extension, the director was paid an annual fee of $86,000 consisting of shares of the Company’s\ncommon stock with a value of $50,000, paid within five days of the effective date of the January 2022 Extension, and cash payments of $36,000, paid in increments of $3,000\nper month. In January 2022, and in connection with the January 2022 Extension, the Company issued 5,814 shares of common stock to the director. Effective December 31,\n2022, the director resigned from the Board. Accordingly, the Company also issued 7,927 shares of common stock in connection with vested RSUs on the date of resignation\n(see Note 10). During the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company paid consulting fees in cash of $0 and $24,000, respectively.\nOn March 10, 2021, the Company entered into a one-year consulting agreement (the “March 2021 Agreement”) with an individual who subsequently was appointed as a\ndirector of the Company on May 18, 2022, to provide services related to investor and strategic introductions for potential mergers and acquisitions and other potential and\nstrategic relationships to add shareholder value. On March 10, 2022, the Company and the director mutually agreed to extend the March 2021 Agreement for an additional 12\nmonths (the “March 2022 Extension”).

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAPRIL 30, 2024\nNOTE 9 — WARRANT LIABILITY\nAs of April 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s warrant liabilities were valued at $3,916,900 and $4,230,850, respectively. Under the guidance in ASC 815-40, certain warrants\ndo not meet the criteria for equity treatment. These warrants include a clause whereby the warrant holder may be entitled to receive a net cash settlement upon the completion\nof a “fundamental transaction.” A fundamental transaction, as defined in the warrants, includes (a) any merger or consolidation by and between the Company and another\nPerson, (b) the sale or other disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of its assets, (c) the completion of any tender offer or exchange offer pursuant to which the\nholders of greater than 50% of the Company’s outstanding common stock has agreed to tender or exchange their securities, and (d) the consummation of a stock purchase\nagreement or other business combination whereby another Person acquires more than 50% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company. In the event of a\nfundamental transaction, the holder of the warrant has the right to require that the Company purchase the warrant from the holder by paying the holder an amount of cash equal\nto a valuation based on the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model reflecting an expected volatility equal to the greater of 100% or the 100-day volatility as of the trading day\nimmediately following the public announcement of the applicable fundamental transaction. This volatility input precludes the Company from applying equity accounting as the\nwarrant holder could receive a net cash settlement value that is greater than a holder of the Company’s common stock. Accordingly, the Company has concluded that liability\naccounting is required.\nAs such, these warrants are recorded at fair value as of each reporting date with the change in fair value reported within other income in the accompanying consolidated\nstatements of operations as “Change in fair value of warrant liability” until the warrants are exercised, expired or other facts and circumstances lead the warrant liability to be\nreclassified to stockholders’ equity. The Company utilized a Monte Carlo Simulation model to estimate the fair values of the April 2023 and March 2022 warrants, which\nincorporates significant inputs that are not observable in the market, and thus represents a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820. The unobservable inputs utilized for\nmeasuring the fair value of the contingent consideration reflect management’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the\ncontingent consideration. The Company determined the fair value by using the below key inputs to the Monte Carlo Simulation Model.\nInitial Measurement\nThe Company accounted for the 625,000 warrants issued on March 18, 2022, in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815 “Derivatives and Hedging” whereby under\nthat provision these warrants did not meet the criteria for equity treatment and were recorded as a liability. The initial valuation of these warrants was valued at $3,652,000 on\nMarch 18, 2022. Additionally, the Company accounted for the 870,000 warrants issued on April 10, 2023, in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815 “Derivatives\nand Hedging” whereby under that provision these warrants did not meet the criteria for equity treatment and were recorded as a liability at an initial valuation of $3,088,500.\nThe key inputs for the warrant liability were as follows as of April 30, 2024:\nKey Valuation Inputs\nExpected term (years) 4.45\nAnnualized volatility 78.9%\nVolatility if fundamental transaction occurs 100.00%\nRisk-free interest rate 4.75%\nStock price $ 4.18\nDividend yield 0.00%\nExercise price $ 6.16\nProbability of fundamental transaction 95%\nDate of fundamental transaction 0.25 years to 4.45 years\nThe key inputs for the warrant liability were as follows as of April 30, 2023:\nKey Valuation Inputs\nExpected term (years) 5.45\nAnnualized volatility 81.4%\nVolatility if fundamental transaction occurs 100.00%\nRisk-free interest rate 3.51%\nStock price $ 4.31\nDividend yield 0.00%\nExercise price $ 6.16\nProbability of fundamental transaction 90%\nDate of fundamental transaction 1.00 years to 5.45 years\nF-15\nU.S. GOLD CORP.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAPRIL 30, 2024\nThe annual advance minimum royalty payments as of April 30, 2024 under the option agreement are as follows, each payment to be made on the first anniversary of the\neffective date of this option agreement and continuing until the tenth anniversary:\nFiscal 2025 $ 25,000\nFiscal 2026 25,000\nFiscal 2027 25,000\nFiscal 2028 25,000\nFiscal 2029 25,000\nFiscal 2030 and thereafter 50,000\n$ 175,000\n100% of the advance minimum royalty payments will be applied to the royalty credits.\nExploration Access and Option to Lease Agreement\nOn August 25, 2021 (“Effective Date”), the Company entered into an Exploration Access and Option to Lease Agreement (the “Agreement”) with a private-party landowner\n(the “Landowner”) whereby the Landowner granted the Company an option (the “Option”) to lease and right of way on a property located in Laramie County, Wyoming. The\nCompany may exercise the Option for five years (“Option Term”) from the Effective Date. During the Option, the Landowner granted non-exclusive rights (the “Exploration\nAccess Rights”) to the Company to use the surface of the property for an annual exploration and access right payment of $10,000, thirty days after the effective date and each\nyear on the anniversary of the Effective Date during the Option Term until such time the Option is exercised or expires. The Company is also required to pay an annual Option\npayment of $35,780 for the lease and $6,560 for the right of way within thirty days after the Effective Date and each year on the anniversary of the Effective Date during the\nOption Term until such time the Option is exercised by the Company or expires. The Company paid a total of $42,340 for each of the periods ended on September 1, 2021,\n2022 and 2023, pursuant to this Agreement.\nAt any time during the Option Term, the Company may exercise the Option by providing a written notice to the Landowner and the Company shall pay a one-time right-of-way\npayment of $26,240 at closing and shall execute a lease agreement. The exclusive option to lease (the “Lease”) and right of way (the “Right of Way”) is for a term of ten years\nwith the right to extend for an additional ten years and requires an annual lease payment of $50,000, compensation for loss of grazing of $40.00 per acre impacted land and\nannual Right of Way payments of $13,120.\nIn consideration for the option rights, lease rights and right of way rights under this Agreement, the Company agreed to grant the Landowner shares of the Company’s common\nstock worth $50,000, which shares will not vest, or be issued, until the Company executes the Lease. Currently, the Company has not executed the Lease.\nAt any time during the Option Term, the Company may terminate this Agreement by providing a written notice to the Landowner. Upon termination, the Landowner is entitled\nto retain any payments already made and the Company shall have no further obligation after the date of termination. The Agreement, including the Option and the Exploration\nAccess Rights, may be extended for a period of five years upon written notice from the Company. In the absence of such notice, the Agreement shall automatically terminate at\nthe end of the Option Term. Currently, the Company has not exercised the Option.\nLegal Matters\nFrom time to time the Company may be involved in claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. To the Company’s knowledge, there are no material\npending legal proceedings to which the Company is a party or of which any of the Company’s property is the subject.\nF-22\nU.S. GOLD CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAPRIL 30, 2024\nNOTE 13 — INCOME TAX\nThe deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are summarized as follows:\nDeferred tax assets: April 30, 2024 April 30, 2023\nNet operating loss carryover $ 12,317,000 $ 11,599,000\nStock-based compensation 948,000 866,000\nExploration cost 386,000 -\nAccrued remediation costs 22,000 35,000\nOther 15,000 7,000\nSubtotal 13,688,000 12,507,000\nLess: valuation allowance (11,949,000) (10,774,000)\nTotal deferred tax assets $ 1,739,000 $ 1,733,000\nDeferred tax liabilities: April 30, 2024 April 30, 2023\nAcquired mineral rights in excess of tax basis in a tax-free merger $ (2,152,000) $ (2,152,000)\nOther (17,000) (11,000)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities $ (2,169,000) $ (2,163,000)\nNet deferred tax assets (liabilities) $ (430,000) $ (430,000)\nThe Company has a net operating loss carryforward for federal tax purposes totaling approximately $58.6 million at April 30, 2024. Approximately $11.3 million expires\nbetween the years 2029 and 2038, with approximately $47.3 million net operating losses incurred after December 31, 2017 that do not expire and can be utilized to offset up to\n80% of future taxable income. As of April 30, 2023, the Company had identified certain adjustments that were required to past tax return filings, including those related to\ncapitalized exploration expenses and share-based compensation. These adjustments were made to the Company’s net operating loss carryforward in the federal tax return for the\nyear ended April 30, 2023. These adjustments are reflected in the carryforward amounts disclosed above. The Company does not have any state net operating loss\ncarryforwards. The Company primarily operates in the states of Wyoming and Nevada which do not impose a corporate income tax. Any minor apportionment that may occur\nto any other taxable state will be immaterial to current and future operations of the Company. Therefore, the effective state tax rate used in the calculation of the Company’s\ndeferred tax is 0%.\nOn August 10, 2020, the Company acquired mineral rights totaling $10,249,632 (see Note 4 – Mineral Rights) in a tax-free reorganization pursuant to IRC Section 368. The\nCompany recorded the assets at fair value for financial reporting purposes and retained the seller’s tax basis which was zero resulting in a deferred tax liability on the business\ncombination date. As required by ASC 740, the Company has recognized the deferred tax impact of acquiring the mineral rights asset in this transaction, with the amount paid\nexceeding the tax basis of the asset on the acquisition date. A portion of the deferred tax liability is offset by deferred tax assets recognized by the Company. The remaining\nportion of the deferred tax liability is not offset by deferred tax assets due to the indefinite life of the mineral rights. As of April 30, 2024, the Company’s remaining net deferred\ntax assets have been offset with a full valuation allowance as management is unable to conclude that it is not more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will expire\nunrealized.\nThe differences between the provision (benefit) for federal income taxes and federal income taxes computed using the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% were as follows:\nYears Ended April 30,\n2024 2023\nFederal income tax provision (benefit) based on statutory rate $ (1,448,000) 21.0% $ (1,599,000) 21.0%\nState income tax provision (benefit), net of federal taxes — —% — —%\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities (66,000) 1.0% (273,000) 3.6%\nChange in prior year estimate (14,000) 0.2% (255,000) 3.4%\nPrior year deferred tax adjustment — —% 1,804,000 (23.7)%\nFederal net operating loss expiration 335,000 (4.9)% — —%\nOther nondeductible expenses 18,000 (0.3)% 42,000 (0.6)%\nIncrease (decrease) in valuation allowance 1,175,000 (17.0)% 281,000 (3.7)%\nTotal tax provision (benefit) on income (loss) $ — —% $ — —%\nThe Company has assessed its tax positions and has determined that it has not taken a position that would give rise to an unrecognized tax liability being reported. In the event\nthat the Company is assessed penalties and/or interest, penalties will be charged to other operating expenses and interest will be charged to interest expense.\nThe Company operates exclusively in the United States and in various state jurisdictions, primarily the states of Wyoming and Nevada. For both federal and state income tax\npurposes, the Company’s fiscal 2021 through 2024 tax years remain open for examination by the tax authorities under the general three-year statute of limitations. However,\ndue to the Company’s federal net operating loss carryforward, the Internal Revenue Service has the ability to adjust this carryforward even if the losses were incurred in years\nthat would otherwise be closed under the statute of limitations.\nF-23\nItem 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone.\nItem 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”),\nmeans controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits\nunder the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Management recognizes that any\ncontrols and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its\njudgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nOur principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of April 30, 2024. Disclosure controls and\nprocedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits\nunder the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including our principal executive and principal financial officer, as appropriate to\nallow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures were effective, at the reasonable assurance level, in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under\nthe Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (“ICFR”). Our internal control system was designed to, in\ngeneral, provide reasonable assurance to our management and our Board regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements, but because of its\ninherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are\nsubject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of April 30,\n2024. The framework used by management in making that assessment was the criteria set forth in the document entitled “2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework” issued\nby the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, (“COSO”). Based on that assessment, management concluded that, during the period covered by\nthis report, such internal controls and procedures were effective as of April 30, 2024.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement’s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm as we are a smaller reporting company and are not required to provide the report.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\nAdoption or Termination of Insider Trading Arrangements and Policies\nThe Company has adopted an insider trading policy, which is effective as of June 14, 2021.\nItem 9C.

AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**JULY 31, 2024**\n\nNOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\n\nOrganization\n\nU.S. Gold Corp., formerly known as Dataram Corporation (the “Company”), was originally incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1967 and was subsequently re-incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada in 2016. Effective June 26, 2017, the Company changed its name to U.S. Gold Corp. from Dataram Corporation. On May 23, 2017, the Company merged with Gold King Corp. (“Gold King”), in a transaction treated as a reverse acquisition and recapitalization, and the business of Gold King became the business of the Company. The Company is a gold and precious metals exploration company pursuing exploration and development properties. The Company owns certain mining leases and other mineral rights comprising the CK Gold Project in Wyoming, the Keystone Project in Nevada and the Challis Gold Project in Idaho. The Company has established an estimate of proven and probable mineral reserves under S-K 1300 at its CK Gold Project, where the Company is conducting exploration and pre-development activities, and all of its activities on its other properties are exploratory in nature.\n\nThe Company’s CK Gold property contains proven and probable mineral reserves and accordingly is classified as a development stage property, as defined in subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“S-K 1300”). None of the Company’s other properties contain proven and probable mineral reserves and all activities are exploratory in nature.\n\nUnless the context otherwise requires, all references herein to the “Company” refer to U.S. Gold Corp. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nNOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nBasis of presentation and principles of consolidation\n\nThe accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), the instructions to Form 10-Q, and the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for interim financial information, which includes the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and presents the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries as of July 31, 2024. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The accounting policies and procedures used in the preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been derived from the audited financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024, which are contained in the Form 10-K filed on July 29, 2024. The unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of July 31, 2024 was derived from those financial statements. It is management’s opinion that all material adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) have been made, which are necessary for a fair financial statement presentation. Operating results during the three months ended July 31, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the fiscal year ending April 30, 2025 (“fiscal year 2025”).\n\nUse of Estimates and Assumptions\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet, and revenues and expenses for the period then ended. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates. Significant estimates made by management include, but are not limited to, valuation of mineral rights, stock-based compensation, the fair value of common stock, valuation of warrant liability, asset retirement obligations and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\nFair Value Measurements\n\nThe Company has adopted ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC 820”), for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. ASC 820 establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of fair value measurements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements.\n\n8  \n---  \n  \n**U.S. GOLD CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**JULY 31, 2024**\n\nASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\n\nThese inputs are prioritized below:\n\nLevel 1: | Observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  \n---|---  \nLevel 2: | Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.  \nLevel 3: | Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the use of the reporting entity’s own assumptions.  \n  \nThe Company analyzes all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under the Financial Accounting Standard Board’s (“FASB”) accounting standard for such instruments. Under this standard, financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\n\nThe Company’s warrant liability for warrants issued in connection with equity financing in March 2022 and April 2023 (see Note 9) was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model using Level 3 inputs.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash equivalents are comprised of certain highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased. The Company did not have any cash equivalents on hand at July 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024. The Company places its cash with high credit quality financial institutions. The Company’s accounts at these institutions are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to $250,000. To reduce its risk associated with the failure of such financial institutions, the Company evaluates, at least annually, the rating of the financial institutions in which it holds deposits. At July 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, the Company had bank balances of approximately $3.0 million and $5.2 million, respectively, exceeding the FDIC insurance limit on interest bearing accounts.\n\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets of $748,336 and $948,833 at July 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, respectively, consist primarily of costs paid for future services which will occur within a year. Prepaid expenses principally include prepayments in cash and equity instruments for consulting, public relations, business advisory services, insurance premiums, mining claim fees, easement fees, options fees, and mineral lease fees which are being amortized over the terms of their respective agreements.\n\nProperty\n\nProperty is carried at cost. The cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are included in income in the year of disposition. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets, generally three to five years.\n\nImpairment of long-lived assets\n\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable, or at least annually. The Company recognizes an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset’s estimated fair value and its book value. The Company did not recognize any impairment during the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nMineral Rights\n\nCosts of leasing, exploring, carrying and retaining unproven mineral lease properties are expensed as incurred. The Company expenses all mineral exploration costs as incurred. Where the Company has identified proven and probable mineral reserves on any of its properties, development costs will be capitalized when all the following criteria have been met, a) the Company receives the requisite operating permits, b) completion of a favorable Feasibility Study and c) approval from the Board of director’s authorizing the development of the ore body. Until such time all these criteria have been met the Company records pre-development costs to expense as incurred.\n\n9  \n---  \n  \n**U.S. GOLD CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**JULY 31, 2024**\n\nWhen a property reaches the production stage, the related capitalized costs will be amortized on a units-of-production basis over the proven and probable reserves following the commencement of production. The Company assesses the carrying costs of the capitalized mineral properties for impairment under ASC 360-10, “Impairment of Long-Lived Assets”, and evaluates their carrying value under ASC 930-360, “Extractive Activities—Mining”, annually. An impairment is recognized when the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the mineral properties. Impairment losses, if any, are measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the mineral properties over its estimated fair value.\n\nTo date, the Company has expensed all exploration and pre-development costs as none of its properties have satisfied the criteria above for capitalization.\n\nASC 930-805, “Extractive Activities—Mining: Business Combinations” (“ASC 930-805”), states that mineral rights consist of the legal right to explore, extract, and retain at least a portion of the benefits from mineral deposits. Mining assets include mineral rights.\n\nAcquired mineral rights are considered tangible assets under ASC 930-805. ASC 930-805 requires that mineral rights be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. As a result, the direct costs to acquire mineral rights are initially capitalized as tangible assets. Mineral rights include costs associated with acquiring patented and unpatented mining claims.\n\nASC 930-805 provides that in measuring the fair value of mineral assets, an acquirer should take into account both:\n\n● The value beyond proven and probable reserves (“VBPP”) to the extent that a market participant would include VBPP in determining the fair value of the assets.\n\n● The effects of anticipated fluctuations in the future market price of minerals in a manner that is consistent with the expectations of market participants.\n\nLeases to explore for or use of natural resources are outside the scope of ASC 842, “Leases”.\n\nShare-Based Compensation\n\nShare-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of ASC 718, “Compensation—Stock Compensation” (“ASC 718”), which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). ASC 718 also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award.\n\nAccounting for Warrants\n\nWarrants are accounted for in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance provided in ASC 815, “Derivatives and Hedging” (“ASC 815”) as either derivative liabilities or as equity instruments, depending on the specific terms of the agreements. The Company classifies as equity any contracts that (i) require physical settlement or net-share settlement or (ii) give the Company a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in its own shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement). The Company classifies as assets or liabilities any contracts that (i) require net-cash settlement (including a requirement to net-cash settle the contract if an event occurs and if that event is outside the control of the Company) or (ii) give the counterparty a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement). Instruments that are classified as liabilities are recorded at fair value at each reporting period, with any change in fair value recognized as a component of change in fair value of derivative liabilities in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n\nThe Company assessed the classification of its outstanding common stock purchase warrants as of the date of issuance and determined that such instruments, except for the warrants discussed under Warrant Liability below, met the criteria for equity classification under the guidance in ASC 260, “Earnings Per Share”; ASC 480, “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity”; ASC 815, “Derivatives and Hedging”. The Company has no outstanding warrants that contain a “down round” feature under ASC 815-10.\n\n10  \n---  \n  \n**U.S. GOLD CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**JULY 31, 2024**\n\nWarrant Liability\n\nThe Company accounts for the 625,000 warrants and 870,000 warrants issued in March 2022 and April 2023 (the “Warrant Agreements”), respectively, in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815 “Derivatives and Hedging” whereby under that provision these warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment and must be recorded as a liability (see Note 9). Accordingly, the Company classifies these warrant instruments as liabilities at fair value and adjusts the instruments to fair value at each reporting period. This liability is re-measured at each balance sheet date until the warrants are exercised or expire, and any change in fair value will be recognized in the Company’s statement of operations. The fair value of these warrants is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Such warrant classification is also subject to re-evaluation at each reporting period.\n\nOffering Costs\n\nOffering costs incurred consisted of legal, placement agent fees and other costs that were directly related to registered direct offerings. Offering costs were allocated to the separable financial instruments issued in the registered direct offering based on the same proportion as the proceeds were allocated to the warrants and equity. Offering costs associated with warrant liabilities are expensed as incurred, presented as offering costs related to warrant liability in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. Offering costs associated with the sale of common shares are charged against equity.\n\nRemediation and Asset Retirement Obligation\n\nAsset retirement obligations (“ARO”), consisting primarily of estimated reclamation costs at the Company’s CK Gold and Keystone properties, are recognized in the period incurred and when a reasonable estimate can be made, and recorded as liabilities at fair value. Such obligations, which are initially estimated based on discounted cash flow estimates, are accreted to full value over time through charges to accretion expense. Corresponding asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset’s remaining useful life. AROs are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from revisions to the estimated timing or amount of reclamation and closure costs. The Company reviews and evaluates its AROs annually or more frequently at interim periods if deemed necessary.\n\nForeign Currency Transactions\n\nThe reporting and functional currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing on the transaction dates. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date with any transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency included in the results of operations as incurred. Translation adjustments, and transaction gains or losses, have not had, and are not expected to have, a material effect on the results of operations of the Company and are included in general and administrative expenses.\n\nLeases\n\nThe Company accounts for leases in accordance with ASC Topic 842, Leases. Operating lease right of use assets (“ROU”) represent the right to use the leased asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As most leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the adoption date in determining the present value of future payments. Upon the election by the Company to extend the lease for additional years, that election will be treated as a lease modification and the lease will be reviewed for re-measurement. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in general and administrative expenses in the statements of operations.\n\n11  \n---  \n  \n**U.S. GOLD CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**JULY 31, 2024**\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provision of ASC 740, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (“ASC 740”), which requires, among other things, an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be realized.\n\nThe Company follows the provision of ASC 740-10, “Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions” (“ASC 740-10”). When tax returns are filed, there may be uncertainty about the merits of positions taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions.\n\nTax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefit associated with tax positions taken that exceed the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. The Company believes its tax positions are all more likely than not to be upheld upon examination. As such, the Company has not recorded a liability for uncertain tax benefits or for any related interest and penalties. In the event that the Company is assessed penalties and/or interest, penalties will be charged to other operating expense and interest will be charged to interest expense.\n\nThe Company follows ASC 740-10-25, “Definition of Settlement”, which provides guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits and provides that a tax position can be effectively settled upon the completion and examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished. For tax positions considered effectively settled, an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit, even if the tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statute of limitations remains open. The federal and state income tax returns of the Company are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and state taxing authorities, generally for three years after they are filed.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nAccounting standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material effect on the financial statements upon adoption. The Company does not discuss recent pronouncements that are not anticipated to have an effect on or are unrelated to its financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.\n\nIn June 2022, FASB issued ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) (“ASU 2022-03”). The amendments in ASU 2022-03 clarify that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The amendments also clarify that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. The amendments in this Update also require additional disclosures for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions. The provisions in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect to early adopt this ASU. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn December 2023, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”). The standard enhances income tax disclosure requirements for all entities by requiring specified categories and greater disaggregation within the rate reconciliation table, disclosure of income taxes paid by jurisdiction, and providing clarification on uncertain tax positions and related financial statement impacts. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently assessing the impact of ASU 2023-09 on its disclosures.\n\n12  \n---  \n  \n**U.S. GOLD CORP.

As of July 31, 2024, the Company had cash of approximately $3.4 million, working capital of approximately $3.6 million, which consists primarily of cash, and an accumulated deficit of approximately $77.2 million. The Company had a net loss and cash used in operating activities of approximately $4.3 million and $2.2 million, respectively, for the three months ended July 31, 2024. As a result of the utilization of cash in its operating activities, and the development of its assets, the Company has incurred losses since it commenced operations. The Company’s primary source of operating funds since inception has been equity financings. As of the filing date of this Form 10-Q, the Company may have sufficient cash to fund its corporate activities and general and administrative costs and currently undertaken project activities related to permitting and engineering studies. However, in order to advance any of its projects past the aforementioned objectives the Company does not have sufficient cash and will need to raise additional funds. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset amounts or the classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\n\nNOTE 4 — MINERAL RIGHTS\n\nAs of the dates presented, mineral properties consisted of the following:\n\nSCHEDULE OF MINERAL RIGHTS\n\nJuly 31, 2024 | April 30, 2024  \n---|---  \nCK Gold Project | $| 3,091,738 | $| 3,091,738  \nKeystone Project | 1,028,885 | 1,028,885  \nChallis Gold Project | 10,249,632 | 10,249,632  \nTotal | $| 14,370,255 | $| 14,370,255  \n  \nNOTE 5 — PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\n\nAs of the dates presented, property and equipment consisted of the following:\n\nSCHEDULE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\n\nJuly 31, 2024 | April 30, 2024  \n---|---  \nSite costs | $| 203,320 | $| 203,320  \nLand | 352,718 | 352,718  \nComputer equipment | 3,766 | 3,766  \nVehicle | 39,493 | 39,493  \nTotal | 599,297 | 599,297  \nLess: accumulated depreciation | (149,321| ) | (141,190| )  \nTotal | $| 449,976 | $| 458,107  \n  \nFor the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, depreciation expense amounted to $8,131 and $8,237, respectively, and was included in general and administrative expenses as reflected in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n\n13  \n---  \n  \n**U.S. GOLD CORP.

The initial term of the lease was for a two-year period from May 2021 to May 2023 starting with a monthly base rent of $1,667. On January 30, 2023, the Company entered into a first lease amendment effective as of May 1, 2023, to extend this lease for a period of one year expiring April 30, 2024. On January 11, 2024, the Company entered into a second lease amendment effective as of May 1, 2024, to extend this lease for another period of one year expiring April 30, 2025, with an option to renew the lease for an additional one-year term. Under the second lease amendment, the monthly base rent increased from $1,768 to $1,821 on May 1, 2024. The Company accounted for the lease extensions as lease modifications under ASC 842. On January 30, 2023, the effective date of the first lease amendment, the Company recorded an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and lease liability in the amount of $20,472 based on the net present value of lease payments discounted using an incremental borrowing rate of 8%. On January 11, 2024, the effective date of the second lease amendment, the Company recorded an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and lease liability in the amount of $20,936 based on the net present value of lease payments discounted using an incremental borrowing rate of 8%.\n\nOn September 1, 2021, the Company entered into a lease agreement for another facility in Cheyenne, Wyoming. The initial term of the lease was for a two-year period from September 2021 through August 2023. On October 18, 2023, the Company entered into a lease amendment effective as of September 1, 2023, to extend the lease for a period of two years expiring August 31, 2025. The Company will not have an option to renew the lease past August 31, 2025, unless agreed to by the lessor and the Company. Pursuant to the lease amendment, the monthly base rent increased to $3,265. On September 1, 2023, the effective date of the amendment, the Company recorded an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and lease liability in the amount of $72,672 based on the net present value of lease payments discounted using an incremental borrowing rate of 8%.\n\nDuring the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, lease expense of $15,259 and $14,267, respectively, was included in general and administrative expenses as reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\n\nRight-of- use assets are summarized below:\n\nSCHEDULE OF SUPPLEMENTAL BALANCE SHEET INFORMATION RELATED TO LEASES\n\n**July 31, 2024** | **April 30, 2024**  \n---|---  \nOperating leases | $| 56,387 | $| 70,331  \n  \n14  \n---  \n  \n**U.S. GOLD CORP.

On March 10, 2022, the Company and the director mutually agreed to extend the March 2021 Agreement for an additional 12 months (the “March 2022 Extension”). On March 10, 2023, the Company and the director further extended the March 2021 Agreement for another 12 months (the “March 2023 Extension”). The terms of the March 2022 Extension and the March 2023 Extension remain the same as stipulated in the March 2021 Agreement. In consideration for the services provided pursuant to the March 2022 Extension and the March 2023 Extension, the director was paid an annual fee of $250,000 consisting of shares of the Company’s common stock with a value of $130,000 paid within five days of the effective date of the applicable extension, and cash payments of $120,000, paid in increments of $10,000 per month. In April 2022 and March 2023, the Company issued 14,286 shares and 33,419 shares of common stock pursuant to March 2022 Extension and the March 2023 Extension, respectively, to the director. The Company paid consulting fees to such director of $0 and $30,000 in cash during the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Additionally, as of July 31, 2024, the Company recorded accounts payable and accrued expenses totaling $111,837 due to such director and was included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.\n\nNOTE 9 — WARRANT LIABILITY\n\nAs of July 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, the Company’s warrant liabilities were valued at $5,666,050 and $3,916,900, respectively. Under the guidance in ASC 815-40, certain warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment. These warrants include a clause whereby the warrant holder may be entitled to receive a net cash settlement upon the completion of a “fundamental transaction.” A fundamental transaction, as defined in the warrants, includes (a) any merger or consolidation by and between the Company and another Person, (b) the sale or other disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of its assets, (c) the completion of any tender offer or exchange offer pursuant to which the holders of greater than 50% of the Company’s outstanding common stock has agreed to tender or exchange their securities, and (d) the consummation of a stock purchase agreement or other business combination whereby another Person acquires more than 50% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company. In the event of a fundamental transaction, the holder of the warrant has the right to require that the Company purchase the warrant from the holder by paying the holder an amount of cash equal to a valuation based on the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model reflecting an expected volatility equal to the greater of 100% or the 100-day volatility as of the trading day immediately following the public announcement of the applicable fundamental transaction. This volatility input precludes the Company from applying equity accounting as the warrant holder could receive a net cash settlement value that is greater than a holder of the Company’s common stock. Accordingly, the Company has concluded that liability accounting is required.\n\n15  \n---  \n  \n**U.S. GOLD CORP.

The Company utilized a Monte Carlo Simulation model to estimate the fair values of the April 2023 and March 2022 warrants, which incorporates significant inputs that are not observable in the market, and thus represents a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820. The unobservable inputs utilized for measuring the fair value of the contingent consideration reflect management’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the contingent consideration.

These leases were assigned to the Company in July 2014 through the acquisition of the CK Gold Project. Leases to explore for or use natural resources are outside the scope of ASU 2016-02 “Leases”.\n\nLease 0-40828 was renewed in February 2023 for a third ten-year term and Lease 0-40858 was renewed for a third ten-year term in February 2024. Lease 0-40828 requires an annual payment of $3.00 per acre starting with the year beginning February 2023 and Lease 0-40858 requires an annual payment of $3.00 per acre starting with the year beginning February 2024. The Company paid the total required minimum lease payment of $3,360 in February 2024.\n\nIn connection with the Wyoming Mining Leases, production royalties of 2.1% of net receipts are required to be paid to the State of Wyoming, although once the project is in operation, the Board of Land Commissioners has the authority to reduce the royalty payable to the State of Wyoming.\n\nThe future minimum lease payments at July 31, 2024, under these mining leases are as follows, with each payment to be made in the fourth quarter of the respective fiscal years:\n\nSCHEDULE OF FUTURE MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS\n\nFiscal 2025 | $| 3,360  \n---|---|---  \nFiscal 2026 | 3,360  \nFiscal 2027 | 3,360  \nFiscal 2028 | 3,360  \nFiscal 2029 | 3,360  \nFiscal 2030 and thereafter | 11,520  \nTotal | $| 28,320  \n  \nThe Company may renew each lease for a fourth ten-year term, which will require annual payments of $4.00 per acre.\n\n19  \n---  \n  \n**U.S. GOLD CORP.

The Company satisfied the minimum royalty payment of $25,000 for fiscal years 2023 and 2024. The Company paid the minimum royalty payment of $25,000 in June 2024 for fiscal year 2025.\n\nThe annual advance minimum royalty payments at July 31, 2024 for each fiscal year, under the option agreement are as follows, each payment to be made on the first anniversary of the effective date of the option agreement and continuing until the tenth anniversary:\n\nSCHEDULE OF ADVANCE MINIMUM ROYALTY PAYMENTS\n\nFiscal 2026 | $| 25,000  \n---|---|---  \nFiscal 2027 | 25,000  \nFiscal 2028 | 25,000  \nFiscal 2029 | 25,000  \nFiscal 2030 | 25,000  \nFiscal 2031 | 25,000  \nTotal | $| 150,000  \n  \n100% of the advance minimum royalty payments will be applied to the royalty credits.\n\nExploration Access and Option to Lease Agreement\n\nOn August 25, 2021 (“Effective Date”), the Company entered into an Exploration Access and Option to Lease Agreement (the “Agreement”) with a private-party landowner (the “Landowner”) whereby the Landowner granted the Company an option (the “Option”) to lease and right of way on a property located in Laramie County, Wyoming. The Company may exercise the Option for five years (“Option Term”) from the Effective Date. During the Option, the Landowner granted non-exclusive rights (the “Exploration Access Rights”) to the Company to use the surface of the property for an annual exploration and access right payment of $10,000, thirty days after the effective date and each year on the anniversary of the Effective Date during the Option Term until such time the Option is exercised or expires. The Company is also required to pay an annual Option payment of $35,780 for the lease and $6,560 for the right of way within thirty days after the Effective Date and each year on the anniversary of the Effective Date during the Option Term until such time the Option is exercised by the Company or expires. The Company paid a total of $42,340 for each of the periods ended on September 1, 2021, 2022 and 2023, pursuant to this Agreement.\n\nAt any time during the Option Term, the Company may exercise the Option by providing a written notice to the Landowner and the Company shall pay a one-time right-of-way payment of $26,240 at closing and shall execute a lease agreement. The exclusive option to lease (the “Lease”) and right of way (the “Right of Way”) is for a term of ten years with the right to extend for an additional ten years and requires an annual lease payment of $50,000, compensation for loss of grazing of $40.00 per acre impacted land and annual Right of Way payments of $13,120.\n\nIn consideration for the option rights, lease rights and right of way rights under this Agreement, the Company agreed to grant the Landowner shares of the Company’s common stock worth $50,000, which shares will not vest, or be issued, until the Company executes the Lease. Currently, the Company has not executed the Lease.\n\nAt any time during the Option Term, the Company may terminate this Agreement by providing a written notice to the Landowner. Upon termination, the Landowner is entitled to retain any payments already made and the Company shall have no further obligation after the date of termination. The Agreement, including the Option and the Exploration Access Rights, may be extended for a period of five years upon written notice from the Company. In the absence of such notice, the Agreement shall automatically terminate at the end of the Option Term. Currently, the Company has not exercised the Option.\n\nLegal Matters\n\nFrom time to time the Company may be involved in claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. To the Company’s knowledge, there are no material pending legal proceedings to which the Company is a party or of which any of the Company’s property is the subject.\n\n20  \n---  \n  \n**ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**\n\nThe interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by U.S. Gold Corp. (the “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. Certain information and footnote disclosure normally included in interim unaudited consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which are duplicate to the disclosures in the audited consolidated financial statements have been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although we believe that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto in the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024, filed with the SEC on July 29, 2024.\n\nIn the opinion of management, all adjustments have been made consisting of normal recurring adjustments and consolidating entries, necessary to present fairly the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial position of us and our subsidiaries as of July 31, 2024, the results of our unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of operations and changes in stockholders’ equity for the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023. The results of unaudited interim condensed consolidated operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year.\n\nThe preparation of interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\n**_Forward-Looking Statements_**\n\nIn addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. See “Forward-Looking Statements” above. Our results and the timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including the risk factors described in this report and in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024.\n\n**_Overview_**\n\nU.S. Gold Corp., formerly known as Dataram Corporation (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”), was originally incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1967 and was subsequently re-incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada in 2016. Effective June 26, 2017, the Company changed its legal name to U.S. Gold Corp. from Dataram Corporation. On May 23, 2017, the Company merged with Gold King Corp. (“Gold King”), in a transaction treated as a reverse acquisition and recapitalization, and the business of Gold King became the business of the Company. We are a gold and precious metals exploration company pursuing exploration and development properties. We own certain mining leases and other mineral rights comprising the CK Gold Project in Wyoming, the Keystone Project in Nevada and the Challis Gold Project in Idaho. We have established an estimate of proven and probable mineral reserves under S-K 1300 at our CK Gold Project, where we are conducting exploration and pre-development activities, and all of our activities on our other properties are exploratory in nature.\n\n**Summary of Activities for the Three Months Ended July 31, 2024**\n\nDuring the three months ended July 31, 2024, we focused primarily on advancing our CK Gold Project in Wyoming.\n\nAn overview of certain significant events follows:\n\n●  | In May 2024, we received notification from the Land Quality Division of the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (WDEQ) that we received approval on our surface gold mine permit (the “MOP”), subject to certain conditions.  \n---|---  \n●  | In June 2024, we satisfied two of the three conditions associated with our MOP with 1) the approval of our Wyoming Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit and 2) acceptance by the WDEQ of our reclamation bond.  \n●  | During the quarter-ended July 31, 2024, we continued to advance towards approval of our Air Quality permit with the Air Quality Division of the WDEQ. Approval of this Air Quality permit is the final condition associated with our MOP and is expected to be received this year.  \n  \n21  \n---  \n  \n**Results of Operations**\n\nFor the three months ended July 31, 2024, compared to the three months ended July 31, 2023:\n\n**_Net Revenues_**\n\nWe are a development-stage company with no operations, and we did not generate any revenues for the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\n**_Operating Expenses_**\n\nTotal operating expenses for the three months ended July 31, 2024, as compared to the three months ended July 31, 2023, were approximately $2,593,000 and $2,930,000, respectively. The approximate $337,000 decrease in operating expenses for the three months ended July 31, 2024, as compared to the three months ended July 31, 2023, is comprised of (i) a decrease in compensation of approximately $173,000 primarily due to a decrease in stock based compensation, (ii) a decrease of approximately $129,000 in exploration expenses on our mineral properties due to the decrease in exploration activities and related consulting expenses at our CK Gold property, (iii) a decrease in professional and consulting fees of approximately $693,000 primarily due to decreases in general strategic and permitting consulting services of $270,000, decrease in legal fees of $34,000, decrease in investor relation fees of $337,000 and decreases in accounting fees of $52,000 and (iv) an increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately $658,000 due primarily to an increase in advertising expenses of approximately $609,000 and an increase in insurance.\n\n**_Loss from Operations_**\n\nWe reported loss from operations of approximately $2,593,000 and $2,930,000 for the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n**_Other Income (Loss)_**\n\nWe reported other income (loss) of approximately $(1,733,000) and $35,000 for the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We reported change in fair value of warrant liability of approximately $(1,749,000) and $15,000 for the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We reported interest income of approximately $17,000 and $14,000 for the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We reported gain from settlement of asset retirement obligation of approximately $0 and $6,000, respectively, for the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n**_Net Loss_**\n\nWe reported a net loss of approximately $4,325,000 and $2,895,000 for the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nThe following table summarizes total current assets, liabilities and working capital at July 31, 2024, compared to April 30, 2024, and the changes between those periods:\n\nJuly 31, 2024 | April 30, 2024 | Increase (decrease)  \n---|---|---  \nCurrent Assets | $| 4,129,003 | $| 6,523,111 | $|  (2,394,108| )  \nCurrent Liabilities | $| 572,868 | $| 452,790 | $| 120,078  \nWorking Capital | $| 3,556,135 | $| 6,070,321 | $| (2,514,186| )  \n  \nAs of July 31, 2024, we had working capital of $3,556,135, as compared to working capital of $6,070,321 as of April 30, 2024, a decrease of $2,514,186.\n\nWe are obligated to file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley”) and the rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board have imposed various requirements on public companies, including requiring changes in corporate governance practices. We expect to spend between $175,000 and $250,000 in legal and accounting expenses annually to comply with our reporting obligations and Sarbanes-Oxley. These costs could affect profitability and our results of operations.\n\n22  \n---  \n  \nOur unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting in accordance with U.S. GAAP and have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. For the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, we incurred net losses in the amounts of approximately $4,325,000 and $2,895,000, respectively. For the three months ended July 31, 2024, cash used in operating activities was approximately $2,194,000. As of July 31, 2024, we had cash of approximately $3,381,000, working capital of approximately $3,556,000, and an accumulated deficit of approximately $77,173,000. Our primary source of operating funds since inception has been equity financings. As of July 31, 2024, we may have sufficient cash to fund our corporate activities and general and administrative costs and currently undertaken project activities related to permitting and engineering studies over the next twelve months. However, in order to advance any of our projects past the aforementioned objectives, we do not have sufficient cash and will need to raise additional funds. These matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the issuance of these financial statements.\n\n**Cash Used in Operating Activities**\n\nNet cash used in operating activities totaled approximately $2,194,000 and $1,809,000 for the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities during the three months ended July 31, 2024, increased primarily due to the (i) increase in net loss of approximately $1,431,000 as compared to the three months ended July 31, 2023, (ii) increase in non-cash items of approximately $1,549,000 as compared to the three months ended July 31, 2023, primarily due to the change in fair value of warrant liability and decrease in stock based compensation and (iii) increase in changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately $503,000 as compared to the three months ended July 31, 2023, primarily due to accounts payable and accrued liabilities.\n\n**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**\n\nAs of July 31, 2024, we did not have, and do not have any present plans to implement, any off-balance sheet arrangements.\n\n**Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements**\n\nSee Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for a summary of recently issued accounting pronouncements.\n\n**Critical Accounting Estimates**\n\nThere have been no changes to our critical accounting estimates during the three months ended July 31, 2024. Critical accounting estimates made in accordance with our significant accounting policies are regularly discussed with the Audit Committee of the Company’s board of directors. Our critical accounting estimates are discussed under “Critical Accounting Estimates” in our “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of the Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Item 7, and our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements thereto, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024, filed with the SEC on July 29, 2024.\n\n**ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK**\n\nAs a smaller reporting company, we are not required to include disclosure under this item.\n\n**ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES**\n\n**_(a)_** | **_Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures_**  \n---|---  \n  \nAt the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision of, and with the participation of, the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a–15(e) and Rule 15d–15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level, in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.\n\n**_(b)_** | **_Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting_**  \n---|---  \n  \nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n23  \n---  \n  \n**PART II: OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n**Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS**\n\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. To our knowledge, there are no material pending legal proceedings to which we are a party or of which any of our property is the subject.\n\n**Item 1A. RISK FACTORS**.\n\nAs a smaller reporting company, we are not required to include disclosure under this item.\n\n**Item 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS**\n\nThere were no sales of unregistered securities during the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2024, that were not previously reported on a Current Report on Form 8-K.\n\n**Item 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES**.\n\nNone.\n\n**Item 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES**\n\nPursuant to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act and subpart 104 of Regulation S-K, issuers that are operators, or that have a subsidiary that is an operator, of a coal or other mine in the United States are required to disclose specified information about mine health and safety in their periodic reports. These reporting requirements are based on the safety and health requirements applicable to mines under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the “Mine Act”) which is administered by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”). During the three months ended July 31, 2024, the Company and its properties or operations were not subject to regulation by MSHA under the Mine Act and thus no disclosure is required under Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act or subpart 104 of Regulation S-K.\n\n**Item 5.

BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES\nOverview\nU.S. Gold Corp., formerly known as Dataram Corporation (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”), was re-incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada in 2016 and was\noriginally incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1967. Effective June 26, 2017, the Company changed its legal name to U.S. Gold Corp. from Dataram Corporation. On\nMay 23, 2017, the Company merged with Gold King Corp. (“Gold King”), in a transaction treated as a reverse acquisition and recapitalization, and the business of Gold King\nbecame the business of the Company. We are a gold, copper and precious metals development and exploration company pursuing exploration opportunities primarily in\nWyoming, Nevada and Idaho.\nWhile we are an exploration and development company that owns certain mining leases and other mineral rights comprising the CK Gold Project in Wyoming, the Keystone\nProject in Nevada and the Challis Gold Project in Idaho, most of our recent activity has focused on moving the CK Gold Project along the development pathway. The\nCompany’s CK Gold Project’s property contains proven and probable mineral reserves and accordingly is classified as a development stage property, as defined in subpart 1300\nof Regulation S-K (“S-K 1300”) promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). None of the Company’s other properties contain proven and probable\nmineral reserves and all activities are exploratory in nature. We do not currently have any revenue-producing activities.\nCorporate Organization Chart\nThe name, place of incorporation, continuance or organization and percent of equity securities that we own or control as of July 29, 2024 for each of our subsidiaries is set out\nbelow.\n4\nCorporate Address\nThe current address, telephone number of our offices are:\nU.S. Gold Corp.\n1910 E.

Drill core is checked, logged, marked for sampling and sawn in half. One-half of\neach drill core is maintained for future reference and the other half of each drill core is sent to ALS, an ISO 17025 accredited laboratory in Elko, Nevada to complete all sample\npreparation and assaying. Samples are analyzed by employing fire assaying with atomic absorption finish for gold, and four-acid ICP-MS analysis for silver and copper. For\nQA/QC protocol purposes, certified standards, blank samples and sample duplicates are inserted into the sample stream. We also periodically submit sample pulps to another\nindependent laboratory for check analysis. With respect to the CK Gold Project, and as part of the examination and preparation of a Technical Report under Reg. S-K 1300\nguidelines, QA/QC protocols have been independently checked. We retain core remnants, duplicates, pulps and rejects in one of several secured facilities.\nCK Gold Project, Wyoming\nThe CK Gold Project consists of certain mining leases and other mineral rights located in the historic Silver Crown Mining District of southeast Wyoming.\nLocation and Access\nThe CK Gold Project is located in southeastern Wyoming, approximately 20 miles west of the city of Cheyenne, on the southeastern margin of the Laramie Range (Figure 1).\nThe property covers about two square miles that include the S½ Section 25, NE¼ Section 35, and all of Section 36, T.14N., R.70W., Sixth Principal Meridian. Access to within\nan approximate 4.0 miles of the property is provided by public paved and maintained gravel roads. An agreement with the private landowner (The Ferguson Ranch Inc.\n(“Ferguson Ranch”)) provides access for the remaining distance to the main project area. The surface of S½ Section 25, NE¼ Section 35 is privately owned by the Ferguson\nRanch. An easement agreement providing access for exploration and potential development activities has been negotiated with an adjacent landowner. The fee for this easement\nis $10,000 per year, renewable each year prior to July 11. The surface of Section 36 is owned by the State of Wyoming and is currently leased to an adjacent landowner for\ngrazing. Currently, the surface of Section 36 is leased for grazing by the Ferguson Ranch and part of the option to lease the lands necessary for project development and\noperation is compensation to the Ferguson Ranch for loss of grazing, as and when areas are impacted.\nThe project is entirely located on mineral rights owned and administered by the State of Wyoming. There are no federal lands within or adjoining the CK Gold Project’s land\nposition. Curt Gowdy State Park lies northwest of the property, partially within Section 26. The state park’s southeastern boundary is approximately 1,000 feet northwest of the\nproperty and approximately 3,000 feet northwest of the mineralized area. The CK Gold Project’s property position consists of two State of Wyoming Metallic and Non- metallic\nRocks and Minerals Mining Leases.\nThrough Gold King, the project has acquired two 35-acre parcels immediately adjacent to Section 36 in Section 35, on the western boundary of the project area. This 70-acre\nlandholding provides a buffer to other occupied and unoccupied parcels to the west of the project area.\n7\nFigure 1 – CK Gold Project Location and Project Boundary\nRights to the CK Gold Project\nOur rights to the CK Gold Project arise under two State of Wyoming mineral leases:\n1) State of Wyoming Mining Lease No. 0-40828\nTownship 14 North, Range 70 West, 6th P.M., Laramie County, Wyoming:\nSection 36: All\n2) State of Wyoming Mining Lease No. 0-40858\nTownship 14 North, Range 70 West, 6th P.M., Laramie County, Wyoming:\nSection 25: S/2\nSection 35: NE/4\n8\nOwnership of the mineral rights remains in the possession of the State of Wyoming as conveyed to the State by the United States, evidenced by 1942 patents for Section 36, and\n1989 Order confirming title to Section 25 and 35. The State of Wyoming issued Mineral Leases for the mineral rights to Wyoming Gold Mining Company, Inc. (“Wyoming\nGold”) in 2013 and 2014. These leases were assigned to us on June 23, 2014.\nLease 0-40828 is a ten-year lease that was renewed within the past year and expires on February 1, 2033. Annual rental payments under this lease are $3.00 per acre. Lease 0-\n40858 is a ten-year lease that was renewed within the current year and expires on February 1, 2034. Annual rental payments under this lease are $3.00 per acre. Each lease is\nrenewable for successive ten-year terms by submitting a renewal application fee and paying a nominal fee of $50. We anticipate continuing to renew each lease beyond their\ncurrent expiration dates.\nEffective April 6, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Office of State Lands and Investments (“OSLI”) approved the recommendation from the staff of the OSLI fixing the\nproduction royalty rate at a flat 2.1% of net receipts received by us once the project is in operation. Additionally, once the project is in operation, the Board of Directors of the\nOSLI has the authority to reduce the royalty payable to the State. Additionally, original lease restrictions limiting operations on the lease areas, deemed critical mule deer\nhabitat, were lifted by OSLI after the company came to an arrangement with The Wyoming Department of Game and Fish (“Game and Fish”) to make a compensatory payment\nto Game and Fish to support habitat and conservation measures. The agreed amount to be paid by the Company to Game and Fish once development and operational impact\noccur amount to $300,000.\nInfrastructure\nGiven the project’s proximity to Cheyenne, the state capital of Wyoming and the Front Range metropolitan area, personnel needs, delivery of consumables, and infrastructure\nneeds are available both locally and regionally. The area has access to both BNSF and Union Pacific railroad lines, intersection of 2 major interstate highways, I-80 and I-25,\nand a regional airport.\nHigh voltage powerlines are approximately 2.4 km (1.5 mi) from the current project area. A connection to the local power provider and easement for transmission lines has been\nidentified and scoped. While there is a nearby line serving the local population, we anticipate that a new line to the project site, catering to approximately a 30-Megawatt load\nwill be constructed and talks have been conducted with the local power provider (Black Hills Energy), the designated provider for the area. Indicative rates including the\ninstallation of approximately 16-miles of line from a nearby sub-station have been received and incorporated into project engineering studies.\nIn February 2023, we entered into a Water Development and Purchase Agreement (“Water Agreement”) with the Board of Public Utilities (the “BOPU”) of the City of\nCheyenne. Under this Water Agreement, BOPU will provide a firm supply of up to 600 gallons per minute for the life of the project. It is anticipated that the water to be\nsupplied under this Water Agreement will come from the Lone Tree well field owned by BOPU. A pipeline from the Lone Tree well field to the project will be required to be\nconstructed. Minor water sources have been identified around the project site from monitoring well locations, and additional deeper well sites will be investigated in upcoming\nfields seasons with a view to securing an independent water supply.\nPermitting\nMine Operating Permit and Closure Plan (“MOP”)\nIn September 2022, we filed our mine operation and reclamation plan (“MOP”) with the WDEQ – Land Division (the “WDEQ”). In November 2022, we received notification\nfrom WDEQ that our MOP was deemed complete and that it was under technical review. In April 2023, we received a first round of technical comments and worked with the\nWDEQ to fully respond to their initial review. In May 2024, WDEQ issued us a letter of approval for the MOP. Per WDEQ’s letter of approval there were three conditions to\nthe MOP: (1) acceptance of a reclamation bond, in the amount of $5,010,000; (2) receipt of a water discharge permit from WDEQ and (3) receipt of the WDEQ Air Quality\nDivision permit. To date, the Company has received acceptance of the reclamation bond and obtained the water discharge permit. The Company expects to obtain the WDEQ\nAir Quality permit this calendar year.\nIndustrial Siting Permit (“ISP”)\nIn February 2023, we submitted our ISP with the Industrial Siting Division of the WDEQ. An ISP is required for all projects within the state of Wyoming when the projected\ncapital costs are anticipated to exceed $253.9 million. This threshold includes costs we may incur as well as costs incurred from other parties. The ISP’s intent is to ascertain the\nregional impacts during construction and mine operation and release state funds to local governments to offset anticipated impacts. Subsequent to the permit submission, a\nhearing was held with the Industrial Siting Commission in May 2023 whereby our ISP was approved. In June 2023, we received official notification from the state of Wyoming\nthat our ISP was granted.\n9\nHistory of Prior Operations and Exploration on the CK Gold Project\nLimited exploration and mining were conducted on the CK Gold Project’s property in the late 1880s and early 1900s. Approximately 300 tons of material was reported to have\nbeen produced from a now inaccessible 160-foot-deep shaft with two levels of cross-cuts. A few small adits and prospect pits with no significant production are scattered\nthroughout the property.\nSince 1938, at least nine historic (pre-Strathmore Minerals Corp.) drilling campaigns by at least seven companies plus the U.S. Bureau of Mines have been conducted at CK\nGold Project’s property, previously referred to as Copper King. The current project database contains 91 drill holes totaling 37,500 feet that were drilled before Wyoming Gold\nacquired the property. All but six of the drill holes are within the current resource area. Other work conducted at the CK Gold Project’s property by previous companies has\nincluded ground and aeromagnetic surveys as well as induced polarization surveys along with geochemical sampling, geologic mapping, and a number of metallurgical studies.\nWyoming Gold conducted an exploration drill program in 2007 and 2008. Thirty-five diamond core drill holes were completed for a total of 25,500 feet. The focus of that work\nwas to confirm and potentially expand the mineralized body outlined in the previous drill campaigns, increase the geologic and geochemical database leading to the creation of\nthe current geologic model and mineralization estimate, and to provide material for further metallurgical testing. The CK Gold Project’s historic assay database for some 120\nholes contains 8,357 gold assays and 8,225 copper assays. At least 10 different organizations or individuals conducted metallurgical studies on the gold-copper mineralization at\nthe request of prior operators between 1973 and 2009.\nGeology and Mineralization\nThe CK Gold Project is underlain by Proterozoic rocks that make up the southern end of the Precambrian core of the Laramie Range. Metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks\nof amphibolite-grade metamorphism are intruded by the 1.4-billion-year-old Sherman Granite and related felsic rocks. Within the project area, foliated granodiorite is intruded\nby aplitic quartz monzonite dikes, thin mafic dikes and younger pegmatite dikes. Shear zones with cataclastic foliation striking N60°E to N60°W are found in the southern part\nof the Silver Crown district, including at CK Gold. The granodiorite typically shows potassium enrichment, particularly near contacts with quartz monzonite. Copper and gold\nmineralization occur primarily in unfoliated to mylonitic granodiorite. The mineralization is associated with a N60°W-trending shear zone and disseminated and stockwork\ngold-copper deposits in the intrusive rocks. The mineralization style is consistent with a porphyry gold-copper deposit of Paleoproterozoic age. Hydrothermal alteration is\noverprinted on retrograde greenschist alteration and includes a central zone of silicification, followed outward by a narrow potassic zone, surrounded by propylitic alteration.\nHigher-grade mineralization occurs within a central core of thin quartz veining and stockwork mineralization that is surrounded by a ring of lower-grade disseminated\nmineralization. Disseminated sulfides and native copper with stockwork malachite and chrysocolla are present at the surface, and chalcopyrite, pyrite, minor bornite, primary\nchalcocite, pyrrhotite, and native copper are present at depth. Gold occurs as free gold and within chalcopyrite crystals.\nThe CK Gold Project’s property contains oxide, mixed oxide-sulfide, and sulfide rock types. At the stated cutoff grade of 0.015oz AuEq/ton, approximately 80% of the resource\nis sulfide material with the remaining 20% split evenly between the oxide and mixed rock types. There is consistent distribution of gold and copper, albeit generally low-grade,\nthroughout this potential open-pit type deposit.\nMineral Reserves and Mineral Resources\nMineral reserve and mineral resource estimates were calculated by Gustavson Associates LLC (now WSP USA, Inc.) through the effective date of November 15, 2021 as\nshown in the Technical Report Summary attached to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The mineral reserve and mineral resource tabulations shown below are based on\nassumed metals prices of $1,625/oz gold, $3.25/lb copper and $18.00/oz silver. These metals price assumptions are comprised of long-term metals forecasting (33%) and the\ntwo-year trailing average (67%). Based on the actual prices of these metals at the end of our fiscal year ($1,911/oz gold, $4.45/lb copper and $23.45/oz silver), based on the\nrespective London Metal Exchange, we believe that the price assumptions used in preparing our mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates at November 15, 2021 remain\nreasonable and, therefore, we believe the estimates prepared by Gustavson Associates LLC remain a reasonable estimate of our mineral resources and mineral reserves at April\n30, 2024.\n10\nCK Gold Project – Summary of Gold, Copper and Silver Mineral Resources at April 30, 2024 based on $1,625/oz gold, $3.25/lb copper and $18.00/oz silver\nAu Equivalent\nMass Gold (Au) Copper (Cu) Silver (Ag) (AuEq)\nTons Oz oz/ lbs Oz Oz oz/\n(000’s) (000’s) st (millions) % (000’s) oz/st (000’s) st\nMeasured (M) 1,000 6 0.019 2 0.196 100 0.05 2 0.024\nIndicated (I) 10,500 94 0.01 30 0.15 450 0.03 138 0.016\nM + I 11,500 100 0.014 32 0.16 550 0.039 140 0.018\nInferred 22,500 235 0.01 68.3 0.152 323 0.014 357 0.016\n(1) Resources tabulated at a cutoff grade of (0.0107 – 0.0088) AuEq oz/st, 0.009 AuEq oz/st average\n(2) Note only 3 significant figures shown, may not sum due to rounding\n(3) Estimates of mineral resources are exclusive of mineral reserves\nCK Gold Project – Summary of Gold, Copper and Silver Mineral Reserves at April 30, 2024 based on $1,625/oz gold, $3.25/lb copper and $18.00/oz silver\nAu Equivalent\nMass Gold (Au) Copper (Cu) Silver (Ag) (AuEq)\nTons Oz oz/ lbs Oz Oz oz/\n(000’s) (000’s) st (millions) % (000’s) oz/st (000’s) st\nProven (P1) 29,600 574 0.019 118 0.198 1,440 0.049 757 0.026\nProbable (P2) 40,700 440 0.011 130 0.16 1,220 0.03 679 0.017\nP1 + P2 70,400 1,010 0.014 248 0.176 2,660 0.038 1,440 0.02\n(1) Reserves tabulated at a cutoff grade of (0.0107 – 0.0088) AuEq oz./st, 0.009 AuEq Oz/st average\n(2) Note only 3 significant figures shown, may not sum due to rounding\nFor comparison, below are our mineral resources and mineral reserves at April 30, 2023:\nCK Gold Project – Summary of Gold, Copper and Silver Mineral Resources at April 30, 2023 based on $1,625/oz gold, $3.25/lb copper and $18.00/oz silver\nAu Equivalent\nMass Gold (Au) Copper (Cu) Silver (Ag) (AuEq)\nTons Oz oz/ lbs Oz Oz oz/\n(000’s) (000’s) st (millions) % (000’s) oz/st (000’s) st\nMeasured (M) 1,000 6 0.019 2 0.196 100 0.05 2 0.024\nIndicated (I) 10,500 94 0.01 30 0.15 450 0.03 138 0.016\nM + I 11,500 100 0.014 32 0.16 550 0.039 140 0.018\nInferred 22,500 235 0.01 68.3 0.152 323 0.014 357 0.016\n(1) Resources tabulated at a cutoff grade of (0.0107 – 0.0088) AuEq oz/st, 0.009 AuEq oz/st average\n(2) Note only 3 significant figures shown, may not sum due to rounding\n(3) Estimates of mineral resources are exclusive of mineral reserves\n11\nCK Gold Project – Summary of Gold, Copper and Silver Mineral Reserves at April 30, 2023 based on $1,625/oz gold, $3.25/lb copper and $18.00/oz silver\nAu Equivalent\nMass Gold (Au) Copper (Cu) Silver (Ag) (AuEq)\nTons Oz lbs Oz Oz\n(000’s) (000’s) oz/ st (millions) % (000’s) oz/st (000’s) oz/ st\nProven (P1) 29,600 574 0.019 118 0.198 1,440 0.049 757 0.026\nProbable (P2) 40,700 440 0.011 130 0.16 1,220 0.03 679 0.017\nP1 + P2 70,400 1,010 0.014 248 0.176 2,660 0.038 1,440 0.02\n(1) Reserves tabulated at a cutoff grade of (0.0107 – 0.0088) AuEq oz./st, 0.009 AuEq Oz/st average\n(2) Note only 3 significant figures shown, may not sum due to rounding\nMineral resources are reported at a gold equivalent grade (AuEq) cutoff grade, which considers metal recovery and pricing Cutoff grade varies with expected recovery for\ndelineated material types, but averages 0.009 short ton (oz/st) AuEq, equivalent to 0.31 grams per metric tonne (g/t) AuEq. Gold equivalent grade (Au/Eq) is used to simplify\ncutoff grade to a single equivalent metal (gold). The mineral resource is constrained inside an optimization shell which, combined with the cutoff grade, represents reasonable\nprospects for economic extraction. The mineral reserve estimate lies inside of a designed mine open pit. See Section 12.1 in the Technical Report Summary incorporated by\nreference in this Form 10-K for a discussion of pit optimization, cutoff grade and dilution.\nPrefeasibility Study (“PFS”)\nOn December 1, 2021, we released the results of our prefeasibility study (“PFS”). The PFS was prepared by Gustavson Associates LLC with an effective date of November 15,\n2021.\nThe following are highlights from the PFS:\n● 10-year Mine Life at 20,000 short tons per day process rate\n○ Average AuEq production: 108,500 ounces per year\n○ First three years: 135,300 AuEq ounces per year\n● Initial Capital: $221 million\n○ Potential attractive financing terms from equipment suppliers and development capital sources\n○ 2-year payback\n● Economics – 39.4% IRR before tax and 33.7% IRR after tax\n○ NPV (5%): $323 million and $266 million, before and after tax, respectively\n○ All in Sustaining Cost (“AISC”) at $800 per AuEq ounce\n○ Assumes $1,625/ounce gold price and $3.25/lb copper price\n○ Highly leveraged to increasing metals prices\n● Upside Potential\n○ Aggregate sales from mine waste rock, proven to be excellent quality\n○ Feasibility study level value engineering and plant optimization\n○ Ongoing metallurgical testing to enhance recovery of gold and copper\n○ Resource expansion potential at depth and to the south-east\n● Permitting and Development\n○ Project footprint under the jurisdiction of Wyoming agencies\n12\nThe economic projections in the PFS are subject to a variety of assumptions and qualifications that are described in more detail in the Technical Report Summary incorporated\nby reference into this Form 10-K. In summary, the low-grade copper, silver and gold deposit located on Wyoming State Land and under lease to US Gold Corp, is proposed as\nan open pit mine. The rate of extraction will be sufficient to feed minerals to the process plant at a rate of 20,000 tons per day, involving the removal of surrounding waste\nmaterial at a similar rate. The process plant serves to crush and grind the ore into a fine particle form in a slurry, whereupon the copper, silver and gold values can be separated\nfrom non-mineralized rock into a concentrate using froth flotation. The concentrate will be dried and shipped off site and sold to a smelter for final metal extraction. The waste\nmaterial will be filtered to recoup and recycle water back to the process plant, and the filtered tailings will be trucked and mechanically stacked onto a tailings pile. The process\nfacility is also on the same Wyoming State section less than a mile away from the mineralized orebody, with the entire operation some 20-miles west of Cheyenne. The\nmetallurgical test work supporting the extraction methodology was initially performed by a previous owner between 2009 and 2012, but the company has gathered additional\nrepresentative sample and conducted further extensive test work between 2020 and 2023. The results of the test work were incorporated into the prefeasibility study published\non December 1, 2021. We expect to update the prefeasibility study by the end of the third quarter of 2024 and finalize the feasibility study sometime thereafter.\nWe expense all mineral exploration costs as incurred. Although we have identified proven and probable mineral reserves on our CK Gold Project, development costs will be\ncapitalized when all the following criteria have been met, (a) we receive the requisite operating permits, (b) completion of a favorable Feasibility Study and (c) approval from\nour Board of Directors (our “Board”) authorizing the development of the ore body. Until such time all these criteria have been met, we record pre-development costs to expense\nas incurred. The current book value of our property is approximately $3.1 million, which is recorded in mineral properties and reflects the value that was attributed to the\npurchase of the CK Gold Project. We do not have any costs on our balance sheet related to plant or equipment as we have not incurred any such costs.\nRecent Activities\nWe submitted both of our major permit applications during the year-ended April 30, 2023, the MOP and Industrial Siting Permit (the “ISP”). We were granted our ISP in June\n2023 providing local governments the ability to receive state funds to mitigate impacts from the anticipated construction and operation of our CK Gold Project. In May 2024,\nwe received approval of the MOP subject to three conditions (reclamation bond approval, water discharge permit and air quality permit). Two of the three conditions have been\nmet (reclamation bond approval and water discharge permit) and we expect to meet the third condition (air quality permit) in calendar 2024.\nPrimarily in support of the feasibility study presently underway, during the 2021 field season, 47 core, reverse circulation rotary and conventional rotary holes were drilled at\nthe CK Gold Project. The primary purpose of the drilling program is to supplement the geotechnical and hydrological information.\nAdditional work centered around the capture and interpretation of environmental base line data encompassing sub-surface and surface water, fauna, flora, cultural, air quality,\nmeteorological conditions, wetlands and socio-economic factors in the project area. Since September 2020, over 3 1/2 years of monitoring data have been gathered and ongoing\nmonitoring in critical areas continues.\nAdditionally, a great deal of social outreach has been conducted to familiarize the immediate population and the Wyoming, Cheyenne and Laramie governmental and regulatory\nagencies.\nGeological Potential of the CK Gold Project\nPotential to expand the existing resource exists primarily at depth beyond current drilling depths and to the south of the proposed pit. Numerous drill holes end in significant\nmineralization. A geophysical anomaly to the southeast supports the trend extending from the proposed open pit as identified by step-out drilling from the current reserve\nboundary; however, to date exploration has not pinpointed mineralization that might be associated with the anomaly further to the southeast in what is thought to be fairly\ncomplex geologic conditions.\n13\nKeystone Project, Cortez Trend, Nevada\nLocation\nThe Keystone Project consists of 601 unpatented lode mining claims situated in Eureka County, Nevada. The claims making up the Keystone Project are situated in Eureka\nCounty, Nevada in Sections 2-4 and 9-11, Township 23 North, Range 48 East, and Sections 22- 28, and 33-36 Township 24 North, all Range 48 East of the Mount Diablo\nMeridian (Figures 2 and 3).\n14\nFigure 2 – Location of Keystone Project and Major Gold Trends in Nevada\n15\nFigure 3 – Keystone Project Claim Boundaries\nThe Keystone Project is accessible via unpaved roads. Navigation through the interior of the project is by off-road vehicle on exploration tracks.\nTitle and Ownership for Keystone Project\nThe Keystone Project consists of unpatented mining claims located on federal land administered by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”). An annual maintenance\nfee of $200 per claim per year must be paid to the Nevada BLM by September 1 of each year, and failure to make the payment on time renders the claims void. In addition to\nthe annual maintenance fee paid to the Nevada BLM, a $12 per claim fee is due to the Eureka County (NV) Clerk’s office as a record fee.\n16\nWe acquired the mining claims comprising the Keystone Project on May 27, 2016 from Nevada Gold Ventures, LLC and Americas Gold Exploration, Inc. (“Americas Gold”).\nSome of the Keystone claims are subject to pre-existing net smelter royalty (“NSR”) obligations. In addition, Nevada Gold Ventures, LLC retained additional NSR rights of\n0.5% with regard to certain claims and 3.5% with regard to certain other claims. The unpatented mining claims comprising the Keystone Project, with applicable NSR\nobligations, are as follows:\n1. Acquired 100% from Americas Gold; subject to a one percent (1%) NSR held by Wolfpack Gold Nevada Corp.; a two percent (2.0%) NSR with respect to\nprecious metals and one percent (1.0%) NSR with respect to all other metals and minerals held by Orion Royalty Company, LLC; and a one-half percent (0.5%)\nNSR to Nevada Gold Ventures, LLC\n27 unpatented lode mining claims situated in Eureka County, Nevada, in Sections 33 and 34, Township 24 North, Range 48 East, and Sections 3, 4, 9, and 10,\nTownship 23 North, Range 48 East, Mount Diablo Base Line and Meridian.\n2. Acquired 100% from Americas Gold; subject to a three and one-half percent (3.5%) NSR to Nevada Gold Ventures, LLC\n13 unpatented lode mining claims situated in Eureka County, Nevada, in Sections 27, 28 and 35, Township 24 North, Range 48 East, and Sections 2 and 3,\nTownship 23 North, Range 48 East, Mount Diablo Base Line and Meridian.\n3. Acquired 100% from Nevada Gold Ventures, LLC; subject to a three and one-half percent (3.5%) NSR to Nevada Gold Ventures, LLC\n28 unpatented lode mining claims situated in Eureka County, Nevada, in Sections 2 & 11, Township 23 North, Range 48 East, Mount Diablo Base Line and\nMeridian.\n4. Acquired 50% from Nevada Gold Ventures, LLC, 50% from Americas Gold, subject to a three and one-half percent (3.5%) NSR to Nevada Gold Ventures, LLC\n216 unpatented lode mining claims, alphabetically ordered, situated in Eureka County, Nevada, in Sections 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 33, 34, 35 & 36,\nTownship 24 North, Range 48 East, Mount Diablo Base Line and Meridian.\nUnder the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated May 25, 2016, under which we acquired the claims, we had the right to buy down 1% of the NSR owed to Nevada\nGold Ventures LLC at any time through the fifth anniversary of the closing date, May 25, 2021, for $2,000,000. In addition, we may buy down an additional 1% of the NSR\nowed to Nevada Gold Ventures, LLC anytime through the eighth anniversary of the closing date, May 25, 2024, for $5,000,000. We did not buy down any portion of the NSR.\nHistory of Prior Operations and Exploration on the Keystone Project\nNo comprehensive, modern-era, model-driven exploration has ever been conducted on the Keystone Project. Newmont drilled 6 holes in the old base metal and silver Keystone\nmine area in 1967 and encountered low-grade (+/- 0.02 opt) gold intercepts. Chevron staked the property in 1981-1983 and drilled 27 shallow drill holes, continued by an\nagreement with USMX that drilled an additional 19 shallow holes; significant amounts of low grade and anomalous gold were intersected, but results were considered\nuneconomic, and the project was dropped. In 1988 and 1989, Phelps Dodge acquired a southern portion of the district and drilled 6 holes, one of which contained gold\nmineralization in its total depth and was subsequently deepened in 1990 resulting in over 200’ of low-grade gold mineralization. About this time Coral Resources acquired a\nnorthern portion of the property and drilled 21 shallow holes to follow-up previous drill intercepts. 1995-1997, Golden Glacier, a junior company, acquired the north end of the\ndistrict, and Uranerz a portion of the southern area; 6 holes were drilled in the north and only 2 holes in the south, respectively. The entire district was dropped by all parties.\n17\nIn 2004, with the discovery of Cortez Hills and escalating gold prices, Nevada Pacific Gold, Great American Minerals (Don McDowell), and Tone Resources (Dave\nMathewson) competed in claim staking the entire district. Subsequently, Don McDowell, founder of Great American Minerals approached Placer Dome (prior to Barrick\nacquisition) who discovered Pipeline and Cortez Hills, and who correctly recognized the Keystone district potential. Placer Dome entered into separate joint venture agreements\nwith Nevada Pacific and Great American. The following year Barrick Gold bought Placer Dome and dropped all Placer Dome’s Nevada exploration projects and joint ventures,\nincluding Keystone. In 2006, Nevada Pacific and Tone were purchased by McEwen Mining. McEwen Mining drilled 35 holes mostly near the north end of the district; targeting\nthe range front pediment and the historic Keystone Mine. McEwen Mining dropped their Keystone claims and quit claimed them to Dave Mathewson and NV Gold Ventures.\nNV Gold Ventures and American Gold staked their own additional claims in the district. This expanded group of claims was acquired in the original Keystone Purchase\nAgreement. We have staked additional claims in the district, such as Potato Canyon, since acquiring the project.\nGeology and Mineralization\nTo date, a technical report has not been prepared on the Keystone Project. Keystone is positioned on the prolific Cortez gold trend. The Keystone Project is centered on a\ngranitic intrusion that warped the local Paleozoic stratigraphy into a dome, allowing for exposure of highly favorable Devonian, Carboniferous (Mississippian-Pennsylvania)\nand Permo- Triassic rocks including key likely host rocks for mineralization, the silty carbonate strata of the Horse Creek Formation and the Wenban limestone, as well as\npossible sandy clastic units of the Diamond Peak Formation. The Horse Canyon and Wenban rocks are the primary host rocks at the nearby Cortez Hills Mine and Gold Rush\ndeposit currently operated by Barrick Gold.\nIn 2022, a hyperspectral survey was conducted on the property identifying evidence of potential mineralization. Numerous anomalies often associated with mineralization were\nidentified. Field investigation of the anomalies commenced during the 2023 field season. In September 2023, we announced completion of a hyperspectral study, which yielded\nthe discovery of multiple high priority targets requiring further investigation and adding to the targets identified from the Company’s prior work at the project.\nInfrastructure and Facilities\nThe Keystone Project does not currently include any significant facilities. The Keystone Project sits some 10 miles to the southwest of Nevada Gold mines Cortez Complex.\nThe Cortez Complex, consisting of surface and underground mines, is served by roads and power, while water in the area is extracted from sub-surface water resources. The\nKeystone Project is served by paved and unpaved roads, which extend down trend from the Cortez Complex to the north and additional road and infrastructure to the north-east.\nThe whole area is some 30 miles to the south of the I-80 interstate corridor between the towns of Battle Mountain and Winnemucca, with Elko, Nevada being the dormitory\ntown for the majority of the workforce and support services.\nThe Challis Gold Project, Idaho\nLocation\nThe Challis Gold property is situated in the Salmon River Mountains, approximately 40 km (25 mi) southwest of the town of Salmon, Idaho, and 69 km (43 mi) north of the\nsmaller town of Challis (Figure 7). The project area is considered to be within the Cobalt Mining District, as the past-producing Blackbird Cobalt Mine is located 9.3 km (5.75\nmi) north-northwest of the property. The nearly-abandoned town of Cobalt, a previous company town for the Blackbird Mine, is along Panther Creek 9.7 km (6 mi) northeast of\nthe property. Meridian Gold’s Beartrack Mine, the closest of the larger gold mines in the region, is 24 km (15 mi) northeast of the Challis Gold Project. The central portion of\nthe property is located at approximately 45º 2’ North Latitude and 114º 20’ West Longitude. The claims are situated in the south-central portion of unsurveyed Township T20N,\nR18E.\n18\n19\n-Figure 7: The Challis Gold Project Location in Idaho\nTitle and Ownership for Challis Gold Project\nAll of the mining claims comprising the Musgrove property are unpatented lode mining claims that have been recorded in the Lemhi County Court House in Salmon, Idaho\nand filed with the US BLM office in Boise. An annual maintenance fee of $200 per claim per year must be paid to the BLM by September 1 of each year, and failure to make\nthe payment on time renders the claims void. In addition to the annual maintenance fee, $20 is due to the Lemhi County (ID) Recorder’s office as a notice of intent to hold\nfee.\nHistory of Prior Operations and Exploration\nEarly mining dates to the late 1880’s when gold was discovered at the nearby Yellow Jacket Mine and copper and cobalt was discovered north of the project area at the\nBlackbird Mine. Small scale intermittent mining was conducted in the project area from 1908 through the 1930’s at the Musgrove Mine and at the Smith-Gahan Mine.\nIn the mid-1980’s, alteration and quartz veining was identified located along the ridge north of Musgrove Creek A large block of claims covering the area was staked by an\nindependent geologist and then leased to Atlas Minerals. Atlas completed an extensive sampling program and, in 1991, drilled nine reverse circulation holes resulting in the\ndiscovery of significant mineralization at the Johny’s Point deposit.\nThe project was acquired by Newmont in 1992 as part of the Grassy Mountain Deposit acquisition. Newmont conducted an extensive exploration program between 1992 and\nthe fall of 1995 consisting of mapping and rock chip sampling. Twenty-seven core holes were completed consisting of nine holes in the Johny’s Point area and 18 holes testing\ntargets along strike from Johny’s Point. Newmont concluded that the project did not meet the potential for their size criteria and the project was dropped.\nIn 1996, Meridian Gold acquired the property and drilled an additional 20 core holes and three reverse circulation drill holes. The property was subsequently returned to the\nowner due to declining gold prices.\nIn 2003, Wave Exploration leased the property and completed a GIS compilation of the surface and drill hole data. Wave subsequently commissioned a technical report. In\n2004, Wave drilled two confirmation drill holes and two step out holes and completed a soil geochemical program northwest of Johny’s Point.\nIn 2005, Wave optioned the property to Journey Resources. In 2006 and 2007, Journey drilled nine reverse circulation drill holes and five core holes northwest of Johny’s Point.\nThere is no documented exploration activity from 2008 until 2018. On September 1, 2018, Journey Resources failed to pay the required claim payments to the Bureau of Land\nManagement and the claims were forfeited. Subsequently, Northern Panther Resources Corporation located or acquired new claims covering the project. In 2020, we acquired\nNorthern Panther Resources. In 2020, we contracted with Wright Geophysics to conduct a ground magnetic geophysical over the current claim block. This survey identified a\nprominent low magnetic linear feature that trends from the Musgrove Mine north-northwest for over two miles.\nGeology and Mineralization\nThe project is located within the Trans-Challis Fault System, a prominent NE-trending fault zone which crosscuts central Idaho and hosts numerous gold deposits. Host rocks\nconsist of quartzites and phyllites of the Precambrian Apple Creek Fm with minor mineralization within the Eocene Challis Volcanics. The Musgrove Mine – Johny’s Point\nmineral trend is within and adjacent to the Musgrove Fault, a northwest-trending fault that brings the Challis Volcanics into contact with the Precambrian rocks. This is a major\nstructural zone that forms the northern edge of the Panther Creek Graben.\nGold mineralization occurs within epithermal quartz veins, quartz vein stockworks, and silicified breccia. The mineralization displays the characteristics of a low sulfidation\nepithermal gold system. The Musgrove Mine – Johny’s Point mineral trend has been defined by a broad soil and rock chip gold and arsenic anomaly that extends a distance\n3000 feet and is up to 800 feet wide. Approximately 600 feet of this zone has been drilled with the remainder tested by wide spaced drilling.\n20\nInfrastructure and Facilities\nThe Challis Gold project does not currently include any significant facilities. The Challis property is located in the Salmon-Challis National Forest and served by paved and\nunpaved roads. There are historic workings in the area and there has been recent mining activity in the area. The site is somewhat remote from grid power and power lines\nwould have to be extended into the area, or onsite power generation used to support an eventual operation. There is water in the area from both surface and sub-surface sources.\nThe Bear Track operation, now closed but under renewed exploration, is some 16 miles as the crow flies to the northeast of the property. Historic mining was conducted;\nhowever, the facilities have been abandoned decades ago and the nearest habited area is a forest ranger station near Forney some 5-miles from site.\nCompetition\nWe do not compete directly with anyone for the exploration or removal of minerals from our property as we hold all interest and rights to the claims. Readily available\ncommodities markets exist in the U.S. and around the world for the sale of minerals. Therefore, we will likely be able to sell minerals that we are able to recover. We will be\nsubject to competition and unforeseen limited sources of supplies in the industry in the event spot shortages arise for supplies such as explosives or large equipment tires, and\ncertain equipment such as bulldozers and excavators and services, such as contract drilling that we will need to conduct exploration. If we are unsuccessful in securing the\nproducts, equipment and services we need, we may have to suspend our exploration plans until we are able to secure them.\nCompliance with Government Regulation\nWe will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the exploration of minerals in the United States\ngenerally. We will also be subject to the regulations of the BLM and the US Forest Service (“Forest Service”) with respect to mining claims on federal lands.\nFuture exploration drilling on any of our properties that consist of BLM or Forest Service land will require us to either file a Notice of Intent (NOI) or a Plan of Operations,\ndepending upon the amount of new surface disturbance that is planned. A Notice of Intent is required for planned surface activities that anticipate less than 5.0 acres of surface\ndisturbance, and usually can be obtained within a 30 to 60-day time period.\nEnvironmental Permitting Requirements\nVarious levels of governmental controls and regulations address, among other things, the environmental impact of mineral mining and exploration operations and establish\nrequirements for reclamation of mineral mining and exploration properties after exploration operations have ceased. With respect to the regulation of mineral mining and\nexploration, legislation and regulations in various jurisdictions establish performance standards, air and water quality emission limits and other design or operational\nrequirements for various aspects of the operations, including health and safety standards. Legislation and regulations also establish requirements for reclamation and\nrehabilitation of mining properties following the cessation of operations and may require that some former mining properties be managed for long periods of time after mining\nactivities have ceased.\nOur activities are subject to various levels of federal and state laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, including requirements for closure and reclamation\nof mineral exploration properties. Some of the laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response,\nCompensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Federal Land Policy and\nManagement Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and related state laws in Nevada. Additionally, much of our property is\nsubject to the federal General Mining Law of 1872, which regulates how mining claims on federal lands are located and maintained.\n21\nThe State of Nevada, where we focus mineral exploration efforts, requires mining projects to obtain a Nevada State Reclamation Permit pursuant to the Mined Land\nReclamation Act (the “Nevada MLR Act”), which establishes reclamation and financial assurance requirements for all mining operations in the state. New and expanding\nfacilities are required to provide a reclamation plan and financial assurance to ensure that the reclamation plan is implemented upon completion of operations. The Nevada\nMLR Act also requires reclamation plans and permits for exploration projects that will result in more than five acres of surface disturbance on private lands.\nThe State of Wyoming, where we focus mineral exploration and development efforts at the CK Gold Project, requires exploration and mining projects to obtain permits from\nthe Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (WDEQ), and various other state agencies. New and expanding facilities are required to provide a reclamation plan and\nfinancial assurance to ensure that the reclamation plan is implemented upon completion of operations. WDEQ in granting permits requires that reclamation plans and permits\nare in place and that bonds have been secured covering the cost of remediation of disturbances on both state and private land.\nExecutive Officers of U.S. Gold Corp.\nName Age Principal Occupation Officer/ Director Since\nEric Alexander 57 Chief Financial Officer - Principal Financial and Accounting Officer 2020\nof U.S. Gold Corp.\nGeorge M.

RISK FACTORS\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nIf we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of internal control, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud. Any inability to\nreport and file our financial results accurately and timely could harm our reputation and adversely impact the trading price of our common stock and our ability to file\nregistration statements pursuant to registration rights agreements and other commitments.\nEffective internal control is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, we may not\nbe able to manage our business as effectively as we would if an effective control environment existed, and our business and reputation with investors may be harmed. As a\nresult of our small size, any current internal control deficiencies may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operation and access to capital. As of April 30, 2024,\nmanagement has concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective.\nThere is substantial doubt about whether we can continue as a going concern.\nTo date, we have earned no revenues and have incurred accumulated net losses of $72.8 million. We have limited financial resources. As of April 30, 2024, we had cash and\ncash equivalents of $5.6 million and working capital of $6.1 million. Therefore, our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our achieving a future financing or\nstrategic transaction. However, there is no assurance that we will be successful pursuing a financing or strategic transaction. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt as to\nwhether our existing cash resources and working capital are sufficient to enable us to continue our operations for the next 12 months as a going concern. Ultimately, in the event\nthat we cannot obtain additional financial resources, or achieve profitable operations, we may have to liquidate our business interests and investors may lose their investment.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that our company will continue as a going concern. Continued operations are dependent on\nour ability to obtain additional financial resources or generate profitable operations. Such additional financial resources may not be available or may not be available on\nreasonable terms. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Such adjustments could be\nmaterial.\nWe have a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of our business and prospects.\nSince our inception, we have had no revenue from operations. We have no history of producing metals from any of our exploration properties. Our properties are exploration\nstage properties. Advancing properties from the exploration stage requires significant capital and time, and successful commercial production from a property, if any, will be\nsubject to completing feasibility studies, permitting and construction of the potential mine, processing plants, roads, and other related works and infrastructure. As a result, we\nare subject to all of the risks associated with developing and establishing new mining operations and business enterprises including:\n● completion of feasibility studies to verify potential mineral reserves and commercial viability, including the ability to find sufficient mineral reserves to support a\ncommercial mining operation;\n● the timing and cost, which can be considerable, of further exploration, preparing feasibility studies, permitting and construction of infrastructure, mining and\nprocessing facilities;\n23\n● the availability and costs of drill equipment, exploration personnel, skilled labor and mining and processing equipment, if required;\n● the availability and cost of appropriate smelting and/or refining arrangements, if required;\n● compliance with environmental and other governmental approval and permit requirements;\n● the availability of funds to finance exploration activities, as warranted;\n● potential opposition from non-governmental organizations, environmental groups, local groups or local inhabitants which may delay or prevent exploration activities;\n● potential increases in exploration, construction and operating costs due to changes in the cost of fuel, power, materials and supplies;\n● inability to secure fair and reasonable terms associated with mineral leases; and\n● potential shortages of mineral processing, construction and other facilities-related supplies.\nThe costs, timing and complexities of exploration activities may be increased by the location of our properties and demand by other mineral exploration and mining companies.\nIt is common in exploration programs to experience unexpected problems and delays during drill programs and, if ever commenced, development, construction and mine start-\nup. Accordingly, our activities may not ever result in profitable mining operations, and we may not succeed in establishing mining operations or profitably producing metals at\nany of our properties.\nWe will require significant additional capital to fund our business plan.\nWe will be required to expend significant funds to continue exploration and if warranted, develop our existing exploration properties and to identify and acquire additional\nproperties to diversify our properties portfolio. We have spent and will be required to continue to expend significant amounts of capital for drilling, geological and geochemical\nanalysis, assaying and feasibility studies with regard to the results of our exploration. We may not benefit from some of these investments if we are unable to identify any\ncommercially exploitable mineralized material.\nOur ability to obtain necessary funding for these purposes, in turn, depends upon a number of factors, including the status of the national and worldwide economy and the price\nof gold and copper. We may not be successful in obtaining the required financing or, if we can obtain such financing, such financing may not be on terms that are favorable to\nus. Failure to obtain such additional financing could result in delay or indefinite postponement of further exploration operations, development activities and the possible partial\nor total loss of our potential interest in our properties.\nOur actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions we make to prepare our financial statements, which could have a material impact on our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nIn connection with the preparation of our financial statements, including the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, our management is required under\nGAAP to make estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based on\nhistorical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments\nabout the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or\nconditions. Although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, they are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are\nbeyond our control. If management’s estimates and assumptions change or are not correct, our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nWe do not know if our properties contain any gold or other minerals that can be mined at a profit.\nAlthough the properties on which we have the right to explore for gold are known to have historic deposits of gold, there can be no assurance such deposits can be mined at a\nprofit. Whether a gold deposit can be mined at a profit depends upon many factors. Some but not all of these factors include: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size,\ngrade and proximity to infrastructure; operating costs and capital expenditures required to start mining a deposit; the availability and cost of financing; the price of gold, which\nis highly volatile and cyclical; and government regulations, including regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land use, importing and exporting of minerals and\nenvironmental protection.\nMost of our projects are in the exploration stage.\nAlthough we have established an estimate of mineral reserves on the CK Gold Project, there are no current estimates of mineral resources or mineral reserves at the Keystone\nProperty or Challis Gold Project. There is no assurance that we can establish the existence of any mineral reserves on those projects in commercially exploitable quantities. If\nwe do not establish the existence of mineral reserves or mineral resources on those projects, we may lose all of the funds that we expend on exploration.\nThe commercial viability of an established mineral deposit will depend on a number of factors including, by way of example, the size, grade and other attributes of the mineral\ndeposit, the proximity of the mineral deposit to infrastructure such as a smelter, roads and a point for shipping, government regulation and market prices. Most of these factors\nwill be beyond our control, and any of them could increase costs and make extraction of any identified mineral deposit unprofitable.\n24\nWe have no history of producing metals from our current mineral properties and there can be no assurance that we will successfully establish mining operations or\nprofitably produce precious metals.\nWe have no history of producing metals from our properties. We do not produce gold and do not currently generate operating earnings. While we seek to advance our projects\nand properties through exploration, such efforts will be subject to all of the risks associated with establishing new future potential mining operations and business enterprises,\nincluding:\n● the timing and cost, which are considerable, of the construction of mining and processing facilities;\n● the availability and costs of skilled labor and mining equipment;\n● compliance with environmental and other governmental approval and permit requirements;\n● the availability of funds to finance exploration activities;\n● potential opposition from non-governmental organizations, environmental groups, local groups or local inhabitants that may delay or prevent exploration activities;\nand\n● potential increases in construction and operating costs due to changes in the cost of labor, fuel, power, materials and supplies.\nIt is common in new mining operations to experience unexpected problems and delays. In addition, our management will need to be expanded. This could result in delays in the\ncommencement of potential mineral production and increased costs of production. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that our activities will result in any profitable mining\noperations or that we will ever successfully establish mining operations.\nWe may not be able to obtain all required permits and licenses to place any of our properties into future potential production.\nOur current and future operations, including additional exploration activities, require permits from governmental authorities and such operations are and will be governed by\nlaws and regulations governing prospecting, exploration, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, toxic substances, land use, environmental protection, mine\nsafety and other matters. Companies engaged in mineral property exploration generally experience increased costs, and delays in exploration and other schedules as a result of\nthe need to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permits. We cannot predict if all permits which we may require for continued exploration and development activities,\nwill be obtainable on reasonable terms, if at all. Costs related to applying for and obtaining permits and licenses may be prohibitive and could delay our planned exploration\nactivities. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permitting requirements may result in enforcement actions, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial\nauthorities causing exploration operations to cease or be curtailed, and may include corrective measures requiring capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment, or\nremedial actions.\nParties engaged in exploration operations may be required to compensate those suffering loss or damage by reason of the exploration activities and may have civil or criminal\nfines or penalties imposed for violations of applicable laws or regulations. Amendments to current laws, regulations and permits governing operations and activities of\nexploration companies, or more stringent implementation thereof, could have a material adverse impact on our operations and cause increases in capital expenditures or\nproduction costs or reduction in levels of exploration activities at our properties or require abandonment or delays in future activities.\nWe are subject to significant governmental regulations, which affect our operations and costs of conducting our business.\nOur current and future operations are and will be governed by laws and regulations, including:\n● laws and regulations governing mineral concession acquisition, prospecting, exploration and development and operation;\n● laws and regulations related to exports, taxes and fees;\n● labor standards and regulations related to occupational health and mine safety; and\n● environmental standards and regulations related to waste disposal, toxic substances, land use and environmental protection.\n25\nCompanies engaged in exploration activities often experience increased costs and delays in exploration and other schedules as a result of the need to comply with applicable\nlaws, regulations and permits. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permits may result in enforcement actions, including the forfeiture of mineral claims or\nother mineral tenures, orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities requiring operations to cease or be curtailed, and may include corrective measures requiring capital\nexpenditures, installation of additional equipment or costly remedial actions. We may be required to compensate those suffering loss or damage by reason of our mineral\nexploration activities and may have civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed for violations of such laws, regulations and permits. Existing and possible future laws,\nregulations and permits governing operations and activities of exploration companies, or more stringent implementation, could have a material adverse impact on our business\nand cause increases in capital expenditures or require abandonment or delays in exploration.\nOur business is subject to extensive environmental regulations that may make exploring, or related activities prohibitively expensive, and which may change at any time.\nAll of our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations that can substantially delay exploration and make exploration expensive or prohibit it altogether. We\nmay be subject to potential liabilities associated with the pollution of the environment and the disposal of waste products that may occur as the result of exploring and other\nrelated activities on our properties. We may have to pay to remedy environmental pollution, which may reduce the amount of money that we have available to use for\nexploration, or other activities, and adversely affect our financial position. If we are unable to fully remedy an environmental problem, we might be required to suspend\nexploration operations or to enter into interim compliance measures pending the completion of the required remedy. We have not purchased insurance for potential\nenvironmental risks (including potential liability for pollution or other hazards associated with the disposal of waste products from our exploration activities) and such\ninsurance may not be available to us on reasonable terms or at a reasonable price. All of our exploration will be subject to regulation under one or more local, state and federal\nenvironmental impact analyses and public review processes. It is possible that future changes in applicable laws, regulations and permits or changes in their enforcement or\nregulatory interpretation could have significant impact on some portion of our business, which may require our business to be economically re-evaluated from time to time.\nThese risks include, but are not limited to, the risk that regulatory authorities may increase bonding requirements beyond our financial capability. Inasmuch as posting of\nbonding in accordance with regulatory determinations is a condition to the right to operate under specific federal and state exploration operating permits, increases in bonding\nrequirements could prevent operations even if we are in full compliance with all substantive environmental laws.\nRegulations and pending legislation governing issues involving climate change could result in increased operating costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness.\nA number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impact of climate change. Legislation\nand increased regulation regarding climate change could impose significant costs on us, our venture partners and our suppliers, including costs related to increased energy\nrequirements, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs to comply with such regulations. Any adopted future climate change regulations could\nalso negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. Given the emotion, political significance and uncertainty around\nthe impact of climate change and how it should be dealt with, we cannot predict how legislation and regulation will affect our financial condition, operating performance and\nability to compete. Furthermore, even without such regulation, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about potential impacts on climate\nchange by us or other companies in our industry could harm our reputation. The potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and would\nbe particular to the geographic circumstances in areas in which we operate. These may include changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities, water shortages, changing\nsea levels and changing temperatures. These impacts may adversely impact the cost, production and financial performance of our operations.\n26\nThe values of our properties are subject to volatility in the price of gold and any other deposits we may seek or locate.\nOur ability to obtain additional and continuing funding, and our profitability in the event we commence future mining operations or sell the rights to mine, will be significantly\naffected by changes in the market price of gold. Gold prices fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors, all of which are beyond our control. Some of these factors\ninclude the sale or purchase of gold by central banks and financial institutions; interest rates; currency exchange rates; inflation or deflation; fluctuation in the value of the\nUnited States dollar and other currencies; speculation; global and regional supply and demand, including investment, industrial and jewelry demand; and the political and\neconomic conditions of major gold or other mineral producing countries throughout the world, such as Russia and South Africa. The price of gold or other minerals have\nfluctuated widely in recent years, and a decline in the price of gold could cause a significant decrease in the value of our properties, limit our ability to raise money, and render\ncontinued exploration activities of our properties impracticable. If that happens, then we could lose our rights to our properties and be compelled to sell some or all of these\nrights. Additionally, the future progression of our properties beyond the exploration stage is heavily dependent upon the level of gold prices remaining sufficiently high to make\nthe continuation of our properties economically viable. A decrease in the price of gold may adversely affect our financial condition and access to capital and result in a decrease\nin our stock price. The greater the decrease in the price of gold, the more likely it is that our stock price will decrease.\nOur property titles may be challenged, and we are not insured against any challenges, impairments or defects to our mineral claims or property titles.\nWe cannot guarantee that title to our properties will not be challenged. Title insurance is not available for our mineral properties, and our ability to ensure that we have obtained\nsecure rights to individual mineral properties or mining concessions may be severely constrained. Our unpatented Keystone claims were created and maintained in accordance\nwith the federal General Mining Law of 1872. Unpatented claims are unique U.S. property interests and are generally considered to be subject to greater title risk than other real\nproperty interests because the validity of unpatented claims is often uncertain. This uncertainty arises, in part, out of the complex federal and state laws and regulations under\nthe General Mining Law. We have obtained a title report on our Keystone claims but cannot be certain that all defects or conflicts with our title to those claims have been\nidentified. Further, we have not obtained title insurance regarding our purchase and ownership of the Keystone claims. Defending any challenges to our property titles may be\ncostly and may divert funds that could otherwise be used for exploration activities and other purposes. We cannot provide any assurances that there are no title defects affecting\nour properties. In addition, unpatented claims are always subject to possible challenges by third parties or contests by the federal government, which, if successful, may prevent\nus from exploiting our discovery of commercially extractable gold. Challenges to our title may increase its costs of operation or limit our ability to explore on certain portions\nof our properties. We are not insured against challenges, impairments or defects to our property titles, nor do we intend to carry extensive title insurance in the future.\nMarket forces or unforeseen developments may prevent us from obtaining the supplies and equipment necessary to explore for gold and other minerals.\nGold exploration, and mineral exploration in general, is a very competitive business. Competitive demands for contractors and unforeseen shortages of supplies and/or\nequipment could result in the disruption of our planned exploration activities. Current demand for exploration drilling services, equipment and supplies is robust and could\nresult in suitable equipment and skilled manpower being unavailable at scheduled times for our exploration program. The recent inflationary environment has also resulted in a\nsignificant increase in costs, including fuel. If we cannot find the equipment and supplies needed for our various exploration programs, we may have to suspend some or all of\nthem until equipment, supplies, funds and/or skilled manpower become available. Any such disruption in our activities may adversely affect our exploration activities and\nfinancial condition.\nJoint ventures and other partnerships may expose us to risks.\nWe may enter into future joint ventures or partnership arrangements with other parties in relation to the exploration, of a certain portion of the CK Gold, Keystone and Challis\nGold Properties in which we have an interest. Joint ventures can often require unanimous approval of the parties to the joint venture or their representatives for certain\nfundamental decisions such as an increase or reduction of registered capital, merger, division, dissolution, amendments of consenting documents, and the pledge of joint venture\nassets, which means that each joint venture party may have a veto right with respect to such decisions which could lead to a deadlock in the operations of the joint venture.\nFurther, we may be unable to exert control over strategic decisions made in respect of such properties. Any failure of such other companies to meet their obligations to us or to\nthird parties, or any disputes with respect to the parties’ respective rights and obligations, could have a material adverse effect on the joint ventures or their properties and\ntherefore could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial performance, cash flows and the price of the Common Shares.\n27\nWe may pursue acquisitions, divestitures, business combinations or other transactions with other companies, involving our properties or new properties, which could harm\nour operating results, may disrupt our business and could result in unanticipated accounting charges.\nAcquisitions of other companies or new properties, divestitures, business combinations or other transactions with other companies may create additional, material risks for our\nbusiness that could cause our results to differ materially and adversely from our expected or projected results. Such risk factors include the effects of possible disruption to the\nexploration activities and mine planning, loss of value associated with our properties, mismanagement of project development, additional risk and liability, indemnification\nobligations, sales of assets at unfavorable prices, failure to sell non-core assets at all, poor execution of the plans for such transactions, permit requirements, debt incurred or\ncapital stock issued to enter into such transactions, the impact of any such transactions on our financial results, negative stakeholder reaction to any such transaction and our\nability to successfully integrate an acquired company’s operations with our operations. If the purchase price of any acquired businesses exceeds the current fair values of the net\ntangible assets of such acquired businesses, we would be required to record material amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets, which could result in significant\nimpairment and amortization expense in future periods. These charges, in addition to the results of operations of such acquired businesses and potential restructuring costs\nassociated with an acquisition, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot forecast the number, timing or size\nof future transactions, or the effect that any such transactions might have on our operating or financial results. Any potential future transactions will be viewed on their merits\nby management and ultimately our Board at the time definitive proposals are received by the Company and viewed relative to the current circumstances of the Company and its\nbusiness. Furthermore, potential transactions, whether or not consummated, will divert our management’s attention and may require considerable cash outlays at the expense of\nour existing operations. In addition, to complete future transactions, we may issue equity securities, incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or have amortization expenses and\nwrite-downs of acquired assets, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe may experience difficulty attracting and retaining qualified management to meet the needs of our anticipated growth, and the failure to manage our growth effectively\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. In addition, we are dependent upon our employees being able to safely perform their jobs,\nincluding the potential for physical injuries or illness.\nWe are dependent on a relatively small number of key employees, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer and our Vice President –\nExploration and Technical Services. The loss of any officer could have an adverse effect on us. We have no life insurance on any individual, and we may be unable to hire a\nsuitable replacement for them on favorable terms, should that become necessary.\nOur success is also dependent on the contributions of highly skilled and experienced consultants and contractors. Our ability to achieve our operating goals depends upon our\nability to retain such consultants and contractors in order to execute on our strategy. There continues to be competition over highly skilled consultants and contractors in our\nindustry. If we lose key consultants, contractors, or one or more members of our senior management team, and we fail to develop adequate succession plans, our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be harmed.\nOur business is dependent upon our consultants and contractors being able to safely perform their jobs, including the potential for physical injuries or illness. If we experience\nperiods where our consultants and contractors are unable to perform their jobs for any reason, including as a result of illness, our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\n28\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nOur future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in\njurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as\nwell as certain discrete items. We are subject to review or audit by tax authorities. As a result, we may in the future receive assessments in multiple jurisdictions on various tax-\nrelated assertions. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, the determination of\nour provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment, and there could be situations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although\nwe believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial\nresults in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nOur activities may be adversely affected by unforeseeable and unquantifiable health risks, whether those effects are local, nationwide or global. Matters outside our control\nmay prevent us from executing on our exploration programs, limit travel of Company representatives, adversely affect the health and welfare of Company personnel or\nprevent important vendors and contractors from performing normal and contracted activities.\nThe risks we face related to contagious disease, or policies implemented by governments to protect against the spread of a disease, are unforeseeable and unquantifiable by us.\nWe, or our people, investors, contractors or stakeholders, may be prevented from free cross-border travel or normal attendance to activities in conducting Company business at\ntrade shows, presentations, meetings or other activities meant to promote or execute our business strategy and transactions. We may be prevented from receiving goods or\nservices from contractors. Decisions beyond our control, such as canceled events, restricted travel, barriers to entry or other factors may affect our ability to accomplish drilling\nprograms, technical analysis of completed exploration actions, equity raising activities, and other needs that would normally be accomplished without such limitations.\nWe use a variety of outsourced contractors to execute our exploration programs. Drilling contractors need to be able to access our projects and ensure social distancing\nrecommended safety standards While our contractors are currently able to access our projects, there can be no assurances that this access will continue if subsequent waves of\nthe infection or variant strains appear.\nAs an exploration and development company with no revenues, we are reliant on constantly raising additional capital to fund our operations. A continuation or worsening of the\nlevels of market disruption and volatility seen in the recent past could have an adverse effect on our ability to access capital, on our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition, and on the market price of our common stock. There are no assurances we will be able to raise additional capital on favorable terms in the foreseeable future.\nWe are dependent on information technology systems, which are subject to certain risks, including cybersecurity risks and data leakage risks.\nWe are dependent upon information technology systems in the conduct of our business. Any significant breakdown, invasion, virus, cyberattack, security breach, destruction or\ninterruption of these systems by employees, others with authorized access to our systems, or unauthorized persons could negatively impact our business. To the extent any\ninvasion, cyberattack or security breach results in disruption to our business, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, our data or confidential information, our reputation, business,\nresults of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against cyber security risks may not be\nsufficient. Although to date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyberattacks, we may suffer such losses in the future. We may be required to expend\nsignificant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures. We also may be subject to significant litigation, regulatory investigation and\nremediation costs associated with any information security vulnerabilities, cyberattacks or security breaches.\nThe Company could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective, not installed properly or not\nproperly integrated into operations. Various measures have been implemented to manage the risks related to the system implementation and modification, but system\nmodification failures could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position, and results of operations.\n29\nRISKS RELATED TO THE MINERAL EXPLORATION INDUSTRY\nExploring for gold is an inherently speculative business.\nNatural resource exploration and exploring for gold in particular is a business that by its nature is very speculative. There is a strong possibility that we will not discover gold or\nany other resources which can be mined or extracted at a profit. Although we have established the existence of mineral reserves at the CK Gold Project, we may be\nunsuccessful in bringing it into production on a profitable basis. Few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. Unusual or unexpected\ngeological formations, geological formation pressures, fires, power outages, labor disruptions, flooding, explosions, cave-ins, landslides and the inability to obtain suitable or\nadequate machinery, equipment or labor are just some of the many risks involved in mineral exploration programs and the subsequent expansion of potential gold deposits.\nEstimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources are subject to evaluation uncertainties that could result in project failure.\nOur exploration and future potential mining operations, if any, are and would be faced with risks associated with being able to accurately predict the quantity and quality of\nmineral resources or mineral reserves within the earth using statistical sampling techniques. Estimates of mineral resources or mineral reserves on our properties are made using\nsamples obtained from appropriately placed trenches, test pits and underground workings and intelligently designed drilling. There is an inherent variability of assays between\ncheck and duplicate samples taken adjacent to each other and between sampling points that cannot be reasonably eliminated. Additionally, there also may be unknown geologic\ndetails that have not been identified or correctly appreciated at the current level of accumulated knowledge about our properties. This could result in uncertainties that cannot be\nreasonably eliminated from the process of estimating potential mineral resources/reserves. If these estimates were to prove to be unreliable, we could implement an exploitation\nplan that may not lead to any commercially viable operations in the future.\nWe may be denied the government licenses and permits which we need to explore or mine on our properties.\nExploration activities usually require the granting of permits from various governmental agencies. For example, exploration drilling on unpatented mineral claims requires a\npermit to be obtained from the United States BLM, which may take several months or longer to grant the requested permit. Depending on the size, location and scope of the\nexploration program, additional permits may also be required before exploration activities can be undertaken. Prehistoric or Native American graveyards, threatened or\nendangered species, archeological sites or the possibility thereof, difficult access, excessive dust and important nearby water resources may all result in the need for additional\npermits before exploration activities can commence. As with all permitting processes, there is the risk that unexpected delays and excessive costs may be experienced in\nobtaining required permits. The needed permits may not be granted at all. Delays in or our inability to obtain necessary permits will result in unanticipated costs, which may\nresult in serious adverse effects upon our business.\nPossible amendments to the General Mining Law and other regulations could make it more difficult or impossible for us to execute our business plan.\nIn recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered a number of proposed amendments to the General Mining Law, as well as legislation that would make comprehensive\nchanges to the law. Although no such comprehensive legislation has been adopted to date, there can be no assurance that such legislation will not be adopted in the future. If\nadopted, such legislation, if it includes concepts that have been part of previous legislative proposals, could, among other things, (i) limit on the number of millsites that a\nclaimant may use, (ii) impose time limits on the effectiveness of plans of operation that may not coincide with mine life, (iii) impose more stringent environmental compliance\nand reclamation requirements on activities on unpatented mining claims and millsites, (iv) establish a mechanism that would allow states, localities and Native American tribes\nto petition for the withdrawal of identified tracts of federal land from the operation of the General Mining Law, (v) allow for administrative determinations that mining would\nnot be allowed in situations where undue degradation of the federal lands in question could not be prevented, (vi) impose royalties on gold and other mineral production from\nunpatented mining claims or impose fees on production from patented mining claims, and (vii) impose a fee on the amount of material displaced at a mine. Further, such\nlegislation, if enacted, could have an adverse impact on earnings from our exploration operations, could reduce future estimates of any reserves we may establish and could\ncurtail our future exploration activity on our unpatented claims.\n30\nOur ability to conduct exploration, and related activities may also be impacted by administrative actions taken by federal agencies.\nWe may not be able to maintain the infrastructure necessary to conduct exploration and development activities.\nOur exploration and development activities depend upon adequate infrastructure. Reliable roads, bridges, power sources and water supply are important factors which affect\ncapital and operating costs. Climate change or unusual or infrequent weather phenomena, sabotage, government or other interference in the maintenance or provision of such\ninfrastructure could adversely affect our exploration activities and financial condition.\nWe compete against larger and more experienced companies.\nThe mining industry is intensely competitive. Many large mining companies are primarily producers of precious or base metals and may become interested in the types of\ndeposits and exploration projects on which we are focused, which include gold, silver and other precious metals deposits or polymetallic deposits containing significant\nquantities of base metals, including copper. Many of these companies have greater financial resources, experience and technical capabilities than we do. We may encounter\nincreasing competition from other mining companies in our efforts to acquire mineral properties and hire experienced mining professionals. Increased competition in our\nbusiness could adversely affect our ability to attract necessary capital funding or acquire suitable mining properties or prospects for mineral exploration in the future.\nWe rely on contractors to conduct a significant portion of our exploration operations.\nA significant portion of our exploration operations are currently conducted in whole or in part by contractors. As a result, our exploration operations are subject to a number of\nrisks, some of which are outside our control, including:\n● negotiating agreements with contractors on acceptable terms;\n● the inability to replace a contractor and its operating equipment in the event that either party terminates the agreement;\n● reduced control over those aspects of operations which are the responsibility of the contractor;\n● failure of a contractor to perform under its agreement;\n● interruption of exploration operations or increased costs in the event that a contractor ceases its business due to insolvency or other unforeseen events;\n● failure of a contractor to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, to the extent it is responsible for such compliance; and\n● problems of a contractor with managing its workforce, labor unrest or other employment issues.\nIn addition, we may incur liability to third parties as a result of the actions of our contractors. The occurrence of one or more of these risks could adversely affect our results of\noperations and financial position.\nOur exploration activities may be adversely affected by the local climate or seismic events, which could prevent us from gaining access to our property year-round.\nEarthquakes, heavy rains, snowstorms, wildfires and floods could result in serious damage to or the destruction of facilities, equipment or means of access to our property, or\nmay otherwise prevent us from conducting exploration activities on our property. There may be short periods of time when the unpaved portion of the access road is impassible\nin the event of extreme weather conditions or unusually muddy conditions. During these periods, it may be difficult or impossible for us to access our property, make repairs, or\notherwise conduct exploration activities on them.\n31\nWe may be unable to secure surface access or to purchase required surface rights.\nAlthough we acquire the rights to some or all of the minerals in the ground subject to the mineral tenures that it acquires, or has a right to acquire, in most cases it does not\nthereby acquire any rights to, or ownership of, the surface to the areas covered by such mineral tenures. In such cases, applicable mining laws usually provide for rights of\naccess to the surface for the purpose of carrying on exploration activities, however, the enforcement of such rights through the courts can be costly and time consuming. It is\nnecessary to negotiate surface access or to purchase the surface rights if long-term access is required. There can be no guarantee that, despite having the right at law to access\nthe surface and carry on exploration activities, we will be able to negotiate satisfactory agreements with any such existing landowners/occupiers for such access or purchase of\nsuch surface rights, and therefore we may be unable to carry out planned exploration activities. In addition, in circumstances where such access is denied, or no agreement can\nbe reached, we may need to rely on the assistance of local officials or the courts in such jurisdiction the outcomes of which cannot be predicted with any certainty. Our inability\nto secure surface access or purchase required surface rights could materially and adversely affect our timing, cost or overall ability to develop any potential mineral deposits we\nmay locate.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control,\nincluding the following:\n● results of our operations and exploration efforts;\n● fluctuation in the supply of, demand and market price for gold and copper;\n● our ability to obtain working capital financing;\n● additions or departures of key personnel;\n● limited “public float” in the hands of a small number of persons whose sales or lack of sales could result in positive or negative pricing pressure on the market price for\nour common stock;\n● our ability to execute our business plan;\n● sales of our common stock and decline in demand for our common stock;\n● regulatory developments;\n● economic and other external factors;\n● investor perception of our industry or our prospects; and\n● period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time-to-time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular\ncompanies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As a result, you may be unable to resell your shares of\nour common stock at a desired price.\nVolatility in the price of our common stock may subject us to securities litigation.\nAs discussed above, the market for our common stock is characterized by significant price volatility when compared to seasoned issuers, and we expect that our share price will\ncontinue to be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have initiated securities class action litigation against a company following\nperiods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and\nliabilities and could divert management’s attention and resources.\nThere is currently a limited trading market for our common stock and we cannot ensure that one will ever develop or be sustained.\nAlthough our common stock is currently quoted on NASDAQ, there is limited trading activity. We can give no assurance that an active market will develop, or if developed,\nthat it will be sustained. If an investor acquires shares of our common stock, the investor may not be able to liquidate our shares should there be a need or desire to do so. There\ncan be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock either now or in the future. The market liquidity of our common stock is limited and\nmay be dependent on the market perception of our business, among other things. We may, in the future, take certain steps, including utilizing investor awareness campaigns,\npress releases, road shows and conferences to increase awareness of our business and any steps that we might take to bring us to the awareness of investors may require we\ncompensate consultants with cash and/or stock. There can be no assurance that there will be any awareness generated or the results of any efforts will result in any impact on\nour trading volume. Consequently, investors may not be able to liquidate their investment or liquidate it at a price that reflects the value of the business and trading may be at an\ninflated price relative to our performance due to, among other things, availability of sellers of our shares. If a market should develop, the price may be highly volatile. Because\nthere may be a low price for our shares of common stock, many brokerage firms or clearing firms may not be willing to effect transactions in the securities or accept our shares\nfor deposit in an account. Even if an investor finds a broker willing to effect a transaction in the shares of our common stock, the combination of brokerage commissions,\ntransfer fees, taxes, if any, and any other selling costs may exceed the selling price. Further, many lending institutions will not permit the use of low-priced shares of common\nstock as collateral for any loans.\n32\nSales, offers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nSales of substantial amounts of the common stock, or the availability of such securities for sale, could adversely affect the prevailing market prices for the common stock. A\ndecline in the market prices of the common stock could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of securities should we desire to do so. In addition, if our\nstockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or upon the expiration of any statutory holding period, under Rule 144, or upon the exercise of\noutstanding options or warrants, it could create a circumstance commonly referred to as an “overhang” in anticipation of which the market price of our common stock could\ndecline. The existence of an overhang, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, also could make it more difficult for us to raise additional financing through the sale\nof equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.\nOur issuance of additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock in exchange for services would dilute the proportionate ownership and\nvoting rights of existing stockholders and could have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock.\nOur Board may generally issue shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock without further approval by our stockholders, based upon such factors that\nour Board may deem relevant at that time. We have also issued securities as payment for services. It is possible that we will issue additional securities to pay for services in the\nfuture. We cannot give you any assurance that we will not issue additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock under circumstances we may\ndeem appropriate at the time.\nOur articles of incorporation allow for our Board to create new series of preferred stock without further approval by our stockholders, which could adversely affect the\nrights of the holders of our common stock.\nOur Board has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock. Board also has the authority to issue preferred stock without further\nstockholder approval. As a result, our Board could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon\nliquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of our common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares, together\nwith a premium, prior to the redemption of our common stock. In addition, our Board could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that has greater voting power\nthan our common stock or that is convertible into our common stock, which could decrease the relative voting power of our common stock or result in dilution to our existing\nstockholders.\nAnti-takeover provisions may impede the acquisition of our Company.\nCertain provisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes have anti-takeover effects and may inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination. These provisions are\nintended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with, and to obtain the approval of, our Board in connection with such a transaction. However, certain\nof these provisions may discourage a future acquisition of us, including an acquisition in which the stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. As a result,\nstockholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have the opportunity to do so.\n33\nThe Company does not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe anticipate that we will retain any future earnings to support operations and to finance the development of our business and do not expect to pay cash dividends in the\nforeseeable future. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that our\ncommon stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders have purchased their shares.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could\ndecline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We have relatively\nlittle research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If no additional industry analysts commence coverage of the Company, the trading price for our common stock\ncould be negatively impacted. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrades our common stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business,\nour stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could\ndecrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nWe may not meet the continued listing requirements of the NASDAQ, which could result in a delisting of our common stock.\nOur common stock is listed on the NASDAQ. We have in the past, and may in the future, be unable to comply with certain of the listing standards that we are required to meet\nto maintain the listing of our common shares on the NASDAQ. For instance, on November 7, 2019, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of the\nNASDAQ Stock Market indicating that, based upon the closing bid price of our common stock for the 30 consecutive business day period between September 26, 2019,\nthrough November 6, 2019, we did not meet the minimum bid price of $1.00 per share required for continued listing on the NASDAQ pursuant to NASDAQ Listing Rule\n5550(a)(2). On April 3, 2020, we received notice from the NASDAQ indicating that we have regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement under NASDAQ\nListing Rule 5550(a)(2), and the matter is now closed.\nIf NASDAQ delists our common stock from trading on its exchange for failure to meet the listing standards, we and our stockholders could face significant material adverse\nconsequences including:\n● a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n● a determination that our common stock is a “penny stock” which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly\nresulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our common stock;\n● a limited amount of analyst coverage; and\n● a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nDelisting could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business\ndevelopment opportunities.\nItem 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNot applicable.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nOur system of internal controls includes consideration of cybersecurity risks. We use technology and control procedures designed to mitigate cybersecurity risks, with our\nmanagement team working to monitor, identify, assess, and respond to potential cybersecurity incidents that may threaten the Company. The system of controls also focuses on\nsecurity awareness and training for employees with access to Company systems. Company management periodically reviews system and organization control reports (SOC 1,\nType 2) for key outsourced information systems to ensure that third-party data processing is subject to appropriate controls and security measures.\nWe have engaged with a third-party information technology firm to assess our vulnerabilities and help us mitigate cybersecurity-related risks.\n34\nManagement is responsible for the operational oversight of company-wide cybersecurity strategy, policy, and standards across relevant departments to assess and help prepare\nus to address cybersecurity risks. As part of our overall risk management system, we monitor and test our safeguards and train our employees on these safeguards. Personnel at\nall levels and departments are made aware of our cybersecurity policies through trainings and necessary implementations.\nOne of the key functions of our Board is informed oversight of our risk management process, including risks from cybersecurity threats. Our Board is responsible for\nmonitoring and assessing strategic risk exposure, and management is responsible for the day-to-day management of any material risks that may arise. Our Board receives\nperiodic updates from management regarding cybersecurity matters and is notified between such updates regarding any significant new cybersecurity threats or incidents, if\nany. We do not believe that there are currently any known risks from cybersecurity threats that are reasonably likely to materially affect us or our business strategy, results of\noperations or financial condition.\nAs of April 30, 2024, we have not identified an indication of a cybersecurity incident that would have a material impact on our business and consolidated financial statements.\nFor further discussion of cybersecurity risks, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nItem 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. To our knowledge, there are no material pending legal\nproceedings to which we are a party or of which any of our property is the subject.\nItem 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nPursuant to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, issuers that are operators, or that have a subsidiary that is an operator, of a coal or other mine in the United States are\nrequired to disclose specified information about mine health and safety in their periodic reports. These reporting requirements are based on the safety and health requirements\napplicable to mines under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the “Mine Act”) which is administered by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Mine Safety and Health\nAdministration (“MSHA”). During the twelve months period ended April 30, 2024, we and our properties or operations were not subject to regulation by MSHA under the\nMine Act and thus no disclosure is required under Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act.\n35\nPART II\nItem 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nMarket Information\nOur Common Stock is traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “USAU”.\nHolders of Common Stock\nOn July 26, 2024, we had 88 registered holders of record of our common stock, which number does not reflect beneficial stockholders who hold their stock in nominee or\n“street” name through various brokerage firms. On July 26, 2024, the closing sales price of our common stock as reported on NASDAQ Capital Market was $5.84 per share.\nDividends and Dividend Policy\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends on shares of its common stock in the foreseeable future as our Board intends to retain future earnings for use in our business. Any future\ndetermination as of the payment of dividends on our common stock will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations and such other factors as our Board seems\nrelevant.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities.\nThere were no sales of unregistered securities during the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024 that were not previously reported on a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or a Current\nReport on Form 8-K. None of the transactions involved any underwriters, underwriting discounts or commissions.\nItem 6. [RESERVED].\nItem 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nU.S. Gold Corp., formerly known as Dataram Corporation (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”), was originally incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1967 and was\nsubsequently re-incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada in 2016. Effective June 26, 2017, the Company changed its legal name to U.S. Gold Corp. from Dataram\nCorporation. On May 23, 2017, the Company merged with Gold King Corp. (“Gold King”), in a transaction treated as a reverse acquisition and recapitalization, and the\nbusiness of Gold King became the business of the Company. We are a gold and precious metals exploration company pursuing exploration and development properties. We own\ncertain mining leases and other mineral rights comprising the CK Gold Project in Wyoming, the Keystone Project in Nevada and the Challis Gold Project in Idaho. We have\nestablished an estimate of proven and probable mineral reserves under S-K 1300 at our CK Gold Project, where we are conducting exploration and pre-development activities,\nand all of our activities on our other properties are exploratory in nature.\nSummary of Activities for the Fiscal Year Ended April 30, 2024\nDuring the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024, we focused primarily on advancing our CK Gold Project in Wyoming with the approval of two major permits; our surface gold\nmine permit (mine operation and reclamation plan (“MOP”)) approved April 2024 and an Industrial Siting permit for the construction and operation of our CK Gold project\napproved May 2023, and continued engineering studies towards the completion of a revised prefeasibility study and feasibility study. Additional exploration and geologic\ninvestigations were undertaken, enhancing our understanding of the Keystone Project deposit in Nevada and continued analysis of the historic geological data on the Challis\nGold Project in Idaho. Management focused on investor relations and awareness, resulting in the completion of an equity financing in April 2024.\nAn overview of certain significant events follows:\nCK Gold Project, Wyoming\n● In May 2023, we received notification from the Industrial Siting Division of the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (“WDEQ”) that an Industrial Siting\nPermit was granted to us for the construction and operation of the proposed mine at the CK Gold Project.\n● In April 2024, we received a letter from the United States Army Corps of Engineers (“USACE”) confirming that the proposed CK Gold Project did not need a permit\nfrom the USACE for the activities outlined in the MOP. With the project being situated on Wyoming State and private land and falling under the jurisdiction of\nWyoming State authorities, this was the only direct nexus to Federal Government involvement in obtaining the necessary project permits.\n● In April 2024, we received notification from the Land Quality Division of the WDEQ that we received approval on our surface gold mine permit, subject to certain\nconditions.\n● In May 2024, we satisfied two of the three conditions associated with our MOP with 1) the approval of our Wyoming Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit\nand 2) acceptance by the WDEQ of our reclamation bond\n● During the year-ended April 30, 2024, we continued to advance towards approval of our Air Quality permit with the Air Quality Division of the WDEQ. Approval of\nthis air quality permit is the final condition associated with our MOP and is expected to be received this year.\n36\nKeystone Project, Cortez Trend, Nevada\n● We continue systematic exploration investigations at our highly prospective Keystone Project looking for potential drill targets. We conducted a hyperspectral survey\non the property identifying evidence of potential mineralization. Numerous anomalies often associated with mineralization were identified. Field investigation of the\nmost prospective anomalies was completed during the 2023 field season. Altered sedimentary outcrops containing anomalous gold grades were discovered which\nrequire additional investigation.\nChallis Gold Project, Idaho\n● We continue towards the completion of a Plan of Operations as the next phase of exploration.\nSales of Common Shares to raise a total of $4.9 million in cash\nOn April 19, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) with certain institutional and accredited investors in connection with\na registered direct offering of 1,400,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $3.50 per share and warrants to purchase 1,400,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise\nprice of $4.48 per share (the “Registered Offering”). The warrants are exercisable on October 19, 2024 and will expire on October 19, 2029. The aggregate gross proceeds of\nthe Registered Offering was $4,900,000 before deduction of legal related offering expenses of $72,309. The closing of the Registered Offering occurred on April 19, 2024.\nShareholder Meeting, Appointment of Directors and Corporate Matters\nOn April 26, 2024, we held our annual meeting of stockholders. At that meeting, among other matters, shareholders re-elected to our Board four of the five incumbent\nDirectors: Mr. Norman, Mr. Bee, Mr. Schafer and Mr. Waldkirch; and elected Ms. Johanna Fipke to our Board, replacing Ms. Tara Gilfillan, who did not stand for re-election.\nEach of the elected Directors will hold office until the next meeting of stockholders and until their successors are named and qualified or until their earlier resignation or\nremoval. The stockholders also ratified the appointment of our audit firm for our fiscal year ended April 30, 2024.\nResults of Operations\nNet Revenues\nWe are a development-stage company with no operations, and we did not generate any revenues for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024, as compared to the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023, were approximately $7,257,000 and $9,401,000,\nrespectively. The approximate $2,144,000 decrease in operating expenses for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024, as compared to the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023, is\ncomprised of (i) a decrease in compensation expense of approximately $437,000 primarily due to a decrease in stock based compensation, (ii) a decrease of approximately\n$336,000 in exploration expenses on our mineral properties due to the decrease in exploration activities and related consulting expenses at our CK Gold property, (iii) a\ndecrease in professional and consulting fees of approximately $1,204,000 primarily due to decreases in general strategic and permitting consulting services of $698,000,\ndecrease in legal fees of $64,000, decreases in director fees of $247,000 (primarily due to the decrease in director stock based compensation), decrease in investor relation fees\nof $244,000, offset marginally by an increase in accounting fees of $49,000 and (iv) a decrease in general and administrative expenses of approximately $167,000 due primarily\nto decreases related to advertising, insurance, research and development, and travel expenses.\n37\nLoss from Operations\nWe reported loss from operations of approximately $7,257,000 and $9,401,000 for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOther Income (Loss)\nWe reported other income of approximately $360,000 and $1,786,000 for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We reported a change in fair value of warrant\nliability of approximately $314,000 and $1,560,000 for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We reported a gain from the sale of asset (Maggie Creek) of\napproximately $0 and $763,000 for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We reported interest income and gain from settlement of asset retirement obligation\nof approximately $40,000 and $6,000, respectively, for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024, as compared to approximately $4,900 and $0 during the fiscal year ended April 30,\n2023, respectively. We reported a decrease in change in fair value due to modification of warrants of approximately $263,000 and decrease in offering cost related to warrant\nliability of approximately $279,000 for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023 as compared to none during the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024.\nNet Loss\nWe reported a net loss of approximately $6,897,000 and $7,614,000 for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table summarizes total current assets, liabilities and working capital at April 30, 2024, compared to April 30, 2023, and the changes between those periods:\nApril 30, 2024 April 30, 2023 Increase (decrease)\nCurrent Assets $ 6,523,111 $ 8,433,070 $ (1,909,959)\nCurrent Liabilities $ 452,790 $ 378,798 $ 73,992\nWorking Capital $ 6,070,321 $ 8,054,272 $ (1,983,951)\nAs of April 30, 2024, we had working capital of $6,070,321, as compared to working capital of $8,054,272 as of April 30, 2023, a decrease of $1,983,951.\nWe are obligated to file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). In addition, the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley”) and the rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board have imposed\nvarious requirements on public companies, including requiring changes in corporate governance practices. We expect to spend between $175,000 and $250,000 in legal and\naccounting expenses annually to comply with our reporting obligations and Sarbanes-Oxley. These costs could affect profitability and our results of operations.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting in accordance with U.S. GAAP and have been prepared assuming that we will\ncontinue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. For the years ended April 30, 2024\nand 2023, we incurred net losses in the amounts of approximately $6,897,000 and $7,614,000, respectively. For the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024, cash used in operating\nactivities was approximately $7,076,000. As of April 30, 2024, we had cash of approximately $5,574,000, working capital of approximately $6,070,000, and an accumulated\ndeficit of approximately $72,848,000. Our primary source of operating funds since inception has been equity financing. As of April 30, 2024, we may have sufficient cash to\nfund our corporate activities and general and administrative costs and currently undertaken project activities related to permitting and engineering studies over the next twelve\nmonths. However, in order to advance any of our projects past the aforementioned objectives, we do not have sufficient cash and will need to raise additional funds. These\nmatters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the issuance of these financial statements.\n38\nCash Used in Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities totaled approximately $7,076,000 and $8,691,000 for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net cash used in operating\nactivities during the year fiscal ended April 30, 2024, decreased primarily due to the i) decrease in net loss of approximately $717,000 as compared to the year fiscal ended\nApril 30, 2023 ii) increase in non-cash items of approximately $890,000 as compared to the years ended April 30, 2023. primarily due to the change in fair value of warrant\nliability, stock-based compensation and gain from sale of asset and iii) decrease in changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately $7,500 as compared to the fiscal\nyear ended April 30, 2023.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year fiscal ended April 30, 2024 was $0. Net cash used in investing activities during the years ended April 30, 2023 was\napproximately $2,572,000, primarily from proceeds received from the sale of Maggie Creek of $2,750,000 related to the Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated on\nNovember 9, 2022 and offset by approximately $178,000 primarily for the purchase of property and equipment.\nCash Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately $4,828,000 for the year fiscal ended April 30, 2024 primarily due to the sale of our common stock and warrants\nfor approximately $4,900,000 in April 2024, net of offering costs. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately $4,830,000 for the fiscal year ended April 30,\n2023, primarily due to the sale of our common stock and warrants for approximately $4,800,000 in April 2023, net of offering costs.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of April 30, 2024, we did not have, and do not have any present plans to implement, any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of recently issued accounting pronouncements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of\nthe consolidated balance sheet, and revenues and expenses for the period then ended. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates. Critical accounting estimates\nare those estimates made in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are\nreasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our critical accounting estimates are discussed below, including, to the extent\nmaterial and reasonably available, the impact such estimates have had, or are reasonably likely to have, on our financial condition or results of operations.\n39\nShare-Based Compensation\nShare-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of ASC 718, “Compensation—Stock Compensation” (“ASC 718”), which requires recognition in the\nfinancial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee or director is required\nto perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). ASC 718 also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services\nreceived in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award.\nMineral Rights\nCosts of leasing, exploring, carrying and retaining unproven mineral lease properties are expensed as incurred. We expense all mineral exploration costs as incurred. Where we\nhave identified proven and probable mineral reserves on any of our properties, development costs will be capitalized when all the following criteria have been met, a) we\nreceive the requisite operating permits, b) completion of a favorable Feasibility Study and c) approval from our Board authorizing the development of the ore body. Until such\ntime all these criteria have been met, we record pre-development costs to expense as incurred.\nWhen a property reaches the production stage, the related capitalized costs will be amortized on a units-of-production basis over the proven and probable reserves following the\ncommencement of production. The Company assesses the carrying costs of the capitalized mineral properties for impairment under ASC 360-10, “Impairment of Long-Lived\nAssets”, and evaluates its carrying value under ASC 930-360, “Extractive Activities—Mining”, annually. An impairment is recognized when the sum of the expected\nundiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the mineral properties. Impairment losses, if any, are measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the\nmineral properties over its estimated fair value.\nTo date, the Company has expensed all exploration and pre-development costs as none of its properties have satisfied the criteria above for capitalization.\nASC 930-805, “Extractive Activities—Mining: Business Combinations” (“ASC 930-805”), states that mineral rights consist of the legal right to explore, extract, and retain at\nleast a portion of the benefits from mineral deposits. Mining assets include mineral rights.\nAcquired mineral rights are considered tangible assets under ASC 930-805. ASC 930-805 requires that mineral rights be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. As a\nresult, the direct costs to acquire mineral rights are initially capitalized as tangible assets. Mineral rights include costs associated with acquiring patented and unpatented mining\nclaims.\nASC 930-805 provides that in measuring the fair value of mineral assets, an acquirer should take into account both:\n● The value beyond proven and probable reserves (“VBPP”) to the extent that a market participant would include VBPP in determining the fair value of the assets.\n● The effects of anticipated fluctuations in the future market price of minerals in a manner that is consistent with the expectations of market participants.\nLeases to explore for or use of natural resources are outside the scope of ASC 842, “Leases”.\nWarrant Liability\nWe account for the warrants issued in March 2022 and April 2023, respectively, in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815 “Derivatives and Hedging” whereby\nunder that provision these warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment and must be recorded as a liability. Accordingly, we classify these warrant instruments as\nliabilities at fair value and adjusts the instruments to fair value at each reporting period. This liability is re-measured at each balance sheet date until the warrants are exercised\nor expire, and any change in fair value will be recognized in our statement of operations. The fair value of these warrants is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model.\nSuch warrant classification is also subject to re-evaluation at each reporting period.\nItem 7A.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of April 30, 2024 and\n2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended April 30, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America.\nExplanatory Paragraph – Going Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 3, the\nCompany has a significant working capital deficiency, has incurred significant losses and needs to raise additional funds to meet its obligations and sustain its operations. These\nconditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The\nconsolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our\naudits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an\naudit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the\npurpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We\nbelieve that our audits provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit\ncommittee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex\njudgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.\n/s/ Marcum LLP\nMarcum LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2016 through 2018 and subsequently reappointed as the Company’s auditor in 2019.\nHouston, TX\nJuly 29, 2024\nF-1\nU.S. GOLD CORP.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAPRIL 30, 2024\nNOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nOrganization\nU.S. Gold Corp., formerly known as Dataram Corporation (the “Company”), was originally incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1967 and was subsequently re-\nincorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada in 2016. Effective June 26, 2017, the Company changed its name to U.S. Gold Corp. from Dataram Corporation. On May\n23, 2017, the Company merged with Gold King Corp. (“Gold King”), in a transaction treated as a reverse acquisition and recapitalization, and the business of Gold King\nbecame the business of the Company. The Company is a gold and precious metals exploration company pursuing exploration and development properties. The Company owns\ncertain mining leases and other mineral rights comprising the CK Gold Project in Wyoming, the Keystone Project in Nevada and the Challis Gold Project in Idaho. The\nCompany has established an estimate of proven and probable mineral reserves under S-K 1300 at its CK Gold Project, where the Company is conducting exploration and pre-\ndevelopment activities, and all of its activities on its other properties are exploratory in nature.\nThe Company’s CK Gold property contains proven and probable mineral reserves and accordingly is classified as a development stage property, as defined in subpart 1300 of\nRegulation S-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“S-K 1300”).\nUnless the context otherwise requires, all references herein to the “Company” refer to U.S. Gold Corp. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nNOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of presentation and principles of consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (“U.S. GAAP”), the instructions to Form 10-K, and the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for financial\ninformation, which includes the consolidated financial statements and presents the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries as of\nApril 30, 2024. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. It is management’s opinion that all material adjustments (consisting of normal recurring\nadjustments) have been made, which are necessary for a fair financial statement presentation.\nUse of Estimates and Assumptions\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the\ndate of the consolidated balance sheet, and revenues and expenses for the period then ended. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates. Significant estimates\nmade by management include, but are not limited to, valuation of mineral rights, stock-based compensation, the fair value of common stock, valuation of warrant liability, asset\nretirement obligations and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nRevision of Financial Statements\nDuring the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021 (“fiscal year 2021”), the Company determined that it had not appropriately recorded a deferred tax liability related to the acquisition\nof mineral rights in August 2020. This resulted in an understatement of deferred tax liability and a corresponding understatement of provision for income taxes during fiscal\nyear 2021. Based on an analysis of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 250 – “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections” (“ASC 250”), Staff Accounting Bulletin 99\n– “Materiality” and Staff Accounting Bulletin 108 – “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial\nStatements,” the Company determined that these errors were immaterial to the previously issued consolidated financial statements, and as such no restatement was necessary.\nCorrecting prior period financial statements for immaterial errors would not require previously filed reports to be amended.\nF-6\nU.S. GOLD CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAPRIL 30, 2024\nThe effect of this revision on the line items within the Company’s consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity as of April 30, 2022, was as follows:\nApril 30, 2022\nAs Previously Reported Revision As Revised\nAccumulated Deficit $ (57,905,928) $ (430,486) $ (58,336,414)\nTotal Stockholders’ Equity $ 23,657,801 $ (430,486) $ 23,227,315\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company has adopted ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC 820”), for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. ASC 820\nestablishes a common definition for fair value to be applied in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of fair value measurements, establishes a framework for\nmeasuring fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements.\nASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. Additionally, ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\nThese inputs are prioritized below:\nLevel 1:Observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2:Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.\nLevel 3:Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which, require the use of the reporting entity’s own assumptions.\nThe Company analyzes all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under the Financial Accounting Standard Board’s (“FASB”) accounting standard for\nsuch instruments. Under this standard, financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement.\nThe Company’s warrant liability for warrants issued in connection with equity financing in March 2022 and April 2023 (see Note 9) was estimated using a Monte Carlo\nsimulation model using Level 3 inputs.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash equivalents are comprised of certain highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased. The Company did not have any cash equivalents\non hand at April 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company places its cash with high credit quality financial institutions. The Company’s accounts at these institutions are insured by the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to $250,000. To reduce its risk associated with the failure of such financial institutions, the Company evaluates, at least\nannually, the rating of the financial institutions in which it holds deposits. At April 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had bank balances of approximately $5.2 million and $7.3\nmillion, respectively, exceeding the FDIC insurance limit on interest bearing accounts.\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets of $948,833 and $610,140 at April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, consist primarily of costs paid for future services which will\noccur within a year. Prepaid expenses principally include prepayments in cash and equity instruments for consulting, public relations, business advisory services, insurance\npremiums, mining claim fees, easement fees, options fees, and mineral lease fees which are being amortized over the terms of their respective agreements.\nProperty\nProperty is carried at cost. The cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets are retired or\ndisposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are included in income in the year of disposition.\nDepreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets, generally three to five years.\nF-7\nU.S. GOLD CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAPRIL 30, 2024\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully\nrecoverable, or at least annually. The Company recognizes an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the\nasset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset’s estimated fair value and its book value. The Company did not recognize any impairment\nduring the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023.\nMineral Rights\nCosts of leasing, exploring, carrying and retaining unproven mineral lease properties are expensed as incurred. The Company expenses all mineral exploration costs as incurred.\nWhere the Company has identified proven and probable mineral reserves on any of its properties, development costs will be capitalized when all the following criteria have\nbeen met, a) the Company receives the requisite operating permits, b) completion of a favorable Feasibility Study and c) approval from the Board of director’s authorizing the\ndevelopment of the ore body. Until such time all these criteria have been met the Company records pre-development costs to expense as incurred.\nWhen a property reaches the production stage, the related capitalized costs will be amortized on a units-of-production basis over the proven and probable reserves following the\ncommencement of production. The Company assesses the carrying costs of the capitalized mineral properties for impairment under ASC 360-10, “Impairment of Long-Lived\nAssets”, and evaluates their carrying value under ASC 930-360, “Extractive Activities—Mining”, annually. An impairment is recognized when the sum of the expected\nundiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the mineral properties. Impairment losses, if any, are measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the\nmineral properties over its estimated fair value.\nTo date, the Company has expensed all exploration and pre-development costs as none of its properties have satisfied the criteria above for capitalization.\nASC 930-805, “Extractive Activities—Mining: Business Combinations” (“ASC 930-805”), states that mineral rights consist of the legal right to explore, extract, and retain at\nleast a portion of the benefits from mineral deposits. Mining assets include mineral rights.\nAcquired mineral rights are considered tangible assets under ASC 930-805. ASC 930-805 requires that mineral rights be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. As a\nresult, the direct costs to acquire mineral rights are initially capitalized as tangible assets. Mineral rights include costs associated with acquiring patented and unpatented mining\nclaims.\nASC 930-805 provides that in measuring the fair value of mineral assets, an acquirer should take into account both:\n● The value beyond proven and probable reserves (“VBPP”) to the extent that a market participant would include VBPP in determining the fair value of the assets.\n● The effects of anticipated fluctuations in the future market price of minerals in a manner that is consistent with the expectations of market participants.\nLeases to explore for or use of natural resources are outside the scope of ASC 842, “Leases”.\nShare-Based Compensation\nShare-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of ASC 718, “Compensation—Stock Compensation” (“ASC 718”), which requires recognition in the\nfinancial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee or director is required\nto perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). ASC 718 also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services\nreceived in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award.\nF-8\nU.S. GOLD CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAPRIL 30, 2024\nAccounting for Warrants\nWarrants are accounted for in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance provided in ASC 815, “Derivatives and Hedging” (“ASC 815”) as either derivative liabilities\nor as equity instruments, depending on the specific terms of the agreements. The Company classifies as equity any contracts that (i) require physical settlement or net-share\nsettlement or (ii) give the Company a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in its own shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement). The Company classifies as\nassets or liabilities any contracts that (i) require net-cash settlement (including a requirement to net-cash settle the contract if an event occurs and if that event is outside the\ncontrol of the Company) or (ii) give the counterparty a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement). Instruments that are\nclassified as liabilities are recorded at fair value at each reporting period, with any change in fair value recognized as a component of change in fair value of derivative\nliabilities in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Company assessed the classification of its outstanding common stock purchase warrants as of the date of issuance and determined that such instruments, except for the\nwarrants discussed under Warrant Liability below, met the criteria for equity classification under the guidance in ASU 2017-11 “Earnings Per Share (Topic 260); Distinguishing\nLiabilities from Equity (Topic 480); Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): (Part I) Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Feature”. The Company has\nno outstanding warrants that contain a “down round” feature under Topic 815 of ASU 2017-11.\nWarrant Liability\nThe Company accounts for the 625,000 warrants and 870,000 warrants issued in March 2022 and April 2023 (the “Warrant Agreements”), respectively, in accordance with the\nguidance contained in ASC 815 “Derivatives and Hedging” whereby under that provision these warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment and must be recorded as a\nliability (see Note 9). Accordingly, the Company classifies these warrant instruments as liabilities at fair value and adjusts the instruments to fair value at each reporting period.\nThis liability is re-measured at each balance sheet date until the warrants are exercised or expire, and any change in fair value will be recognized in the Company’s statement of\noperations. The fair value of these warrants is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Such warrant classification is also subject to re-evaluation at each reporting\nperiod.\nOffering Costs\nOffering costs incurred consisted of legal, placement agent fees and other costs that were directly related to registered direct offerings. Offering costs were allocated to the\nseparable financial instruments issued in the registered direct offering based on the same proportion as the proceeds were allocated to the warrants and equity. Offering costs\nassociated with warrant liabilities are expensed as incurred, presented as offering costs related to warrant liability in the consolidated statements of operations. Offering costs\nassociated with the sale of common shares are charged against equity.\nRemediation and Asset Retirement Obligation\nAsset retirement obligations (“ARO”), consisting primarily of estimated reclamation costs at the Company’s CK Gold and Keystone properties, are recognized in the period\nincurred and when a reasonable estimate can be made, and recorded as liabilities at fair value. Such obligations, which are initially estimated based on discounted cash flow\nestimates, are accreted to full value over time through charges to accretion expense. Corresponding asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the\nrelated long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset’s remaining useful life. AROs are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from\nrevisions to the estimated timing or amount of reclamation and closure costs. The Company reviews and evaluates its AROs annually or more frequently at interim periods if\ndeemed necessary.\nForeign Currency Transactions\nThe reporting and functional currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the\nexchange rates prevailing on the transaction dates. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates\nprevailing at the balance sheet date with any transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the\nfunctional currency included in the results of operations as incurred. Translation adjustments, and transaction gains or losses, have not had, and are not expected to have, a\nmaterial effect on the results of operations of the Company and are included in general and administrative expenses.\nF-9\nU.S. GOLD CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAPRIL 30, 2024\nLeases\nThe Company accounts for leases in accordance with ASC Topic 842, Leases. Operating lease right of use assets (“ROU”) represent the right to use the leased asset for the\nlease term and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As most\nleases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the adoption date in determining the present value\nof future payments. Upon the election by the Company to extend the lease for additional years, that election will be treated as a lease modification and the lease will be\nreviewed for re-measurement. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in general and administrative\nexpenses in the statements of operations.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provision of ASC 740, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (“ASC 740”), which requires, among other things, an asset and\nliability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax\nconsequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax\nassets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be realized.\nThe Company follows the provision of ASC 740-10, “Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions” (“ASC 740-10”). When tax returns are filed, there may be uncertainty\nabout the merits of positions taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax\nposition is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position\nwill be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions.\nTax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized\nupon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefit associated with tax positions taken that exceed the amount measured as described above should\nbe reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing\nauthorities upon examination. The Company believes its tax positions are all more likely than not to be upheld upon examination. As such, the Company has not recorded a\nliability for uncertain tax benefits or for any related interest and penalties. In the event that the Company is assessed penalties and/or interest, penalties will be charged to other\noperating expense and interest will be charged to interest expense.\nThe Company follows ASC 740-10-25, “Definition of Settlement”, which provides guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for\nthe purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits and provides that a tax position can be effectively settled upon the completion and examination by a taxing\nauthority without being legally extinguished. For tax positions considered effectively settled, an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit, even if the tax position is\nnot considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statute of limitations remains open. The federal and state income tax\nreturns of the Company are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and state taxing authorities, generally for three years after they are filed.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAccounting standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material effect on the financial\nstatements upon adoption. The Company does not discuss recent pronouncements that are not anticipated to have an effect on or are unrelated to its financial condition, results\nof operations, cash flows or disclosures.\nIn June 2022, FASB issued ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) (“ASU 2022-03”). The amendments in ASU 2022-03 clarify that a contractual restriction on the\nsale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The amendments also\nclarify that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. The amendments in this Update also require additional\ndisclosures for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions. The provisions in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early\nadoption is permitted. The Company does not expect to early adopt this ASU. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on its\nconsolidated financial statements.\nF-10\nU.S. GOLD CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAPRIL 30, 2024\nOn May 1, 2023, the Company adopted FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326) (“ASU 2016-13”), which requires the immediate\nrecognition of management’s estimates of current and expected credit losses. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements or disclosures.\nIn December 2023, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”). The standard enhances income tax\ndisclosure requirements for all entities by requiring specified categories and greater disaggregation within the rate reconciliation table, disclosure of income taxes paid by\njurisdiction, and providing clarification on uncertain tax positions and related financial statement impacts. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024. The Company is currently assessing the impact of ASU 2023-09 on its disclosures.\nNOTE 3 — GOING CONCERN\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities\nin the normal course of business. As of April 30, 2024, the Company had cash of approximately $5.6 million, working capital of approximately $6.1 million which consists\nprimarily of cash and prepaid expenses and other current assets and an accumulated deficit of approximately $72.8 million. The Company had a net loss and cash used in\noperating activities of approximately $6.9 million and $7.1 million, respectively, for the year ended April 30, 2024. As a result of the utilization of cash in its operating\nactivities, and the development of its assets, the Company has incurred losses since it commenced operations. The Company’s primary source of operating funds since inception\nhas been equity financing. As noted in Note 10, in April 2024, the Company completed a registered offering which raised total gross proceeds of approximately $4.9 million\nbefore deducting fees and other estimated offering expenses. As of the date of filing the annual report for the year ended April 30, 2024, the Company has sufficient cash to\nfund its corporate activities and general and administrative costs and currently undertaken project activities related to permitting and engineering studies. However, in order to\nadvance any of its projects past the aforementioned objectives the Company does not have sufficient cash and will need to raise additional funds. These matters raise substantial\ndoubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the issuance of these consolidated financial statements.\nThe consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset amounts or the classification of liabilities that\nmight be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nNOTE 4 — MINERAL RIGHTS\nThe Company’s CK Gold property contains proven and probable mineral reserves and accordingly is classified as a development stage property, as defined in subpart 1300 of\nRegulation S-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“S-K 1300”). None of the Company’s other properties contain proven and probable mineral reserves\nand all activities are exploratory in nature.\nCK Gold Project\nThe Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Gold King Corp., a Nevada corporation, owns the Copper King gold and copper development project (the “CK Gold\nProperty”), which is comprised of two State of Wyoming Metallic and Non-metallic Rocks and Minerals Mining Leases covering an area of approximately 1.8 square miles\nlocated in the Silver Crown Mining District of southeast Wyoming.\nKeystone Project\nThe Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, U.S. Gold Acquisition Corporation, acquired the mining claims comprising the Keystone Project. The Keystone Project\nconsists of 601 unpatented lode mining claims situated in Eureka County, Nevada. Some of the Keystone Project claims are subject to pre-existing net smelter royalty (“NSR”)\nobligations.\nF-11\nU.S. GOLD CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAPRIL 30, 2024\nMaggie Creek Project\nOn November 9, 2022, the Company entered into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement (the “Assignment and Assumption Agreement”) with and among Orevada Metals,\nInc., the Company’s indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary (“Orevada”), Nevada Gold Mines LLC (“NGM”), Orogen Royalties Inc. (“Orogen”) and Renaissance Exploration,\nInc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Orogen (“RenEx”) whereby Orevada assigned its interest in that certain Exploration Earn-In Agreement with RenEx, dated February 19,\n2019 (the “Original Earn-In Agreement”), to NGM. Pursuant to the Original Earn-In Agreement, Orevada, by making certain payments and incurring certain exploration\nexpenditures, had the right to earn at least a 50% interest and up to a 70% interest in the Maggie Creek Property, owned by RenEx, in Eureka County, Nevada. Simultaneous\nwith this assignment, NGM and RenEx entered into an Amended and Restated Exploration Earn-In Agreement, pursuant to which NGM can earn a 100% interest in the Maggie\nCreek Property (the “NGM Option”).\nAs consideration for the assignment of the Original Earn-In Agreement to NGM, U.S. Gold received an upfront cash payment of $2,750,000 from NGM, and NGM agreed that\nif it exercises the NGM Option and acquires the Maggie Creek Property, it will grant to U.S. Gold a 0.5% Net Smelter Returns royalty on all gold and other recovered and\nsaleable minerals from the Maggie Creek Property (the “U.S. Gold Royalty”), pursuant to a separate royalty agreement (the “U.S. Gold Royalty Agreement”) between NGM\nand the Company, the terms of which have been fully agreed as part of this assignment. Under the U.S. Gold Royalty Agreement, NGM will have the right to buy back one-half\nof the U.S. Gold Royalty (reducing the royalty to 0.25% of Net Smelter Returns) for a fixed price of $500,000. In addition, the U.S. Gold Royalty Agreement will provide that\nthe Company waives the first $800,000 of production royalty payments owed to it, regardless of whether NGM exercises its buy-back rights. Under the U.S. Gold Royalty\nAgreement, NGM will also have a right of first refusal to purchase the U.S. Gold Royalty if the Company decides to sell that royalty. Under the U.S. Gold Royalty Agreement,\nNGM will also have a right of first refusal to purchase the U.S. Gold Royalty if the Company decides to sell that royalty. Accordingly, the Company recognized gain from sale\nof asset of $763,393 during the year ended April 30, 2023 as reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations in connection with the Assignment and\nAssumption Agreement.\nNorthern Panther Merger Agreement\nOn August 10, 2020, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement with Acquisition Corp., NPRC and the Stockholder Representative named therein, pursuant to which\nAcquisition Corp. merged with and into NPRC, with NPRC surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Consequently, the Company acquired mineral rights on a\ngold exploration project in Idaho called the Challis Gold project. The Challis Gold project contains 77 unpatented lode mining claims in Lemhi County, Idaho covering\napproximately 1,710 acres.\nAs of the dates presented, mineral properties consisted of the following:\nApril 30, 2024 April 30, 2023\nCK Gold Project $ 3,091,738 $ 3,091,738\nKeystone Project 1,028,885 1,028,885\nChallis Gold Project 10,249,632 10,249,632\nTotal $ 14,370,255 $ 14,370,255\nNOTE 5 — PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nAs of the dates presented, property consisted of the following:\nApril 30, 2024 April 30, 2023\nSite costs $ 203,320 $ 203,320\nLand 352,718 352,718\nComputer equipment 3,766 7,265\nVehicle 39,493 39,493\nTotal 599,297 602,796\nLess: accumulated depreciation (141,190) (111,871)\nTotal $ 458,107 $ 490,925\nFor the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, depreciation expense amounted to $32,818 and $36,505, respectively.\nF-12\nU.S. GOLD CORP.

The initial term of the lease was for a two-year period from May 2021 to\nMay 2023 starting with a monthly base rent of $1,667. On January 30, 2023, the Company entered into a first lease amendment effective as of May 1, 2023, to extend this lease\nfor a period of one year expiring April 30, 2024. On January 11, 2024, the Company entered into a second lease amendment effective as of May 1, 2024, to extend this lease for\nanother period of one year expiring April 30, 2025, with an option to renew the lease for an additional one-year term. Under the second lease amendment, the monthly base rent\nincreased from $1,768 to $1,821 starting on May 1, 2024. The Company accounted for the lease extensions as lease modifications under ASC 842. On January 30, 2023, the\neffective date of the first lease amendment, the Company recorded an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and lease liability in the amount of $20,472 based on the net present\nvalue of lease payments discounted using an incremental borrowing rate of 8%. On January 11, 2024, the effective date of the second lease amendment, the Company recorded\nan adjustment to the right-of-use asset and lease liability in the amount of $20,936 based on the net present value of lease payments discounted using an incremental borrowing\nrate of 8%.\nOn September 1, 2021, the Company entered into a lease agreement for another facility in Cheyenne, Wyoming. The initial term of the lease was for a two-year period from\nSeptember 2021 through August 2023. On October 18, 2023, the Company entered into a lease amendment effective as of September 1, 2023, to extend the lease for a period of\ntwo years expiring August 31, 2025. The Company will not have an option to renew the lease past August 31, 2025, unless agreed to by the lessor and the Company. Pursuant to\nthe lease amendment, the monthly base rent increased to $3,265. On September 1, 2023, the effective date of the amendment, the Company recorded an adjustment to the right-\nof-use asset and lease liability in the amount of $72,672 based on the net present value of lease payments discounted using an incremental borrowing rate of 8%.\nDuring the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, lease expense of approximately $59,000 and $56,000, respectively, was included in general and administrative expenses as\nreflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nRight-of- use assets are summarized below:\nApril 30, 2024 April 30, 2023\nOperating leases $ 70,331 $ 32,080\nOperating Lease liabilities are summarized below:\nApril 30, 2024 April 30, 2023\nOperating lease, current portion $ 57,486 $ 32,080\nOperating lease, long term portion 12,845 -\nTotal lease liability $ 70,331 $ 32,080\nF-13\nU.S. GOLD CORP.

On January 7, 2022, the Company and the\ndirector mutually agreed to extend the term of the agreement for an additional 12 months under the same terms as the January 2021 agreement (the “January 2022 Extension”).\nIn consideration for the services provided pursuant to the January 2022 Extension, the director was paid an annual fee of $86,000 consisting of shares of the Company’s\ncommon stock with a value of $50,000, paid within five days of the effective date of the January 2022 Extension, and cash payments of $36,000, paid in increments of $3,000\nper month. In January 2022, and in connection with the January 2022 Extension, the Company issued 5,814 shares of common stock to the director. Effective December 31,\n2022, the director resigned from the Board. Accordingly, the Company also issued 7,927 shares of common stock in connection with vested RSUs on the date of resignation\n(see Note 10). During the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company paid consulting fees in cash of $0 and $24,000, respectively.\nOn March 10, 2021, the Company entered into a one-year consulting agreement (the “March 2021 Agreement”) with an individual who subsequently was appointed as a\ndirector of the Company on May 18, 2022, to provide services related to investor and strategic introductions for potential mergers and acquisitions and other potential and\nstrategic relationships to add shareholder value. On March 10, 2022, the Company and the director mutually agreed to extend the March 2021 Agreement for an additional 12\nmonths (the “March 2022 Extension”). On March 10, 2023, the Company and the director further extended the March 2021 Agreement for another 12 months (the “March 2023\nExtension”). The terms of the March 2022 Extension and the March 2023 Extension remain the same as stipulated in the March 2021 Agreement. In consideration for the\nservices provided pursuant to the March 2022 Extension and the March 2023 Extension, the director was paid an annual fee of $250,000 consisting of shares of the Company’s\ncommon stock with a value of $130,000 paid within five days of the effective date of the applicable extension, and cash payments of $120,000, paid in increments of $10,000\nper month. In April 2022 and March 2023, the Company issued 14,286 shares and 33,419 shares of common stock pursuant to March 2022 Extension and the March 2023\nExtension, respectively, to the director. The Company paid consulting fees to such director of $100,000 and $120,000 in cash during the year ended April 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. Additionally, as of April 30, 2024, the Company recorded accounts payable and accrued expenses totaling $58,977 due to such director and was included in\naccounts payable and accrued liabilities.\nF-14\nU.S. GOLD CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAPRIL 30, 2024\nNOTE 9 — WARRANT LIABILITY\nAs of April 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s warrant liabilities were valued at $3,916,900 and $4,230,850, respectively. Under the guidance in ASC 815-40, certain warrants\ndo not meet the criteria for equity treatment. These warrants include a clause whereby the warrant holder may be entitled to receive a net cash settlement upon the completion\nof a “fundamental transaction.” A fundamental transaction, as defined in the warrants, includes (a) any merger or consolidation by and between the Company and another\nPerson, (b) the sale or other disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of its assets, (c) the completion of any tender offer or exchange offer pursuant to which the\nholders of greater than 50% of the Company’s outstanding common stock has agreed to tender or exchange their securities, and (d) the consummation of a stock purchase\nagreement or other business combination whereby another Person acquires more than 50% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company. In the event of a\nfundamental transaction, the holder of the warrant has the right to require that the Company purchase the warrant from the holder by paying the holder an amount of cash equal\nto a valuation based on the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model reflecting an expected volatility equal to the greater of 100% or the 100-day volatility as of the trading day\nimmediately following the public announcement of the applicable fundamental transaction. This volatility input precludes the Company from applying equity accounting as the\nwarrant holder could receive a net cash settlement value that is greater than a holder of the Company’s common stock. Accordingly, the Company has concluded that liability\naccounting is required.\nAs such, these warrants are recorded at fair value as of each reporting date with the change in fair value reported within other income in the accompanying consolidated\nstatements of operations as “Change in fair value of warrant liability” until the warrants are exercised, expired or other facts and circumstances lead the warrant liability to be\nreclassified to stockholders’ equity. The Company utilized a Monte Carlo Simulation model to estimate the fair values of the April 2023 and March 2022 warrants, which\nincorporates significant inputs that are not observable in the market, and thus represents a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820. The unobservable inputs utilized for\nmeasuring the fair value of the contingent consideration reflect management’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the\ncontingent consideration.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAPRIL 30, 2024\nNOTE 13 — INCOME TAX\nThe deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are summarized as follows:\nDeferred tax assets: April 30, 2024 April 30, 2023\nNet operating loss carryover $ 12,317,000 $ 11,599,000\nStock-based compensation 948,000 866,000\nExploration cost 386,000 -\nAccrued remediation costs 22,000 35,000\nOther 15,000 7,000\nSubtotal 13,688,000 12,507,000\nLess: valuation allowance (11,949,000) (10,774,000)\nTotal deferred tax assets $ 1,739,000 $ 1,733,000\nDeferred tax liabilities: April 30, 2024 April 30, 2023\nAcquired mineral rights in excess of tax basis in a tax-free merger $ (2,152,000) $ (2,152,000)\nOther (17,000) (11,000)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities $ (2,169,000) $ (2,163,000)\nNet deferred tax assets (liabilities) $ (430,000) $ (430,000)\nThe Company has a net operating loss carryforward for federal tax purposes totaling approximately $58.6 million at April 30, 2024. Approximately $11.3 million expires\nbetween the years 2029 and 2038, with approximately $47.3 million net operating losses incurred after December 31, 2017 that do not expire and can be utilized to offset up to\n80% of future taxable income. As of April 30, 2023, the Company had identified certain adjustments that were required to past tax return filings, including those related to\ncapitalized exploration expenses and share-based compensation. These adjustments were made to the Company’s net operating loss carryforward in the federal tax return for the\nyear ended April 30, 2023. These adjustments are reflected in the carryforward amounts disclosed above. The Company does not have any state net operating loss\ncarryforwards. The Company primarily operates in the states of Wyoming and Nevada which do not impose a corporate income tax. Any minor apportionment that may occur\nto any other taxable state will be immaterial to current and future operations of the Company. Therefore, the effective state tax rate used in the calculation of the Company’s\ndeferred tax is 0%.\nOn August 10, 2020, the Company acquired mineral rights totaling $10,249,632 (see Note 4 – Mineral Rights) in a tax-free reorganization pursuant to IRC Section 368. The\nCompany recorded the assets at fair value for financial reporting purposes and retained the seller’s tax basis which was zero resulting in a deferred tax liability on the business\ncombination date. As required by ASC 740, the Company has recognized the deferred tax impact of acquiring the mineral rights asset in this transaction, with the amount paid\nexceeding the tax basis of the asset on the acquisition date. A portion of the deferred tax liability is offset by deferred tax assets recognized by the Company. The remaining\nportion of the deferred tax liability is not offset by deferred tax assets due to the indefinite life of the mineral rights. As of April 30, 2024, the Company’s remaining net deferred\ntax assets have been offset with a full valuation allowance as management is unable to conclude that it is not more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will expire\nunrealized.\nThe differences between the provision (benefit) for federal income taxes and federal income taxes computed using the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% were as follows:\nYears Ended April 30,\n2024 2023\nFederal income tax provision (benefit) based on statutory rate $ (1,448,000) 21.0% $ (1,599,000) 21.0%\nState income tax provision (benefit), net of federal taxes — —% — —%\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities (66,000) 1.0% (273,000) 3.6%\nChange in prior year estimate (14,000) 0.2% (255,000) 3.4%\nPrior year deferred tax adjustment — —% 1,804,000 (23.7)%\nFederal net operating loss expiration 335,000 (4.9)% — —%\nOther nondeductible expenses 18,000 (0.3)% 42,000 (0.6)%\nIncrease (decrease) in valuation allowance 1,175,000 (17.0)% 281,000 (3.7)%\nTotal tax provision (benefit) on income (loss) $ — —% $ — —%\nThe Company has assessed its tax positions and has determined that it has not taken a position that would give rise to an unrecognized tax liability being reported. In the event\nthat the Company is assessed penalties and/or interest, penalties will be charged to other operating expenses and interest will be charged to interest expense.\nThe Company operates exclusively in the United States and in various state jurisdictions, primarily the states of Wyoming and Nevada. For both federal and state income tax\npurposes, the Company’s fiscal 2021 through 2024 tax years remain open for examination by the tax authorities under the general three-year statute of limitations. However,\ndue to the Company’s federal net operating loss carryforward, the Internal Revenue Service has the ability to adjust this carryforward even if the losses were incurred in years\nthat would otherwise be closed under the statute of limitations.\nF-23\nItem 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone.\nItem 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”),\nmeans controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits\nunder the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Management recognizes that any\ncontrols and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its\njudgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nOur principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of April 30, 2024. Disclosure controls and\nprocedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits\nunder the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including our principal executive and principal financial officer, as appropriate to\nallow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures were effective, at the reasonable assurance level, in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under\nthe Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (“ICFR”). Our internal control system was designed to, in\ngeneral, provide reasonable assurance to our management and our Board regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements, but because of its\ninherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are\nsubject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of April 30,\n2024. The framework used by management in making that assessment was the criteria set forth in the document entitled “2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework” issued\nby the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, (“COSO”). Based on that assessment, management concluded that, during the period covered by\nthis report, such internal controls and procedures were effective as of April 30, 2024.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement’s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm as we are a smaller reporting company and are not required to provide the report.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\nAdoption or Termination of Insider Trading Arrangements and Policies\nThe Company has adopted an insider trading policy, which is effective as of June 14, 2021.\nItem 9C.
