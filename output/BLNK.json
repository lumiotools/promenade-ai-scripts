(Nasdaq: BLNK) (“Blink” or the “Company”), a leading manufacturer, owner, operator, and provider of electric vehicle (EV) charging equipment and services, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nThe following top-line highlights are in thousands of dollars and preliminary.\n\n**Three Months Ended** | **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 30,** | **September 30,**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **% Change** | **2024** | **2023** | **% Change**  \nProduct Revenues | $ | 13,448 | $ | 35,059 | (61.6 | )% | $ | 64,538 | $ | 76,035 | (15.1 | )%  \nService Revenues (2) | 8,754 | 6,735 | 30.0 | % | 24,988 | 18,491 | 35.1 | %  \nOther Revenues (3) | 2,985 | 1,583 | 88.6 | % | 6,491 | 3,361 | 93.1 | %  \nTotal Revenues | $ | 25,187 | $ | 43,377 | (41.9 | )% | $ | 96,017 | $ | 97,887 | (1.9 | )%  \n  \n(1)  _Among comparative full-service publicly traded charging providers headquartered in the U.S._ (2)  _Service Revenues consist of charging service revenues, network fees, and car-sharing service revenues._ (3)  _Other Revenues consist of warranty fees, grants and rebates, and other revenues._ “Blink delivered service revenue growth of 30% in the third quarter, primarily driven by the expansion of our global network of Blink-owned chargers and the corresponding demand for charging and networked services. We also continued to strengthen our business by reducing our year-to-date cash burn by $45 million, or 50%, excluding financing activities, and reducing our total year-to-date operating expenses by 24%. As we expected, overall product revenues decreased in the quarter, in part related to significantly stronger charger sales to automotive dealerships in 2023. However, our third quarter margin of 36%, demonstrates our ability to generate more profitable and sustainable revenue by shifting to our traditional sales verticals and leveraging our vertically integrated model.\n\n“As we move through the balance of the year, we’re focused on continuing the momentum we’ve built around our service offerings and on increasing our reach as the third largest charging network in the U.S. and a leading charging provider in Europe. We have continued to expand our Blink-owned network, with 28% growth in owned and operated units compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n\n“We remain focused on our strategic priorities and have restructured our operations and optimized our processes to ensure that Blink is resilient in challenging market conditions. During the quarter, as previously communicated, we took additional improvement actions that will be completed by first quarter of 2025.\n\n“The EV charging industry is still in its early stages, and with our product and service offerings, our network and our flexible business models designed to meet the unique needs of our customers, we’re energized by the opportunities in our pipeline. As EV adoption continues to expand, we remain committed to building the global infrastructure to enable a seamless transition to electric transportation alternatives.” **said** **Brendan Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer of Blink Charging.**\n\n**Company Targets**\n\nFor the full year 2024, Blink is revising its target revenues to between $125 million and $135 million.

publicly reports its financial information in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”). To facilitate external analysis of the Company’s operating performance, Blink Charging also presents financial information that is considered “non-GAAP financial measures” under Regulation G and related reporting requirements promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, Net Income (Loss) or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different than those presented by other companies, including Blink Charging’s competitors. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and are therefore considered non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation tables are presented above.\n\nEBITDA is defined as earnings (loss) attributable to Blink Charging before interest income (expense), provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Blink Charging believes EBITDA is useful to its management, securities analysts, and investors in evaluating operating performance because it is one of the primary measures used to evaluate the economic productivity of the Company’s operations, including its ability to obtain and maintain its customers, its ability to operate its business effectively, the efficiency of its employees and the profitability associated with their performance. It also helps Blink Charging’s management, securities analysts, and investors to meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of the Company’s operations from period to period on a consistent basis by removing the impact of its merger and acquisition expenses, financing transactions, and the depreciation and amortization impact of capital investments from its operating results.\n\nThe Company also believes that Adjusted EBITDA, defined as EBITDA adjusted for non-recurring items such as stock-based compensation, acquisition related costs, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, estimated loss related to sale of underperforming assets of subsidiary, change in fair value related to consideration payable, loss on extinguishment of notes payable and one-time non-recurring expense, is useful to securities analysts and investors to evaluate the Company’s core operating results and financial performance because it excludes items that are significant non-cash or non-recurring expenses reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nOur definition of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS may differ from other companies reporting similarly named measures. These measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as Net Loss, and Diluted Earnings per Share.\n\n**About Blink Charging**\n\nBlink Charging Co.

(Nasdaq: BLNK)\n(“Blink” or the “Company”), a leading manufacturer, owner, operator, and provider of electric\nvehicle (EV) charging equipment and services, today announced financial results for the\nthird quarter ended September 30, 2024.\nThe following top-line highlights are in thousands of dollars and preliminary.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\nProduct Revenues $ 13,448 $ 35,059 (61.6)% $ 64,538 $ 76,035 (15.1)%\nService Revenues (2) 8,754 6,735 30.0% 24,988 18,491 35.1%\nOther Revenues (3) 2,985 1,583 88.6% 6,491 3,361 93.1%\nTotal Revenues $ 25,187 $ 43,377 (41.9)% $ 96,017 $ 97,887 (1.9)%\n(1) Among comparative full-service publicly traded charging providers headquartered in\nthe U.S.\n(2) Service Revenues consist of charging service revenues, network fees, and car-\nsharing service revenues.\n(3) Other Revenues consist of warranty fees, grants and rebates, and other revenues.\n“Blink delivered service revenue growth of 30% in the third quarter, primarily driven by the\nexpansion of our global network of Blink-owned chargers and the corresponding demand for\ncharging and networked services. We also continued to strengthen our business by reducing\nour year-to-date cash burn by $45 million, or 50%, excluding financing activities, and\nreducing our total year-to-date operating expenses by 24%. As we expected, overall product\nrevenues decreased in the quarter, in part related to significantly stronger charger sales to\nautomotive dealerships in 2023. However, our third quarter margin of 36%, demonstrates\nour ability to generate more profitable and sustainable revenue by shifting to our traditional\nsales verticals and leveraging our vertically integrated model.\n“As we move through the balance of the year, we’re focused on continuing the momentum\nwe’ve built around our service offerings and on increasing our reach as the third largest\ncharging network in the U.S. and a leading charging provider in Europe. We have continued\nto expand our Blink-owned network, with 28% growth in owned and operated units\ncompared to the third quarter of 2023.\n“We remain focused on our strategic priorities and have restructured our operations and\noptimized our processes to ensure that Blink is resilient in challenging market conditions.\nDuring the quarter, as previously communicated, we took additional improvement actions\nthat will be completed by first quarter of 2025.\n“The EV charging industry is still in its early stages, and with our product and service\nofferings, our network and our flexible business models designed to meet the unique needs\nof our customers, we’re energized by the opportunities in our pipeline. As EV adoption\ncontinues to expand, we remain committed to building the global infrastructure to enable a\nseamless transition to electric transportation alternatives.” said Brendan Jones, President\nand Chief Executive Officer of Blink Charging.\nCompany Targets\nFor the full year 2024, Blink is revising its target revenues to between $125 million and $135\nmillion.

with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”). To facilitate\nexternal analysis of the Company’s operating performance, Blink Charging also presents\nfinancial information that is considered “non-GAAP financial measures” under Regulation G\nand related reporting requirements promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission. Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a\nsubstitute for, or superior to, Net Income (Loss) or other measures of financial performance\nprepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different than those presented by other\ncompanies, including Blink Charging’s competitors. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not\nperformance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and are therefore considered\nnon-GAAP measures. Reconciliation tables are presented above.\nEBITDA is defined as earnings (loss) attributable to Blink Charging before interest income\n(expense), provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Blink Charging\nbelieves EBITDA is useful to its management, securities analysts, and investors in\nevaluating operating performance because it is one of the primary measures used to\nevaluate the economic productivity of the Company’s operations, including its ability to\nobtain and maintain its customers, its ability to operate its business effectively, the efficiency\nof its employees and the profitability associated with their performance. It also helps Blink\nCharging’s management, securities analysts, and investors to meaningfully evaluate and\ncompare the results of the Company’s operations from period to period on a consistent basis\nby removing the impact of its merger and acquisition expenses, financing transactions, and\nthe depreciation and amortization impact of capital investments from its operating results.\nThe Company also believes that Adjusted EBITDA, defined as EBITDA adjusted for non-\nrecurring items such as stock-based compensation, acquisition related costs, impairment of\ngoodwill and intangible assets, estimated loss related to sale of underperforming assets of\nsubsidiary, change in fair value related to consideration payable, loss on extinguishment of\nnotes payable and one-time non-recurring expense, is useful to securities analysts and\ninvestors to evaluate the Company’s core operating results and financial performance\nbecause it excludes items that are significant non-cash or non-recurring expenses reflected\nin the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nOur definition of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS may differ from other companies\nreporting similarly named measures. These measures should be considered in addition to,\nand not as a substitute for, or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared\nin accordance with GAAP, such as Net Loss, and Diluted Earnings per Share.\nAbout Blink Charging\nBlink Charging Co.
