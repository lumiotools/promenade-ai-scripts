(NASDAQ: GDYN) (Grid Dynamics), a leading provider of technology consulting, platform and product engineering, AI, and digital engagement services, today announces the launch of its [Composable Commerce Starter Kit on Azure](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/consulting-services/griddynamics1591098950826.composable_commerce_starter_kit_with_commercetools?search=composable%20commerce&page=1). This starter kit includes a minimum viable product (MVP) deployable in months, and empowers businesses to deliver superior digital commerce experiences with rapid time-to-value. Clients can leverage best-of-breed commerce components from different third-party vendors, and compose them with commercetools on Microsoft Azure into a flexible custom digital platform built for the future of commerce.\n\nB2C and B2B businesses transitioning from monolithic commerce solutions to MACH (Microservices, API-first, Cloud-native, and Headless) architectures face significant challenges in their digital transformation journeys. Traditional commerce platforms, while comprehensive, are often rigid and outdated, and lack the flexibility and modern features needed to support today’s digital commerce needs. Seamlessly integrating composable commerce packaged business capabilities (e.g. core commerce, retail search, content management, digital asset management, order management, etc.) is technically challenging. To address this challenge, Grid Dynamics created the Composable Commerce Starter Kit on Azure, allowing customers to rapidly deploy an extensible MACH-compliant architecture in Microsoft Azure centered on commercetools’ core commerce platform along with pre-built connectors for 3rd party ISVs that provide other commerce PBCs (Packaged Business Capabilities), such as retail search, content management, payments, and order management, among others. The starter kit embraces MACH architecture principles, offering flexibility to integrate with various modular components, unify customer interactions, streamline digital commerce processes, and provide personalized experiences. These capabilities are delivered on the Microsoft Azure Cloud, which allows clients to leverage its powerful ecosystem of cutting-edge AI technologies to further transform their business and the experiences they bring to customers.\n\n“By enabling businesses to replace outdated legacy systems with modern, composable architectures, our Composable Commerce Starter Kit on Azure offers a proven, scalable, digital platform centered on the industry-leading core commerce capabilities of commercetools with the power, scale, and reliability of Microsoft Azure. The starter kit’s API-first approach, open architecture, and superior compatibility with 3rd party integrations provides a future proof design and unlocks modern, AI-driven customer experiences for our clients. We believe this will meet the sophisticated demands of today’s customers and also drive operational efficiency and business value,” said Valery Zelixion, Senior Vice President, Global Head of Sales, Account Management and Practice Development at Grid Dynamics. \n\n“Digital commerce transformation and platform modernization following the MACH principles embraced in this kind of composable commerce architecture allows Microsoft retail, consumer packaged goods, and other B2C/B2B industry customers to unlock the power and flexibility of Microsoft Cloud for Retail. That includes taking advantage of cutting-edge AI-powered solutions built on Azure,” said Willayna Banner, Head of Growth & Innovation Product Engineering for Retail, CPG & Agriculture, Cloud + AI Engineering at Microsoft.\n\n“We are proud to partner with Grid Dynamics and Microsoft Azure to make composable commerce available to even more businesses. Together, we share the mission to enable businesses to provide best-in-class, flexible and scalable commerce experiences,” said Christopher Holley, Global Director, Technology Partnership at commercetools. \n\nVisit [this page](https://www.griddynamics.com/solutions/commercetools-composable-commerce-azure-starter-kit) to learn more about this Composable Commerce Starter Kit on Azure.

Fusing technical vision with business acumen, we solve the most pressing technical challenges and enable positive business outcomes for enterprise companies undergoing business transformation. A key differentiator for Grid Dynamics is our 8 years of experience and leadership in [enterprise AI](https://www.griddynamics.com/solutions/ai), supported by profound expertise and ongoing investment in [data](https://www.griddynamics.com/solutions/big-data), [analytics](https://www.griddynamics.com/solutions/analytical-data-platform), [application modernization](https://www.griddynamics.com/solutions/application-modernization), [cloud & DevOps](https://www.griddynamics.com/solutions/cloud-devops), and [customer experience](https://www.griddynamics.com/solutions/digital-experience). Founded in 2006, Grid Dynamics is headquartered in Silicon Valley with offices across the Americas, Europe, and India. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis communication contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that are not historical facts, and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results of Grid Dynamics to differ materially from those expected and projected. Grid Dynamics intends such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and includes this statement, in part, for the purposes of complying with such safe harbor provisions. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the words “believes,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “may,” “will,” “potential,” “projects,” “predicts,” “continue,” or “should,” or, in each case, their negative or other variations or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements about the closing of the offering. Most of the factors that could cause actual results of Grid Dynamics to differ materially from those expected and projected are outside Grid Dynamics’s control and are difficult to predict. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to: (i) Grid Dynamics has a relatively short operating history and operates in a rapidly evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate future prospects and may increase the risk that it will not continue to be successful and may adversely impact our stock price; (ii) Grid Dynamics may be unable to effectively manage its growth or achieve anticipated growth, particularly as it expands into new geographies, which could place significant strain on Grid Dynamics’ management personnel, systems and resources; (iii) Grid Dynamics’ revenues are highly dependent on a limited number of clients and industries that are affected by seasonal trends, and any decrease in demand for outsourced services in these industries may reduce Grid Dynamics’ revenues and adversely affect Grid Dynamics’ business, financial condition and results of operations; (iv) macroeconomic conditions, inflationary pressures, and the geopolitical climate, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, have and may continue to materially adversely affect our stock price, business operations, overall financial performance and growth prospects; (v) Grid Dynamics’ revenues are highly dependent on clients primarily located in the United States, and any economic downturn in the United States or in other parts of the world, including Europe or disruptions in the credit markets may have a material adverse effect on Grid Dynamics’ business, financial condition and results of operations; (vi) Grid Dynamics faces intense and increasing competition; (vii) Grid Dynamics’ failure to successfully attract, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel could materially adversely affect Grid Dynamics’ business, financial condition and results of operations; (viii) failure to adapt to rapidly changing technologies, methodologies and evolving industry standards may have a material adverse effect on Grid Dynamics’ business, financial condition and results of operations; (ix) failure to successfully deliver contracted services or causing disruptions to clients’ businesses may have a material adverse effect on Grid Dynamics’ reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations; (x) risks and costs related to acquiring and integrating other companies; and (xi) other risks and uncertainties indicated in Grid Dynamics filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Grid Dynamics cautions that the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive. Grid Dynamics cautions readers not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Grid Dynamics does not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in its expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. Further information about factors that could materially affect Grid Dynamics, including its results of operations and financial condition, is set forth under the “Risk Factors” section of Grid Dynamic’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed October 31, 2024 and in other periodic filings Grid Dynamics makes with the SEC.\n\n**Contact** Grid Dynamics Investor Relations: investorrelations@griddynamics.com\n\n[](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.griddynamics.com%2Fpress-releases%2Fpublic-offering-pricing-announcement-2024 \"Facebook\")[](https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.griddynamics.com%2Fpress-releases%2Fpublic-offering-pricing-announcement-2024 \"Linkedin\")[](https://www.griddynamics.com/press-releases/public-offering-pricing-announcement-2024 \"Email\")[](https://www.griddynamics.com/press-releases/public-offering-pricing-announcement-2024 \"Print\")\n\n##### IR Contact\n\nFor investor inquiries, please send us an email at investorrelations@griddynamics.com\n\n[ GET IN TOUCH ](/contact)\n\n##### Quick links\n\n##### E-mail alerts\n\n![check](https://cdnwp.griddynamics.com/wp-content/themes/griddynamics/assets/img/check.svg) News \n\n![check](https://cdnwp.griddynamics.com/wp-content/themes/griddynamics/assets/img/check.svg) Events/quarterly results \n\n![check](https://cdnwp.griddynamics.com/wp-content/themes/griddynamics/assets/img/check.svg) Stock quotes \n\n![check](https://cdnwp.griddynamics.com/wp-content/themes/griddynamics/assets/img/check.svg) SEC filings \n\nYour email\n\nSubscribe\n\n## Thank you!\n\nYou have been successfully subscribed to email alerts with regular Grid Dynamics investor relations updates.

Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to: (i) Grid Dynamics has a relatively short operating history and operates in a rapidly evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate future prospects and may increase the risk that it will not continue to be successful and may adversely impact our stock price; (ii) Grid Dynamics may be unable to effectively manage its growth or achieve anticipated growth, particularly as it expands into new geographies, which could place significant strain on Grid Dynamics’ management personnel, systems and resources; (iii) Grid Dynamics’ revenues are highly dependent on a limited number of clients and industries that are affected by seasonal trends, and any decrease in demand for outsourced services in these industries may reduce Grid Dynamics’ revenues and adversely affect Grid Dynamics’ business, financial condition and results of operations; (iv) macroeconomic conditions, inflationary pressures, and the geopolitical climate, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, have and may continue to materially adversely affect our stock price, business operations, overall financial performance and growth prospects; (v) Grid Dynamics’ revenues are highly dependent on clients primarily located in the United States, and any economic downturn in the United States or in other parts of the world, including Europe or disruptions in the credit markets may have a material adverse effect on Grid Dynamics’ business, financial condition and results of operations; (vi) Grid Dynamics faces intense and increasing competition; (vii) Grid Dynamics’ failure to successfully attract, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel could materially adversely affect Grid Dynamics’ business, financial condition and results of operations; (viii) failure to adapt to rapidly changing technologies, methodologies and evolving industry standards may have a material adverse effect on Grid Dynamics’ business, financial condition and results of operations; (ix) failure to successfully deliver contracted services or causing disruptions to clients’ businesses may have a material adverse effect on Grid Dynamics’ reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations; (x) risks and costs related to acquiring and integrating other companies; and (xi) other risks and uncertainties indicated in Grid Dynamics filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Grid Dynamics cautions that the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive. Grid Dynamics cautions readers not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Grid Dynamics does not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in its expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. Further information about factors that could materially affect Grid Dynamics, including its results of operations and financial condition, is set forth under the “Risk Factors” section of Grid Dynamic’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed October 31, 2024 and in other periodic filings Grid Dynamics makes with the SEC.\n\n**Contact** Grid Dynamics Investor Relations: investorrelations@griddynamics.com\n\n[](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.griddynamics.com%2Fpress-releases%2Fgrid-dynamics-announces-proposed-public-offering \"Facebook\")[](https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.griddynamics.com%2Fpress-releases%2Fgrid-dynamics-announces-proposed-public-offering \"Linkedin\")[](https://www.griddynamics.com/press-releases/grid-dynamics-announces-proposed-public-offering \"Email\")[](https://www.griddynamics.com/press-releases/grid-dynamics-announces-proposed-public-offering \"Print\")\n\n##### IR Contact\n\nFor investor inquiries, please send us an email at investorrelations@griddynamics.com\n\n[ GET IN TOUCH ](/contact)\n\n##### Quick links\n\n##### E-mail alerts\n\n![check](https://cdnwp.griddynamics.com/wp-content/themes/griddynamics/assets/img/check.svg) News \n\n![check](https://cdnwp.griddynamics.com/wp-content/themes/griddynamics/assets/img/check.svg) Events/quarterly results \n\n![check](https://cdnwp.griddynamics.com/wp-content/themes/griddynamics/assets/img/check.svg) Stock quotes \n\n![check](https://cdnwp.griddynamics.com/wp-content/themes/griddynamics/assets/img/check.svg) SEC filings \n\nYour email\n\nSubscribe\n\n## Thank you!\n\nYou have been successfully subscribed to email alerts with regular Grid Dynamics investor relations updates.

October 31, 2024 – Grid Dynamics Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: GDYN) (“Grid Dynamics” or the “Company”), a leader in enterprise-level digital transformation, today announced results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nWe are very pleased to report third quarter 2024 revenues of $87.4 million that was higher than our outlook range of $84.0 million to $86.0 million that we provided in August 2024. Our Retail and Technology, Media and Telecom (“TMT”) verticals were the two largest verticals during the third quarter of 2024 with 34.1% and 27.7% of our revenues, respectively. Our Finance vertical, representing 16.2% of our third quarter revenues, grew 12.7% on a sequential basis and 94.0% on a year-over-year basis. Strength in the Financial vertical came from our finance technology and insurance customers. Our CPG and Manufacturing vertical, representing 11.2% of our third quarter revenues, remained flat on a sequential basis. \n\n“The third quarter was another milestone in the Company’s history. We reported record revenues and profitability, scaled partnership influenced revenues, and set a new record with the highest number of billable engineers. Customers, both existing and new, are contributing to our strong results, which is a testament to our technology differentiation and delivery excellence. The strong demand we witnessed in the third quarter was built on steady improvements in the first half of the year. \n\nI am thrilled to welcome JUXT and Mobile Computing to Grid Dynamics. Each company brings in a unique set of capabilities. UK-based JUXT elevates our industry expertise in banking and financial services, and Argentina-based Mobile Computing enhances our engineering capabilities and adds premier clients in Latin America. \n\nOur AI initiatives continue to gain significant traction across our customer base. Our pipeline of AI opportunities has grown to more than 100, representing a 50% increase from last quarter. This growth reflects the increasing enterprise readiness to move beyond experimentation to implementation of AI solutions at scale. \n\nWe approach the end of 2024 with strong business momentum and confident of the foundations of the Company as we enter 2025,” said Leonard Livschitz, CEO.\n\n**Third Quarter of 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Total revenues were $87.4 million, an increase of 5.3% on a sequential basis and 12.9% on a year-over-year basis.\n  * GAAP gross profit was $32.7 million, or 37.4% of revenues, in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $28.2 million, or 36.4% of revenues, in the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP gross profit was $33.3 million, or 38.0% of revenues, in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $28.7 million, or 37.0% of revenues, in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders was $4.3 million, or $0.05 per share, based on 78.8 million diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $0.7 million, or $0.01 per share, based on 77.3 million diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding in the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP net income was $8.1 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, based on 78.8 million diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $5.9 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, based on 77.3 million diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Non-GAAP EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, other income and expenses, fair value adjustments, stock-based compensation, transaction and transformation-related costs, restructuring costs as well as geographic reorganization expenses), a non-GAAP metric, was $14.8 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $10.7 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\nSee “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Information” below for a discussion of our non-GAAP measures.\n\n**Cash Flow and Other Metrics**\n\n  * Cash provided by operating activities was $23.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $33.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. \n  * Cash and cash equivalents totaled $231.3 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $257.2 million as of December 31, 2023. \n  * Total headcount was 4,298 as of September 30, 2024, compared with 3,823 employees as of September 30, 2023.\n\n\n\n**Financial Outlook**\n\n  * The Company expects revenue in the fourth quarter of 2024 to be in the range of $95.0 million to $97.0 million. \n  * Non-GAAP EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2024 is expected to be between $13.5 million and $15.5 million.\n  * For the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect our basic share count to be in the 77.0 – 78.0 million range and diluted share count to be in the 80.0 – 81.0 million range. \n\n\n\nGrid Dynamics is not able, at this time, to provide GAAP targets for net income/(loss) for the fourth quarter of 2024 because of the difficulty of estimating certain items excluded from Non-GAAP EBITDA that cannot be reasonably predicted, such as interest income, taxes, other income/(expenses), fair-value adjustments, geographic reorganization expenses, restructuring expenses, transaction-related costs and charges related to stock-based compensation expense. The effect of these excluded items may be significant.\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nGrid Dynamics will host a video conference call at 4:30 p.m. ET on Thursday, October 31, 2024 to discuss its third quarter financial results. Investors and other interested parties can access the call in the following ways: A webcast of the video conference call can be accessed on the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at [https://ir.griddynamics.com](https://ir.griddynamics.com/)/.\n\nA replay will also be available after the call at [https://ir.griddynamics.com](https://ir.griddynamics.com/)/ with the passcode $Q3@2024.\n\n**About Grid Dynamics**\n\nGrid Dynamics (Nasdaq: GDYN) is a digital-native technology services provider that accelerates growth and bolsters competitive advantage for Fortune 1000 companies.

Follow us on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/grid-dynamics/).\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo supplement the financial measures presented in Grid Dynamics press release in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), the Company also presents Non-GAAP measures of financial performance.\n\nA “non-GAAP financial measure” refers to a numerical measure of Grid Dynamics historical or future financial performance or financial position that is included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Grid Dynamics provides certain non-GAAP measures as additional information relating to its operating results as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a measure of liquidity and profitability.\n\nGrid Dynamics has included these non-GAAP financial measures because they are financial measures used by Grid Dynamics’ management to evaluate Grid Dynamics’ core operating performance and trends, to make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and new investments and are among the factors analyzed in making performance-based compensation decisions for key personnel.\n\nGrid Dynamics believes the use of non-GAAP financial measures, as a supplement to GAAP measures, is useful to investors in that they eliminate items that are either not part of core operations or do not require a cash outlay, such as stock-based compensation expense. Grid Dynamics believes these non-GAAP measures provide investors and other users of its financial information consistency and comparability with its past financial performance and facilitate period to period comparisons of operations. Grid Dynamics believes these non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating its operating performance compared to that of other companies in its industry, as they generally eliminate the effects of certain items that may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.\n\nThere are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Further, these measures may differ from the non-GAAP information, even where similarly titled, used by other companies and therefore should not be used to compare our performance to that of other companies. Grid Dynamics compensates for these limitations by providing investors and other users of its financial information a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the related GAAP financial measures. Grid Dynamics encourages investors and others to review its financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view its non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures. Please see the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures attached to this release.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis communication contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are not historical facts, and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results of Grid Dynamics to differ materially from those expected and projected. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the words “believes,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “may,” “will,” “potential,” “projects,” “predicts,” “continue,” or “should,” or, in each case, their negative or other variations or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, the quotations of management, the section titled “Financial Outlook,” and statements concerning Grid Dynamics’s expectations with respect to future performance, particularly in light of the macroeconomic environment and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, as well as its GigaCube strategy.\n\nThese forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the expected results. Most of these factors are outside Grid Dynamics’s control and are difficult to predict. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to: (i) Grid Dynamics has a relatively short operating history and operates in a rapidly evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate future prospects and may increase the risk that it will not continue to be successful and may adversely impact our stock price; (ii) Grid Dynamics may be unable to effectively manage its growth or achieve anticipated growth, particularly as it expands into new geographies, which could place significant strain on Grid Dynamics’ management personnel, systems and resources; (iii) Grid Dynamics’ revenues are highly dependent on a limited number of clients and industries that are affected by seasonal trends, and any decrease in demand for outsourced services in these industries may reduce Grid Dynamics’ revenues and adversely affect Grid Dynamics’ business, financial condition and results of operations; (iv) macroeconomic conditions, inflationary pressures, and the geopolitical climate, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, have and may continue to materially adversely affect our stock price, business operations, overall financial performance and growth prospects; (v) Grid Dynamics’ revenues are highly dependent on clients primarily located in the United States, and any economic downturn in the United States or in other parts of the world, including Europe or disruptions in the credit markets may have a material adverse effect on Grid Dynamics’ business, financial condition and results of operations; (vi) Grid Dynamics faces intense and increasing competition; (vii) Grid Dynamics’ failure to successfully attract, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel could materially adversely affect Grid Dynamics’ business, financial condition and results of operations; (viii) failure to adapt to rapidly changing technologies, methodologies and evolving industry standards may have a material adverse effect on Grid Dynamics’ business, financial condition and results of operations; (ix) failure to successfully deliver contracted services or causing disruptions to clients’ businesses may have a material adverse effect on Grid Dynamics’ reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations; (x) risks and costs related to acquiring and integrating other companies; and (xi) other risks and uncertainties indicated in Grid Dynamics filings with the SEC.\n\nGrid Dynamics cautions that the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive. Grid Dynamics cautions readers not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Grid Dynamics does not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in its expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. Further information about factors that could materially affect Grid Dynamics, including its results of operations and financial condition, is set forth under the “Risk Factors” section of the Company’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed October 31, 2024 and in other periodic filings Grid Dynamics makes with the SEC.\n\n**Contacts** Grid Dynamics Investor Relations:

Welcome to Grid Dynamics’ third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. I'm\nCary Savas, Director of Branding and Communications. At this time, our participants are in listen-only\nmode. Joining us on the call today are CEO Leonard Livschitz, CFO Anil Duradla, and COO Yury Grzlov.\nFollowing the prepared remarks we will open the call to your questions.\nPlease note that today's conference is being recorded. Before we begin, I would like to remind\neveryone that today’s discussion will contain forward-looking statements.This includes our business in\na financial outlook and the answers to some of your questions.Such statements are subject to the risks\nand uncertainty as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. During\nthis call, we will discuss certain non-Gap measures of our performance. Gap to non-Gap financial\nreconciliations and supplemental financial information are provided in the earnings press release and\nthe 8K filed with the SEC. You can find all the information I just described in the investor relations\nsection of our website.\nI now turn the call over to Leonard, our CEO.\nLeonard Livschitz, Chief Executive Officer:\nThank you, Cary. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today.\nGrid Dynamics reported another solid quarter as positive trends continued to favorably influence our\nbusiness. Our third quarter results were above our guidance range and exceeded wall-street\nexpectations, both on revenue and non-GAAP EBITDA. More importantly, our revenue and profitability\nwere the highest in the company’s history. Similar to the second quarter, we exited the third quarter\nwith a record billable engineering headcount. Customers, both existing and new, are contributing to\nour strong results, which is a testament to our technology differentiation and delivery excellence. The\naddition of Argentina-based Mobile Computing enhances our follow-the-sun capabilities and the\nacquisition of UK-based JUXT elevates our industry expertise in banking and financial services. With\nboth acquisitions, our teams have started working together and I expect them to generate immediate,\nscalable synergies starting in the fourth quarter.\nThere are many trends shaping the company, both in the fourth quarter of 2024 and in 2025, some\nnotable ones I will share with you today. As we exit 2024, our long-term targets around the company’s\ngrowth, profitability, and technical leadership remain unchanged.\nNow, coming to the demand environment. Similar to the first half of 2024, demand trends improved\nacross our customers. In the third quarter, we witnessed our customers funding key programs and\ninitiatives. At many of our customers, there is a sense of urgency to complete projects by the end of\nthe year. Numerous initiatives that were held back due to the economic cycle are being prioritized for\ncompletion. This is something we witnessed across a wide-range of customers and industries.\nIn many ways, the foundation of the third quarter demand trends were set up in the first half of the\nyear. If you recall from my last quarter commentary, I highlighted the first quarter was characterized by\ncustomers focusing on sharing their outlook and forecasts plans but not aggressively spending. In the\nsecond quarter, customers were more willing to release budgets and implement their plans. Bottom\nline, the positive demand environment that we witnessed in the third quarter was a result of steady\nimprovements over the past couple of quarters, and we expect it to continue into the fourth quarter\nand beyond.\nWe set a new record for partnership influenced revenues. Year to date, partnership revenue\ncontribution is 18% of the total revenue. Our focus on hyperscalers paid off, with three of the largest\nbeing in the top five for partnership revenue.\nAs I pointed out earlier, we are thrilled to welcome JUXT and Mobile Computing to Grid Dynamics. Each\ncompany brings in a unique set of capabilities. Founded in 2013, JUXT is known for delivering complex\nend-to-end solutions, from design and user experience, to deep functionality and ongoing managed\nservices. Their specializations in mission-critical platforms and products for leading banks and\nfinancial institutions make them a strategically important addition to Grid Dynamics, especially as\nglobal demand for reliable, scalable, future-proof data solutions continues to grow. Their focus on risk\nplatforms, structured products, equity derivatives, and financial reporting is highly complementary to\nour current offerings in financial services, which adds into our portfolio some of the world's largest\nbanks and financial institutions.\nThe acquisition of Mobile Computing expands Grid Dynamics’ global footprint and follow-the-sun\ndelivery model. Founded in 1998, Mobile Computing is recognized as a leader in digital transformation,\noffering a comprehensive suite of solutions spanning industries including manufacturing, CPG, and\nfinancial services. By adding this talented team in Argentina, our clients now have expanded options in\nthe Americas, complementing our established presence in the United States, Mexico, and Jamaica.\nDuring the last earnings call, I shared some insights around vendor consolidation across many of our\nclients. Over the past 12 months, customers have been scaling back on the number of IT vendors they\nwork with. During the third quarter, the majority of vendor consolidation efforts across customers were\ncompleted. Grid Dynamics' technology and operational excellence is highly valued, and this helped us\njoin a short list of strategic partners for those customers.\nNow, turning to our AI initiatives. I am pleased to report that our AI capabilities continue to gain\nsignificant traction across our customer base. We've substantially expanded our AI portfolio and now\nhave over 30 service offerings and solutions specifically targeting Fortune 500 companies across\nvarious industries. These solutions are designed to drive both top-line growth and bottom-line\nefficiency for our enterprise clients. On the revenue side, we're focused on innovative customer\nexperiences and enhanced marketing, pricing, and product decisions. On the cost side, our solutions\ncenter on efficiency improvements and enterprise knowledge management.\nWhat's particularly encouraging is the evolution we're seeing in our AI engagements. While previous\nquarters were dominated by POCs and user-facing programs, this quarter marked a significant shift as\nmore projects moved into full production environments. Our pipeline of AI opportunities has grown to\nmore than 100 active opportunities, representing a 50% increase from the last quarter. This growth\nreflects the increasing enterprise readiness to move beyond experimentation to implementation of AI\nsolutions at scale.\nCurrently, we are seeing particularly strong demand in three key areas of AI: AI-based search,\nconversational AI, and catalog enrichment. This demand is driven by rapidly evolving customer\nexpectations, as interactions with AI-based assistants become more commonplace in both consumer\nand enterprise contexts. To support this growing demand, we're expanding our partnerships with\nhyperscalers, building specialized accelerators based on their foundational models and AI-based\nservices.\nInternally, we continue to invest in our own AI capabilities. We've made significant strides in improving\nour engineering productivity through the implementation of AI coding assistants. This enhances our\ndelivery efficiency and ensures our teams stay at the forefront of AI technology implementation.\nNow, let me share a few examples of our AI programs at large enterprises:\nAt one iconic retailer, we've launched an AI solution that streamlines their product catalog\nmanagement by automatically extracting and harmonizing product attributes from unstructured data,\nsignificantly improving operational efficiency and data quality. For one of the largest US auto parts\nproviders, we're implementing an advanced AI assistant that connects customers with store associates\nthrough instant messaging. This solution incorporates visual auto parts recognition and conversational\npart finding capabilities, enhancing both customer experience and operational efficiency. At one of the\nlargest beverage companies, we're developing a conversational knowledge AI platform focused on\nimproving employee productivity by providing intelligent access to corporate knowledge and\nstreamlining internal processes.\nThese implementations showcase our ability to deliver AI solutions that drive meaningful business\noutcomes across diverse industry verticals. As we look ahead, we remain confident in our positioning\nas a leader in enterprise AI implementation, supported by our growing pipeline and expanding\npartnership ecosystem.\nIn the quarter there were several trends, and I want to share some of the notable ones:\nLogo Momentum: In the third quarter we signed 6 new logos, which are large enterprises. Of these\ncustomers we signed in the quarter, one is a global food products and hospitality distribution\ncompany, another is an automotive parts company, and another is one of the largest grocery retailers\nin Europe.\nPartnerships Revenues driven by strategic partnerships have shown sustained growth—contributing\n18% of our total revenue in the first three quarters of 2024. In response to this positive trend, we are\ninvesting in joint sales and marketing, and collaborating closely with hyperscalers and SaaS providers.\nThese efforts span across critical areas such as digital commerce, application modernization, data\nplatforms, and engineering services, allowing us to tap into an even broader range of opportunities.\nAdditionally, our partners are emerging as critical channels for seizing opportunities in artificial\nintelligence and generative AI, as demand in these areas continues to rise. To further strengthen our\nfootprint, we are actively deploying our AI and generative AI accelerators across hyperscaler platforms\nand marketplaces, enhancing accessibility and engagement for clients seeking advanced AI solutions.\nIndia expansion: Our follow-the-sun strategy provides the framework of scaling our global locations.\nIndia is now in our top two countries by headcount, and it is an integral part of our global delivery\nmodel. Bengaluru, our third location in India, is now scaling its team and has been a successful\naddition to our Indian operations. We are scaling relationships with India-based GCCs, recently hosting\na technology and innovation forum attended by more than a dozen GCCs.\nEuropean business: With roughly mid-teens of our revenue, Europe continues to be strategic to our\ngrowth. We are increasing our footprint with the European divisions of our large global accounts. We\nare also expanding our business with joint go-to-market strategies with hyperscalers across all our\nservices.\nWe are witnessing significant AI adoption trends, with clients engaging us to assess their AI and data\nplatform capabilities in preparation for building AI platforms that will support multi-year business\ntransformations.\nA major UK-based retail customer is engaging us not only on e-commerce transformation but also on\ntheir cloud migration journey this year. In Q4, we are launching a composable commerce B2C solution\nfor a major auto parts distributor. We are working towards helping them further modernize and\nconsolidate their complex technology landscape into 2025.\nDuring the quarter, Grid Dynamics delivered some notable projects.\nA leading global technology company sought a solution to maintain user data in compliance with\nprivacy regulations. Grid Dynamics successfully implemented a consolidated system, enabling\ncentralized monitoring and management of datasets and user workflows. The UI application has been\nwidely adopted across multiple cross-functional teams within the organization. The new system\nprovides business teams with a standardized method to ensure datasets meet current regulatory\nrequirements. It also maintains a comprehensive audit trail for all changes, enhancing transparency\nand accountability.\nA leading financial and investment services company aimed to enhance the search experience on its\ninternal web portal, which serves around 10,000 financial advisors. The goal was to improve search\nresult accuracy by understanding financial advisors’ intent and delivering the most relevant\ninformation. The solution incorporates a ‘do no harm’ analysis to ensure reliability. This feature\nprioritizes accuracy over completeness by withholding results when the system cannot confidently\nprovide correct information. Grid Dynamics implemented this solution leveraging AWS and NVIDIA\ntechnology stack.\nWe recently introduced a contactless payment system for a major US DIY retailer, enabling customers\nto complete purchases quickly and securely with a tap of their phone or card. This solution enhances\nthe shopping experience by reducing checkout times and minimizing physical contact. The rollout is\nunderway across more than 2,000 stores, with overwhelmingly positive customer feedback. This\nupgrade underscores the impact of Grid Dynamics' work on our clients' business operations.\nWe successfully launched passwordless biometrics-based identification that leverages cutting-edge\nauthentication standards to enable users to securely authenticate their online payments using\nbiometric data such as fingerprints and/or facial recognition, in Summer Olympics starting from POC to\nproduction in a record time of 6 months.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Anil, who will discuss Q3 results in more detail.\nAnil …\n###\nAnil Doradla, Chief Financial Officer:\nThanks, Leonard. Good afternoon everyone.\nOur third quarter results were solid as we exceeded our expectations, both on revenue and non-GAAP\nEBITDA. During the third quarter we recognized a record revenue of $87.4 million that was organic and\nahead of our guidance range of $84.0 million to $86.0 million. Our non-GAAP EBITDA of $14.8 million\nexceeded our guidance range of $12.3 million and $13.3 million. The better than expected results were\ndriven by a combination of factors that included strength from existing and new customers and\noperational efficiencies.\nDuring the third quarter, our retail and TMT were the two largest verticals at 34.1% and 27.7% of our\nrevenues, respectively. Our Retail vertical grew 11.4% and 12.4% on a sequential and year-over-year\nbasis, respectively. On a sequential basis, we witnessed growth from multiple customers in the\nspecialty retail, home improvement space, and department stores.\nTMT saw an increase of 4.1% and 1.9% on a sequential and year-over year basis, respectively. Similar to\nlast quarter, our largest customers in the TMT vertical, grew both on a sequential and year-over-year\nbasis. Here are the details of the revenue mix of other verticals. Our Finance vertical was the strongest\nboth on a sequential and on a year-over-year basis and grew by 12.7% and 94% respectively. As a\nresult, its share in total revenues increased to 16.2% in the third quarter of 2024. Similar to last quarter,\nthe growth was from customers across the Fintech and Insurance space. Our CPG & Manufacturing,\nrepresenting 11.2% of our revenue in the third quarter, remained relatively flat on a sequential basis\nand increased 1.4% on a year-over-year basis. Our Healthcare and Pharma representing 2.9% of our\nrevenues decreased (20.5)% and (26.9)% sequentially and on a year-over year basis, respectively. And\nfinally, the Other vertical represented 7.9% of our third quarter revenue and was down (6.9)% on a\nsequential basis and up 3.0% on a year-over-year basis.\nWe ended the third quarter with a total headcount of 4,298 up from 3,961 employees in the second\nquarter of 2024 and up from 3,823 in the third quarter of 2023. Our recent acquisition of Juxt added 139\nemployees located mainly in Europe. At the end of the third quarter of 2024, our total US headcount\nwas 345, or 8.0% of the company’s total headcount versus 8.4% in the year ago quarter. Our non-US\nheadcount, located in Europe, Americas and India was 3,953, or 92.0%.\nIn the third quarter, Revenues from our top 5 and top 10 customers were 39.8% and 59.2%, respectively,\nversus 36.8% and 54.0% in the same period a year ago, respectively. During the third quarter, we had a\ntotal of 201 customers down from 208 in the second quarter of 2024 and 224 in the year ago quarter.\nDuring the quarter we added several customers, some of which Leonard referred to in his prepared\nremarks. The year over year decline in the number of customers was primarily driven by our continued\nefforts to rationalize our portfolio of non-strategic customers.\nMoving to the income statement, Our GAAP gross profit during the quarter was $32.7 million, or 37.4%,\ncompared to $29.6 million or 35.6% in the second quarter of 2024 and $28.2 million, or 36.4% in the year\nago quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, our gross profit was $33.3 million or 38.0% up from $30.1 million or\n36.2% in the second quarter of 2024 and up from $28.7 million or 37.0% in the year ago quarter. The\nincrease in gross profit, both in dollar and as a percentage on a sequential basis was mainly driven by\na combination of higher levels of revenue and better utilization of engineering resources. Non-GAAP\nEBITDA during the third quarter that excluded stock-based compensation, depreciation and\namortization, restructuring and expenses related to the geographic reorganization, transaction and\nother related costs was $14.8 million, or 16.9% of sales up from $11.7 million or 14.1% of sales in the\nsecond quarter of 2024 and $10.7 million or 13.9%, in the year ago quarter. The increase on a\nsequential basis was largely due to higher revenues, partially offset by increase in operating expenses.\nOur GAAP net income in the third quarter was $4.3 million or $0.05 per share, based on a diluted share\ncount of 78.8 million shares, compared to the second quarter loss of $(0.8) million or $(0.01) per share,\nbased on a diluted share count of 76.6 million and an income of $0.7 million or $0.01 per share based\non 77.3 million diluted shares in the year ago quarter. Our sequential increase in GAAP net income was\ndue to higher gross profit, lower levels of stock-based compensation, and lower provision for income\ntaxes. On a non-GAAP basis, in the third quarter our non-GAAP net income was $8.1 million, or $0.10 per\nshare based on 78.8 million diluted shares, compared to the second quarter non-GAAP net income of\n$6.0 million or $0.08 per share based on 77.9 million diluted shares and $5.9 million or $0.08 per share\nbased on $77.3 million diluted shares in the year ago quarter.\nOn September 30, 2024, our Cash and cash equivalents totaled $231.3 million, down from $256.0 million\nin the second quarter of 2024.\nComing to the fourth quarter guidance, we expect revenues to be in the range of 95 to 97 million. We\nexpect our recent acquisitions contributing 10% of the total revenue. We expect our non-GAAP EBITDA\nin the fourth quarter to be in the range of $13.5 to 15.5 million. For Q4 2024, we expect our basic share\ncount to be in the range of 77 to 78 million and our diluted share count to be in the range of 80 to 81\nmillion.\nThat concludes my prepared comments. We are ready to take questions.\n###\nQuestions and Answers\nCary Savas, Director, Branding & Communications:\nOkay. Thank you, Anil. As we go into the Q&A session of this call, I will first announce your name.\nAt that point, please unmute yourself and turn on your camera. And the first question is going to come\nfrom Mayank Tandon from Needham.\nMayank Tandon @ Needham:\nOh, great. Thanks. Hi, Leonard. Hi, Anil. Congrats on the quarter.\nLeonard Livschitz, Chief Executive Officer:\nThank you.\nMayank Tandon @ Needham:\nSo let me just clarify. Sorry, I missed your last comment on the contribution from M&A in the fourth\nquarter. And then I just want to get a sense related, if you strip out the revenue from the fourth quarter\nin terms of M&A, then can we expect this organic growth to continue in the future quarters, why would\nit not continue? So any color on your outlook for the next few quarters would be helpful, just given\nwhat you had in terms of performance in the last several quarters.\nLeonard Livschitz, Chief Executive Officer:\nAnil?\nAnil Doradla, Chief Financial Officer:\nYes, so Mayank, we said 10%, right? Now, I think the most important thing you have to understand as\nwe go from Q3 to Q4 is that you had…some of the working time, right? The number of hours. The\nbillable headcount will grow from Q3 to Q4.\nSo, uh, if you look at the underlying foundations, which at the end of the day is driven by billable\nheadcount. Of course, working time moves around right as we're going through the seasonality part of\nthe year into as we exit, you'll see some variations, but the billable headcount, new customers, existing\ncustomers are continuing.\nMayank Tandon @ Needham:\nGot it. So just to be clear, in terms of the organic trends, it sounds like that can continue based on the\ndemand climate. I'm just trying to get a sense if there's anything on the horizon—in terms of budget\nflush or companies going through their budgeting process for next year that could maybe change the\ndynamic in terms of the current organic growth trajectory you've seen quarter to quarter.\nAnil Doradla, Chief Financial Officer:\nSo look, you know, there is nothing changed. From a, you know, what I call some abnormal or artificial\nmovements So the trends that we're seeing, it points to more fundamental. As we get into next year,\nobviously, we will talk next year. We don't guide beyond a quarter, but our underlying results, which\nwas 5% sequential growth, there's an acceleration in quarter over quarter, right? This is all driven by\nfundamentals. It was not driven by budget flush. It is not driven by some artificial behavior in the\norganic business. It is across the board, as Leonard pointed out, both from our existing customers and\nnew customers.\nLeonard Livschitz, Chief Executive Officer:\nSo, Mayank, I'll add one more point just to make sure it's clear. October is a great month. We are very\nconfident. We have numbers, right? But we don't write yet all the details. The conservatives in a\nguidance is driven by two factors. As you know, December has certain furloughs, certain holidays. We\nwant to be a little bit more careful. And also the revenue coming from the new customers will be\nunique, and I'm sure we'll talk more with other guys\nWe'll be asked similar questions, and that's driven by the fact that we started to collaborate even\nbefore we closed. This is different from the previous acquisitions we had. So not sure how much\nresolve will be in Q4, but Q1 will see the additional revenue due to the synergy. So we're bullish on\nboth fronts.\nMayank Tandon @ Needham:\nGot it. Can I squeeze one more in?\nAnil Doradla, Chief Financial Officer:\nSure.\nMayank Tandon @ Needham:\nSo just want to get some perspective on pricing. It's been a point of debate In the services industry,\njust given some of the demand headwinds. Are you seeing pricing stabilize, maybe even uptick a little\nbit? Any color around what your conversations are like with clients around pricing?\nLeonard Livschitz, Chief Executive Officer:\nAll right, I'll take this one. So first of all, so we have Yury Gryzlov today. He's not only our COO, but he\nalso runs Europe. So I will tell you a little bit about US because next time I’ll bring Vasily Sizov here but\nGryzlov will give you a few color on Europe.\nFundamentally, we do see a bit of improvements in terms of the pricing performance. With new clients,\nalso related to this, obviously, more engagements on the technology side. We'll talk more about,\nhopefully, again, other people ask questions about how technology drives the differentiation in new\nbusiness for Grid Dynamics. Those colors are on a growing business, upgrading business. You talk\nabout the more traditional legacy business pretty much stable. So you can see the, again, Q3 was good\nevery way you say. So the proof is their pudding. There's a Q4, there's Q1 - You know, seasonality always\nworks there. And we'll need to be on the rise as we go toward the middle of next year significantly,\nright? For now, we enjoy the run. We see good stable pricing. We see new improved pricing, and at least\nin US. Let Yury speak for the first time. Anil and I talked for 20 times together already. So Yury?\nYury Gryzlov, Chief Operating Officer:\nYeah, I think I just wanted to add that it's the same in Europe. I think that, as Leonard just mentioned,\nthe pricing has been stable and we don't see those fluctuations anymore so it's pretty much you know\nbusiness as usual as we as we see right now. And then we'll see if, you know, Q4 and Q1 next year.\nMayank Tandon @ Needham:\nCongrats on the quarter. Good to hear.\nYury Gryzlov, Chief Operating Officer:\nThanks, Mayank.\nAnil Doradla, Chief Financial Officer:\nThank you, Mayank.\nLeonard Livschitz, Chief Executive Officer:\nThank you, Mayank.\nCary Savas, Director, Branding & Communications:\nThe next question comes from Puneet Jain of JP Morgan. And just give me a second and I'll get the\ncameras going. Okay. Super.\nCary Savas, Director, Branding & Communications:\nWe can't hear you, Puneet.\nAnil Doradla, Chief Financial Officer:\nHang on a second.\nCary Savas, Director, Branding & Communications:\nGo ahead, Puneet.\nAnil Doradla, Chief Financial Officer:\nNo. You're still on mute. You're still unmute yourself. Okay. You're muted here, right? Yeah, he's\nunmuted.\nCary Savas, Director, Branding & Communications:\nGo ahead, sir. We can't hear you. Okay, we can come back to you.\nAnil Doradla, Chief Financial Officer:\nNo, no, no, hold on. Give him a second. Okay, I think we're going to come back to him. Hold on.\nCary Savas, Director, Branding & Communications:\nDid he mute himself? He took him off camera. Okay.\nAnil Doradla, Chief Financial Officer:\nOh, here we go. Give it a try again. All right. So why don't you, Puneet, why don't you do one thing-just\ndial in through the mobile, you know, and then we'll get back to you. But just call in. You don't have to\ndo the video. So Cary, let's just go to the next one, and Puneet just call in, or call me. I'll put you on\nspeakerphone here.\nCary Savas, Director, Branding & Communications:\nOkay, then the next question comes from Bryan Bergen of TD Cohen. Please turn on your camera, and\nI'll make sure you're…\nBryan Bergin @ TD Cowen:\nHi, guys. Hope you can hear me.\nLeonard Livschitz, Chief Executive Officer:\nYeah, yeah.\nBryan Bergin @ TD Cowen:\nAll right, very good. Let's talk about demand recovery. So you conveyed a sense of urgency here from\nclients before your end. It's definitely different from what we've heard from peers. Just as far as the\nurgency to complete deals, are there any particular types of programs or subsets of clients that are\ndemonstrating that behavior, or is it more broad-based? And just as you think about that dynamic, are\nthere any implications from that as we think about just the early 25 spend potential in those types of\naccounts?\nLeonard Livschitz, Chief Executive Officer:\nHi, Brian. Yeah, always good questions. So, I don't want to get too broad on that scope of the clients\nnot everyone is in this accelerated mode to spend. We know there's some case it would people like to\nkind of flush their old budgets and all this stuff. But that's a minor minority. What happened was when\nit relates to new activities. And it's not just AI. AI, it's a good excuse to spend more money from the, you\nknow, when your wardrobe wants you to be more aggressive. It's the efficiency and capability. And what\ndo I mean by efficiency and capability? There are more demands right now from very broad base of the\ncustomers to have a better reach with lower costs. So basically, working on various LLMs and co-pilots\nand all the programs just demonstrated to the clients what could be done with the good data? But\ndata needs to be properly analyzed. It needs to be properly adjusted. There needs to be proper\nformatting. So they start getting to understand that this is not just a magic bullet which turned their\nbusiness into a hugely profitable enterprise. So they opened the coffers for longer term activities. And\nthe focus is on applications. not just proof points that some models work. When it comes to AI\nassistance, of course, it's clear. It's about, you know, conversational part.\nWhen we talk about transforming, for example, vector search to Vertex AI, and many other features. It's\njust a much broader base. So we see a lot of activities data related. As well as customers right now\nhaving a little bit more confidence generally industry-wide, right? So there's a little bit more planning\ngoing on. So you're absolutely right. Most of the activities on the spend usually comes around\nFebruary, April timeframe. That's usually when we see this uplift. Last year, it actually was pushed more\nto April-May, but this year, we see it started as early as the mid of the third quarter.\nBryan Bergin @ TD Cowen:\nOkay. Okay. That's helpful. If we shift to profitability now, if revenue improvement continues to\nmaterialize, do you expect to see a commensurate improvement in margin or are there offsets that we\nneed to consider here just near term, such as needing to scale the bench? Just key inputs and takes as\nyou go into 4Q here on the profitability front?\nLeonard Livschitz, Chief Executive Officer:\nSure. Very good. So Anil will give you numbers in a second because, you know, you always like\nnumbers.\nBryan Bergin @ TD Cowen:\nReally good. Yeah.\nLeonard Livschitz, Chief Executive Officer:\nAnd you interview him after the meeting, by the way. He has everything for you, Brian. But I want to go\na little bit on, you know, the more fundamental philosophical skill because it's important. So we're\nadding new regions. You know india becomes a big part but even more technology solutions and we're\nadding more accelerators When you have more…at home, house developed codes. Your efficiency is\nhigh, right? And you bring the ROI to the client, so you get a little bit better margin on it.\nNow, again, third quarter was somewhat unique from the overall billability perspective you know very\nwell. And when we went to July, we almost were at 40, 20, the magic number. So we felt the taste of the\ntarget. Now, this is not, and I bet October is going to be very good as well. But it's not just the bench.\nSo bench is a function of our long-term visibility. So there's always a swap of the bench, but there is a\ntraining of enormous army of the AI-related specialists. And it comes from the internships, Grid\nDynamics University, and then Grid Dynamics Labs.\nWe expend more investment into our own AI labs for various functionality. Our partnerships with the\nhyperscalers and NVIDIA and a few other guys are taking more space. So this is non-linear investments,\nwhich I can allow myself to do even maybe not giving you immediate short-term this glorious 2040,\nbecause I see the return. Return on robotics. It's not BBS, it’s true robotics or automation for various\nclients, how to improve their production efficiency, AI systems. So we do balance, we would break\ndown how Bench is contributing and how innovation is contributing and how skill set modernization is\ncontributing. But overall, of course, if we don't get efficiency longer term while we're in this game,\nright? You like me and all the shareholders want to see the profit at the end of the day.\nBryan Bergin @ TD Cowen:\nAny other…\nAnil Doradla, Chief Financial Officer:\nYeah, Brian, just adding to what Leonard said, you got the gist of it, but this is something that, you\nknow, we highlighted in a couple of quarters ago, right? So there are three, four factors that we're\nworking on, right? As Leonard pointed out, we're doubling on internship programs. So, you know, so\nthe cost optimization from you know that point of view helps us. We're scaling India too. The nature of\nour programs from TNM going to pod to fixed price, that also helps.\nAnd Leonard and Yury just pointed out the pricing environment is improving. So all these things put\ntogether point to the underlying fundamentals of our business improving. Now, that has to be judged\nagainst what Leonard pointed out, investments for growth. So that's the thing. But again, what I want to\nconvey is the underlying you know price cost you know, element, is improving in our business.\nLeonard Livschitz, Chief Executive Officer:\nCorrect.\nBryan Bergin @ TD Cowen:\nOkay. Okay. Yeah, growth investments are appreciated there for sure. The AI commentary, last question\nhere. The AI commentary as far as actually scaling now beyond kind of the the POCs and the science\nprojects. As you are scaling, are there any changes to the contracting structures or more of the same,\nyou know, getting more productivity incremental volume of work. Just talk to us about that nuance as\nthese programs are becoming bigger.\nLeonard Livschitz, Chief Executive Officer:\nYes. So there's no magic bullet there either, right? So the customers are still a bit shy from between\ntechnology visionaries who say, let's have performance-based compensation, outcome-based\ncompensation versus fixed bits and TNMs. It happens on a very rare occasion because most of the\ntime, those programs, when they wrap up into the production implementation, they're part of the\nbigger initiative. So we're trying to actually, it works favorably for both sides. But it's still a limited\nbase. Now, as we become smarter. And we do more homegrown stuff. There's maybe a somewhat\nchange to our model offering as well.\nBut I know how you guys are cautious about when a service company starts throwing some different\nmodels of compensation, right? So we're still being there, but we certainly offered our clients, various\nmethods which make it a little bit more performance based, not often to be compared. But we see that\nthose solutions actually result in more efficiency to the client immediately.\nSo hopefully I can give you a better news that we do get more performance-based outcome in the\nupcoming quarters.\nBryan Bergin @ TD Cowen:\nAll right. Very good. Thanks for all the detail.\nLeonard Livschitz, Chief Executive Officer:\nSure.\nAnil Doradla, Chief Financial Officer:\nThank you, Bryan.\nCary Savas, Director, Branding & Communications:\nThanks, Bryan. Thank you for your questions, Brian. The next question comes from Maggie Nolan of\nWilliam Blair. Maggie, please turn on your camera and unmute your mic.\nMaggie Nolan @ William Blair:\nHi, how are you?\nLeonard Livschitz, Chief Executive Officer:\nGood.\nMaggie Nolan @ William Blair:\nTrying to get my video on here.\nAnil Doradla, Chief Financial Officer:\nGood.\nMaggie Nolan @ William Blair:\nNice quarter. Congratulations.\nAnil Doradla, Chief Financial Officer:\nThank you.\nMaggie Nolan @ William Blair:\nI wanted to ask a little bit about the end markets. And I know you gave some commentary for this\nquarter, but any thoughts on how your verticals might trend as you exit this year and then over the\ncourse of next year, are there particular areas where you anticipate growth is going to come from?\nLeonard Livschitz, Chief Executive Officer:\nOkay, well, I'll start and maybe Yury will share. I mean, Europe maybe slightly different to some extent.\nAnd definitely, in India with GCCs, we have some more dynamic so the three drivers for our business\ntoday pretty much are in chains, right? So it's a TMT, CPGs. and retail. The notable addition to the\ngrowth vertical is actually various financial services, payment systems, and fintech. The other guys like\nmanufacturing and you know life sciences and others are a little bit behind behind now the there is\naddition of insurance and other things to BFSI. And with acquisition, as a matter of fact, in Europe, and\nthat's what when Yury will talk about, there's a very big potential upswing on top tier financial\ninstitution.\nI think what is actually happening is very interesting. The dynamic of additional shift on the verticals,\nnow it's coming from our partners. Particularly, with the very notable hyperscaler, who we are doing a\nlot of initiatives together. So what happened is they see our successes in one or two industries, and\nthey are kind of passing the baton to their sales people in adjacent industries.\nSo the horizontal capability around knowledge of the major factors. And the major factors is a cloud\nbehavior, cloud migration various AI initiatives.\nAnd now even going into the, at least in the early stages, we're going to today into the various\napplication specific, which is basically, connected devices and everything around it. That creates the\npotential. So we are actually retuning. It's more about sales, right? Because engineering services are\nmore or less expendable. And then there is specialization in new tools. So we're investing in part of the\npartnerships with the industry-specific software providers.\nAnd that training has been happening actually from Q1. So we'll see that dynamics early next year. But\nthat's pretty much. So the big players are still there. The new players come in existing industries, but\nexpanding one, the biggest notable expansion, I would say, is fintech. And Yury, could you just more.\nYury Gryzlov, Chief Operating Officer:\nYes, yes. just to add on fintech, I think that, again, our distribution of industries in Europe are pretty\nmuch the same, have been stable. But obviously with the addition of JUXT, right, that we just acquired I\nthink that brings us into, you know, kind of expanded into fintech and and banking and financial\nservices overall. So JUXT, as you know, as Leonard mentioned earlier today, they are specializing in\ndata-intensive systems for banking and financial services. And that's, you know, it's a highly\ncomplementary area to what we are offering in this field. So from that perspective, I think we will see\nthe immediate synergies and opportunities to go beyond that and offer their capabilities to our\nexisting clients and obviously adding more clients in this area. But at the same time, transitioning to\nthe US as well is very, very important because while, again, this acquisition accelerates the growth in\nEurope, but we see a very high potential of immediate expansion into the largest US financial\ninstitutions as well. So I think that's pretty exciting. So we'll see the shift, I think, in Europe in particular\nbecause of the size. But that will be Q4 and beyond.\nMaggie Nolan @ William Blair:\nPerfect. That makes sense. Thank you. And then, Anil, you mentioned balancing investments as we're\nthinking about profitability. Where are we in the investment cycle? You've made some investments in\nrecent past in the sales force. How do you feel the return is on those? Are those folks ramping up\nnicely? You know, how are you thinking about your ability to add new logos As the demand\nenvironment recovers? Are you well set up to scale the business from here? Are there additional\ninvestments ahead?\nLeonard Livschitz, Chief Executive Officer:\nVery good. So the biggest investment which pays off as a technology investment. That makes us\ndifferentiated. Remember, we always talk about Grid Dynamics being kind of a canary in the lean times\nand the good times. And when our technology capabilities align with the market upswing, then it\ncreates a double whammy and we grow faster. So technology capability is bespoke. Partnership\ncapability, there's a significant investment, which is, again. in the process.\nAs a matter of fact, the good news is, our partners demand us to invest. You know and they're kind of\nreally vigorous about making sure we balance our investments with the solutions they provide and\ncertification associated with it so that's going on. In terms of the new logo acquisitions in a traditional\nway, right? It's still a lot of new opportunities come because remember, again, we work with very large\nFortune 500 companies as the most comes from either referrals, that's still the best way. Industry is\ndynamic, so that works well. Or in the clients where our technical solutions implementations of the\napplications become reachable and they want to do something very rapidly. And that's where\nSalesforce is needed. The good news about our Salesforce, especially in the US, We're positioned well\nvirtually in every region. But the rate of return so far is more driven by individual clients. rather than a\nblend area, I can say that you want X amount of productivity in certain you know southeast And that's\nwhat I'm getting. Now we have investments in all the areas. So what we do with the sales force and\naccount management force, the main investment is to make sure once we get into the first programs,\nthe execution is flawless.\nAnd because people are in rush right now as the client said to do something. who spend more time\ndeliberately on defining a statement of works, defining the milestones. Because getting new clients is\nno longer a problem for us. how to make this 5, 10, 20 million dollar revenue works driven by flawless\nexecution. Today is not only on engineering, as you've always been. Engineering has to be great,\ndelivery has to be great. But for account management and front-facing organization, you seek time and\nalign with their clients. So we're adding more consultancy on the architecture side. We're adding more\naccount management specialized with an engineering background and understand coming from the\nexecution background before. We train delivery management guys to watch not just the timeline, but\nchanges in the scope. Now, I'm giving you a lot of kitchen for a very small question, but it's not about\nacquisition about right now, but rapidly scaling those top guys with the existing capabilities.\nMaggie Nolan @ William Blair:\nUnderstood. That makes a lot of sense. And then you've just, I mean, you've transformed the business\nso much even since becoming public. You've become incredibly global as a company, and you continue\nto have that at the forefront of your acquisition strategy and imperatives. So I'm wondering, you know,\nhow this global expansion has impacted conversations with your clients, maybe comment on how\nadding Argentina, for instance, as a delivery location has impacted conversations with clients.\nLeonard Livschitz, Chief Executive Officer:\nAll right. Well, nearshoring has been always on a list of our clients, right? And for many of them\nespecially, and it is a merit of nearshoring now, being a global company, I assume the clients are in the\nUnited States. Because if the customer in Europe, there's a different nearshore. The customers now in\nIndia is nearshoring. And now we have customers in Latin America, right? But if we talk about our\ntraditional US business. They rush in, and then they want to have the same quality, the same\nperformance and the same conversation as they've had with their US colleagues. Well, it's not always\nhappened that way, right? And, you know, in our case, our Mexican team is very good. In the past, it was\nappreciating for a long time now, It's a bit declining. There was not as much productivity when you\nwant good people. Good people cost you money no matter what. System solutions an approach that\nmatters. So what happened, you know, we started, as you know, in Mexico, we started in Jamaica. Now\nwe have first green shoots in Canada, some consultants. We're not opening an office yet, but that's not\nimpossible because we have new clients in Canada. But Argentina is kind of unique. For a long time, it\nwas, you know, there's a very, very successful, our, you know, peer in the industry. I mean, they may not\nlike us to call them peers, but I treat them as peers who come from Argentina and they're doing a great\njob. They extended in Colombia. Now they're investing into India and Eastern Europe, right?\nAnd for that matter, I always had a strong affinity to the culture, to the education, to people in\nArgentina. It's just very close, and the connection with them, it's also strong with the European\norganization. So I see that our clients, again, remember I mentioned we started working on an\nintegration in advance. So with the clients from JUXT, we're talking about our positioning for a while\nalready. But with the clients in the US, we obtain an approval for expanding in Argentina before the ink\ndried on the contract. So once we finish the acquisition, there is already a demand coming for a supply\nfrom the Argentinian organization.\nWhich is pretty cool.\nMaggie Nolan @ William Blair:\nThank you for taking my questions.\nLeonard Livschitz, Chief Executive Officer:\nThanks, Maggie\nMaggie Nolan @ William Blair:\nOf course. Thank you.\nAnil Doradla, Chief Financial Officer:\nThank you, Maggie. Let's try. Puneet.\nPuneet Jain @ JP Morgan:\nAll right, I hope you can hear me now.\nAnil Doradla, Chief Financial Officer:\nWe can hear you. Yes.\nPuneet Jain @ JP Morgan:\nAwesome.\nAnil Doradla, Chief Financial Officer:\nWhat happened? You tell us.\nPuneet Jain @ JP Morgan:\nThis was the student. I don't know. My laptop doesn't like me.\n00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.000\nYes, exactly. This person\nLeonard Livschitz, Chief Executive Officer:\nMaybe because, man, happy Diwali, maybe because you should not be working today, but it's a day of\nprosperity for all of us, right? So let's make it prosper.\nPuneet Jain @ JP Morgan:\nThis was a sign. This was a sign. Maybe my wife did something here. But anyway, very strong quarter. So\nlet me ask about overall demand like many peers like you have reported, they all are talking about the\nrebrand. Your tone, your growth rates definitely indicate like that things are better now than what they\nwere six months ago. So what’s driving this separation in growth rate for you like you grew like about\n13%. year on year this quarter, right? So what driving this separation and growth for you versus many of\nyour digital peers.\nLeonard Livschitz, Chief Executive Officer:\nSo I mentioned before a few things. The AI solutions open the door for bigger implementations. So\nthat's obviously, but I'm sure you sit through many, many earnings calls and I guarantee you that my\ngood friends from other companies, regardless where they are, tell the same story, right? And, you\nknow, I read one of the reports yesterday. We were talking about 100, you know, early engagement,\npeople talk about thousands. Size matters, right? The reality is, we are a truly technology partner. and\nas we mature and grow and become more global, more people learn about us early. Remember about\nthis concentration, right? So, you know, the reality is we still have some of it. The top clients to some\nextent, you know, may actually invest more with us because they trust us more, especially when it's\ninnovative projects. But we see some rapidly increasing demand from certain clients, which are new,\nmuch faster. And the reason is the ramp up happens is because they put more bets on us. What I told\nMaggie. We need to make sure we have not only flawless execution, but a very well-established\nexpectations. People rush to have some result. And it's all about applications. You know probably well,\nand trust me, we live through that the customer wants to do something immediate. And we are kind of\npulling back and we're talking about a longer roadmap Once they appreciate what we do, and it\nhappened not just Q3, it's happened even earlier. They're more comfortable to lay larger dollars in\nfront of us. So to some extent, it's still size, but more important is in the times of investment of\ntechnology, we ramp up quicker and we are more in a strategic critical applications for the business.\nYou know, because it's very important. People always say, okay, you go fast, you fall fast. We'll see how\nnext turn cycle goes. But I think we're holding our line pretty well. Because we're having this stream of\ntechnology innovation into the larger execution. And also, Anil mentioned, probably before to you as\nwell, some of the clients who measure to decline in 2023, are now, also in a rebound. So that helps too.\nSo it's a combination of the facts. I don’t know Yuri if you want to mention something notable in\nEurope?\nYury Gryzlov, Chief Operating Officer:\nNo, I think it's, yeah, it's pretty much aligned with what Leonard mentioned. I just want also to add that\nthe inorganic strategy as well, right? Every time when we're looking at those companies and, you know,\nthose two that we just acquired. no exceptions. I think that we are always trying to understand if they\ncan bring some nonlinear value to us, right? In terms of like our GigaCube strategy, technology\nexpertise, you know, footprint expansion and things like that. I think it's also very, very important. And\nif you look at those and, you know, as Neil mentioned, right, they're contributing some amount of, you\nknow, revenue already. I think it's very important for us to stay focused. And if we go too broad, then\nwe will kind of fall into the same category of many bigger players, but if we stay focused, I believe\nthat's the key. And the other thing I think worth mentioning, the GCCs is not just ultimate definition of\nIndia. It's also Europe. So some of our big US notable clients trust us with a strong position in\nEuropean organizations as well.\nSo in India, it's a big thing. The Bangalore office was the best investment of recently and you know all\nwe're doing is fighting for talent and to some extent, you know, successful because people are curious\nabout us and there's a good you know, having three major areas good but we also have a very large\npull from the GCCs in India. But recent pull from, you know, they don't even call themselves GCCs, but\nfrom the big clients that are engineering organization in Europe becomes quite valuable as we\ncontinue to balance growth in Europe with the growth in India.\nPuneet Jain @ JP Morgan:\nAnd let me ask on that, how are clients deciding between like the work that should go to like a vendor\nlike yourself, especially like a digital vendor like yourself, versus their in-house operations. I\nunderstand like you're working more with GCC is there. But like how like the work allocated between\nGCCs and vendors\nLeonard Livschitz, Chief Executive Officer:\nYeah, so working with the US centers of excellence It's definitely easier than with GCCs in India. I mean,\nthis is perfect because we have very smart, not like US guys are not smart, but the people who\nnaturally have been brought in for GCCs in India, they're doing a pretty good job themselves.\nBut remember, when you have a client base recruiting, and you have a supplier-based recruiting, there\nare very two different tasks. So there are some very notable clients, which may go very broad.\nAnd the competition is very fierce. When it comes to suppliers, they know the job will stay for one\nclient with another client with a third client. So some of the GCC guys, what they're saying is, we want\nto give you a partial work and we say, look, we need to be cooperating so that we want to send project\nwork as well, we're not a staffing company.\nThere was a bit of a discussion on that, but over time they give us more because they feel we're part of\nthe team. You know, sometimes we work in their offices, there's a big, by the way, reverse back to the\noffice thing so a little bit remote is not as helpful but also the competition for the specific talent when\nwe double down on the fewer narrow but extremely deep expertise, driven by the technology experts\nlocally then they open up. But I agree with you. You know, we just finished a really nice tech conference\nin Bangalore. More than a dozen GCC guys send their participants. There were more than 30 technical\nand business executives. This is the first one. So I'm sure next year we'll have a bigger one. And these\nguys don't come just to write the notes. There's a lot of active discussion. So let's give us a bit of a\ntestament with respect to their capabilities.\nPuneet Jain @ JP Morgan:\nYeah, no, that's good to know. And thanks for the answer. Like the clients, Leonard, you talked about\nlike the client spending on AI projects, like they're getting ready for AI projects, investing in data and\nall that. Does this represent incremental spend which should result in overall increase in budget for\nclients? Or are they just like reclassifying or shifting budget from one area to spend in this.\nLeonard Livschitz, Chief Executive Officer:\nWell, they're both, right? Some people are mesmerized by a demonstration from, you know. Elon Musk\nhaving robots walking on the stage, right? Not everybody knows exactly what goes into that, and I will\nleave it at that level. But it gives you the perspective of level automation which goes into the\nfoundation of our society. And that's very critical for some of the clients because they're\nrevolutionizing the things around our daily work. You know consumer work, recruiting you know\nassistance AI assistance so robotics just start changing. There are a few of them. They're\nexperimenting, obviously, but there's a big cost in the regulatory stuff. But most of the guys, what they\nexpend in application science. They want to be very, very specific. I have this number of General AI\ncases. I want to improve it. I have this… Veterinary Clinic. I want to increase the throughput. I want to,\nyou know, as you know, pets don't speak. So there's a lot of things we go around that. Some clients\nsaying, look, you know. We would like to have a lot more bundle inventory.\nAnd the wealth management system, we are revolutionizing the conversational AIs, you know, basically\nvideo search assistance and putting the data together. So it's a lot more with the fewer capabilities, but\npeople would like to have a repetitive So those drips now has a mainstream of the new larger\nimplementations where this big world of dreamers are doing more as a proof of concepts. But both are\nimportant because the impact of the dreamers is significantly larger over time. And we talked about\nour investment into AI. We can't compare with the big guys. But there's certain areas where we believe\nit's fundamental and we're going to continue to hone and shift the offering for the future. Because it's\nnot traditional. It's not only that particular software development skill. And if we need to cannibalize\nsome of the business, we will. But right now, the revenue comes from the applications. And the future\nbusiness positioning comes from those tectonic shifts.\nPuneet Jain @ JP Morgan:\nThat's great. Thank you.\nLeonard Livschitz, Chief Executive Officer:\nThank you so much. Thank you, Puneet\nCary Savas, Director, Branding & Communications:\nThank you Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Q&A session for today. And now I'll turn it over to\nLeonard for closing statements. Just give me one second.\n###\nCLOSING COMMENTS\nLeonard Livschitz, Chief Executive Officer:\nThank you everybody for joining us on the call today.

October 31, 2024 – Grid Dynamics Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: GDYN) (“Grid Dynamics” or the “Company”),\na leader in enterprise-level digital transformation, today announced results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\nWe are very pleased to report third quarter 2024 revenues of $87.4 million that was higher than our outlook range of $84.0\nmillion to $86.0 million that we provided in August 2024. Our Retail and Technology, Media and Telecom (“TMT”) verticals\nwere the two largest verticals during the third quarter of 2024 with 34.1% and 27.7% of our revenues, respectively. Our Finance\nvertical, representing 16.2% of our third quarter revenues, grew 12.7% on a sequential basis and 94.0% on a year-over-year\nbasis. Strength in the Financial vertical came from our finance technology and insurance customers. Our CPG and\nManufacturing vertical, representing 11.2% of our third quarter revenues, remained flat on a sequential basis.\n“The third quarter was another milestone in the Company’s history. We reported record revenues and profitability, scaled\npartnership influenced revenues, and set a new record with the highest number of billable engineers. Customers, both existing\nand new, are contributing to our strong results, which is a testament to our technology differentiation and delivery excellence.\nThe strong demand we witnessed in the third quarter was built on steady improvements in the first half of the year.\nI am thrilled to welcome JUXT and Mobile Computing to Grid Dynamics. Each company brings in a unique set of capabilities.\nUK-based JUXT elevates our industry expertise in banking and financial services, and Argentina-based Mobile Computing\nenhances our engineering capabilities and adds premier clients in Latin America.\nOur AI initiatives continue to gain significant traction across our customer base. Our pipeline of AI opportunities has grown to\nmore than 100, representing a 50% increase from last quarter. This growth reflects the increasing enterprise readiness to move\nbeyond experimentation to implementation of AI solutions at scale.\nWe approach the end of 2024 with strong business momentum and confident of the foundations of the Company as we enter\n2025,” said Leonard Livschitz, CEO.\nThird Quarter of 2024 Financial Highlights\n• Total revenues were $87.4 million, an increase of 5.3% on a sequential basis and 12.9% on a year-over-year basis.\n• GAAP gross profit was $32.7 million, or 37.4% of revenues, in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $28.2 million,\nor 36.4% of revenues, in the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP gross profit was $33.3 million, or 38.0% of revenues,\nin the third quarter of 2024, compared to $28.7 million, or 37.0% of revenues, in the third quarter of 2023.\n• GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders was $4.3 million, or $0.05 per share, based on 78.8 million\ndiluted weighted-average common shares outstanding in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $0.7 million, or $0.01\nper share, based on 77.3 million diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding in the third quarter of 2023.\nNon-GAAP net income was $8.1 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, based on 78.8 million diluted weighted-average\ncommon shares outstanding in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $5.9 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, based on\n77.3 million diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding in the third quarter of 2023.\n• Non-GAAP EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, other income and expenses, fair\nvalue adjustments, stock-based compensation, transaction and transformation-related costs, restructuring costs as well\nas geographic reorganization expenses), a non-GAAP metric, was $14.8 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared\nto $10.7 million in the third quarter of 2023.\nSee “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Information” below for a discussion of our\nnon-GAAP measures.\nCash Flow and Other Metrics\n• Cash provided by operating activities was $23.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to\n$33.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n• Cash and cash equivalents totaled $231.3 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $257.2 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\n• Total headcount was 4,298 as of September 30, 2024, compared with 3,823 employees as of September 30, 2023.\nFinancial Outlook\n• The Company expects revenue in the fourth quarter of 2024 to be in the range of $95.0 million to $97.0 million.\n• Non-GAAP EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2024 is expected to be between $13.5 million and $15.5 million.\n• For the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect our basic share count to be in the 77.0 - 78.0 million range and diluted share\ncount to be in the 80.0 - 81.0 million range.\nGrid Dynamics is not able, at this time, to provide GAAP targets for net income/(loss) for the fourth quarter of 2024 because of\nthe difficulty of estimating certain items excluded from Non-GAAP EBITDA that cannot be reasonably predicted, such as\ninterest income, taxes, other income/(expenses), fair-value adjustments, geographic reorganization expenses, restructuring\nexpenses, transaction-related costs and charges related to stock-based compensation expense. The effect of these excluded items\nmay be significant.\nConference Call and Webcast\nGrid Dynamics will host a video conference call at 4:30 p.m. ET on Thursday, October 31, 2024 to discuss its third quarter\nfinancial results. Investors and other interested parties can access the call in the following ways: A webcast of the video\nconference call can be accessed on the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at https://ir.griddynamics.com / .\nA replay will also be available after the call at https://ir.griddynamics.com / with the passcode $Q3@2024.\nAbout Grid Dynamics\nGrid Dynamics (Nasdaq: GDYN) is a digital-native technology services provider that accelerates growth and bolsters\ncompetitive advantage for Fortune 1000 companies.

Follow us on LinkedIn .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement the financial measures presented in Grid Dynamics press release in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), the Company also presents Non-GAAP measures of financial\nperformance.\n2\nA “non-GAAP financial measure” refers to a numerical measure of Grid Dynamics historical or future financial performance or\nfinancial position that is included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in\naccordance with GAAP. Grid Dynamics provides certain non-GAAP measures as additional information relating to its\noperating results as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial information\npresented herein should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information\npresented in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a measure of liquidity and profitability.\nGrid Dynamics has included these non-GAAP financial measures because they are financial measures used by Grid Dynamics’\nmanagement to evaluate Grid Dynamics’ core operating performance and trends, to make strategic decisions regarding the\nallocation of capital and new investments and are among the factors analyzed in making performance-based compensation\ndecisions for key personnel.\nGrid Dynamics believes the use of non-GAAP financial measures, as a supplement to GAAP measures, is useful to investors in\nthat they eliminate items that are either not part of core operations or do not require a cash outlay, such as stock-based\ncompensation expense. Grid Dynamics believes these non-GAAP measures provide investors and other users of its financial\ninformation consistency and comparability with its past financial performance and facilitate period to period comparisons of\noperations. Grid Dynamics believes these non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating its operating performance compared to\nthat of other companies in its industry, as they generally eliminate the effects of certain items that may vary for different\ncompanies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.\nThere are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Further, these measures may differ\nfrom the non-GAAP information, even where similarly titled, used by other companies and therefore should not be used to\ncompare our performance to that of other companies. Grid Dynamics compensates for these limitations by providing investors\nand other users of its financial information a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the related GAAP financial measures.\nGrid Dynamics encourages investors and others to review its financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single\nfinancial measure, and to view its non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures. Please see the\nreconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures attached to this release.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis communication contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933\nand Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are not historical facts, and involve risks and uncertainties that\ncould cause actual results of Grid Dynamics to differ materially from those expected and projected. These forward-looking\nstatements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the words “believes,” “estimates,”\n“anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “may,” “will,” “potential,” “projects,” “predicts,” “continue,” or “should,” or, in\neach case, their negative or other variations or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements include, without\nlimitation, the quotations of management, the section titled “Financial Outlook,” and statements concerning Grid Dynamics’s\nexpectations with respect to future performance, particularly in light of the macroeconomic environment and the Russian\ninvasion of Ukraine, as well as its GigaCube strategy.\nThese forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ\nmaterially from the expected results. Most of these factors are outside Grid Dynamics’s control and are difficult to predict.\nFactors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to: (i) Grid Dynamics has a relatively short operating\nhistory and operates in a rapidly evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate future prospects and may increase the\nrisk that it will not continue to be successful and may adversely impact our stock price; (ii) Grid Dynamics may be unable to\neffectively manage its growth or achieve anticipated growth, particularly as it expands into new geographies, which could place\nsignificant strain on Grid Dynamics’ management personnel, systems and resources; (iii) Grid Dynamics’ revenues are highly\ndependent on a limited number of clients and industries that are affected by seasonal trends, and any decrease in demand for\noutsourced services in these industries may reduce Grid Dynamics’ revenues and adversely affect Grid Dynamics’ business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations; (iv) macroeconomic conditions, inflationary pressures, and the geopolitical\nclimate, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, have and may continue to materially adversely affect our stock price,\n3\nbusiness operations, overall financial performance and growth prospects; (v) Grid Dynamics’ revenues are highly dependent on\nclients primarily located in the United States, and any economic downturn in the United States or in other parts of the world,\nincluding Europe or disruptions in the credit markets may have a material adverse effect on Grid Dynamics’ business, financial\ncondition and results of operations; (vi) Grid Dynamics faces intense and increasing competition; (vii) Grid Dynamics’ failure\nto successfully attract, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel could materially adversely affect Grid\nDynamics’ business, financial condition and results of operations; (viii) failure to adapt to rapidly changing technologies,\nmethodologies and evolving industry standards may have a material adverse effect on Grid Dynamics’ business, financial\ncondition and results of operations; (ix) failure to successfully deliver contracted services or causing disruptions to clients’\nbusinesses may have a material adverse effect on Grid Dynamics’ reputation, business, financial condition and results of\noperations; (x) risks and costs related to acquiring and integrating other companies; and (xi) other risks and uncertainties\nindicated in Grid Dynamics filings with the SEC.\nGrid Dynamics cautions that the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive. Grid Dynamics cautions readers not to place undue\nreliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Grid Dynamics does not undertake or\naccept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect\nany change in its expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\nFurther information about factors that could materially affect Grid Dynamics, including its results of operations and financial\ncondition, is set forth under the “Risk Factors” section of the Company’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed October 31, 2024\nand in other periodic filings Grid Dynamics makes with the SEC.\nContacts\nGrid Dynamics Investor Relations:\ninvestorrelations@griddynamics.com\n4\nSchedule 1:\nGRID DYNAMICS HOLDINGS, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME/(LOSS) AND\nCOMPREHENSIVE INCOME/(LOSS)\nUnaudited\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenues $ 87,435 $ 77,419 $ 250,289 $ 234,841\nCost of revenues 54,706 49,267 160,332 149,809\nGross profit 32,729 28,152 89,957 85,032\nOperating expenses\nEngineering, research, and development 4,446 3,402 12,945 10,878\nSales and marketing 6,817 6,132 21,395 17,729\nGeneral and administrative 19,330 18,475 58,983 60,940\nTotal operating expenses 30,593 28,009 93,323 89,547\nIncome/(loss) from operations 2,136 143 (3,366) (4,515)\nOther income/(expense), net 3,466 3,159 8,656 7,849\nIncome before income taxes 5,602 3,302 5,290 3,334\nProvision for income taxes 1,320 2,626 5,773 8,001\nNet income/(loss) $ 4,282 $ 676 $ (483) $ (4,667)\nForeign currency translation adjustments 214 (561) (91) 1,337\nComprehensive income/(loss) $ 4,496 $ 115 $ (574) $ (3,330)\nIncome/(loss) per share\nBasic $ 0.06 $ 0.01 $ (0.01) $ (0.06)\nDiluted $ 0.05 $ 0.01 $ (0.01) $ (0.06)\nWeighted average shares outstanding\nBasic 76,697 75,464 76,485 75,026\nDiluted 78,837 77,339 76,485 75,026\n5\nSchedule 2:\nGRID DYNAMICS HOLDINGS, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nUnaudited\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\nAs of\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nAssets\nCurrent assets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 231,261 $ 257,227\nAccounts receivable, net of allowance of $1,791 and $1,363 as of September 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023, respectively 64,320 49,824\nUnbilled receivables 5,737 3,735\nPrepaid income taxes 10,292 3,998\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 11,385 9,196\nTotal current assets 322,995 323,980\nProperty and equipment, net 13,965 11,358\nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net 12,329 10,446\nIntangible assets, net 42,451 26,546\nGoodwill 73,875 53,868\nDeferred tax assets 7,515 6,418\nOther noncurrent assets 4,122 2,549\nTotal assets $ 477,252 $ 435,165\nLiabilities and equity\nCurrent liabilities\nAccounts payable $ 3,717 $ 3,621\nAccrued compensation and benefits 22,986 19,263\nAccrued income taxes 13,191 8,828\nOperating lease liabilities, current 5,179 4,235\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities 9,161 6,276\nTotal current liabilities 54,234 42,223\nDeferred tax liabilities 7,621 3,274\nOperating lease liabilities, noncurrent 7,649 6,761\nContingent consideration payable, noncurrent 7,501 —\nTotal liabilities $ 77,005 $ 52,258\nStockholders’ equity\nCommon stock, $0.0001 par value;

          "content": "GrGidr iDdy nDaymniacms ics\nCIunvltesutroer presentation\nNASDAQ: GDYN | Q3 2024\nPrivileged and confidential Grid Dynamics / Grid Dynamics Investor Presentation\nDisclaimer\nForward-looking statements\nThis communication contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are not historical facts, and involve risks and uncertainties\nthat could cause actual results of Grid Dynamics to differ materially from those expected and projected. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the words “believes,”\n“estimates,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “may,” “will,” “potential,” “projects,” “predicts,” “continue,” or “should,” or, in each case, their negative or other variations or comparable terminology. These forward-looking\nstatements include, without limitation, statements concerning Grid Dynamics’ expectations with respect to future performance, market size and industry trends, particularly in light of the macroeconomic environment and the Russian\ninvasion of Ukraine. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the expected results. Most of these factors are outside Grid Dynamics’s control\nand are difficult to predict. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to: (i) Grid Dynamics has a relatively short operating history and operates in a rapidly evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate\nfuture prospects and may increase the risk that it will not continue to be successful and may adversely impact our stock price; (ii) Grid Dynamics may be unable to effectively manage its growth or achieve anticipated growth, particularly as it\nexpands into new geographies, which could place significant strain on Grid Dynamics’ management personnel, systems and resources; (iii) Grid Dynamics’ revenues are highly dependent on a limited number of clients and industries that are\naffected by seasonal trends, and any decrease in demand for outsourced services in these industries may reduce Grid Dynamics’ revenues and adversely affect Grid Dynamics’ business, financial condition and results of operations; (iv)\nmacroeconomic conditions, inflationary pressures, and the geopolitical climate, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, have and may continue to materially adversely affect our stock price, business operations, overall financial\nperformance and growth prospects; (v) Grid Dynamics’ revenues are highly dependent on clients primarily located in the United States, and any economic downturn in the United States or in other parts of the world, including Europe or\ndisruptions in the credit markets may have a material adverse effect on Grid Dynamics’ business, financial condition and results of operations; (vi) Grid Dynamics faces intense and increasing competition; (vii) Grid Dynamics’ failure to\nsuccessfully attract, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel could materially adversely affect Grid Dynamics’ business, financial condition and results of operations; (viii) failure to adapt to rapidly changing technologies,\nmethodologies and evolving industry standards may have a material adverse effect on Grid Dynamics’ business, financial condition and results of operations; (ix) failure to successfully deliver contracted services or causing disruptions to\nclients’ businesses may have a material adverse effect on Grid Dynamics’ reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations; (x) risks and costs related to acquiring and integrating other companies; and (xi) other risks and\nuncertainties indicated in Grid Dynamics filings with the SEC. Grid Dynamics cautions that the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive. Grid Dynamics cautions readers not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which\nspeak only as of the date made. Grid Dynamics does not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in its expectations or any\nchange in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\nUse of projections\nThis presentation contains projections for Grid Dynamics, including with respect to its revenue. Grid Dynamics’ auditors have not audited, reviewed, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to the projections for the purpose of\ntheir inclusion in this presentation, and accordingly, have not expressed an opinion or provided any other form of assurance with respect thereto for the purpose of this presentation. These projections are for illustrative purposes only and\nshould not be relied upon as necessarily indicative of future results. In this presentation, certain of the above-mentioned projection information has been repeated for purposes of providing comparisons with historical data. The\nassumptions and estimates underlying the projected information are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ\nmaterially from those contained in the projected information. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the projected results will be indicative of the future performance of Grid Dynamics or that actual results will not differ materially\nfrom those presented in the projected information.\nIndustry and market data\nThis presentation includes market data and other statistical information for sources believed by Grid Dynamics to be reliable, including independent industry publications and other published independent sources. Some data are also based\non the good faith estimates of Grid Dynamics, which are derived from their review of internal sources as well as the independent sources described above. Although Grid Dynamics believe these sources are reliable, they have not\nindependently verified the information and cannot guarantee its accuracy and completeness.\nNon-GAAP financial measures\nIn this presentation, Grid Dynamics supplements results reported in accordance with the United States generally accepted accounting principles, referred to as GAAP, with non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP EBITDA, non-GAAP\nnet income, non-GAAP gross profit, and non-GAAP earnings per share. Management believes these measures help illustrate underlying trends in Grid Dynamics’ business and uses the measures to establish budgets and operational goals,\ncommunicate internally and externally, for managing its business and evaluating its performance, including in comparison to prior periods. Non-GAAP EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and\nexcludes transaction and transformation-related expenses, stock-based compensation expenses, retention bonuses, restructuring charges, and geographic reorganization expenses. Non-GAAP EBITDA is not a measure of financial\nperformance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, income from operations as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities or as a\nmeasure of liquidity. Reconciliations of the differences between the non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this presentation. Grid Dynamics anticipates that it will continue to report certain non-\nGAAP financial measures in its financial results, including non-GAAP results that exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related charges, impairment of goodwill, amortization of certain intangible assets, retention bonuses,\nrestructuring charges, geographic reorganization expenses, items related to one-time charges and benefits, gains and losses related to foreign exchange, potential loss contingencies, and the tax impact of any such pre-tax adjustments.\nBecause these non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, these measures are not comparable to GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly described non-GAAP measures reported by other companies\nwithin Grid Dynamics’ industry. Consequently, Grid Dynamics’ non-GAAP financial measures should not be evaluated in isolation or supplant comparable GAAP measures, but should be considered together with the information in Grid\nDynamics’ consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n2 NASDAQ: GDYN © 2024 Grid Dynamics Holdings, Inc.
