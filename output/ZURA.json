This study protocol reflects our commitment to advancing therapies that could potentially bring meaningful improvements for those affected by systemic sclerosis.”\n\nThe planned Phase 2 clinical trial, a double-blind, randomized (1:1), placebo-controlled study, is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of tibulizumab in approximately 80 participants with early diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (dcSSc). The anticipated study aims to demonstrate improvements in skin and lung symptoms, two primary complications of SSc, and includes an open-label extension. The trial is expected to initiate in Q4 2024, with an Orphan Drug Designation request already submitted to the FDA in the same quarter.\n\nTibulizumab has not received approval from any regulatory authority, and its safety and efficacy for the treatment of SSc have not been established.\n\n**ABOUT SYSTEMIC SCLEROSIS**\n\nSystemic sclerosis (SSc), also known as scleroderma, is a rare, life-threatening autoimmune disease affecting approximately 300,000 individuals worldwide, including around 100,000 in the United States. Characterized by chronic inflammation and progressive fibrosis of connective tissues, SSc primarily affects the skin and lungs but can also impact the heart, liver, kidneys, digestive tract, and vascular system. The most common symptoms of SSc include skin thickening and extreme sensitivity to cold in the extremities. The disease can also affect other organs and tissues, leading to muscle numbness and swelling, joint stiffness and reduced mobility, fibrosis in the lungs and heart, kidney dysfunction, and gastrointestinal issues such as difficulty swallowing, heartburn, bloating, constipation, and diarrhea.\n\nThere remains a high unmet medical need due to the limited treatment options available for individuals living with SSc. Currently, only two disease-modifying therapies are FDA-approved for severe lung complications of the disease (i.e., SSc-ILD), and no effective treatment exists that addresses the disease across multiple organ systems.\n\n**ABOUT TIBULIZUMAB**\n\nTibulizumab, an investigational humanized, tetravalent bispecific dual-antagonist antibody, is a fusion of Taltz® (ixekizumab) and tabalumab, engineered to bind to and neutralize both IL-17A and BAFF. Tibulizumab is expected to enter Phase 2 clinical development for the treatment of systemic sclerosis in Q4 2024 and for the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa in Q2 2025. Before in-licensing, Phase 1/1b studies of tibulizumab were conducted in Sjögren’s syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n**ABOUT ZURA BIO**\n\nZura Bio is a clinical-stage, multi-asset immunology company developing novel dual-pathway antibodies for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Currently, Zura Bio is developing three assets which have completed Phase 1/1b studies. The company is developing a portfolio of therapeutic indications for tibulizumab (ZB-106), crebankitug (ZB-168), and torudokimab (ZB-880), with a goal of demonstrating their efficacy, safety, and dosing convenience in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including systemic sclerosis and other novel indications with unmet needs.\n\n**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**\n\nThis communication includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

We’ve worked closely with our contract research organization (CRO) to begin trial readiness and prepare for site activation,\" said Robert Lisicki, CEO of Zura Bio. “Additionally, we've selected a CRO to support the anticipated Phase 2 trial initiation for tibulizumab in HS in the second quarter of 2025. We're excited to advance toward these milestones and highlight tibulizumab's potential as a best-in-class therapy for these underserved diseases.\"\n\n**RECENT UPDATES AND UPCOMING ANTICIPATED MILESTONES:**\n\n**Tibulizumab**\n\n _Systemic sclerosis_\n\n  * In September 2024, the protocol for the Phase 2 clinical program in systemic sclerosis was finalized.\n  * The Orphan Drug Designation application was completed, and the request was submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in Q4 2024.\n  * The Phase 2 clinical trial of tibulizumab for the treatment of SSc is anticipated to initiate in Q4 2024.\n\n\n\n_Hidradenitis suppurativa_\n\n  * In September 2024, a third-party CRO was selected to oversee and conduct the Phase 2 clinical program in HS.\n  * The Pre-IND meeting request was submitted in Q4 2024 and the IND submission to the FDA for a Phase 2 trial of tibulizumab in HS is expected in Q1 2025.\n  * The Phase 2 trial of tibulizumab for the treatment of HS is anticipated to initiate in Q2 2025.\n\n\n\n**Crebankitug**\n\n  * Ongoing monitoring of external Phase 2 data releases from other companies relating to IL-7Rα inhibitors in development for conditions such as ulcerative colitis, atopic dermatitis and alopecia areata.\n\n\n\n**Torudokimab**\n\n  * Ongoing monitoring of external Phase 2 and Phase 3 IL-33/ST2 data releases from other companies related to asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\n\n\n**Corporate Highlights**\n\n  * In August 2024, the company successfully completed a warrant exchange program, simplifying its capital structure.\n  * As of September 2024, an “at-the-market” (ATM) program is in place, providing the company with increased financial flexibility.\n\n\n\n**THIRD QUARTER 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTS:**\n\n**Cash and Cash Equivalents**\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $188.2 million as of September 30, 2024, as compared to $99.8 million as of December 31, 2023. Zura Bio anticipates that its existing cash and cash equivalents and investments should be sufficient to support operations as currently planned through 2027.\n\n**Operating Results**\n\nResearch and development expenses were $6.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $2.0 million compared to $4.0 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $1.7 million in personnel compensation for research and development functions including share-based compensation and an increase of $0.9 million for consulting services costs for preparation of clinical trials, partially offset by a decrease of $0.7 million in manufacturing costs.\n\nGeneral and Administrative expenses were $13.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $7.1 million compared to $6.2 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to $5.3 million in share-based compensation, driven by a one-time non-cash expense, as well as $1.6 million in fees related to the warrant exchange.\n\n**Net Loss**\n\nNet loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $22.9 million or $0.26 per share compared to $8.3 million or $0.18 per share for the same period in 2023.\n\n**ABOUT ZURA BIO**\n\nZura Bio is a clinical-stage, multi-asset immunology company developing novel dual-pathway antibodies for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.
