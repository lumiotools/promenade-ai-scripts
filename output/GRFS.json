Facility extension\n\n[ Download PDF ](/documents/6155538/7131695/np-20241211-en.pdf/23284003-cd12-dec9-5d80-09fe2e591ee7?t=1733936079578)\n\n**\n\n  * No funded maturities till November 2027\n  * Significantly improved liquidity position\n  * Leverage neutral transaction\n  * Remain on course to deliver a record financial performance in 2024\n\n**\n\n**_Barcelona, Spain – December 11, 2024_** – Grifols (MCE:GRF, MCE:GRF.P, NASDAQ:GRFS), a global healthcare company and leading manufacturer of plasma-derived medicines, today announced the execution of an agreement for a private placement (the “Offering”) of EUR 1.3 billion of 7.125% senior secured notes due May 2030 at par. In conjunction with the Offering, Grifols has also entered into an agreement to partially extend and upsize its Revolving Credit Facility (“RCF”) through May 2027.\n\nTaken as a whole, the two transactions will be leverage neutral, as EUR 300 million of the proceeds from the Offering will be used, together with cash on hand, to redeem the remaining balance of EUR 343 million of the company’s senior secured notes due February 2025 and the remaining EUR 1.0 billion will be used to fully clean down the outstanding amount under its revolving facility alongside its extension to May 2027. Subject to the closing of the transactions and application of proceeds, Grifols’ liquidity position will improve significantly, increasing by c.EUR 1 billion to c.EUR 1.7 billion on a proforma basis as of Q3 2024.\n\nThe closing of the Offering and the RCF extension, each of which is subject to customary closing conditions, are expected to occur on or around December 19, 2024. These transactions will conclude Grifols’ actions to significantly delever, proactively manage all its maturities, strengthen its liquidity, while staying resolutely focused on its inspiring mission of improving patients’ lives globally and serving donors.\n\n“This important leverage-neutral step is supported by a group of high-quality investors and global banks and concludes the balance sheet improvement process at Grifols, paving the way for a potential significant rerating of the Grifols story over time,” saidRahul Srinivasan,Grifols’ Chief Financial Officer. “Now, in addition to the rapid deleveraging that has already been achieved this year, we will have no funded maturities of any significance until November 2027 and a very strong liquidity position. We can look forward to focusing all our attention on capturing the immense opportunities across our highly attractive portfolio and delivering on our improved free cashflow generation priority. We remain on course to deliver a record financial performance in 2024, significantly improving on our prior record in 2023.”\n\nGrifols’ CEO Nacho Abia said: \"This successful transaction reflects clear confidence and support for Grifols. As we approach 2025, this achievement underscores our ability to deliver on our strategic commitments. With a strong financial position, we are well positioned to continue delivering transformative therapies that make a meaningful difference in the lives of patients around the world.\"\n\nThe new EUR 1.3 billion private placement includes strong support from a broad based group of global investors. BofA Securities, J.P. Morgan, Deutsche Bank and Santander acted as Lead Placement Agents and DNB, HSBC, Commerzbank, BBVA, Landesbank Hessen-Thüringen, Citibank, UBS, Nomura and Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE acted as Joint Placement Agents on the private placement. The same bank group acted as Bookrunners on the RCF extension to May 2027.\n\nGrifols retained Osborne Clarke and Proskauer Rose LLP as legal advisors and Milbank LLP served as legal advisor to the banks and investors.\n\nThis website uses its own and third party essential (to remember your settings) and non-essential (to analyse our traffic and show you personalized advertising based on a profile made from your browsing habits) cookies.

](/documents/6155538/7087373/np-20241127-en.pdf/72da239e-eb47-b66b-618d-2be8fe46ff99?t=1732732584695)\n\n**_Barcelona, Spain, Nov. 27, 2024_** – The Board of Directors of Grifols (MCE:GRF, MCE:GRF.P, NASDAQ:GRFS), a global healthcare company and leading manufacturer of plasma-derived medicines, today announced the termination of discussions with Brookfield Capital Partners (UK) Limited (“Brookfield”) regarding a potential acquisition of Grifols shares.\n\nThis followed the statement on November 19 by the Board of Directors of Grifols, based on the recommendation of its Transaction Committee, that it would not recommend shareholders of the company to accept a potential offer from Brookfield with a valuation of €6.45 billion for the entirety of the company’s outstanding share capital (comprising both Class A and Class B shares). This indicative, non-binding valuation from Brookfield implied a price of €10.50 per Class A share, which was deemed to significantly undervalue the company’s fundamental prospects and long-term potential.\n\nThis assessment is supported by the company’s robust financial performance, as highlighted in its Q3 2024 results, which demonstrate Grifols’ strong fundamentals and its ability to capture substantial global demand across key markets. Year-to-date revenues increased by 9.1% at constant currency year-over-year, driven by solid results across all business divisions and also maintains a solid financial position. In recent months, Grifols has successfully reduced its leverage, following the repayment of senior secured debt after receiving €1.6 billion from the sale of a 20% equity stake in Shanghai RAAS, along with a notable improvement in EBITDA adjusted, which for the last twelve months reached €1.7bn.\n\nThis announcement comes after a comprehensive due diligence exercise has been conducted, with Brookfield granted access to all requested information. Throughout this period, Grifols provided full access to the company’s data and management, which was sufficient to make an informed assessment of the company's fundamental value in the context of a potential public tender offer.\n\nThe Board of Directors and management team of Grifols remain fully committed to executing the company’s strategic plan, which is focused on enhancing long-term value. In alignment with this commitment, Grifols will soon announce a Capital Markets Day, where it will present its strategic vision under new leadership, alongside key initiatives designed to unlock growth opportunities and drive sustained performance.\n\nThis website uses its own and third party essential (to remember your settings) and non-essential (to analyse our traffic and show you personalized advertising based on a profile made from your browsing habits) cookies.

](/documents/6155538/7021314/np-20241107-en.pdf/eb6212a5-9c3d-82eb-fd08-6ad40086b91c?t=1730998096095)\n\n**\n\n  * Revenue increased by 12.4% cc1 to EUR 1,793 million for the third quarter driven by Biopharma (+12.1% cc), with a year-to-date revenue of EUR 5,237 million, an increase of 9.1% cc\n  * Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter grew by 26.7% cc to EUR 462 million (25.8% margin), bringing year-to-date EBITDA to EUR 1,253 million (23.9% margin) driven by product mix, lower cost per liter and operational leverage\n  * Free Cash Flow2 increased to EUR 127 million in the quarter primarily driven by improved working capital management\n  * Net profit was EUR 52 million (EUR 88 million YTD), impacted by non-recurring financial and tax expenses associated with the debt reduction following the sale of the 20% of SRAAS. Net income excluding one-offs amounted to EUR 264 million for the first nine months of the year\n  * Leverage ratio3 declined sequentially to 5.1x from 6.8x in Q1’24\n  * Reaffirmed guidance for full year 2024\n\n**\n\n**Barcelona, Spain – November 7, 2024** – Grifols (MCE:GRF, MCE:GRF.P, NASDAQ:GRFS), a global healthcare company and leading manufacturer of plasma-derived medicines, reported strong third quarter results, delivering sequential improvement across key metrics.\n\n**Nacho Abia** , Chief Executive Officer, commented, “I am proud of the strong third quarter performance delivered by the entire Grifols team. We have successfully built growth momentum, maintained disciplined cost control and advanced our continuous improvement initiatives. With this work underway, and our strong fundamentals, we continue to make progress on achieving our 2024 targets.”\n\n**Rahul Srinivasan** , Chief Financial Officer, said “This record-breaking quarter stands as a testament to the passion and commitment of our entire team at Grifols towards our mission of improving patients' lives globally and supporting our donors. We remain firmly focused on our ongoing priorities of deleveraging and free cash flow generation.”\n\n**Business Segment Performance**\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, total revenue reached EUR 1,793 million, a year-over-year increase of 12.4% cc (12.2% on a reported basis). This brought year-to-date revenue to EUR 5,237 million, up 9.1% cc (8.6% reported), driven by strength in Biopharma.\n\n**Biopharma** revenue grew by 12.1% cc (12.1% reported) in Q3’24 to EUR 1,533 million across key geographies, supported by strong demand for key proteins, particularly immunoglobins (+16.6% cc) and albumin (+11.7% cc) in the U.S. and international markets. Year-to-date revenue grew by 9.9% cc (9.6% reported) to EUR 4,455 million.\n\nThe immunoglobin franchise grew by 14.3% cc in the first nine months of the year as a result of successful launches in Europe and strong performance in the U.S. of subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG), which increased by 51.8% cc. Albumin grew by 10.3% cc year-to-date, mainly driven by higher demand in China. Additionally, Alpha-1 and specialty proteins grew 1.3% cc year-to-date, driven by higher demand of Rabies in the US, while Alpha-1’s saw a paced recovery in the third quarter following the strategic transition of our specialty pharma distributor in the U.S.\n\n**Diagnostic** sales were up 1.7% cc (+0% reported) on a like-for-like basis4 to EUR 479 million in the first nine months of the year, increasing 1.3% cc (+0% reported) in the third quarter. Improved performance was mainly driven by Blood Typing Solutions, up 13.7% cc year-to-date (+11.4% cc in the quarter), as well as our Nucleic Acid Testing Donor Screening (NAT) business, which grew by 3.5% cc in the third quarter.\n\n**Plasma** supply continues to be managed efficiently, with cost per liter (CPL) declining modestly in the third quarter, further extending the significant drop since peak cost in July 2022. The outlook for plasma costs remains positive, with opportunities for further cost reductions stemming from continuous improvement initiatives aimed at increasing efficiencies.\n\n**Financial Performance and Leverage**\n\n**Adjusted****EBITDA** in the third quarter was EUR 462 million with a 25.8% margin, an increase of 26.7% cc (24.6% reported) compared to the third quarter of 2023. Year-to-date, adjusted EBITDA was EUR 1,253 million, an increase of 25.0% cc (23.1% reported). This performance reflects an enhanced product mix, gross margin improvement following the reducing of cost per liter reported over the last quarters, and strong commercial execution and operational leverage.\n\n**Reported** **EBITDA** for the third quarter was EUR 425 million and EUR 1,149 million in the first nine months of 2024, with margins of 23.7% and 21.9%, respectively. In the third quarter, reported EBITDA mainly included close to EUR 30 million of non-recurring transaction and restructuring costs and EUR 5 million from the Biotest Next Level (BNL) project5.\n\n**Reported net profit** stands at EUR 88 million year-to-date, an increase of EUR 102 million year-over-year, driven by a strong third quarter total of EUR 52 million. Net profit was impacted by certain non-recurring financial and tax expenses associated with the Company’s efforts to reduce debt and the SRAAS transaction. Excluding these items, the Company’s net profit amounted to EUR 264 million in the first nine months of the year.\n\n**Free Cash Flow 6** increased to EUR 127 million for the third quarter, reflecting sequential improvement compared to the EUR 253 million deficit in the first quarter and EUR 57 million in the second quarter. Third quarter Free Cash Flow was mainly driven by improved working capital management.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Grifols had a **net financial debt** as per the Credit Facility of EUR 8,128 million. This amount does not include the impact of the financial obligations related to leasing, primarily of plasma centers (IFRS 16) – the related impact is EUR 1,080 million. Therefore, net financial debt on the Balance Sheet stood at EUR 9,208 million. Liquidity position stands at EUR 704 million.\n\n**Deleveraging** remains a top priority, with the leverage ratio standing at 5.1x7 for the quarter, down from 5.5x in the second quarter of 2024 and 6.8x in the first quarter. The company remains focused on strengthening its financial profile, as evidenced by the allocation of all proceeds from the EUR 1.6 billion SRAAS asset sale to reduce the 2025 Senior Secured Notes and 2027 Term Loan B’s in the third quarter.\n\n**Alternative Performance Measures (APMs)**\n\nThis document contains the following Alternative Performance Measures (APMs): Consolidated EBITDA Reported, Consolidated EBITDA Adjusted, Leverage Ratio as per the Credit Facility, Net Debt as per the Credit Facility, Free Cash Flow, Working Capital, and non-recurring items.
