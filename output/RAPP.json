Whereas AMPARs are distributed widely in the central nervous system (CNS), TARPγ8 is expressed only in discrete regions, including the hippocampus and cortex. Because of this restricted expression of TARPγ8 in forebrain regions, the Company believes RAP-219 has the potential to provide a differentiated clinical profile, including improved activity and tolerability along with a higher therapeutic index, potentially providing more patients with sustained therapeutic benefit without intolerable side effects, as compared to traditional neuroscience medications. Due to the role of AMPA biology in various neurological disorders and the precision approach of selective targeting of TARPγ8, the Company believes RAP-219 has significant pipeline-in-a-product potential and is currently evaluating the compound as a transformational treatment for patients with focal epilepsy, peripheral neuropathic pain, and bipolar disorder.\n\n**About Rapport Therapeutics** Rapport Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biotechnology company dedicated to discovering and developing small molecule precision medicines for patients suffering from central nervous system (CNS) disorders. The Company’s founders have made pioneering discoveries related to the function of receptor associated proteins (RAPs) in the brain. Their findings form the basis of Rapport’s RAP technology platform, which enables a differentiated approach to generate precision small molecule product candidates with the potential to overcome many limitations of conventional neurology drug discovery. Rapport’s precision neuroscience pipeline includes the Company’s lead clinical program, RAP-219, designed to achieve neuroanatomical specificity through its selective targeting of a RAP expressed in only discrete regions of the brain. The Company is currently advancing RAP-219 in clinical trials in focal epilepsy, peripheral neuropathic pain, and bipolar disorder. Additional preclinical and late-stage discovery stage programs are also underway, targeting CNS disorders including chronic pain and hearing disorders.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements** This press release contains​ “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each as amended.

Young was recently inducted into the American Chemistry Society Hall of Fame, and she has also been named “One of the Top 20 Women in Biopharma” by _Endpoints News_ and “Most Influential Women in SF Bay Area” by the _San Francisco Times_.\n\n**RAP-219 Lead Program**\n\nRAP-219 is designed to selectively target TARPγ8, a receptor-associated protein (RAP) which is associated with the neuronal AMPAR (neuronal α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor), a clinically validated target for epilepsy. The Company is also evaluating RAP-219 as a potential treatment for peripheral neuropathic pain and bipolar disorder.\n\n  * The Company is conducting a second multiple ascending dose trial (MAD-2) of RAP-219, expected to be completed in Q4 2024. The trial will assess additional dosing regimens specifically to inform dosing for its Phase 2a trial for the treatment of bipolar acute mania. The initial MAD trial demonstrated that RAP-219 was generally well tolerated at target therapeutic exposures, with no serious adverse events and no drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) above Grade 1.\n  * A Phase 1 human positron emission tomography (PET) trial in healthy adult volunteers is currently underway, utilizing a companion PET radiotracer to confirm brain target receptor occupancy and brain region specificity across a range of RAP-219 dosing and exposure levels.\n  * Topline results from both the MAD-2 and PET trials will be released in Q1 2025.\n  * The Company continues to progress the development of a long-acting injectable formulation of RAP-219 as the first potential anti-seizure medication (ASM) in a depot formulation, offering greater ease-of-use and potentially improved patient adherence.\n\n\n\n_Focal Epilepsy_\n\n  * Patient recruitment and screening is underway for the Company’s Phase 2a proof of concept trial in focal epilepsy. The trial is on track, and topline results are expected in mid-2025.\n    * The Phase 2a trial is enrolling adult patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy who have an implanted responsive neurostimulation (RNS) device and are demographically similar to those expected in future registrational trials.\n    * The RNS device continually captures intracranial electroencephalography data and records the frequency of long episodes (LEs), which are often referred to as subclinical seizures and serve as a biomarker to clinical seizures. LEs function as a biomarker-based endpoint, supporting more efficient and objective efficacy results. After the initiation of new antiseizure medication, a 30% reduction of LEs has been shown to predict meaningful changes (≥ 50% reduction) in clinical seizure frequency.\n  * At the Annual Epilepsy Society meeting in December, the Company will have four poster presentations focused on RAP-219, highlighting preclinical data, SAD/MAD trial results, food effect data, and new analyses on the correlation between RNS-measured long episode and clinical seizure frequency in adult patients with refractory focal epilepsy.\n  * In September, the Company presented on the underlying mechanism of action for RAP-219 as well as the novel design of the Phase 2a proof-of-concept trial for the treatment of focal epilepsy at the International League Against Epilepsy 15th Annual European Epilepsy Congress and the 2024 Epilepsy Foundation Pipeline Conference. \n\n\n\n _Peripheral Neuropathic Pain_\n\n  * The Company was recently notified by the FDA that the IND submitted by the Company for the initiation of a Phase 2a proof-of-concept trial of RAP-219 for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP) was placed on clinical hold. The FDA requested additional information and amendments specific to the protocol design. The clinical hold is specific to the IND for DPNP and has not impacted the Company’s ongoing Phase 2a trial in focal epilepsy or planned proof-of-concept trial in bipolar disorder. The Company believes in its ability to resolve the clinical hold in DPNP and will provide an update on the anticipated timing of the Phase 2a trial initiation once available. \n\n\n\n _Bipolar Disorder_\n\n  * The Company plans to initiate a Phase 2a trial in bipolar disorder patients with acute mania in 2025. \n\n\n\n**Preclinical and Discovery Programs**\n\n  * With growing confidence in RAP-219 and a commitment to disciplined capital allocation, the Company is deferring further investment in RAP-199 and focusing resources on execution of its three RAP-219 proof-of-concept clinical trials.\n  * The Company continues to advance its RAP-enabled nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) discovery-stage programs – modulators of a6 nAChR for the potential treatment of chronic pain, and modulators of a9a10 nAChR for the potential treatment of hearing loss.\n\n\n\n**THIRD QUARTER 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTS**\n\n  * Net loss was $17.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to $8.7 million for the prior year period.\n  * Research and development expense was $15.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to $7.6 million for the prior year period. The increase in research and development expense was primarily driven by operational costs related to clinical development and costs to support the progression of the Company’s overall pipeline.\n  * General and administrative expense was $6.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to $2.0 million for the prior year period. The increase in general and administrative expense was primarily driven by costs associated with the growth of the business, in addition to costs incurred to satisfy the requirements of becoming and operating as a public company.\n  * The Company ended the third quarter with $320.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, compared to $336.1 million as of June 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to cash outflows on operating activities in the third quarter of 2024.\n  * The Company expects that current cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of September 30, 2024, will enable the Company to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through the end of 2026. \n\n\n\n**About RAP-219**\n\nRAP-219 is a clinical-stage AMPAR (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor) negative allosteric modulator (NAM) designed to achieve neuroanatomical specificity through its selective targeting of a RAP known as TARPγ8, which is associated with the neuronal AMPAR.

(Nasdaq: RAPP), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on discovery and development of small molecule precision medicines for patients suffering from central nervous system (CNS) disorders, today announced that management will participate in fireside chats at two upcoming investor conferences as follows:\n\n  * **The Stifel Healthcare Conference in New York City** Monday, November 18, 2024, at 1:15pm ET\n\n\n  * **The Jefferies London Healthcare Conference** Wednesday, November 20, 2024, at 4:00pm GMT/11am ET\n\n\n\nInterested parties may access the live and archived webcasts under the “Investors” section of the company’s website at: [https://investors.rapportrx.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=0k6V4j0J4k98OkDhJ-Mmii5WT4pC2xHNJKvaY9wilf6lQ_gmO7LRkzWVhvLrHsyGSB6XWCU0p9xewTmdi1IX0i_yDDkX3iWlo73UUCThc7t8w4QjEoIfjwOoUMWdHwsv).\n\n**About Rapport Therapeutics**\n\nRapport Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biotechnology company dedicated to discovering and developing transformational precision neuromedicines for patients suffering from central nervous system (CNS) disorders. The Company’s founders have made pioneering discoveries related to the function of receptor associated proteins (RAPs) in the brain. Their findings form the basis of Rapport’s RAP technology platform, which enables a differentiated approach to generate precision small molecule product candidates with the potential to overcome many limitations of conventional neurology drug discovery. Rapport’s precision neuroscience pipeline includes the Company’s lead clinical program, RAP-219, designed to achieve neuroanatomical specificity through its selective targeting of a RAP expressed in only discrete regions of the brain. The Company is currently advancing RAP-219 in clinical trials in focal epilepsy, peripheral neuropathic pain, and bipolar disorder. Additional preclinical and late-stage discovery stage programs are also underway, targeting CNS disorders including chronic pain and hearing disorders.\n\n**Contact**\n\nJulie DiCarloHead of Communications & IRRapport Therapeutics[jdicarlo@rapportrx.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=aQov50c8zRpfHMz4j9toqajKu1BZcqnuhmmQmZJM3gSbVyovLCV2h3l9rBcnXdr5zm_mLKzk6r5QxY4sK7Ly4jCwExI8ZgVETzOPpmimS6E=)\n\nSource: [https://www.rapportrx.com/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=0k6V4j0J4k98OkDhJ-Mmih6LnK9mg4uO0MS47XwgSKyZu2LsvRZ2RU73MiHlUfOaGJtAqwLYQp3tAuWIbXRXPrgPTDqczkzdeJNfZs_dqd0=)\n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/N2QwNzA3NzktMmVhMy00MDM4LWI4NzMtMjgyOTcyNzc4OWU5LTEzMDEyMTQ=/tiny/Rapport-Therapeutics-Inc-.png)\n"
