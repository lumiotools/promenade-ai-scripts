The reason for the decrease in revenue was that the company's original business had been declining while the Company attempted to enter into new businesses.\n\nRevenue from the prepaid payment network services business decreased by $0.18 million, or 100%, to $82 in the six months ended June 30, 2023, from $0.18 million for the same period of last year. Total number of merchant customers who used the Company's prepaid payment network services was 1 in the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 8 in the same period in 2022. During the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company provided technology consulting and support services to these customers. The Company charged such merchant customers service fees for designing tailored payment solutions, interfacing their internal systems with the Company's prepaid card payment system, and providing their staff with relevant operation training.
