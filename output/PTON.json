Additionally, the company completed its first-ever product carbon footprint assessment for the Peloton Bike, marking an important step in its sustainability journey. \n\n\n  * **Social impact programs:** Peloton celebrated three years of social impact partnerships across the US, UK, Canada, Germany and Australia; reaching ~199,000 individuals in the past year through Peloton’s Wellbeing for Life community engagement program. \n\n\n  * **Corporate equality recognition** : Peloton earned a perfectscore on the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index, highlighting the company’s leadership in LGBTQ+ workplace inclusion, and reflecting its broader commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. \n\n\n  * **Adaptive fitness programs:** In partnership with Paralympian Tom Miazga, Peloton launched the Seated Adaptive Transfer Program in December 2023.

Find your power. campaign features football player brothers T.J. and J.J. Watt_\n\nNEW YORK, Nov. 1, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Peloton (NASDAQ: PTON) today announced the launch of its new multi-phase creative campaign:  _Find your push. Find your power_. The campaign acknowledges how motivation looks differently for everyone and celebrates Peloton's role in helping people find what pushes them to show up and reach their goals in fitness. In the first North America-based phase of  _Find your push. Find your power._ , Peloton targets millennial males by leveraging the 'friendly', real-life sibling rivalry between US football player brothers T.J. and J.J. Watt.\n\nExperience the full interactive Multichannel News Release here: [https://www.multivu.com/peloton/9205451-en-peloton-launches-multi-phase-creative-campaign-drive-demand-new-audiences](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4292790-1&h=3204610412&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.multivu.com%2Fpeloton%2F9205451-en-peloton-launches-multi-phase-creative-campaign-drive-demand-new-audiences&a=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.multivu.com%2Fpeloton%2F9205451-en-peloton-launches-multi-phase-creative-campaign-drive-demand-new-audiences)\n\nAs part of Peloton's evolving go-to-market strategy, the company is taking a more balanced marketing approach to how it creates demand among new audiences. Today, two-thirds of Peloton Members are women, which provides an opportunity for the company to attract more men to the platform by using targeted messaging that resonates with their fitness needs.\n\n\"Our brand research has shown that more than 70 percent of millennial males engage with running, but many in that same audience set are either not aware of our Tread and running offerings or are unsure if we'll deliver a challenging enough fitness experience for them,\" said Lauren Weinberg, Peloton Chief Marketing Officer. \"Enter T.J. and J.J. Watt, Peloton Members who already compete against each other on the Peloton Leaderboard. Partnering with them is an organic way to counter these misperceptions by showcasing that we have challenging workout options that are hard enough, even for elite athletes.\"\n\nMotivation has long been an important part of the Peloton experience, but  _Find your push. Find your power._ taps into a deeper human power that energizes people to stay on track with their fitness routines. Produced in partnership with creative agency Special London, the first phase of the campaign demonstrates how sibling rivalry fuels both T.J. and J.J. to push harder in their workouts, competing against each other across many different fitness disciplines on the Peloton Leaderboard. The brothers rotate through various workouts, including running on the Peloton Tread, cycling on the Peloton Bike, and doing strength training and yoga with the Peloton App. Regardless of the activity, the innate competitive nature of the brothers pushes them to their maximum effort.\n\nThe first phase of the  _Find your push. Find your power._ campaign launches globally, with 0:30, 0:15, and 0:06 spots featuring the Watt brothers airing in North America on various channels in both English and Spanish (in the US only), including television, digital, social and over-the-top streaming content.\n\nThe work represents the first campaign from a new agency relationship with Special London. David Day, Chief Creative Officer, Special London, said of the work: \"The sibling rivalry that lies at the heart of this first campaign is not only something most of us can instantly relate to, but there was no better duo than NFL legends T.J. and J.J. Watt to bring that idea to life. Their natural competitive spirit and sense of humor helped us to encapsulate Peloton's motivational power - the power to engage and encourage people to work out and to get them to come back for more.\"\n\nFor more information, visit [onepeloton.com](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4292790-1&h=3202995089&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.onepeloton.com%2F&a=onepeloton.com) and follow the brand on [Instagram](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4292790-1&h=1551083217&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fonepeloton%2F&a=Instagram), [Facebook](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4292790-1&h=3986603210&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fonepeloton%2F&a=Facebook) and [TikTok](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4292790-1&h=3621862949&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40onepeloton%3Flang%3Den&a=TikTok).\n\n**Peloton Credits:** Lauren Weinberg - Chief Marketing OfficerJoanna Lee - Senior Vice President, Global Consumer and Brand MarketingSam Walter - Senior Director, Brand and Integrated MarketingCindy De La Rosa - Senior Manager, Consumer MarketingErick Rodriguez - Creative DirectorAyorinde Iranlowo-Ifatunji - Assistant Brand Manager\n\n**Special London Credits:** Cade Heyde - Global PartnerRichard Sweetman - General ManagerDavid Day - Chief Creative OfficerDevon Hong - Creative DirectorThomas Worthington - Senior Art DirectorGregory Fazal - Senior CopywriterEmily Harlock - Chief Strategy OfficerKelsey Karson - Head of StrategyIzzy Dixon - Business DirectorLinda Rafoss and Cara Brophy - Agency ProducerNader Abushhab - PhotographerMichel + Nico / Merman - Director/Production CoKira Carstensen, EP - ProducerRoss Hallard/Trim Edit - EditorCosmo Street Editorial - Post ProductionStarr Whitesides - DoP\n\n**Press Contact:** Letena Lindsay, press@onepeloton.com\n\n**About Peloton** Peloton (NASDAQ: PTON) provides Members with expert instruction, and world class content to create impactful and entertaining workout experiences for anyone, anywhere and at any stage in their fitness journey.
