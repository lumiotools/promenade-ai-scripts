An Advanced Access (AA) program was conducted in July 2024 with a group of customers and partners, including large corporations, legal service providers and law firms. AA users tested the end-to-end solution, with a focus on usability and data accuracy, and provided feedback to Cellebrite and Relativity. It used to take days, or even weeks to go from collecting data to processing. The AA users got to experience a new era of efficiency, collecting an entire mobile device for review in RelativityOne in just over an hour.\n\n“We are so pleased to know our partnership with Relativity is reshaping the way mobile data and eDiscovery are perceived,” said Ronnen Armon, Chief Products and Technologies Officer at Cellebrite. “Our 2024 Industry Trends survey shows ninety-seven percent of eDiscovery cases now involve at least one mobile device, and our integration allows examiners to accurately and efficiently extract the data needed with minimal disruption.”\n\n\"Integrating Cellebrite’s mobile collection solutions into RelativityOne Collect significantly enhances workflow efficiency and sets a new benchmark for managing mobile data,\" said Chris Brown, Chief Product Officer at Relativity. \"The insightful feedback from our AA customers and partners highlights the positive impact this collaboration is bringing. Together, our dedicated teams will continue to drive the industry forward, unlocking the full potential of remote collection and delivering unparalleled solutions.\"\n\nAntonio Avant, Litigation Technology Manager at Troutman Pepper eMerge, said the RelativityOne and Cellebrite Mobile Collection and Conversion integration allows them to keep up with growing demand and last-minute mobile collection requests. “From our work alone this year, we’ve seen at least a 30 to almost 40 percent increase in mobile data collection,” Avant said, adding that from a staffing perspective, this “allows me to do a lot more with less.”\n\nRemote mobile device collections can now be fully orchestrated and monitored, end to end, all from within RelativityOne Collect. This includes custodian notification, device collection and an automatic and secure transfer of the mobile data through the integration with Cellebrite Endpoint Inspector directly into RelativityOne. All short message data is automatically converted to Relativity Short Message Format (RSMF), which allows a near native review experience in the RelativityOne Viewer. This integration is designed for ease of use, ensuring that partners and enterprise users can operate it without ever having to travel to the custodian or take possession of the device.\n\n“It’s a game changer for us to be able to handle our own cellphone collections,” said Chris Cameron, Director of Account Services at PLUSnxt. “We don’t have a forensics team on staff, we have partners we have to call up to do cellphone collections, but now that’s something we can do.”\n\nAs a promotion for this exciting collaboration, Cellebrite and Relativity are currently offering customers three complimentary collections through the Cellebrite Endpoint Inspector – RelativityOne integration: https://enterprise.cellebrite.com/a-powerful-partnership-to-revolutionize-your-ediscovery-workflow/ \n\n**About Cellebrite**\n\nCellebrite’s (Nasdaq: CLBT) mission is to enable its customers to protect and save lives, accelerate justice and preserve privacy in communities around the world.

The corrected release follows:\n\nCellebrite (NASDAQ: CLBT), a global leader in premier Digital Investigative solutions for the public and private sectors, today announced financial results for the three and nine months ending September 30, 2024.\n\nYossi Carmil, Cellebrite’s CEO, stated, “We delivered a strong third-quarter performance that exceeded our expectations thanks to increasing traction with our AI-driven Case-to-Closure platform, the impact of our ongoing investment in market-leading innovation and solid execution on all fronts. We produced notable ARR growth, surpassed $100 million in quarterly revenue for the first time in company history and generated outstanding profitability. Our customers are increasingly recognizing the value of how Cellebrite’s powerful end-to-end solutions can enable them to efficiently and effectively address major pain points in the digital investigative lifecycle. Against the backdrop of a healthy market, we anticipate a positive fourth quarter finish to our year and have updated our full-year outlook accordingly.”\n\n**Third-Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Revenue of $106.9 million, up 27% year-over-year\n  * Subscription revenue was $93.4 million, up 27% year-over-year\n  * Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) of $370.8 million, up 26% year-over-year\n  * Recurring revenue dollar-based net retention rate of 124%\n  * GAAP gross profit and gross margin of $91.4 million and 85.5%, respectively; Non-GAAP gross profit and gross profit margin of $92.0 million and 86.1%, respectively\n  * GAAP net loss of $207.1 million; Non-GAAP net income of $31.8 million\n  * GAAP diluted loss per share of $(0.99); Non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.14\n  * Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin of $31.3 million and 29.3%, respectively\n\n\n\n**Third-Quarter 2024 and Recent Business & Operational Highlights**\n\n _Innovation_\n\n  * On September 15, 2024, Cellebrite announced Pathfinder in the Cloud with Amazon Web Services (AWS), allowing customers to access Cellebrite’s industry-leading investigative analytics solution, Pathfinder, through the secure Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Pathfinder in the Cloud with AWS, part of Cellebrite’s Case-to-Closure (C2C) platform, helps agencies of all sizes eliminate both the need to purchase and maintain physical servers as well as the common reliance on dedicated server rooms and sensitive compartmented information facility (SCIF) secure rooms. With this update, customers can now quickly scale storage and resources based on demand, while preserving resources as they only pay for what is needed. \n\n  * On September 24, 2024, Cellebrite announced that it received a patent for Remote Mobile Collection, which equips corporate investigators with immediate, targeted remote data collection – saving them time and money. In today’s hybrid work environment, Cellebrite’s SaaS platforms Endpoint Mobile Now and Endpoint Inspector leverage this newly patented technology to deliver high value, supporting rapid data collection and offer greater convenience to the device’s consenting owner, who can keep their devices during collection rather than returning them to a corporate office. \n\n\n\n\n _Go to Market_\n\n  * On October 29, 2024, Cellebrite announced that its inaugural [Case-to-Closure (C2C) User Summit](https://events.cellebritec2c.com/event/ec371a30-107d-4ce4-8bad-44e331148339/websitePage:1f2e0d12-6569-41bd-ab82-15fb4bc2b9f5), the premier event for digital investigations being held from March 31 to April 3, 2025, in Washington, D.C., will feature Tim Tebow as the keynote speaker. Tim Tebow is a two-time national football champion, Heisman Trophy winner, first-round NFL draft pick and a former professional baseball player who is also known for his extensive advocacy work to protect children through his namesake foundation. At the C2C User Summit, Tim Tebow will address his foundation’s global fight against human trafficking, complementing Cellebrite’s Operation Find Them All (OFTA) initiative, a landmark commitment to accelerating investigations of online crimes against children. \n\n\n\n\n _Capital Markets_\n\n  * Cellebrite’s efforts to drive value creation for shareholders underpinned three major milestones: \n\n    * On September 16, 2024, Cellebrite disclosed that 5.0 million Price Adjustment Shares will be issued and 3.0 million Restricted Sponsored Shares vested after the dollar volume-weighted average price of the Company’s ordinary shares was greater than or equal to $15.00 per share for the 20th trading day within a 30 trading-day period. This is the second triggering event to occur, following the one that was announced by the Company on August 15, 2024. \n\n    * On September 18, 2024, Cellebrite announced the results of the completed redemption of all of its outstanding Public and Private Warrants. Nearly all of the 20.0 million Public Warrants and 100% of the 9.7 million Private Warrants outstanding of August 15, 2024 were exercised on a cashless basis in exchange for an aggregate of approximately 10.1 million Ordinary Shares. \n\n    * On November 4, 2024, Cellebrite disclosed that 5.0 million Price Adjustment Shares will be issued after the dollar volume-weighted average price of the Company’s ordinary shares was greater than or equal to $17.50 per share for the 20th trading day within a 30 trading-day period. This is the third triggering event to occur, leaving 1.5 million Restricted Stock Shares that will vest when the dollar volume-weighted average price of the Company’s ordinary shares is greater than or equal to $30.00 per share for 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period. \n\n\n\n\n _Annual General Meeting_\n\n  * On September 17, 2024, Cellebrite held its 2024 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (the “Meeting”). As subsequently disclosed, shareholders approved all of the proposals brought forth during the Meeting by the respective requisite majority in accordance with the Israeli Companies Law, 5759-1999, and the Company’s articles of association, as described in the Proxy Statement which was furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 13, 2024, and sent to shareholders in connection with the Meeting. \n\n\n\n\nSupplemental financial information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website at [https://investors.cellebrite.com/financial-information/quarterly-results](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=EDeRWK_ayCzjul9OEBSQ110JVXZR0fXenBJqS1rOEI88dEio7nXuydyauckf83Dt0Jr-cJJ7BW06wypRiFb03RteJRi50088ex3l77iso7q5gyCjDEzl2OI1llXbo27143zRtiVQwmXVEKjlcgI4da5VVuNCkGvOBbVSkTQM3f0LG2EATMM47XLSutV-MOT5jAaNH4OR3JAglbROeHAZt4x8HesR9VnsCNFh3Cwrssg=).\n\n**Financial Outlook** “We delivered a very strong third-quarter performance, highlighted by strong top-line execution, prudent spending and outstanding cash generation,” stated Dana Gerner, Cellebrite’s CFO. “The completion of our broad warrant redemption program, combined with our strong stock price performance over the past several months that resulted in multiple triggering events, enable us to move forward with a more optimized capital structure, an increased stock float and simplified financial reporting. As we look ahead, based on our results for the first three quarters of the year and our assessment of the near-term opportunities, we have raised our 2024 revenue and adjusted EBITDA ranges and increased the low end of our full-year ARR range.” \n\nThe Company’s updated 2024 expectations are as follows:\n\n**Fourth-Quarter 2024 Expectations****(as of 11/06/24)**| **Full-Year 2024 Expectations****(as of 11/06/24)**  \n---|---  \nARR| --| $390 million – $400 million  \nAnnual Growth| --| 23% – 27%  \nRevenue| $105 million – $109 million| $397 million – $401 million  \nAnnual Growth| 13% – 17%| 22% – 23%  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $25 million – $29 million| $94 million – $100 million  \nAdjusted EBITDA margin| 24% – 27%| 24% – 25%  \n  \n**Conference Call Information** Cellebrite will host a live conference call and webcast later this morning to review the Company’s financial third-quarter 2024 results and discuss its full-year 2024 outlook. Pertinent details include:\n\nDate:| Tuesday, November 6, 2024  \n---|---  \nTime:| 8:30 a.m. ET  \nCall-In Number:| 203-518-9783 / 800-267-6316  \nConference ID:| CLBTQ324  \nEvent URL:| <https://investors.cellebrite.com/events/event-details/cellebrite-q3-2024-financial-results-investor-call-webcast>  \nWebcast URL:| <https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/skb7gjeh>  \n  \nIn conjunction with the conference call and webcast, historical financial tables and supplemental data will be available on the quarterly results section of Company’s investor relations website at [https://investors.cellebrite.com/financial-information/quarterly-results](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=EDeRWK_ayCzjul9OEBSQ110JVXZR0fXenBJqS1rOEI88dEio7nXuydyauckf83Dt0Jr-cJJ7BW06wypRiFb03RteJRi50088ex3l77iso7pXBHDNzX9QBkfHECsoJ9sH-htWQzlmjq67pdz-s2Lru0_o10_U2Him-biytSUEnCyXcPIAA7SuEBiYFxkzDSD6zjRyxidGY-Ssv9-m4byMrjyElNj5ZK4nlpkxcOS9eTw=).\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Information and Key Performance Indicators** This press release includes non-GAAP financial measures. Cellebrite believes that the use of non-GAAP cost of revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS and Adjusted EBITDA is helpful to investors. These measures, which the Company refers to as our non-GAAP financial measures, are not prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nThe Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide a more meaningful comparison of its operational performance from period to period, and offer investors and management greater visibility to the underlying performance of its business. Mainly:\n\n  * Share-based compensation expenses utilize varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and a variety of equity instruments that can impact a company's non-cash expenses;\n\n  * Acquired intangible assets are valued at the time of acquisition and are amortized over an estimated useful life after the acquisition, and acquisition-related expenses are unrelated to current operations and neither are comparable to the prior period nor predictive of future results;\n\n  * To the extent that the above adjustments have an effect on tax (income) expense, such an effect is excluded in the non-GAAP adjustment to net income;\n\n  * Tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense vary for many reasons that are often unrelated to our underlying performance and make period-to-period comparisons more challenging; and\n\n  * Financial instruments are remeasured according to GAAP and vary for many reasons that are often unrelated to the Company’s current operations and affect financial income. \n\n\n\n\nEach of our non-GAAP financial measures is an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating our own operating results over different periods of time. The non-GAAP financial measures do not represent our financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to operating income or net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolated from, or as an alternative to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies in our industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring, unusual items. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, and exclude expenses that may have a material impact on our reported financial results. Further, share-based compensation expense has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, significant recurring expenses in our business and an important part of the compensation provided to our employees. In addition, the amortization of intangible assets is expected recurring expense over the estimated useful life of the underlying intangible asset and acquisition-related expenses will be incurred to the extent acquisitions are made in the future. Furthermore, foreign exchange rates may fluctuate from one period to another, and the Company does not estimate movements in foreign currencies.\n\nA reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP measure is set forth in a table included at the end of this press release, which is also available on our website at [**https://investors.cellebrite.com**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=EDeRWK_ayCzjul9OEBSQ110JVXZR0fXenBJqS1rOEI9GHQg1LFsU0y2k_7QW0QO_yr0Rf9NuWpiibV8FsqLMcNahvnpwg6d8h1F7t3YlvFxyoAEGMcYc8rTmLhXRWaqe)**.**\n\nIn regard to forward-looking non-GAAP guidance, we are not able to reconcile the forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA measure to the closest corresponding GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts because we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of certain significant items including, but not limited to, fair value movements, share-based payments for future awards, tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and certain financing and tax items.\n\n**Key Performance Indicators** This press release also includes key performance indicators, including annual recurring revenue and dollar-based retention rate.\n\nAnnual recurring revenue (“ARR”) is defined as the annualized value of active term-based subscription license contracts and maintenance contracts related to perpetual licenses in effect at the end of that period. Subscription license contracts and maintenance contracts for perpetual licenses are annualized by multiplying the revenue of the last month of the period by 12. The annualized value of contracts is a legal and contractual determination made by assessing the contractual terms with our customers. The annualized value of maintenance contracts is not determined by reference to historical revenue, deferred revenue or any other GAAP financial measure over any period. ARR is not a forecast of future revenues, which can be impacted by contract start and end dates and renewal rates.\n\nDollar-based net retention rate (“NRR”) is calculated by dividing customer recurring revenue by base revenue. We define base revenue as recurring revenue we recognized from all customers with a valid license at the last quarter of the previous year period, during the four quarters ended one year prior to the date of measurement. We define our customer revenue as the recurring revenue we recognized during the four quarters ended on the date of measurement from the same customer base included in our measure of base revenue, including recurring revenue resulting from additional sales to those customers.\n\n**About Cellebrite** Cellebrite’s (Nasdaq: CLBT) mission is to enable its customers to protect and save lives, accelerate justice and preserve privacy in communities around the world.
