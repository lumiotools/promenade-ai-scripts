LifeWallet also recently entered into an agreement with one of the Company’s lenders, securing a limited waiver of the Company’s obligation to pay a promissory note, which is expected to provide additional liquidity to the Company.\n\nLifeWallet CEO, John H. Ruiz, is confident in the Company’s continued progress, saying, “Our commitment to discovering waste and recovering improper healthcare payments will continue to have a positive widespread impact.” He continues, “By tackling waste through legal, operational, and technological avenues, LifeWallet is committed to recovering improperly paid funds and promoting accountability within the healthcare system, benefitting all Americans.”\n\n**Pharmaceutical Litigation Settlement**\n\nOn November 21, 2024, LifeWallet reached a preliminary settlement totaling $2 million, subject to finalizing terms in a global settlement agreement, against a defendant for alleged violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”), and violation of various state consumer protection laws and unjust enrichment laws. The terms of the settlement are a combination of monetary and non-monetary considerations, with the non-monetary considerations involving LifeWallet obtaining prescription drug claims data that will assist in identifying and recovering against other responsible parties, including, but not limited to, at least twelve other pharmaceutical manufacturers, and distributors.\n\n**Ongoing Settlement Negotiations**\n\nAs part of LifeWallet’s owned claims portfolio, the Company is also engaged in ongoing litigation against property and casualty insurers and other pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers based on claims of anti-competitive pricing, RICO, violation of state consumer protection statutes, and defective medical products or prescription drugs.\n\nOn November 11, 2024, the Company announced two comprehensive settlements with P&C insurers, totaling more than $5.2 million, which offer a going-forward process to collaboratively and timely resolve future claims and share important historical data. LifeWallet’s exclusive data matching with primary payers is expected to enhance its claims reconciliation capabilities by identifying claims owned by LifeWallet that it may have a right to recover on, benefiting Medicare plans and downstream entities. These recent P&C insurer settlements follow three other settlements against P&C insurers earlier this year. Some of these settlements require the P&C insurers to provide data to the LifeWallet clearinghouse platform that was designed and created by LifeWallet and Palantir Technologies, Inc. \n\nThe LifeWallet/Palantir clearinghouse is a hybrid between a statistical analysis system model and one that identifies improper payments, while also having the capability to provide patients, providers, and attorneys with an individual's current and past medical conditions as they relate to improper payments or potential claims against the world's largest pharmaceutical and medical device companies.\n\nLifeWallet notes these settlements are not a guarantee that its portfolio of assigned claims (owed by other Primary Payers) can be settled with the same or similar terms. The settlement values are a combination of monetary and non-monetary considerations, with the non-monetary considerations involving LifeWallet obtaining data on all the claims that were processed and paid by the P&C Insurers, and the P&C Insurers' assignment of rights to collect against other responsible parties. LifeWallet expects this will enhance its ability to discover liens and recover payments owed more efficiently than through litigation. It also enables LifeWallet to pursue a diversified number of entities that failed to pay liens or collected twice for the same bills, both from the insurer and LifeWallet's assignor clients.\n\n**LifeWallet's Efforts to Discover and Recover Medicare and Medicaid Waste**\n\n_The Scope of the Problem_\n\nImproper payments by Medicare and Medicaid contribute significantly to government waste, accounting for billions of dollars annually.\n\n  * In fiscal year 2022, the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported $247 billion in improper payments across 82 programs, with approximately 52% attributed to Medicare and Medicaid1. This statistic was highlighted by Elon Musk, who is expected to head the newly established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) (x.com/doge), which will function as a newly created advisory board to President-elect Donald Trump. Musk commented the above numbers are “just the tip of the iceberg. The actual fraud and waste in government spending is much higher.” \n  * With Medicare and Medicaid spending surpassing $1 trillion in 2023,2 estimated waste due to accident-related injuries exceeds $100 billion.\n\n\n\n_LifeWallet's Initiatives Align with Reducing Government Waste_\n\nLifeWallet is dedicated to discovering and recovering substantial improper payments within the Medicare and Medicaid systems, particularly focusing on the Medicare Advantage program. These improper payments often result from systemic communication failures among stakeholders, leading to Medicare erroneously covering accident-related injuries and failing to recuperate those funds.\n\n  * _Litigation Against Improper Payments:_ In 2024, LifeWallet has agreed to five settlements against property and casualty insurers, in aggregate totaling more than $10 million dollars to settle historical claims of improper payments, as well as obtain data to pursue claims for additional improper payments and establish a clearinghouse to efficiently settle future claims with certain P&C Insurers. \n  * _Additional Claims Acquisition_ : In October 2024, LifeWallet paid approximately $2 million dollars to acquire additional Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) claims with an overall Paid Amount3 exceeding $10.6 billion, encompassing over 450,000 Medicare members. This claims acquisition enhances LifeWallet's ability to identify and recover improper payments.4\n  * _Technological Enhancements:_ In 2023, continuing into 2024, LifeWallet has developed the LifeWallet/Palantir clearinghouse that connects P&C Insurers to health plans, allowing for elimination of waste from improper payments made for accident-related injuries.\n\n\n\nWhile these efforts represent steps toward addressing systemic issues in Medicare and Medicaid spending, comprehensive reform requires collaboration among all stakeholders. Individuals expected to be appointed to President-elect Trump's advisory committee, called the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), are emphasizing the importance of addressing Medicare waste, advocating for enhanced oversight and stricter enforcement measures to curb improper payments. Their efforts align with LifeWallet's continued mission to reduce waste and improve efficiency in healthcare spending.\n\n**Nomura Limited Waiver of Company's Obligation to Pay**\n\nOn November 18, 2024, Company lender, Nomura Securities International, Inc. (\"Nomura\"), agreed to a limited waiver of the Company’s obligation to pay promissory note obligations using the proceeds of the Standby Equity Purchase Agreement dated November 14, 2023 by and between the Company and YA II PN, Ltd. until March 31, 2025, and up to an aggregate total of $4 million of such proceeds that would otherwise be paid to Nomura; provided that such proceeds be used to fund the operations of the Company. This waiver is expected to create more liquidity for the Company, to invest in accelerating healthcare reimbursement recoveries.\n\n**Forward Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements may generally be identified by the use of words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan\" and “will” or, in each case, their negative, or other variations or comparable terminology.

Factors that could cause these differences include, but are not limited to, the Company’s ability to capitalize on its assignment agreements and recover monies that were paid by the assignors; the inherent uncertainty surrounding settlement negotiations and/or litigation, including with respect to both the amount and timing of any such results; the success of the Company's scheduled settlement mediations; the validity of the assignments of claims to the Company; negative publicity concerning healthcare data analytics and payment accuracy; and those other factors included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other reports filed by it with the SEC. These statements constitute the Company’s cautionary statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\n\n**About LifeWallet**\n\nFounded in 2014 as MSP Recovery, LifeWallet has become a Medicare, Medicaid, commercial, and secondary payer reimbursement recovery leader, disrupting the antiquated healthcare reimbursement system with data-driven solutions to secure recoveries from responsible parties.

This amount varies based on the party making payment. For example, Medicare typically pays a lower fee for service rate than commercial insurers. The Paid Amount is derived from the Claims data we receive from our Assignors. In the limited instances where the data received lacks a paid value, our team calculates the Paid Amount with a formula. The formula used provides rates for outpatient services and is derived from the customary rate at the 95th percentile as it appears from standard industry commercial rates or, where that data is unavailable, the Billed Amount if present in the data. These amounts are then adjusted to account for the customary Medicare adjustment to arrive at the calculated Paid Amount. Management believes that this formula provides a conservative estimate for the Medicare paid amount rate, based on industry studies which show the range of differences between private insurers and Medicare rates for outpatient services. We periodically update this formula to enhance the calculated paid amount where that information is not provided in the data received from our Assignors. Management believes this measure provides a useful baseline for potential recoveries, but it is not a measure of the total amount that may be recovered in respect of potentially recoverable Claims, which in turn may be influenced by any applicable potential statutory recoveries such as double damages or fines. Where we have to extrapolate a Paid Amount to establish damages, the calculated amount may be contested by opposing parties. The figures pertaining to Medicare Member Lives as well as the paid amount were tabulated based on the data provided by health care plans; these figures may be subject to adjustment upon further investigation of the paid amounts reflected by the health plans.4 [https://investor.lifewallet.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lifewallet-acquires-assignment-additional-msp-claims-overall](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=gB5pfQ8Y1oEE_zQlrSs65B9Bf2tfXgr0GsRZ2sGJR0U2kNsNCwRj7Cq1faEZnhM8-Dq7pbBFIR7oVQH6hau-GNEPOiA6yX_CO3CwyjweQVLWqUv_nzZpWcS5CVCzEcaJQCONr-M9HmHMAiqXg_ZWP-qYMVdKPquWklpKjMqwhdG3CT7u0hxWOb0HUfv1p0875LZwS-wrK9WAHGkq1D2AIg1aJAZUgTHoE2a1pN799rJ6cSOYEnPnjxRB6OtcMC2BbyJGqqrYXbYv-8v1xpj_zZ7WDCEC9rP2nC0Gzm0zjV419In63dPT2Hn_S0KK1PfbhLQMFAugAPAaoGD-vmqwUfdr1UqmF65yE9PPuicHRagR7n3jPemPZdOzLFzooVGQ)\n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/ZTU2OGVjZDQtNTAwMy00Y2E0LWJlMTMtY2VmYmFjNzVlMzdiLTEyNTk2NTU=/tiny/LifeWallet.png)\n"

Ruiz, said, “From additional settlements to the processing of additional claims data, we continue to see progress across all lines of business. We’re also reaping the rewards of reduced operating expenses, which have had a positive impact on our financials. In addition to providing invaluable technological resources to patients, providers, payers, and attorneys, our cost-cutting solutions can discover wasted federal funds and recover Medicare reimbursements to preserve tax dollars, benefiting all Americans.”\n\n**Third Quarter Highlights**\n\n  * On July 22, 2024, the Company announced a new comprehensive settlement with another group of affiliated property and casualty insurance carriers (“P&C Insurers”) doing business in multiple states, which includes the P&C Insurers' agreement to provide ten years of historical data and data sharing of future claims, implementation of LifeWallet's clearinghouse solution to settle future claims, and assignment of additional rights to collect against additional third parties related to the settled claims.\n  * The Company entered into a confidential pharmaceutical antitrust settlement totaling $3.1 million. As part of LifeWallet’s owned claims portfolio, the Company has claims against multiple pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers based on allegations of defective products or anti-competitive pricing.\n  * The Company launched an initiative to secure new agreements with health plans, providers, insurers and attorneys, while continuing to reduce operating costs.\n  * Creditors Virage Capital Management LP; Virage Recovery Master, LP; Hazel Holdings I, LLC; and Hazel Partners Holdings, LLC agreed to waive certain provisions in their agreements with the Company that would accelerate the payment of amounts due in the event that the Company receives a negative going concern opinion from its auditors for the year ending December 31, 2024.\n\n\n\n**Subsequent Events**\n\n  * On November 11, 2024, the Company announced new comprehensive settlements with P&C Insurers, totaling $5.2 million, continued progress in recoveries on owned claims and acquiring rights to additional claims, as well as initiatives to eliminate wasteful Medicare spending by launching beta testing of its clearinghouse solution, built in partnership with Palantir Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: PLTR).\n  * LifeWallet is also currently in negotiations with other property and casualty insurers to resolve claims on a similar basis, including one of the country’s largest P&C Insurers. Some of these negotiations have resulted in collaborative statistical sampling and extensive data-matching to determine the size and scope of claims that are owned by the Company that LifeWallet has asserted repayment is due pursuant to Medicare Secondary Payer and other related laws.\n  * The Company entered into a confidential settlement with a medical device manufacturer totaling $760,000. As part of LifeWallet’s owned claims portfolio, the Company has ongoing litigation against other pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers based on claims of defective products or anti-competitive pricing.\n  * The Company acquired the recovery rights to additional Medicare Secondary Payer claims consisting of more than 450,000 Medicare members, as documented by health insurance plans, with an estimated total claims Paid Amount exceeding $10.6 billion.1\n  * LifeWallet strategically reduced its operating costs in 2023 and continues to do so in 2024. These cost reductions do not impact the systems that the Company has already created to support recovery efforts of the claims owned by the Company or other resources available to third parties. The Company anticipates these reductions could continue to contribute savings to operating expenses for the year ending December 31, 2024.\n  * The Company is advancing initiatives to eliminate wasteful spending of federal dollars and unnecessary Medicare secondary payments, utilizing its clearinghouse system, created through its exclusive healthcare partnership with Palantir Technologies. The clearinghouse solution utilizes the Palantir Foundry platform, AI tools, natural language processing, and machine learning, resulting in the development of a sophisticated data analytics system that captures and manages healthcare data, enhancing LifeWallet’s Chase to Pay model.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Revenue** : Total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $3.7 million compared to $0.4 million for three months ended September 30, 2023.\n  * **Operating loss:** Operating loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $129.9 million, compared to $136.7 million during three months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted operating loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $8.4 million, excluding non-cash claims amortization expense of $121.0 million and professional fees paid in stock of $0.4 million.\n  * **Net loss:** Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $190.4 million and $160.5 million to controlling members, or net loss per share of $1.26 per share, Class A Common Stock, based on 23,764,079 million weighted average shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding. Adjusted net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $11.0 million, excluding the non-cash item noted above, change in fair value of warrant and derivative liabilities of $45.3 million, and $103.3 million related to interest expense.\n  * **Liquidity:** As of September 30, 2024, cash totaled $4.7 million, and as of October 31, 2024, cash totaled $5.6 million. The Company continually monitors its liquidity and may in the future access debt and equity markets as necessary in order to meet its ongoing liquidity needs, including by drawing upon its working capital facility. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received $5.25 million of funding for working capital. Subsequently, the Company has received additional working capital funding of $3.5 million, and it has $5.25 million of remaining capacity to draw from its working capital facility as of the date of filing of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ending September 30, 2024.\n\n\n\n**Assigned Recovery Rights, Claims Paid and Billed Value**\n\nThe table below outlines the Company’s claims data for the most recent periods. The amounts represent data received from current and new assignors:\n\n**_$ in billions_**| **Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024**| **Year Ended****December 31, 2023**| **Year Ended****December 31, 2022**  \n---|---|---|---  \nPaid Amount| $| 380.5| $| 369.8| $| 374.8  \nPaid Value of Potentially Recoverable Claims(2)| 87.8| 88.9| 89.6  \nBilled Value of Potentially Recoverable Claims| 375.3| 373.5| 377.8  \nRecovery Multiple| N/A(1)| N/A| N/A  \nPenetration Status of Portfolio| 86.8| %| 86.8| %| 85.8| %  \n  \n1) During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company has received total recoveries of $9.9 million. However, the settlement amounts do not provide a large enough sample to be statistically significant, and are therefore not shown in the table.\n\n2) On August 10, 2022, the United States Court of Appeals, Eleventh Circuit held that a four-year statute of limitations period applies to certain claims brought under the Medicare Secondary Payer Act’s private cause of action, and that the limitations period begins to run on the date that the cause of action accrued. This opinion may render certain Claims held by the Company unrecoverable and may substantially reduce PVPRC and BVPRC as calculated. As our cases were filed at different times and in various jurisdictions, and prior to data matching with a defendant we are not able to accurately calculate the entirety of damages specific to a given defendant, we cannot calculate with certainty the impact of this ruling at this time. However, the Company has deployed several legal strategies (including but not limited to seeking to amend existing lawsuits in a manner that could allow claims to relate back to the filing date as well as asserting tolling arguments based on theories of fraudulent concealment) that would apply to tolling the applicable limitations period and minimizing any material effect on the overall collectability of its claim rights. In addition, the Eleventh Circuit decision applies only to district courts in the Eleventh Circuit. Many courts in other jurisdictions have applied other statutes of limitations to the private cause of action, including borrowing the three-year statute of limitations applicable to the government’s cause of action; and borrowing from the False Claims Act’s six-year period. The most recent decision on the issue from the District Court of Massachusetts, for example, applies the same statute of limitations as Eleventh Circuit, but expressly disagrees with the Eleventh Circuit’s application of the “accrual” rule and instead adopted the notice-based trigger that the company has always argued should apply. This would mean that the limitations period for unreported claims has not even begun to accrue. This is a complex legal issue that will continue to evolve in jurisdictions across the country. Nevertheless, if the application of the statute of limitations as determined by the Eleventh Circuit was applied to all Claims assigned to us, we estimate that the effect would be a reduction of PVPRC by approximately $9.9 billion. As set forth in our Risk Factors, PVPRC is based on a variety of factors. As such, this estimate is subject to change based on the variety of legal claims being litigated and statute of limitations tolling theories that apply.\n\n**Going Concern**\n\nAs disclosed in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company has concluded that, despite the financing arrangements entered into by the Company, there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Unless the Company is successful in raising additional funds through the offering of debt or equity securities, the Company has concluded it is probable the Company will be unable to continue to operate as a going concern beyond the next 12 months.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nAdditional information regarding the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this release, including an explanation of these measures and how each is calculated, is included below under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures has also been provided in the financial tables.\n\n**About LifeWallet**\n\nFounded in 2014 as MSP Recovery, LifeWallet has become a Medicare, Medicaid, commercial, and secondary payer reimbursement recovery leader, disrupting the antiquated healthcare reimbursement system with data-driven solutions to secure recoveries from responsible parties.

We consider “adjusted net loss” and “adjusted operating loss” as non-GAAP financial measures and important indicators of performance and useful metrics for management and investors to evaluate the Company’s ongoing operating performance on a consistent basis across reporting periods. We believe these measures provide useful information to investors. Adjusted net loss represents net loss adjusted for certain non-cash and non-recurring expenses, and adjusted operating loss items represents operating loss adjusted for certain non-cash and non-recurring expenses. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most relevant GAAP measure is included above.\n\n(1) Interest expense included above excludes any interest expense payments made in cash during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n_______________________________1 ” _Paid Amount_ ” (a/k/a Medicare Paid Rate or wholesale price) means the amount paid to the provider from the health plan or insurer. This amount varies based on the party making payment. For example, Medicare typically pays a lower fee for service rate than commercial insurers. The Paid Amount is derived from the Claims data we receive from our Assignors. In the limited instances where the data received lacks a paid value, our team calculates the Paid Amount with a formula. The formula used provides rates for outpatient services and is derived from the customary rate at the 95th percentile as it appears from standard industry commercial rates or, where that data is unavailable, the Billed Amount if present in the data. These amounts are then adjusted to account for the customary Medicare adjustment to arrive at the calculated Paid Amount. Management believes that this formula provides a conservative estimate for the Medicare paid amount rate, based on industry studies which show the range of differences between private insurers and Medicare rates for outpatient services. We periodically update this formula to enhance the calculated paid amount where that information is not provided in the data received from our Assignors. Management believes this measure provides a useful baseline for potential recoveries, but it is not a measure of the total amount that may be recovered in respect of potentially recoverable Claims, which in turn may be influenced by any applicable potential statutory recoveries such as double damages or fines. Where we have to extrapolate a Paid Amount to establish damages, the calculated amount may be contested by opposing parties. The figures pertaining to Medicare Member Lives as well as the paid amount were tabulated based on the data provided by health care plans; these figures may be subject to adjustment upon further investigation of the paid amounts reflected by the health plans.\n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/NTQzMzVlNjktZjllMy00MDM2LTk0ZDktOGFmMmU3YTc0ZTZhLTEyNTk2NTU=/tiny/LifeWallet.png)\n"

The Company has filed an amendment to its Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to affect the reverse stock split at the ratio of 1-for-25 as of the Effective Time.\n\nAs a result of the reverse split, every 25 shares of the Company’s issued and outstanding Common Stock will automatically be converted into one share of issued and outstanding Common Stock. The Company’s shares will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on the Nasdaq Capital Market commencing upon market open on November 18, 2024. Immediately after the reverse split becomes effective, there will be approximately 1.6 million shares of Class A common stock issued and outstanding.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.
