These forward-looking statements are based on JFrog’s current assumptions, expectations and beliefs and are subject to substantial risks, uncertainties, assumptions and changes in circumstances that may cause JFrog’s actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement. \n\nThere are a significant number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from statements made in this press release and our earnings call, including but not limited to: risks associated with managing our rapid growth; our history of losses; our limited operating history; our ability to retain and upgrade existing customers our ability to attract new customers; our ability to effectively develop and expand our sales and marketing capabilities; our ability to integrate and realize anticipated synergies from acquisitions of complementary businesses and our strategic collaborations; risk of a security breach incident or product vulnerability; risk of interruptions or performance problems associated with our products and platform capabilities; our ability to adapt and respond to rapidly changing technology or customer needs; our ability to compete in the markets in which we participate; our ability to successfully integrate technology from acquisitions into our offerings; our ability to provide continuity to our respective customers and realize innovation following our acquisitions; and general market, political, economic, and business conditions.

Forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date of this press release. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements. \n\n**About Non-GAAP Financial Measures:**\n\nJFrog discloses the following non-GAAP financial measures in this release and the earnings call referencing this press release: non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses (research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per diluted share, non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic share, and free cash flow. JFrog uses each of these non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate JFrog’s financial performance. JFrog believes they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating its operational performance, as further discussed below. JFrog’s non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in its industry, as other companies in its industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring and unusual items. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and exclude expenses that may have a material impact on JFrog’s reported financial results. \n\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the historical non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release. A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items that may be incurred in the future such as share-based compensation, the effect of which may be significant. \n\nJFrog defines non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expenses (research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP operating income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) as the respective GAAP balances, adjusted for, as applicable: (1) share-based compensation expense; (2) the amortization of acquired intangibles; (3) acquisition-related costs; and (4) income tax effects. JFrog defines free cash flow as Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, minus capital expenditures. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these historical non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. \n\nManagement believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and others in assessing JFrog’s operating performance due to the following factors: \n\n_Share-based compensation._ JFrog utilizes share-based compensation to attract and retain employees. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of its shareholders and at long-term retention, rather than to address operational performance for any particular period. As a result, share-based compensation expenses vary for reasons that are generally unrelated to financial and operational performance in any particular period. \n\n_Amortization of acquired intangibles._ JFrog views amortization of acquired intangible assets as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While these intangible assets are evaluated for impairment regularly, amortization of the cost of acquired intangibles is an expense that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period. \n\n_Acquisition-related costs._ Acquisition-related costs include expenses related to acquisitions of other companies. JFrog views acquisition-related costs as expenses that are not necessarily reflective of operational performance during a period. \n\n_Income tax effects._ JFrog’s non-GAAP financial results are adjusted for income tax effects related to these non-GAAP adjustments and changes in our assessment regarding the realizability of our deferred tax assets, if any. Excluding income tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments provides a more accurate view of JFrog’s operating results. \n\n_Non-GAAP weighted average share count._ Diluted GAAP and non-GAAP weighted-average shares are the same, except in periods that there is a GAAP loss and a non-GAAP income. The non-GAAP weighted-average shares used to compute the non-GAAP net income per share - diluted are adjusted to reflect dilution equal to the dilutive impact had there been GAAP income. \n\nAdditionally, JFrog’s management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure, free cash flow, is meaningful to investors because management reviews cash flows generated from operations after taking into consideration capital expenditures due to the fact that these expenditures are considered to be a necessary component of ongoing operations. \n\n**Operating Metrics**\n\nJFrog’s number of customers with annual recurring revenue (“ARR”) of $100,000 or more is based on the ARR of each customer, as of the last month of the quarter. JFrog’s number of customers with ARR of $1 million or more is based on the ARR of each customer, as of the last month of the quarter. JFrog defines ARR as the annualized revenue run-rate of subscription agreements from all customers as of the last month of the quarter. The ARR includes monthly subscription customers, so long as JFrog generates revenue from these customers. JFrog annualizes its monthly subscriptions by taking the revenue it would contractually expect to receive from such customers in a given month and multiplying it by 12. \n\nJFrog’s net dollar retention rate compares its ARR from the same set of customers across comparable periods. JFrog calculates net dollar retention rate by first identifying customers (the “Base Customers”), which were customers in the last month of a particular quarter (the “Base Quarter”). JFrog then calculates the contracted ARR from these Base Customers in the last month of the same quarter of the subsequent year (the “Comparison Quarter”). This calculation captures upsells, contraction, and attrition since the Base Quarter. JFrog then divides total Comparison Quarter ARR by total Base Quarter ARR for Base Customers.

Our actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied in\nforward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including but not limited to, risks detailed\nin our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in our annual report on\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the\nquarter ended March 31 and June 30, 2024, and other filings and reports that we may file from\ntime to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Forward-looking statements\nrepresent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date of this press release. We disclaim any\nobligation to update forward-looking statements.\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures:\nJFrog discloses the following non-GAAP financial measures in this release and the earnings call\nreferencing this press release: non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP gross profit, non-\nGAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses (research and development, sales and\nmarketing, general and administrative), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss),\nnon-GAAP net income (loss) per diluted share, non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic share, and\nfree cash flow. JFrog uses each of these non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand and\ncompare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting\npurposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate JFrog’s financial performance.\nJFrog believes they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating its\noperational performance, as further discussed below. JFrog’s non-GAAP financial measures may\nnot provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in its\nindustry, as other companies in its industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently,\nparticularly related to non-recurring and unusual items. In addition, there are limitations in using\nnon-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in\naccordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other\ncompanies and exclude expenses that may have a material impact on JFrog’s reported financial\nresults.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for,\nfinancial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the historical non-\nGAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in\nthe financial statement tables included below in this press release. A reconciliation of non-GAAP\nguidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis\nwithout unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of,\nreconciling items that may be incurred in the future such as share-based compensation, the effect\nof which may be significant.\nJFrog defines non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expenses (research and development,\nsales and marketing, general and administrative), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating\nmargin, non-GAAP operating income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) as the respective GAAP\nbalances, adjusted for, as applicable: (1) share-based compensation expense; (2) the amortization\nof acquired intangibles; (3) acquisition-related costs; and (4) income tax effects. JFrog defines free\ncash flow as Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, minus capital expenditures.\nInvestors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these historical non-GAAP financial\nmeasures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nManagement believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and others in\nassessing JFrog’s operating performance due to the following factors:\nShare-based compensation. JFrog utilizes share-based compensation to attract and retain\nemployees. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of its shareholders and at\nlong-term retention, rather than to address operational performance for any particular period. As\na result, share-based compensation expenses vary for reasons that are generally unrelated to\nfinancial and operational performance in any particular period.\nAmortization of acquired intangibles. JFrog views amortization of acquired intangible assets as items\narising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While these\nintangible assets are evaluated for impairment regularly, amortization of the cost of acquired\nintangibles is an expense that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period.\nAcquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs include expenses related to acquisitions of other\ncompanies. JFrog views acquisition-related costs as expenses that are not necessarily reflective of\noperational performance during a period.\nIncome tax effects. JFrog’s non-GAAP financial results are adjusted for income tax effects related to\nthese non-GAAP adjustments and changes in our assessment regarding the realizability of our\ndeferred tax assets, if any. Excluding income tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments provides a more\naccurate view of JFrog’s operating results.\nNon-GAAP weighted average share count. Diluted GAAP and non-GAAP weighted-average shares are\nthe same, except in periods that there is a GAAP loss and a non-GAAP income. The non-GAAP\nweighted-average shares used to compute the non-GAAP net income per share - diluted are\nadjusted to reflect dilution equal to the dilutive impact had there been GAAP income.\nAdditionally, JFrog’s management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure, free cash flow, is\nmeaningful to investors because management reviews cash flows generated from operations after\ntaking into consideration capital expenditures due to the fact that these expenditures are\nconsidered to be a necessary component of ongoing operations.\nOperating Metrics\nJFrog’s number of customers with annual recurring revenue (“ARR”) of $100,000 or more is based\non the ARR of each customer, as of the last month of the quarter. JFrog’s number of customers\nwith ARR of $1 million or more is based on the ARR of each customer, as of the last month of the\nquarter. JFrog defines ARR as the annualized revenue run-rate of subscription agreements from all\ncustomers as of the last month of the quarter. The ARR includes monthly subscription customers,\nso long as JFrog generates revenue from these customers. JFrog annualizes its monthly\nsubscriptions by taking the revenue it would contractually expect to receive from such customers\nin a given month and multiplying it by 12.\nJFrog’s net dollar retention rate compares its ARR from the same set of customers across\ncomparable periods. JFrog calculates net dollar retention rate by first identifying customers (the\n“Base Customers”), which were customers in the last month of a particular quarter (the “Base\nQuarter”). JFrog then calculates the contracted ARR from these Base Customers in the last month\nof the same quarter of the subsequent year (the “Comparison Quarter”). This calculation captures\nupsells, contraction, and attrition since the Base Quarter. JFrog then divides total Comparison\nQuarter ARR by total Base Quarter ARR for Base Customers. JFrog’s net dollar retention rate in a\nparticular quarter is obtained by averaging the result from that particular quarter with the\ncorresponding results from each of the prior three quarters.\nInvestor Contact:\nJeff Schreiner\njeffs@jfrog.com\nJFROG LTD.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(in thousands, except per share data;

Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify\nforward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,”\n“contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our\nexpectations, strategy, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include, but are not limited to,\nstatements about:\n• our future financial performance, including our expectations regarding our revenue, cost of revenue, gross profit, operating expenses, operating cash flow\nand free cash flow, and our ability to achieve, and maintain, future profitability;\n• market acceptance of our products;\n• our expectations about the impact of global economic disruptions resulting from natural disasters, public health epidemics, protests or riots, and\ngeopolitical tensions or war, such as the war between Hamas, Hezbollah, certain other factions and Israel and the war in Ukraine, on our business, results\nof operations and financial condition;\n• our expectations about the impact of unfavorable economic conditions, and adverse macroeconomic conditions, such as recent inflation and slower\ngrowth or recession, on our business and financial condition;\n• the effects of increased competition in our markets and our ability to compete effectively;\n• anticipated trends, growth rates and challenges in our business and in the markets in which we operate;\n• our ability to maintain and expand our customer base, including by attracting new customers;\n• our ability to successfully expand in our existing markets and into new markets;\n• our ability to maintain the security and availability of our software;\n• our ability to maintain or increase our net dollar retention rate;\n• our ability to develop new products, or enhancements to our existing products, and bring them to market in a timely manner;\n• our business model and our ability to effectively manage our growth and associated investments;\n• our ability to integrate and realize anticipated synergies from acquisitions of complementary businesses;\n• beliefs and objectives for future operations, including regarding our market opportunity;\n• our relationships with third parties, including our technology partners and cloud providers;\n• our ability to maintain, protect, and enhance our intellectual property rights;\n• our ability to successfully defend litigation brought against us;\n• our ability to attract and retain qualified employees and key personnel;\n• the sufficiency of our cash and cash equivalents to meet our liquidity needs;\n• our ability to comply with laws and regulations that currently apply or become applicable to our business in Israel, the United States, and internationally;\nand\n• the future trading prices of our ordinary shares.\n1\nTable of Contents\nYou should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and prospects. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties\nand other factors described in the section titled “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Moreover, we operate in a very\ncompetitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and\nuncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We cannot assure you that the\nresults, events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur, and actual results, events or circumstances could differ\nmaterially from those described in the forward-looking statements.\nThe forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We\nundertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to reflect events or circumstances after the date\nof this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions\nor expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking\nstatements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures, or investments we may make.\nIn addition, statements that “we believe” and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based upon\ninformation available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such\nstatements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into,\nor review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these\nstatements.\n2\nTable of Contents\nPART I – FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nITEM 1.

Organization and Description of Business\nJFrog Ltd. (together with its subsidiaries, “JFrog”, or the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Israel in 2008. JFrog provides an end-\nto-end, hybrid, universal Software Supply Chain Platform that enables organizations to continuously and securely create and deliver software updates across any\nsystem. This platform is the critical bridge between software development and deployment of that software, paving the way for modern software supply chain\nmanagement and software release processes. The Company enables organizations to build and release software faster and more securely while empowering\ndevelopers, security teams and machine learning operations teams to be more efficient. The Company’s solutions are designed to run on-premise, in public or\nprivate clouds, or in hybrid environments.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States of America (“GAAP”), and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim\nfinancial reporting, and include the accounts of JFrog Ltd. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated\nin consolidation.\nThe condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date, but does\nnot include all of the disclosures, including certain notes required by GAAP on an annual reporting basis. Certain information and note disclosures normally\nincluded in the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. Therefore, these\nunaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes\nthereto as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed\nwith the SEC on February 15, 2024.\nIn management’s opinion, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated\nfinancial statements and reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Company’s financial\nposition as of September 30, 2024, the Company’s consolidated results of operations and shareholders’ equity for the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023, and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The results for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024 or any other future interim or annual period.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods and accompanying notes. Significant items subject to such estimates\nand assumptions include, but are not limited to, the allocation of transaction price among various performance obligations, the estimated benefit period of\ndeferred contract acquisition costs, the allowance for credit losses, the fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill, the useful lives of acquired\nintangible assets and property and equipment, the incremental borrowing rate for operating leases, and the valuation of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax\npositions. The Company bases these estimates on historical and anticipated results, trends and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the\ncircumstances, including assumptions as to future events. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n9\nTable of Contents\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nThe Company’s significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Company’s Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

This free access takes the form of free trials and open source software,\nand helps generate demand for our paid offerings within the software developer, security, and IT operator communities.\nWe generated revenue of $109.1 million and $88.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing 23% growth,\nand $312.4 million and $252.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing 24% growth. We have continued to\ninvest in our business and had a net loss of $22.9 million and $13.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $46.0\nmillion and $50.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nMiddle East Conflict\nOn October 7, 2023, Hamas militants and members of other terrorist organizations infiltrated Israel’s southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a\nseries of terror attacks on civilian and military targets. Following the attack, Israel’s security cabinet declared war against Hamas and commenced a military\ncampaign against these terrorist organizations. Since the commencement of these events, there have been additional active hostilities, including with Hezbollah\nin Lebanon, Iran, and most recently, the Houthi movement which controls parts of Yemen. The conflict has recently expanded into Lebanon and it is possible\nthat\n23\nTable of Contents\nhostilities will escalate in the future into a greater regional conflict, and that additional terrorist organizations and countries could actively join the hostilities.\nAlthough we are domiciled in Israel, we are a global, cloud-based company, with operations spanning numerous countries with redundant infrastructure and\ncode located outside of Israel. We have activated and maintained a comprehensive three-pillar business continuity plan and have taken the necessary steps which\nwe believe are in line with such plan, in an effort to ensure that our operations and service to our customers remain consistent. The first pillar is our internal plan\nfocused on the safety of our employees in Israel and maintaining internal communication channels. The second pillar revolves around technology to support\ncontinuity of our services, security, cyber defense, and research and development. The third pillar is dedicated to our external-facing activities to promote\ncontinuity of customer engagements, support and external communication. While certain of our employees and consultants have been called into military\nservice, there has been no major interruption or material adverse impact on our operating results as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We will\ncontinue to monitor the situation as it progresses.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nWe believe that our future performance will depend on many factors, including the following:\nExtending Our Technology Leadership\nWe intend to continue to enhance our end-to-end, hybrid, universal Software Supply Chain Platform by developing new products and expanding the\nfunctionality of existing products to maintain our technology leadership.\nWe invest heavily in integrating our products with the major package technologies so that our products can be easily adopted in any development\nenvironment. We believe that these integrations increase the value of our platform to our customers, as they provide freedom of choice for software developers,\nsecurity teams, and IT operators and help avoid vendor lock-in. We intend to expend additional resources in the future to continue introducing new products,\nfeatures, and functionality.\nExpanding Usage by Existing Customers\nWe believe that there is a significant opportunity for growth with many of our existing customers. Many customers purchase our products through self-\nservice channels and often materially expand their usage over time. Increased engagement with our products provides our support and customer success teams\nopportunities to work directly with customers and introduce them to additional products and features, as well as drive usage of our products across large teams\nand more broadly across organizations. Furthermore, we see expansion opportunities when customers migrate from self-managed subscriptions to SaaS\nsolutions because customers have generally increased their platform usage levels after migration. We will continue to expand our strategic team to identify new\nuse cases and drive expansion and standardization on JFrog within our largest customers, to maintain engineering-level customer support, and to introduce new\nproducts and features that are responsive to our customers’ needs.\nWe quantify our expansion across existing customers through our net dollar retention rate. Our net dollar retention rate compares our annual recurring\nrevenue (“ARR”) from the same set of customers across comparable periods. We define ARR as the annualized revenue run-rate of subscription agreements\nfrom all customers as of the last month of the quarter. The ARR includes monthly subscription customers so long as we generate revenue from these customers.\nWe annualize our monthly subscriptions by taking the revenue we would contractually expect to receive from such customers in a given month and multiplying\nit by 12. We calculate net dollar retention rate by first identifying customers (the “Base Customers”), which were customers in the last month of a particular\nquarter (the “Base Quarter”). We then calculate the contracted ARR from these Base Customers in the last month of the same quarter of the subsequent year (the\n“Comparison Quarter”). This calculation captures upsells, contraction, and attrition since the Base Quarter. We then divide total Comparison Quarter ARR by\ntotal Base Quarter ARR for Base Customers. Our net dollar retention rate in a particular quarter is obtained by averaging the result from that particular quarter\nwith the corresponding results from each of the prior three quarters. Our net dollar retention rate may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the\nlevel of penetration within our customer base, expansion of products and features, and our ability to retain our customers. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nour net dollar retention rate was 117% and 119%, respectively. We expect our net dollar retention rate to remain relatively stable, with minor fluctuations around\ncurrent levels.\nWe focus on growing the number of large customers as a measure of our ability to scale with our customers and attract larger organizations to adopt our\nproducts. As of September 30, 2024, 966 of our customers had ARR of $100,000 or more, increasing\n24\nTable of Contents\nfrom 886 customers as of December 31, 2023. We had 46 customers with ARR of at least $1.0 million as of September 30, 2024, increasing from 37 customers\nas of December 31, 2023.\nAcquiring New Customers\nWe believe there is a significant opportunity to grow the number of customers that use our platform. Our operating results and growth prospects will depend\nin part on our ability to attract new customers. To date, we have primarily relied on our self-service and inbound sales model to attract new customers.\nProspective customers can evaluate and adopt our products through our free trials and open source software options. The costs associated with providing these\nfree trials and open source software options are included in sales and marketing. While we believe we have a significant market opportunity that our platform\naddresses, we will need to continue to invest in customer support, research and development, and sales and marketing in order to address this opportunity.\nAdditionally, we believe our products address the software release needs of customers worldwide, and we see international expansion as a major opportunity.\nWe have been operating and selling our products in international markets since our inception. While we believe global demand for our products will continue to\nincrease as international market awareness of our brand grows, our ability to conduct our operations internationally will require considerable management\nattention and resources and is subject to the particular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures,\ncustoms, legal and regulatory systems, alternative dispute systems, and commercial markets.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe that free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is useful in evaluating the\nperformance of our business.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We\nbelieve this is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated from our core operations\nthat, after the purchases of property and equipment, can be used for strategic initiatives, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and\nstrengthening our balance sheet. Free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool, and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of\nother GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities. Some of the limitations of free cash flow are that this metric does not reflect\nour future contractual commitments and may be calculated differently by other companies in our industry, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. We\nexpect our free cash flow to fluctuate in future periods as we invest in our business to support our plans for growth.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented and provides a reconciliation of net cash from operating activities, the most directly\ncomparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, for each of the periods presented:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 61,806 $ 41,562\nLess: purchases of property and equipment (2,509) (1,364)\nFree cash flow $ 59,297 $ 40,198\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (99,702) $ (37,827)\nNet cash provided by financing activities $ 16,824 $ 11,766\n25\nTable of Contents\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nOur revenues are comprised of revenue from self-managed subscriptions and SaaS subscriptions. Subscriptions to our self-managed software include license,\nsupport, and upgrades and updates on a when-and-if-available basis. Our SaaS subscriptions provide access to our latest managed version of our product hosted\nin a public cloud.\nSubscription—Self-Managed and SaaS\nSubscription—self-managed and SaaS revenue is generated from the sale of subscriptions for our self-managed software products and the sale of our SaaS\nsubscriptions. For subscriptions to our self-managed software products, revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription term. For our SaaS subscriptions,\nrevenue is recognized based on usage over the contract period, including minimum usage commitments.\nLicense—Self-Managed\nThe license component of our self-managed subscriptions reflects the revenue recognized by providing customers with access to proprietary software\nfeatures. License revenue is recognized upfront when the software license is made available to our customer.\nCost of Revenue\nSubscription—Self-Managed and SaaS\nCost of subscription—self-managed and SaaS revenue primarily consists of expenses related to providing support to our customers and cloud-related costs,\nsuch as hosting and managing costs. These costs primarily consist of personnel-related expenses of our services and customer support personnel, share-based\ncompensation expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, public cloud infrastructure costs, depreciation of property and equipment, and allocated\noverhead. We expect our cost of subscription and SaaS revenue to increase in absolute dollars as our subscription and SaaS revenue increases.\nLicense—Self-Managed\nCost of license self-managed revenue consists of amortization of acquired intangible assets.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs primarily consist of personnel-related expenses, share-based compensation expenses, associated with our engineering\npersonnel responsible for the design, development, and testing of our products, cost of development environments and tools, and allocated overhead. We expect\nthat our research and development expenses will continue to increase as we increase our research and development headcount to further strengthen and enhance\nour products and invest in the development of our software.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses, share-based compensation expenses, sales commissions primarily associated\nwith our sales and marketing organizations, public cloud infrastructure costs associated with our free trials and open source software options, and costs\nassociated with marketing programs and user events. Marketing programs include advertising, promotional events, and brand-building activities. We plan to\nincrease our investment in sales and marketing over the foreseeable future, as we continue to hire additional personnel and invest in sales and marketing\nprograms.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses, share-based compensation expenses, associated primarily with our\nfinance, legal, human resources and other operational and administrative functions, professional\n26\nTable of Contents\nfees for external legal, accounting and other consulting services, directors and officer’s insurance expenses, and allocated overhead. We expect to increase the\nsize of our general and administrative function to support the growth of our business.\nInterest and Other Income, Net\nInterest and other income, net primarily consists of income earned on our cash equivalents and short-term investments. Interest and other income, net also\nincludes foreign exchange gains and losses.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nIncome tax expense (benefit) consists primarily of income taxes related to the United States and other foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We\nmaintain a full valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets in Israel as we have concluded that it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax assets\nwill be realized. Our effective tax rate is affected by tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions, non-\ndeductible expenses, excess tax benefits from share-based compensation awards, and changes in our valuation allowance.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth selected condensed consolidated statements of operations data and such data as a percentage of total revenue for each of the\nperiods indicated:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nRevenue:\nSubscription—self-managed and SaaS $ 103,487 $ 84,131 $ 297,297 $ 238,141\nLicense—self-managed 5,569 4,505 15,113 14,485\nTotal subscription revenue 109,056 88,636 312,410 252,626\nCost of revenue:\nSubscription—self-managed and SaaS(1)(2)(3) 27,156 19,532 69,363 55,966\nLicense—self-managed(2) 135 218 425 654\nTotal cost of revenue—subscription 27,291 19,750 69,788 56,620\nGross profit 81,765 68,886 242,622 196,006\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development(1)(3) 42,996 33,358 115,945 101,788\nSales and marketing(1)(2)(3) 50,956 37,915 140,423 109,753\nGeneral and administrative(1)(3) 17,733 15,663 51,937 44,635\nTotal operating expenses 111,685 86,936 308,305 256,176\nOperating loss (29,920) (18,050) (65,683) (60,170)\nInterest and other income, net 5,705 5,733 19,690 14,621\nLoss before income taxes (24,215) (12,317) (45,993) (45,549)\nIncome tax expense (benefit) (1,270) 1,430 45 4,474\nNet loss $ (22,945) $ (13,747) $ (46,038) $ (50,023)\n_________________________________________\n(1) Includes share-based compensation expense as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nCost of revenue: subscription–self-managed and SaaS $ 3,864 $ 2,650 $ 10,203 $ 6,865\nResearch and development 13,611 8,596 33,453 23,566\nSales and marketing 13,506 8,248 33,759 21,461\nGeneral and administrative 5,414 6,192 14,922 15,028\nTotal share-based compensation expense $ 36,395 $ 25,686 $ 92,337 $ 66,920\n27\nTable of Contents\n(2) Includes amortization expense of acquired intangible assets as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nCost of revenue: subscription–self-managed and SaaS $ 4,493 $ 2,386 $ 9,265 $ 7,160\nCost of revenue: license—self-managed 135 218 425 654\nSales and marketing 1,259 357 1,975 1,073\nTotal amortization expense of acquired intangible assets $ 5,887 $ 2,961 $ 11,665 $ 8,887\n(3) Includes acquisition-related costs as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nCost of revenue: subscription–self-managed and SaaS $ 1 $ 6 $ 9 $ 16\nResearch and development 1,628 1,251 2,605 6,931\nSales and marketing 546 19 610 89\nGeneral and administrative 180 18 856 158\nTotal acquisition-related costs $ 2,355 $ 1,294 $ 4,080 $ 7,194\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenue:\nSubscription—self-managed and SaaS 95% 95% 95% 94%\nLicense—self-managed 5 5 5 6\nTotal subscription revenue 100 100 100 100\nCost of revenue:\nSubscription—self-managed and SaaS 25 22 22 22\nLicense—self-managed — — — —\nTotal cost of revenue—subscription 25 22 22 22\nGross profit 75 78 78 78\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development 39 37 37 40\nSales and marketing 47 43 45 44\nGeneral and administrative 16 18 17 18\nTotal operating expenses 102 98 99 102\nOperating loss (27) (20) (21) (24)\nInterest and other income, net 5 6 6 6\nLoss before income taxes (22) (14) (15) (18)\nIncome tax expense (benefit) (1) 2 — 2\nNet loss (21)% (16)% (15)% (20)%\nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nRevenue\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nSubscription—self-managed and SaaS $ 103,487 $ 84,131 $ 19,356 23%\nLicense—self-managed 5,569 4,505 1,064 24%\nTotal subscription revenue $ 109,056 $ 88,636 $ 20,420 23%\n28\nTable of Contents\nThe increase in total subscription revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 consisted\nof approximately $17.1 million in growth from existing customers and the remaining attributable to new customers.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nSubscription—self-managed and SaaS $ 27,156 $ 19,532 $ 7,624 39%\nLicense—self-managed 135 218 (83) (38)%\nTotal cost of revenue—subscription $ 27,291 $ 19,750 $ 7,541 38%\nGross margin 75% 78%\nTotal cost of revenue increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Our principal uses of\ncash in recent periods have been funding our operations, investing in capital expenditures, and business and asset acquisitions.\nAs of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $467.8 million. Cash and cash\nequivalents primarily consist of cash in banks and money market funds. Short-term investments generally consist of bank deposits, certificates of deposit,\ncommercial paper, corporate debt securities, municipal securities, and government and agency debt. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-\nterm investments, together with cash provided by operations, will be sufficient to meet our needs for the next 12 months, as well as in the long-term.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our revenue growth rate, subscription renewal activity, billing frequency, the timing,\nand extent of spending to support further sales and marketing and research and development efforts, the continuing market acceptance of our products and\nservices, as well as expenses associated with our international expansion, the timing, and extent of additional capital expenditures to invest in existing and new\noffice spaces. We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, and technologies, including intellectual\nproperty rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may\nnot be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, results of operations, and\nfinancial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 61,806 $ 41,562\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (99,702) $ (37,827)\nNet cash provided by financing activities $ 16,824 $ 11,766\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $61.8 million for nine months ended September 30, 2024 was related to our net loss of $46.0 million adjusted for\nnon-cash charges of $108.5 million, including share-based compensation expense of $92.3 million and depreciation and amortization expense of $14.6 million,\nand net cash outflow of $0.6 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The total cash outflows of $38.7 million from changes in our operating\nassets and liabilities were primarily related to an increase of $15.8 million in accounts receivable, an increase of $8.2 million in deferred contract acquisition\ncosts, an increase of $6.9 million in prepaid expenses and other assets mainly due to timing of payments, and a decrease of $6.2 million in operating lease\nliabilities as a result of payments. These outflows were partially offset by an increase of $30.1 million in deferred revenue and an increase of $8.0 million in\naccrued expense and other liabilities mainly due to accrued compensation and benefits. The increases in deferred revenue, accounts receivable, and deferred\ncontract acquisition costs were driven by higher sales.\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $41.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was related to our net loss of $50.0 million adjusted\nfor non-cash charges of $79.3 million, including share-based compensation expense of $66.9 million and depreciation and amortization expense of $11.5\nmillion, and changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $12.3 million. The changes in our operating assets and liabilities were primarily related to an\nincrease of $16.2 million in deferred revenue driven by higher sales and an increase of $4.9 million in accrued expenses and other liabilities primarily due to\nhigher income tax obligations, partially offset by a decrease of $5.8 million in operating lease liabilities as a result of payments and an increase of $4.8 million\nin deferred contract acquisition costs related to capitalized commissions.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities of $99.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of payments for the Qwak\nacquisition of $156.7 million, net of cash acquired, partially offset by the net proceeds from maturities and sales of short-term investments of $59.5 million.\n33\nTable of Contents\nNet cash used in investing activities of $37.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted primarily of the net purchase of short-term\ninvestments of $36.5 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $16.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of proceeds from exercise of\nshare options of $8.8 million and proceeds from employee share purchases under our ESPP of $8.7 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $11.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted primarily of proceeds from employee\nshare purchases under our ESPP of $6.7 million and proceeds from exercise of share options of $5.4 million.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our non-cancellable contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024:\nPayments Due by Period\nTotal 2024 (Remainder) 2025 and Thereafter\n(in thousands)\nOperating lease obligations $ 16,543 $ 2,142 $ 14,401\nPurchase obligations 21,506 1,180 20,326\nTotal $ 38,049 $ 3,322 $ 34,727\nThe contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding. Purchase obligations\nrepresent our commitments primarily for hosting services, software products and services under contracts with remaining terms of 12 months or longer.\nObligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. We believe we will have sufficient liquidity\nfrom our operations to fulfill the commitments.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial\nstatements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well as related\ndisclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that\nwe believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. As events continue to evolve and additional information becomes available, our estimates and assumptions\nmay change materially in future periods.\nOur critical accounting policies and estimates were disclosed in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations included in our Annual Report. There have been no significant changes to these policies and estimates during the nine months ended September 30,\n2024.\n34\nTable of Contents\nITEM 3. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe have operations in the United States and internationally, and we are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nOur revenue and expenses are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Substantially all of our sales are\ndenominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore our revenue is not subject to significant foreign currency risk. However, a significant portion of our operating costs in\nIsrael, consisting principally of salaries and related personnel expenses, and operating lease and facility expenses are denominated in NIS. This foreign currency\nexposure gives rise to market risk associated with exchange rate movements of the U.S. dollar against the NIS. Since the beginning of the war between Israel,\nHamas, and Hezbollah, the volatility of NIS against the U.S. dollar has not materially affected the results of our business. We anticipate that a material portion of\nour expenses will continue to be denominated in NIS.\nTo reduce the impact of foreign exchange risks associated with forecasted future cash flows and certain existing assets and liabilities and the volatility in our\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, we have established a hedging program. Foreign currency contracts are generally utilized in this hedging\nprogram. Our foreign currency contracts are generally short-term in duration. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We\naccount for our derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carry them at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The accounting\nfor changes in the fair value of the derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Our hedging program reduces but does\nnot eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our\nbusiness, after considering our hedging programs, would not have had a material impact on our results of operations for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nOur derivatives expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement. In addition, the financial\ninstitutions with which we have foreign currency contracts are primarily located in Israel, exposing us to risks related to the country's economic standing which\nmay affect credit ratings. We seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions, spreading the risk across a number of major\nfinancial institutions, and closely monitoring rating downgrades. However, failure of one or more of these financial institutions is possible and could result in\nincurred losses.\nAs of September 30, 2024, our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments were primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. A hypothetical\n10% increase or decrease in current exchange rates would not materially affect our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investment balances as\nof September 30, 2024.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $62.2 million, and short-term investments of $405.5 million. Cash and cash equivalents\nprimarily consist of cash in banks and money market funds. Short-term investments generally consist of bank deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper,\ncorporate debt securities, municipal securities, and government and agency debt. Our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held for working\ncapital purposes. The primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of capital, the fulfillment of liquidity needs and the fiduciary control of\ncash. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Such interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. Changes in\ninterest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, and the market value of those securities. A hypothetical 1%\nincrease in interest rates would not have had a material impact on their fair value as of September 30, 2024.\nInflation Risk\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, other than its impact on the general\neconomy. However, if our costs, in particular labor, sales and marketing, and hosting costs, were to become subject to inflationary pressures, we might not be\nable to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\n35\nTable of Contents\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the\nExchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is\naccumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions\nregarding required disclosure.\nOur management, with the participation and supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of\nour disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of such date, our\ndisclosure controls and procedures were, in design and operation, effective at a reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d)\nof the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\nThe effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, is subject to inherent limitations, including the exercise of\njudgment in designing, implementing, operating, and evaluating the controls and procedures, and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. Accordingly,\nin designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any system of internal control over financial reporting,\nincluding ours, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In\naddition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its\njudgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future\nperiods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate.\n36\nTable of Contents\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nThe information set forth under the heading “Legal Proceedings” in Note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q is incorporated herein by reference.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our ordinary shares involves a high degree of risk. A description of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business and ownership of our\nordinary shares is set forth below. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information contained\nin this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations”\nand our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto, before making a decision to invest in our ordinary shares. The risks and\nuncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects could also be harmed by risks\nand uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not material. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, results of\noperations, financial condition, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our ordinary shares could decline\nand you could lose all or part of your investment.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nInvesting in our ordinary shares involves a high degree of risk because our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those outside of\nour control that could cause our actual results to be harmed, including, but not limited to, risks regarding the following:\n• Our business and operations have experienced rapid growth, and if we do not appropriately manage future growth, if any, or are unable to improve our\nsystems, processes, and controls, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects will be adversely affected.\n• Our recent growth may not be indicative of our future growth, and we may not be able to sustain our revenue growth rate in the future. Our growth also\nmakes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.\n• We have a history of losses and may not be able to achieve profitability on a consistent basis. If we cannot achieve profitability, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations may suffer.\n• The markets for our products are evolving and may develop more slowly or differently than we expect. Our future success depends on the growth and\nexpansion of these markets and our ability to adapt and respond effectively to evolving markets.\n• Our results of operations are likely to fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which could adversely affect the trading price of our ordinary shares.\n• If we are not able to keep pace with technological and competitive developments or fail to integrate our products with a variety of technologies that are\ndeveloped by others, our products may become less marketable, less competitive, or obsolete, and our results of operations may be adversely affected.\n• The market for our products is nascent and highly fragmented, and we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors,\nsome of whom have greater financial, technical, and other resources than we do. If we do not compete successfully our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be harmed.\n• JFrog Artifactory is at the center of our platform and any decline in demand for JFrog Artifactory occasioned by malfunction, inferior performance,\nincreased competition, or otherwise, will impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n37\nTable of Contents\n• We recognize a significant portion of revenue from subscriptions over the term of the relevant subscription period, and as a result, downturns or upturns in\nsales are not immediately reflected in full in our results of operations.\n• A real or perceived defect, security vulnerability, error, or performance failure in our software could cause us to lose revenue, damage our reputation, and\nexpose us to liability.\n• Unfavorable economic conditions may adversely affect our business and financial condition due to impacts on consumer and business spending, including\nreductions in information technology spending and decreased demand for our products, which could limit our ability to grow our business.\n• We have acquired, and may in the future acquire, complementary businesses which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business,\ndilute shareholder value, and adversely affect our results of operations.\n• We are subject to stringent and changing laws, regulations, standards, and contractual obligations related to privacy, data protection, and data security. Our\nactual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business.\n• A breach of our security measures or unauthorized access to proprietary and confidential data, or a perception that any security breach or other incident\nhas occurred, may result in our platform or products being perceived as not secure, lower customer use or stoppage of use of our products, and significant\nliabilities.\n• Our international operations and expansion expose us to risks.\n• Your rights and responsibilities as our shareholder are governed by Israeli law, which may differ in some respects from the rights and responsibilities of\nshareholders of United States (“U.S.”) corporations.\n• If we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate\nfinancial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\n• The impact of the war between Israel, Hamas and Hezbollah, the regional conflict in the Middle East, the war between Russia and Ukraine, and other\nareas of geopolitical tension around the world, including the related global economic disruptions, remains uncertain at this time, and could harm or\ncontinue to harm our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur business and operations have experienced rapid growth, and if we do not appropriately manage future growth, if any, or are unable to improve our\nsystems, processes, and controls, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects will be adversely affected.\nWe have experienced rapid growth and increased demand for our products. Our total number of customers has grown to approximately 7,400 organizations\nas of December 31, 2023 from approximately 7,200 organizations as of December 31, 2022. Our employee headcount has also increased from approximately\n1,300 as of December 31, 2022 to approximately 1,400 as of December 31, 2023. We expect to continue to grow our headcount organically over the next year.\nThe growth and expansion of our business places a continuous significant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources. In addition, as\ncustomers adopt our products for an increasing number of use cases, we have had to support more complex commercial relationships. We must continue to\nimprove and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our security and compliance requirements, our operating and administrative\nsystems, our relationships with various partners and other third parties, and our ability to manage headcount and processes in an efficient manner to manage our\ngrowth effectively.\nIn 2023, we released Artifactory and Platform features to become a system of record for machine learning models that fuel artificial intelligence (“AI”)\ninnovations in the software supply chain, enhancements to JFrog Advanced Security including SAST, and a new security product, JFrog Curation. These\nenhancements and releases represent an expansion beyond our core developer/operations (DevOps) business, delving more deeply into software security\n(DevSecOps) and machine learning model management (MLOps). We may not be able to sustain the pace of improvements to our products successfully or\nimplement systems, processes, and controls in an efficient or timely manner or in a manner that does not negatively affect our results of operations. Our failure\nto improve our systems, processes, and controls, or their failure to operate in the intended manner, may\n38\nTable of Contents\nresult in our inability to manage the growth of our business and to forecast our revenue, expenses, and earnings accurately, or to prevent losses.\nAs we expand our business and continue operating as a public company, we may find it difficult to maintain our corporate culture while managing our\nemployee growth. Any failure to manage our anticipated growth and related organizational changes in a manner that preserves our culture could negatively\nimpact future growth and achievement of our business objectives. Additionally, our productivity and the quality of our products may be adversely affected if we\ndo not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively. Failure to manage any future growth effectively could result in increased costs, negatively\naffect our customers’ satisfaction with our products, and harm our results of operations.\nOur recent growth may not be indicative of our future growth, and we may not be able to sustain our revenue growth rate in the future. Our growth also\nmakes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.\nOur total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $109.1 million and $88.6 million, respectively, representing 23% growth,\nand $312.4 million and $252.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing 24% growth. You should not rely on\nthe revenue growth of any prior quarterly or annual period as an indication of our future performance. Even if our revenue continues to increase, we expect our\nrevenue growth rate to decline in future periods. For example, we experienced slowed growth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many factors may contribute to\ndeclines in our growth rate, including greater market penetration, increased competition, slowing demand for our platform, a failure by us to continue\ncapitalizing on growth opportunities, the maturation of our business, the protracted conflict in the Middle East, and global economic downturn, among others. If\nour growth rate declines, investors’ perceptions of our business and the market price of our ordinary shares could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, our rapid growth may make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects. Our ability to forecast our future results of operations is subject to a\nnumber of uncertainties, including our ability to effectively plan for and model future growth. We have encountered in the past, and may encounter in the future,\nrisks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries. If we fail to achieve the necessary level of efficiency in our\norganization as it grows, or if we are not able to accurately forecast future growth, our business would be harmed. Moreover, if the assumptions that we use to\nplan our business are incorrect or change in reaction to changes in our market, or we are unable to maintain consistent revenue or revenue growth, our share\nprice could be volatile, and it may be difficult to achieve and maintain profitability.\nWe have a history of losses and may not be able to achieve profitability on a consistent basis. If we cannot achieve profitability, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations may suffer.\nAlthough we have recently achieved positive operating cash flow and free cash flow, we have incurred annual losses since our incorporation. We incurred a\nnet loss of $61.3 million, $90.2 million and $64.2 million in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We had an accumulated deficit of\n$290.4 million as of December 31, 2023. We anticipate that our operating expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we continue to\nenhance our products, broaden our customer base, expand our sales and marketing activities, including building a customer success team and continuing to\ninvest in our strategic sales team, expanding our operations, integrating the operations of Qwak following the closing of the acquisition in July 2024, hiring\nadditional employees, and continuing to develop our technology. These efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed\nin increasing our revenue sufficiently, or at all, to offset these higher expenses. Revenue growth may slow or revenue may decline for a number of possible\nreasons, including slowing demand for our products or increasing competition. Any failure to increase our revenue as we grow our business could prevent us\nfrom achieving profitability or maintaining positive operating cash flow and free cash flow at all or on a consistent basis, which would cause our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations to suffer.\nThe markets for our products are evolving and may develop more slowly or differently than we expect. Our future success depends on the growth and\nexpansion of these markets and our ability to adapt and respond effectively to evolving markets.\nThe markets for our products are rapidly evolving and unproven. Accordingly, it is difficult to predict customer adoption and renewals and demand for our\nplatform and our products, the entry of competitive products, the success of existing competitive products, or the future growth rate, expansion, longevity, and\nthe size of the DevOps, DevSecOps, MLOps, and software release management software markets. The expansion of and our ability to penetrate these new and\nevolving markets depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance, and perceived value associated with DevOps, DevSecOps, and MLOps\ntechnologies, as well as the ability of DevOps workflows to improve critical steps in the lifecycle of software, including managing\n39\nTable of Contents\nsoftware security. If we or other software and SaaS providers experience security incidents, loss of customer data, or disruptions in delivery or service, the\nmarket for these applications as a whole, including our platform and products, may be negatively affected. If DevOps, DevSecOps, and software release\nmanagement software do not continue to achieve market acceptance, or there is a reduction in demand caused by decreased customer acceptance, technological\nchallenges, weakening economic conditions, privacy, data protection and data security concerns, governmental regulation, competing technologies and products,\nor decreases in information technology spending or otherwise, the market for our platform and products might not continue to develop or might develop more\nslowly than we expect, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur results of operations are likely to fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which could adversely affect the trading price of our ordinary shares.\nOur results of operations, including our revenue, cost of revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, cash flow, and deferred revenue, have fluctuated from\nquarter to quarter in the past and may continue to vary significantly in the future so that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may not be\nmeaningful. Accordingly, our financial results in any one quarter should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance. Our quarterly financial results\nmay fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, may be difficult to predict, and may or may not fully reflect the\nunderlying performance of our business. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results include:\n• general economic, industry, and market conditions, including adverse macroeconomic conditions such as inflation;\n• our ability to attract and retain new customers;\n• the loss of existing customers;\n• renewals and timing of renewals;\n• customer usage of our products;\n• customer satisfaction with our products and platform capabilities and customer support;\n• our ability to expand sales within our existing customers;\n• mergers and acquisitions that might affect our customer base, including the consolidation of affiliates’ multiple paid business accounts into a single paid\nbusiness account;\n• our ability to gain new partners and retain existing partners;\n• our ability to convert users of free trials and open source version of JFrog Artifactory into subscribing customers;\n• increases or decreases in the number of elements of our subscriptions or pricing changes upon any renewals of customer agreements;\n• fluctuations in share-based compensation expense, including as a result of our acquisition activity;\n• decisions by potential customers to purchase alternative solutions;\n• decisions by potential customers to develop in-house DevOps and DevSecOps technologies as alternatives to our products;\n• the amount and timing of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business and operations, including investments in research\nand development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative resources;\n• network outages;\n• actual or perceived breaches of, or failures relating to, privacy, data protection, or data security;\n40\nTable of Contents\n• the timing of expenses related to the development or acquisition of technologies or businesses and potential future charges for impairment of goodwill\nfrom acquired companies, including our recent acquisition of Qwak;\n• the impact of political uncertainty or unrest, including the Russia-Ukraine war, the war between Israel, Hamas and Hezbollah, other areas of geopolitical\ntension around the world, or the worsening of such conflicts or tensions and any related global economic disruptions;\n• changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\n• fluctuations in the growth rate of the overall market that our products address;\n• the budgeting cycles and purchasing practices of customers;\n• the business strengths or weakness of our customers;\n• our ability to collect timely on invoices or receivables;\n• the cost and potential outcomes of future litigation or other disputes;\n• future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies;\n• our overall effective tax rate, including impacts caused by any reorganization in our corporate tax structure and any new legislation or regulatory\ndevelopments;\n• our ability to successfully expand our business in the U.S. and internationally;\n• fluctuations in the mix of our revenue between self-managed subscriptions and SaaS subscriptions;\n• fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and\n• the timing and success of new products introduced by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including\nconsolidation among competitors, customers, or partners.\nThe impact of one or more of the foregoing or other factors may cause our results of operations to vary significantly. Such fluctuations could cause us to fail\nto meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, which could cause the trading price of our ordinary shares to fall substantially, and we could face\ncostly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\nIf we are not able to keep pace with technological and competitive developments or fail to integrate our products with a variety of technologies that are\ndeveloped by others, our products may become less marketable, less competitive, or obsolete, and our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIn order to provide value for our customers, we must offer products that allow our customers to compile software from source code repositories, manage the\ndependencies among components within software packages, move packages and ML models to a universal repository, ingest packages from third parties,\nincluding open source libraries, scan for vulnerabilities through various stages, distribute to endpoints, and deploy in production, all through a single user access\npoint. The success of any new product introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful product development,\nmarket acceptance, the quality of our product and the user experience, our ability to manage the risks associated with new product releases, the effective\nmanagement of development and other spending in connection with anticipated demand for new products, and the availability of newly developed products. We\nhave in the past experienced bugs, errors, or other defects or deficiencies in new products and product updates and delays in releasing new products, deployment\noptions, and product enhancements and may have similar experiences in the future. As a result, some of our customers may either defer purchasing our products\nuntil the next upgrade is released or switch to a competitor if we are not able to keep up with technological developments. For example, AI and machine learning\nmay change the way our industry operates, and businesses that are slow to adopt or fail to adopt these new technologies may face a competitive disadvantage. In\naddition, if defects are not discovered until after customers purchase our products, our customers could lose confidence in the quality of our products and our\nreputation and brand may be harmed. If significant bugs, errors, or other defects or deficiencies are not discovered and patched in a timely manner, unauthorized\nparties\n41\nTable of Contents\ncould gain access to such products. Any negative publicity related to the perceived quality of our products could harm our business, results of operations, and\nfinancial condition.\nTo keep pace with technological and competitive developments we have in the past invested, and may continue to invest, in the acquisition of complementary\nbusinesses, technologies, services, products, and other assets that expand the products that we can offer our customers. For example, in 2021, we acquired Vdoo\nConnected Trust Ltd. (“Vdoo”), a privately-held security company, and Upswift Ltd. (“Upswift”), a cloud-based platform company and creator of connected\ndevice management software for developers, and in July 2024, we acquired Qwak, a privately-held AI development platform company. We may make these\ninvestments without being certain that they will result in products or enhancements that will be accepted by existing or prospective customers or that will\nachieve market acceptance. If we are unable to successfully enhance our existing products to meet evolving customer requirements, increase adoption and use\ncases of our products, develop new products, quickly resolve security vulnerabilities, or if our efforts to increase the use cases of our products are more\nexpensive than we expect, then our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nOur business and success depend in part on our strategic relationships with third parties, including our third-party hosting providers and our partner\necosystem, and if we fail to maintain or expand these relationships, our results of operations and reputation could be harmed.\nWe currently depend on, and anticipate we will continue to depend on, various third-party relationships to sustain and grow our business. For example, we\ncurrently partner with third-party public cloud partners, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure (including Azure DevOps), and Alphabet Inc.’s\nGoogle Cloud, who provide our services through their marketplaces. Our technology partnership ecosystem powers significant extensibility of our products,\noffers our customers the ability to use external tools of their choice with our products, provides the ability to deploy our products in their preferred\nenvironments, and allows them to support new package technologies as they are released. Accordingly, our SaaS products must be compatible with major cloud\nservice providers in order to support local hosting of our JFrog-managed products in geographies chosen by our customers and third parties with whom we may\npartner.\nWe have also established relationships with certain channel partners to distribute our products. We believe that continued growth in our business is dependent\nupon identifying, developing, and maintaining strategic relationships with our existing and potential channel partners that can drive substantial revenue and\nprovide additional value added services to our customers. If we are unable to develop and maintain successful relationships with our channel partners, our\nbusiness, results of operations, and financial condition could be harmed. In addition, our agreements with our channel partners are non-exclusive, so they may\noffer customers the products of several different companies, including products that compete with ours.\nIt is uncertain whether these third parties will be successful in co-marketing our solutions to provide a significant volume and quality of lead referrals and\norders, or whether they will continue to work with us long-term. Changes in our relationship with any third-party partner or third-party provider, the instability\nor vulnerability of any third-party technology, or the inability of our products to successfully integrate with third-party technology may adversely affect our\nbusiness and results of operations.\nWhile also partners, public cloud providers may compete with a subset of JFrog functionality and we may also face competition from them. For example,\nthird-party hosting providers currently selling our products and services could build and market their own competing products and services or market competing\nproducts and services of other vendors.\nFurther, identifying and negotiating new and expanded partner relationships requires significant resources and we cannot guarantee that the parties with\nwhich we currently have relationships can or will continue to devote the resources necessary to operate and expand their use of our platform. If we are\nunsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our partner relationships or any other strategic relationships with third parties, our ability to compete, our revenue,\nresults of operations, and future prospects could be harmed.\nEven if we are successful in establishing and maintaining our relationships with third-parties, we cannot ensure that our relationships will result in sustained\nor increased usage of our platform. In addition, any failure of our solutions to operate effectively with the business applications of any third-party partners could\nreduce the demand for our solutions and cause harm to our business and reputation. We may also be held responsible for obligations that arise from the actions\nor omissions of third parties with which we do business. Further, any expansion into new geographies may require us to integrate our products with new third-\nparty technology and invest in developing new relationships with providers. If we are unable to respond to changes in a cost-effective manner, our products may\nbecome less marketable, less competitive, or obsolete, and our results of operations may be negatively impacted.\n42\nTable of Contents\nA limited-functionality version of JFrog Artifactory is licensed under an open source license, which could negatively affect our ability to monetize our\nproducts and protect our intellectual property rights.\nWe make a limited-functionality version of JFrog Artifactory that only supports Java-based packages, and also lacks other features required for organization-\nwide adoption by DevOps teams, available under an open source license, the Affero General Public License version 3.0 (“AGPL”). The AGPL grants licensees\nbroad freedom to view, use, copy, modify, and redistribute the source code of this limited version of JFrog Artifactory. Anyone can download a free copy of this\nlimited version of JFrog Artifactory from the Internet, and we neither know who all of our AGPL licensees are, nor have visibility into how JFrog Artifactory is\nbeing used by licensees, so our ability to detect violations of the open source license is extremely limited.\nThe AGPL has a “copyleft” requirement that further distribution of AGPL-licensed software and modifications or adaptations to that software be made\navailable pursuant to the AGPL as well. This leads some commercial enterprises to consider AGPL-licensed software to be unsuitable for commercial use.\nHowever, the AGPL would not prevent a commercial licensee from taking this open source version of JFrog Artifactory under AGPL and using it for internal\npurposes for free. AGPL also would not prevent a commercial licensee from taking this open source version of JFrog Artifactory under AGPL and using it to\ncompete in our markets by providing it for free.\nThis competition can develop without the degree of overhead and lead time required by traditional proprietary software companies, due to the permissions\nallowed under AGPL. It is also possible for competitors to develop their own software based on our open source version of JFrog Artifactory. Although this\nsoftware would also need to be made available for free under the AGPL, it could reduce the demand for our products and put pricing pressure on our\nsubscriptions. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, some of which may have greater\nresources than we have, or that competitive pressure or the availability of new open source software will not result in price reductions, reduced operating\nmargins, and loss of market share, any one of which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe market for our products is nascent and highly fragmented, and we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors,\nsome of whom have greater financial, technical, and other resources than we do. If we do not compete successfully, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be harmed.\nOur platform consists of multiple products in DevOps and DevSecOps, and we compete in each product category as well as the entire platform level. The\nmarket for our products is highly fragmented, quickly evolving, and subject to rapid changes in technology. We believe that our ability to compete successfully\ndepends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the following:\n• ability to provide an end-to-end, unified platform solution for the DevOps and DevSecOps workflows;\n• ability to provide updated security products to create and maintain trusted software releases;\n• breadth of technologies we support;\n• breadth of technology integrations;\n• total cost of ownership;\n• extensibility across organizations, including software developers, security teams, AI/ML engineers, data scientists, and IT operators;\n• ability to enable collaboration between software developers, security teams, and IT operators;\n• ability to deploy our products in any combination of cloud, multi-cloud, on-premise, or hybrid environments;\n• performance, security, scalability, and reliability;\n• quality of customer experience and satisfaction;\n43\nTable of Contents\n• quality of customer support;\n• ease of implementation and use; and\n• brand recognition and reputation.\nOur products are available for self-managed, SaaS, and hybrid deployments. While we believe we compete successfully on the above factors, particularly\nwith regards to the comprehensive nature of our solutions, we do experience competition in each of these categories with different vendors:\n• Home grown solutions. Over time, many companies built solutions in-house for specific use cases they uniquely required. Often, these solutions do not\nscale or were not designed to meet the needs of modern software delivery methodologies or technologies.\n• DevOps and developer-focused vendors. Many companies address only certain parts of the DevOps cycle and may compete with a limited set of JFrog\nofferings, including Microsoft’s GitHub, GitLab, Inc., Cloudsmith, and Sonatype.\n• Cloud providers. While also partners, cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure (including Azure DevOps), and Alphabet\nInc.’s Google Cloud, may compete with a subset of JFrog functionality.\n• Security point solutions. Some security-focused companies may compete with a subset of JFrog’s holistic security offerings or address only developer-\nlevel security, such as Aqua Security, Snyk, Sonatype, and Synopsys.\n• Diversified vendors. Some diversified technology companies, such as IBM, Inc. (including Red Hat), Pivotal Software, and VMware, Inc. (now\nBroadcom Inc.) may have offerings that compete with certain JFrog products.\nAdditionally, we compete with home-grown, start-up, and open source technologies across the categories described above. Many of our competitors have\ngreater financial, technical, and other resources, greater brand recognition, larger sales forces and marketing budgets, broader distribution networks, more\ndiverse product and services offerings, and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios. They may be able to leverage these resources to gain\nbusiness in a manner that discourages customers from purchasing our offerings. Furthermore, we expect that our industry will continue to attract new\ncompanies, including smaller emerging companies, which could introduce new offerings. We may also expand into new markets and encounter additional\ncompetitors in such markets.\nJFrog Artifactory is at the center of our platform and any decline in demand for JFrog Artifactory occasioned by malfunction, inferior performance,\nincreased competition, or otherwise, will impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur subscription structure is aligned with the way we have built our platform, and JFrog Artifactory is at the center of our platform and all subscriptions.\nAccordingly, market acceptance of JFrog Artifactory is critical to our success. If demand for JFrog Artifactory declines, the demand for our other products will\nalso decline. Demand for JFrog Artifactory is affected by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, such as continued market acceptance of\nJFrog Artifactory and products by customers for existing and new use cases, the timing of development and release of new features, functionality, and lower cost\nalternatives introduced by our competitors, technological changes and developments within the markets we serve, and growth or contraction in our addressable\nmarkets. If we are unable to continue to meet customer demand, if our products fail to compete with the products of our competitors, if we fail to achieve more\nwidespread market acceptance of JFrog Artifactory, or if our products fail to meet statutory, regulatory, contractual, or other applicable requirements, then our\nbusiness, results of operations, and financial condition would be harmed.\nIf we are unable to increase sales of our subscriptions to new customers, sell additional subscriptions to our existing customers, or expand the value of our\nexisting customers’ subscriptions, our future revenue and results of operations will be harmed.\nOur future success depends on our ability to sell our subscriptions to new customers and to expand within our existing customers by selling paid\nsubscriptions to our existing users and expanding the value and number of existing customers’ subscriptions within the organization. Our ability to sell new\nsubscriptions depends on a number of factors, including the prices of our products, the functionality of our products, the prices of products offered by our\ncompetitors, and the budgets of our\n44\nTable of Contents\ncustomers. We serve customer needs with multiple tiers of subscriptions that differ based on product depth and functionality. We also offer a limited free trial of\nour platform. To the extent that users of our free trial do not become, or lead others not to become, paying customers, we will not realize the intended benefits of\nthese strategies, our expenses may increase as a result of associated hosting costs, and our ability to grow our business may be harmed.\nWe also offer an open source version of JFrog Artifactory. Our open source version is intended to increase visibility and familiarity of our platform among\nthe developer communities. We invest in developers and developer communities through multiple channels, including the introduction of new open source\nprojects, as well as through our annual developer conference, swampUP, and other community-centered events. There is no guarantee that such events will\ntranslate into new customers, or that open source users will convert to paying subscribers.\nIn addition, a significant aspect of our sales and marketing focus is to expand deployments within existing customers. The rate at which our customers\npurchase additional subscriptions and expand the value of existing subscriptions depends on a number of factors, including customers’ level of satisfaction with\nour products, the nature and size of the deployments, the desire to address additional use cases, and the perceived need for additional features, as well as general\neconomic conditions. We have experienced in the past and expect in the future that recessionary concerns and other unfavorable economic conditions will\nnegatively impact our ability to expand deployments within existing customers. If our customers do not recognize the potential of our products, our business\nwould be materially and adversely affected.\nSeasonality may cause fluctuations in our sales and results of operations.\nHistorically, we have experienced seasonality in customer bookings, as we typically enter into a higher percentage of subscription agreements with new\ncustomers and renewals with existing customers in our fourth quarter. We believe that this results from the procurement, budgeting, and deployment cycles of\nmany of our customers, particularly our enterprise customers. We expect that this seasonality will continue to affect our bookings, deferred revenue, and our\nresults of operations in the future and might become more pronounced as we continue to target larger enterprise customers.\nIn addition, we have historically experienced seasonality in usage patterns by users of our SaaS subscriptions. We typically experience reduced usage by our\ncustomers during holiday periods, particularly at the end of the fourth quarter. As revenue from our SaaS subscriptions is recognized based upon usage, the\nchanges in usage patterns may negatively affect revenues from our SaaS subscriptions and our results of operations.\nIf our existing customers do not renew their subscriptions, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe expect to derive a significant portion of our revenue from renewals of existing subscriptions. Our customers have no contractual obligation to renew their\nsubscriptions after the completion of their subscription term. Our self-managed subscriptions are offered on an annual and multi-year basis, and SaaS\nsubscriptions are offered on a monthly, annual, and multi-year basis. For our JFrog-managed products, we also offer subscriptions for committed usage amounts.\nOur customers’ renewals may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their satisfaction with our products and our customer support, the\nfrequency and severity of product outages, our product uptime or latency, the pricing of our, or competing, products, additional new features and capabilities that\nwe offer, new integrations, and updates to our products as a result of updates by technology partners. If our customers renew their subscriptions, they may renew\nfor shorter subscription terms or on other terms that are less economically beneficial to us. We may not accurately predict future renewal trends. If our customers\ndo not renew their subscriptions, or renew on less favorable terms, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline.\nWe recognize a significant portion of revenue from subscriptions over the term of the relevant subscription period, and as a result, downturns or upturns in\nsales are not immediately reflected in full in our results of operations.\nWe recognize a significant portion of our subscription revenue over the term of the relevant subscription period. As a result, much of the subscription revenue\nwe report each fiscal quarter is the recognition of deferred revenue from subscription contracts entered into during previous fiscal quarters. Consequently, a\ndecline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one fiscal quarter will not be fully or immediately reflected in revenue in that fiscal quarter and will negatively\naffect our revenue in future fiscal quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in new or renewed sales of our subscriptions is not reflected in full in\nour results of operations until future periods.\n45\nTable of Contents\nA real or perceived defect, security vulnerability, error, or performance failure in our software could cause us to lose revenue, damage our reputation, and\nexpose us to liability.\nOur products are inherently complex and, despite extensive testing and quality control, have in the past and may in the future contain defects or errors,\nespecially when first introduced, or not perform as contemplated. These defects, security vulnerabilities, errors, or performance failures could cause damage to\nour reputation, loss of customers or revenue, order cancellations, service terminations, or lack of market acceptance of our software. As the use of our products,\nincluding products that were recently acquired or developed, expands to more sensitive, secure, or mission critical uses by our customers, we may be subject to\nincreased scrutiny, potential reputational risk, or potential liability should our software fail to perform as contemplated in such deployments. We have in the past\nand may in the future need to issue corrective releases of our software to fix these defects, errors, or performance failures, which could require us to allocate\nsignificant research and development and customer support resources to address these problems.\nAny limitation of liability provisions that may be contained in our customer, user, third-party vendor, service provider, and partner agreements may not be\nenforceable or adequate or effective as a result of existing or future applicable law or unfavorable judicial decisions, and they may not function to limit our\nliability arising from regulatory enforcement. The sale and support of our products entail the risk of liability claims, which could be substantial in light of the use\nof our products in enterprise-wide environments. In addition, our insurance against this liability may not be adequate to cover a potential claim and potentially\nmay be subject to exclusions, or that the insurer will deny coverage as to any future claim or exclude from our coverage such claims in policy renewals. The\ndenial of our claims by our insurer or the successful assertion of claims by others against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of\nchanges in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, including our financial condition, results of operations, and reputation.\nIncorrect implementation or use of, or our customers’ failure to update, our software could result in customer dissatisfaction and negatively affect our\nbusiness, operations, financial results, and growth prospects.\nOur products are often operated in large scale, complex IT environments. Our customers and some partners require training and experience in the proper use\nof and the benefits that can be derived from our products to maximize their potential. If users of our products do not implement, use, or update our products\ncorrectly or as intended, then inadequate performance and/or security vulnerabilities may result. Because our customers rely on our software to manage a wide\nrange of operations, the incorrect implementation, use of, or our customers’ failure to update, our software or our failure to train customers on how to use our\nsoftware productively has in the past and may in the future result in customer dissatisfaction and negative publicity and may adversely affect our reputation and\nbrand. Our failure to effectively provide training and implementation services to our customers could result in lost opportunities for follow-on sales to these\ncustomers and decrease subscriptions by new customers, which would adversely affect our business and growth prospects.\nInterruptions or performance problems associated with our technology and infrastructure, and our reliance on technologies from third parties, may\nadversely affect our business operations and financial results.\nWe outsource substantially all of the infrastructure relating to our cloud products to third-party cloud providers chosen by our customers. Customers of our\nSaaS offerings need to be able to access our platform at any time, without interruption or degradation of performance, and we provide them with service-level\ncommitments with respect to uptime. Third-party cloud providers run their own platforms that we access, and we are, therefore, vulnerable to their service\ninterruptions and any changes in their product offerings. Any limitation on the capacity of our third-party hosting services could impede our ability to onboard\nnew customers or expand the usage of our existing customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In\naddition, any incident affecting our third-party hosting services’ infrastructure that may be caused by cyber-attacks, natural disasters, fire, flood, severe storm,\nearthquake, power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorist or other attacks, protests or riots, and other similar events beyond our control could negatively\naffect our cloud-based and multi-cloud hybrid products. These risks may be heightened in connection with the war between Israel, Hamas and Hezbollah, the\nwar between Russia and Ukraine, and associated geopolitical tensions and regional instability. It is also possible that our customers and regulators would seek to\nhold us accountable for any breach of security affecting a third-party cloud provider’s infrastructure and we may incur significant liability in investigating such\nan incident and responding to any claims, investigations, or proceedings made or initiated by those customers, regulators, and other third parties. We may not be\nable to recover a material portion of such liabilities from any of our third-party cloud providers. It may also become increasingly difficult to maintain and\nimprove our performance, especially during peak usage times, as our software becomes more complex and the usage of our software increases. Moreover,\n46\nTable of Contents\nour insurance may not be adequate to cover such liability and may be subject to exclusions. Any of the above circumstances or events may harm our business,\nresults of operations, and financial condition.\nIn addition, our website and internal technology infrastructure may experience performance issues due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure\nchanges, human or software errors, website or third-party hosting disruptions, capacity constraints, technical failures, natural disasters, or fraud or security\nattacks. Our use and distribution of open source software may increase this risk. If our website is unavailable or our users are unable to download our products\nor order subscriptions or services within a reasonable amount of time or at all, our business could be harmed. We expect to continue to make significant\ninvestments to maintain and improve website performance and to enable rapid releases of new features and applications for our products. To the extent that we\ndo not effectively upgrade our systems as needed and continually develop our technology to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our\nbusiness and results of operations may be harmed.\nIn the event that our service agreements with our third-party hosting services are terminated, or there is a lapse of service, elimination of services or features\nthat we utilize, interruption of internet service provider connectivity, or damage to such facilities, we could experience interruptions in access to our platform as\nwell as significant delays and additional expense in arranging or creating new facilities and services and/or re-architecting our cloud solution for deployment on\na different cloud infrastructure service provider, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe also rely on cloud technologies from third parties in order to operate critical functions of our business, including financial management services,\nrelationship management services, and lead generation management services. If these services become unavailable due to extended outages or interruptions or\nbecause they are no longer available on commercially reasonable terms or prices, our expenses could increase, our ability to manage our finances could be\ninterrupted, our processes for managing sales of our products and supporting our customers could be impaired, and our ability to generate and manage sales\nleads could be weakened until equivalent services, if available, are identified, obtained, and implemented, any of which could harm our business and results of\noperations.\nWe typically provide service-level commitments under our subscription agreements. If we fail to meet these contractual commitments, we could be obligated\nto provide credits for future service or face subscription termination with refunds of prepaid amounts, which would decrease our revenue and harm our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur subscription agreements typically contain service-level commitments. If we are unable to meet the stated service-level commitments, including failure to\nmeet the uptime and response time requirements under our customer subscription agreements, we may be contractually obligated to provide these customers\nwith service credits which would significantly affect our revenue in the periods in which the failure occurs and the credits are applied. We could also face\nsubscription terminations and a reduction in renewals, which would significantly affect both our current and future revenue. We offer multiple tiers of\nsubscriptions to our products and as such our service-level commitments will increase if more customers choose subscriptions of JFrog Pro X, JFrog Enterprise\nX, and JFrog Enterprise Plus. Any service-level failures could also damage our reputation, which could also adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations.\nWe depend on our executive officers and other key employees, and the loss of one or more of these employees or an inability to attract and retain highly\nskilled employees could harm our business.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. The loss of the services of any of our key\npersonnel, the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel, or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly in engineering and sales, may seriously harm\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations. Although we have entered into employment agreements with our key personnel, employment in the\nU.S. is generally for no specific duration and constitutes at-will employment. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing\nengineering personnel because of the complexity of our products.\nOur future performance also depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management to execute on our business plan and\nto identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations. The loss of services of senior management could significantly delay or prevent the\nachievement of our development and strategic objectives, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAdditionally, the industry in which we operate is generally characterized by significant competition for skilled personnel as well as high rates of employee\nattrition. There is currently a high demand for experienced DevSecOps professionals and we may not be successful in attracting, integrating, or retaining\nqualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs. Also, to the extent\n47\nTable of Contents\nwe hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited, that they have divulged proprietary or other\nconfidential information, or that their former employers own their inventions or other work product.\nTo execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for these employees is intense, specifically for engineers for\nresearch and development, security experts, and support positions who are experienced in DevSecOps, and such competition often results in increasing wages,\nespecially in Israel, where most of our research and development positions are located, and in the San Francisco Bay Area, where we have a significant\npresence. Therefore, we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. We have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect\nto continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. Our recent hires and planned hires may not\nbecome as productive as we expect, and we may be unable to hire, integrate, or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals. Many of the companies with\nwhich we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have, and due to our profile and market position, such competitors actively seek to\nhire skilled personnel away from us, even if such employee has entered into a non-compete agreement. Israeli labor courts have required employers seeking to\nenforce non-compete undertakings of a former employee to demonstrate that the competitive activities of the former employee will harm one of a limited\nnumber of material interests of the employer that have been recognized by the courts, such as the protection of a company’s trade secrets or other intellectual\nproperty. We may not be able to make such a demonstration.\nIn addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the internet and high-technology industries, job candidates often consider the value of the equity\nthey are to receive in connection with their employment. Employees may be more likely to leave us if the shares they own or the shares underlying their equity\nincentive awards have significantly appreciated or significantly reduced in value. Many of our employees may receive significant proceeds from sales of our\nequity in the public markets, which may reduce their motivation to continue to work for us and could lead to employee attrition. If we fail to attract new\npersonnel, or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and growth prospects could be harmed.\nIf we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, especially among developers, security teams, and IT operators, our business and results of operations\nmay be adversely affected.\nWe believe that developing and maintaining widespread awareness of our brand, especially with developers, security teams, and IT operators, is critical to\nachieving widespread acceptance of our software and attracting new users and customers. Brand promotion activities may not generate user or customer\nawareness or increase revenue, and even if they do, any increase in revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brand. If we fail to successfully\npromote and maintain our brand, we may fail to attract or retain users and customers necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, or to\nachieve the widespread brand awareness that is critical for broad customer adoption of our products.\nOur corporate culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, creativity, and\nentrepreneurial spirit we have worked to foster, which could harm our business.\nWe believe that our culture has been and will continue to be a key contributor to our success. We expect to continue to hire as we expand. If we do not\ncontinue to maintain our corporate culture as we grow, we may be unable to foster the innovation, creativity, and entrepreneurial spirit we believe we need to\nsupport our growth. Our anticipated headcount growth and our continued operation as a public company may result in a change to our corporate culture, which\ncould harm our business.\nOur ability to achieve customer renewals and increase sales of our products is highly dependent on the quality of our customer support, and our failure to\noffer high quality support would have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, and results of operations.\nOur customers depend on our customer support services to resolve issues and realize the full benefits relating to our products. If we do not succeed in helping\nour customers quickly resolve post-deployment issues or provide effective ongoing support and education on our products, our ability to sell additional\nsubscriptions to, or renew subscriptions with, existing customers or expand the value of existing customers’ subscriptions would be adversely affected and our\nreputation with potential customers could be damaged. Many larger enterprise customers have more complex IT environments and require higher levels of\nsupport than smaller customers. If we fail to meet the requirements of these enterprise customers, it may be more difficult to grow sales with them.\nAdditionally, it can take several months to recruit, hire, and train qualified engineering-level customer support employees. We may not be able to hire such\nresources fast enough to keep up with demand, particularly if the sales of our products exceed our internal forecasts. To the extent that we are unsuccessful in\nhiring, training, and retaining adequate support resources, our ability to provide adequate and timely support to our customers, and our customers’ satisfaction\nwith our products, will be adversely\n48\nTable of Contents\naffected. Our failure to provide and maintain high-quality support services would have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, and results of operations.\nWe currently primarily rely on an inbound sales model that may not continue to be as successful as we anticipate, and the absence of a large, direct,\ntraditional sales function may impede the growth of our business.\nWe currently primarily rely on an inbound sales model that may not continue to be as successful as we anticipate, and the absence of a large, direct,\ntraditional sales function may impede our future growth. We intend to continue to expand our strategic sales team to identify new use cases and drive expansion\nand standardization on JFrog within our largest customers. There is no guarantee, however, that this strategic sales team will be successful. Moreover, we are not\nable to predict whether the deployment of our strategic sales team may adversely affect our inbound sales model. If our efforts to sell subscriptions to new\ncustomers and to expand deployments with existing customers are not successful, our total revenue and revenue growth rate may decline and our business will\nsuffer.\nFurther, as we continue to scale our business, a more traditional sales infrastructure could assist in reaching larger enterprise customers and growing our\nrevenue. Identifying, recruiting, and training such a qualified sales force would require significant time, expense, and attention and would significantly impact\nour business model. We believe that there is significant competition for sales personnel, including sales representatives, sales managers, and sales engineers,\nwith the skills and technical knowledge that we require. Our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training,\nand retaining sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth. New hires require significant training and it may take significant time before they\nachieve full productivity.\nIn addition, expanding our sales infrastructure would considerably change our cost structure and results of operations, and we may have to reduce other\nexpenses, such as our research and development expenses, in order to accommodate a corresponding increase in marketing and sales expenses, and maintain\npositive operating cash flow and free cash flow. Moreover, recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect, and we may be\nunable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business. In addition, particularly if we\ncontinue to grow rapidly, a large percentage of our sales force will have relatively little experience working with us, our subscriptions, and our business model.\nIf our lack of a large, direct enterprise sales force limits us from reaching larger enterprise customers and growing our revenue and we are unable to hire,\ndevelop, and retain talented sales personnel in the future, our revenue growth and results of operations may be harmed.\nThe sales prices of our products may fluctuate or decline, which may reduce our revenue and gross profit and adversely affect our financial results.\nThe sales prices for our products may fluctuate or decline for a variety of reasons, including competitive pricing pressures, discounts, anticipation of the\nintroduction of new products, or promotional programs. Competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate, and we expect\ncompetition to further increase in the future, thereby leading to increased pricing pressures. Larger competitors with more diverse offerings may reduce the price\nof offerings that compete with ours or may bundle them with other offerings and provide for free. Additionally, currency fluctuations in certain countries and\nregions may negatively impact actual prices that customers and partners are willing to pay in those countries and regions. Any decrease in the sales prices for\nour products, without a corresponding decrease in costs or increase in volume, would adversely affect our revenue and gross profit. Revenue and gross profit\nwould also be adversely affected by a shift in mix of our subscriptions from self-managed to our SaaS offerings, which have a lower gross margin. We cannot\nassure you that we will be able to maintain our prices and gross profits at levels that will allow us to achieve and maintain profitability.\nFurther, we have in the past, and expect in the future, to need to change our pricing model from time to time. While we do and will attempt to set prices based\non our prior experiences and customer feedback, our assessments may not be accurate, and we could be underpricing or overpricing our products. In addition, if\nour subscriptions change, then we may need to revise our pricing strategies. Any such changes to our pricing strategies or our ability to efficiently price our\nofferings could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Pricing pressures and decisions could result in reduced sales,\nreduced margins, losses, or the failure of our products to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance, any of which could negatively impact our\noverall business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n49\nTable of Contents\nWe expect our revenue mix to vary over time, which could harm our gross margin and results of operations.\nWe expect our revenue mix to vary over time due to a number of factors, including the mix of our subscriptions for self-managed and SaaS offerings, which\nmay affect the timing and amount of revenue recognized and the associated costs. Further, our gross margins and results of operations could be harmed by\nnumerous other factors, including entry into new markets or growth in lower margin markets; entry into markets with different pricing and cost structures;\npricing discounts; and increased price competition. Any one of these factors or the cumulative effects of certain of these factors may result in significant\nfluctuations in our gross margin and results of operations. This variability and unpredictability could result in our failure to meet internal expectations or those of\nsecurities analysts or investors for a particular period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons, the market price of our\nordinary shares could decline.\nThe length of our sales cycle can be unpredictable, particularly with respect to sales to large customers, and our sales efforts may require considerable time\nand expense.\nOur results of operations may fluctuate, in part, because of the length and variability of the sales cycle of our subscriptions and the difficulty in making short-\nterm adjustments to our operating expenses. Our results of operations depend in part on sales to new large customers and increasing sales to existing customers.\nThe length of our sales cycle, from initial contact from a prospective customer to contractually committing to our paid subscriptions, can vary substantially from\ncustomer to customer based on deal complexity as well as whether a sale is made directly by us. It is difficult to predict exactly when, or even if, we will make a\nsale to a potential customer or if we can increase sales to our existing customers. As a result, large individual sales have, in some cases, occurred in quarters\nsubsequent to those we anticipated, or have not occurred at all. Because a substantial proportion of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term, our results\nof operations will suffer if revenue falls below our expectations in a particular quarter, which could cause the price of our ordinary shares to decline.\nOur relatively limited operating history as a publicly traded company may make it difficult for investors to evaluate our current business and prospects and\nmay increase the risks associated with your investment.\nWe were founded in 2008 and our ordinary shares started trading on Nasdaq Global Select Market in September 2020. Our relatively limited operating\nhistory as a publicly traded company may make it difficult for investors to evaluate our current business and our future prospects, including our ability to plan\nfor and model future growth. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by rapidly growing companies in\nconstantly evolving industries. If we do not address these risks successfully, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected, and the market\nprice of our ordinary shares could decline.\nFurther, we have limited historical financial data and we operate in a rapidly evolving market. As such, any predictions about our future revenue and\nexpenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more predictable market.\nWe rely on traditional web search engines to direct traffic to our website. If our website fails to rank prominently in unpaid search results, traffic to our\nwebsite could decline and our business would be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract users through unpaid Internet search results on traditional web search engines such as Google. The\nnumber of users we attract to our website from search engines is due in large part to how and where our website ranks in unpaid search results. These rankings\ncan be affected by a number of factors, many of which are not in our direct control, and they may change frequently. For example, a search engine may change\nits ranking algorithms, methodologies, or design layouts. As a result, links to our website may not be sufficiently prominent to drive traffic to our website, and\nwe may not know how or otherwise be in a position to influence the results. Any reduction in the number of users directed to our website could reduce our\nrevenue or require us to increase our customer acquisition expenditures.\nUnfavorable economic conditions may adversely affect our business and financial condition due to impacts on consumer and business spending, including\nreductions in information technology spending and decreased demand for our products, which could limit our ability to grow our business.\nOur operations and financial performance depend in part on global economic conditions and the impact of these conditions on levels of information\ntechnology spending and the willingness of our current and prospective customers to purchase our products. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including\ninflation, slower growth or recession, bank failures or instability in the financial\n50\nTable of Contents\nservices sector, changes to fiscal and monetary policies, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currency fluctuations, could adversely impact consumer and\nbusinesses confidence and spending and negatively affect demand for our products.\nFor example, we are currently operating in a period of economic uncertainty. While interest rates have begun to decline and inflation is significantly lower\nthan in past quarters, the U.S. has experienced increased costs of labor, capital, employee compensation, and other similar effects in the recent past. If conditions\nin the national and global economy do not continue to improve or instead worsen, our current and potential customers’ operating costs will likely increase,\nwhich could result in reduced operating and information technology budgets. To the extent our products are perceived by customers and potential customers as\ndiscretionary, our revenue may be disproportionately affected by delays or reductions in general information technology spending. Such delays or reductions in\ntechnology spending are often associated with enhanced budget scrutiny by our customers including additional levels of approvals, cloud optimization efforts,\nand additional time to evaluate and test our products, which can lead to long and unpredictable sales cycles. We have recently experienced longer sales cycles\nfor certain products and enhanced budget scrutiny by our customers, and expect to continue to experience these challenges given the current macroeconomic\nenvironment. Also, customers may choose to develop in-house software as an alternative to using our products, and competitors may respond to such negative\nconditions in the general economy by lowering prices, any of which could adversely affect demand for our products and limit our ability to grow our business.\nThe present conditions and state of the U.S. and global economies make it difficult to predict whether, when, and to what extent a recession has occurred or\nwill occur in the future. We cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic slowdown, instability, or recovery, generally or within any\nparticular industry. If the economic conditions of the general economy or markets in which we operate do not improve, or worsen from present levels, our\nbusiness, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe have acquired, and may in the future acquire, complementary businesses which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business,\ndilute shareholder value, and adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products, or technologies. We have in the past acquired,\nand expect in the future to acquire, businesses that we believe will complement or augment our existing business, such as our Vdoo and Upswift acquisitions in\n2021 and our acquisition of Qwak in July 2024. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates is difficult, and we may not be able to complete such\nacquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. If we do complete future acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals\nand business strategy, we may be subject to claims or liabilities assumed from an acquired company, product, or technology, and any acquisitions we complete\ncould be viewed negatively by our customers, investors, and securities analysts. In addition, if we are unsuccessful at integrating future acquisitions, or the\ntechnologies associated with such acquisitions, the revenue and results of operations of the combined company could be adversely affected. Any integration\nprocess may require significant time and resources, which may disrupt our ongoing business and divert management’s attention, and we may not be able to\nmanage the integration process successfully.\nWe may have to pay cash, incur debt, or issue equity or equity-linked securities to pay for any future acquisitions, any of which could adversely affect our\nfinancial condition or the market price of our ordinary shares. The sale of equity or issuance of equity-linked debt to finance any future acquisitions could result\nin dilution to our shareholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions\nthat would impede our ability to raise additional capital and to manage our operations. The occurrence of any of these risks could harm our business, results of\noperations, and financial condition.\nOur failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new products could reduce our\nability to compete and could harm our business.\nHistorically, we have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily through equity issuances and cash generated from our operations. Although\nwe currently anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents and operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months,\nwe may require additional financing. We evaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things,\non our development efforts, business plans, operating performance, and condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We cannot assure you that\nadditional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or equity-\nlinked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to the rights of our ordinary shares, and our shareholders may\nexperience dilution.\n51\nTable of Contents\nIf we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms, we may not be able to, among other things:\n• develop or enhance our products;\n• continue to expand our research and development and sales and marketing organizations;\n• acquire complementary technologies, products, or businesses;\n• expand operations in the U.S. or internationally;\n• hire, train, and retain employees; or\n• respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements.\nOur failure to have sufficient capital to do any of these things could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nA minor portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities, which are subject to a number of challenges and risks.\nSales to government entities are subject to a number of risks that are specific to public sector customers. Selling to government entities can be highly\ncompetitive, expensive, and time-consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale.\nGovernment certification requirements for products like ours may change, thereby restricting our ability to sell into the U.S. federal government, U.S. state\ngovernments, or non-U.S. government sectors until we have attained such revised certification or certifications. Government demand and payment for our\nproducts may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector\ndemand for our products. Additionally, any actual or perceived privacy, data protection, or data security incident, or even any perceived defect with regard to our\npractices or measures in these areas, may negatively impact public sector demand for our products.\nAdditionally, we rely on certain partners to provide technical support services to certain of our government entity customers to resolve any issues relating to\nour products. If our partners do not effectively assist our government entity customers in deploying our products, succeed in helping our government entity\ncustomers quickly resolve post-deployment issues, or provide effective ongoing support, our ability to sell additional products to new and existing government\nentity customers would be adversely affected and our reputation could be damaged.\nGovernment entities may have statutory, contractual, or other legal rights to terminate contracts with us for convenience or due to a default, and any such\ntermination may adversely affect our future results of operations. Governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes,\nand any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our subscriptions, a reduction of revenue, or fines or civil or criminal\nliability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIssues in the development and use of AI, combined with an uncertain regulatory environment, may result in reputational harm, liability, or other adverse\nconsequences to our business operations.\nWe have deployed machine learning and AI technologies in our offerings and business, including developing new product features utilizing AI technologies.\nAI technology may become more important to our operations or to our future growth over time. We may fail to properly implement or market our use of AI\ntechnology. Our products and systems may become targets for abuse powered by AI, and our support for MLOps may fall behind existing standards which are\nchanging rapidly. Our competitors or other third parties may incorporate AI technology into their products, offerings, and solutions more quickly or more\nsuccessfully than us, which could impair our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our results of operations.\nAI technology also may be the subject of new or modified legal and regulatory obligations. For example, the EU AI Act (the “AI Act”) which entered into\nforce on August 1, 2024, will impose obligations on providers and users of AI. Under the AI Act, fines can reach up to €35 million or 7% of global income. The\nAI Act may impact the incorporation of AI technologies into our offerings and business in Europe. Other countries, including the U.S. at both the state and\nfederal level, are increasingly looking\n52\nTable of Contents\nto regulate AI. For example, on October 30, 2023, the Biden Administration issued an Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and\nUse of Artificial Intelligence, and several AI bills have been introduced in Congress. A significant number of other countries are contemplating laws regulating\nAI. and numerous U.S. states have proposed, and in certain cases enacted, legislation relating to AI.\nUncertainty regarding new and emerging AI technologies, such as generative AI, may require us to incur additional expenses to research and integrate\ngenerative AI, or other emerging AI technologies, into our future product offerings and our internal systems. Any such research, implementation, and integration\nmay be costly and could impact our results of operations. Additionally, AI may create content that appears correct but is factually inaccurate or flawed. Our use\nof AI technology may expose us to additional claims, demands, and proceedings by private parties, customers, and regulatory authorities and subject us to legal\nliability as well as brand and reputational harm, confidentiality or security risks, competitive harm, ethical and social concerns, or other complications that could\nadversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\nExpectations of our performance relating to environmental, social, and governance factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks.\nThere is an increasing focus from regulators, certain investors, and other stakeholders concerning environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters,\nboth in the U.S. and internationally. We have undertaken and expect to continue to undertake certain ESG-related initiatives, goals, and commitments, which we\nhave communicated on our website, in our SEC filings, and elsewhere. These initiatives, goals, or commitments could be difficult to achieve and costly to\nimplement. We could fail to achieve, or be perceived to fail to achieve, our ESG-related initiatives, goals, or commitments. In addition, we could be criticized\nfor the timing, scope, or nature of these initiatives, goals, or commitments, or for any revisions to them. Stakeholders could also challenge the accuracy,\nadequacy, or completeness of our ESG-related disclosures. Our actual or perceived failure to achieve some or all of our ESG-related initiatives, goals, or\ncommitments or maintain ESG practices that meet evolving stakeholder expectations or regulatory requirements could harm our reputation, adversely impact\nour ability to attract and retain employees or customers, and expose us to increased scrutiny from ESG-focused investors, regulatory authorities, and others, or\nsubject us to liability. Damage to our reputation or reduced demand for our products may adversely impact our business, financial condition, or results of\noperations.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nFailure to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights could substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nOur success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our proprietary technology, methodologies, know-how, and brand. We rely on a\ncombination of trademarks, copyrights, patents, contractual restrictions, and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality procedures to establish and\nprotect our proprietary rights. However, we make certain products, including a limited-functionality version of JFrog Artifactory, available under open source\nlicenses, contribute other source code to open source projects under open source licenses, and release internal software projects under open source licenses, and\nanticipate doing so in the future. Because the source code for the open source version of JFrog Artifactory and any other software we contribute to open source\nprojects or distribute under open source licenses is publicly available, our ability to monetize and protect our intellectual property rights with respect to such\nsource code may be limited or, in some cases, lost entirely. Our competitors could access such source code and use it to create software and service offerings that\ncompete with ours.\nFurther, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate. We will not be able to protect our intellectual property rights if we are\nunable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights\nadequately, our competitors may gain access to our proprietary technology and our business may be harmed. In addition, defending our intellectual property\nrights might entail significant expense. Any patents, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights that we have or may obtain may be challenged by others or\ninvalidated through administrative process or litigation. We hold a number of active patents and have filed patent applications both in the U.S. and in other\ncountries. There can be no assurance that our patent applications will result in issued patents. Even if we continue to seek patent protection in the future, we may\nbe unable to obtain further patent protection for our technology. In addition, any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or\nmay be successfully challenged by third parties. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of intellectual\nproperty rights are uncertain.\n53\nTable of Contents\nDespite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our products and use information that we regard as proprietary to create\nofferings that compete with ours. Effective patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our\nproducts are available. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names or trademarks that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the\nvalue of our trademarks and other proprietary rights. The laws of some countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the U.S., and\nmechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. As we continue to expand our international activities, our exposure to\nunauthorized copying and use of our products and proprietary information will likely increase. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent\nthird parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.\nWe enter into confidential, non-compete, proprietary, and inventions assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into\nconfidentiality agreements with other parties. No assurance can be given that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to and distribution of our\nproprietary information, especially in certain states and countries, including Israel, that are less willing to enforce such agreements. Further, these agreements\nmay not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products.\nIn order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights.\nLitigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our\nintellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming, and distracting to management, and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our\nintellectual property. Further, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits attacking the\nvalidity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our inability to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, as well as\nany costly litigation or diversion of our management’s attention and resources, could delay further sales or the implementation of our products, impair the\nfunctionality of our products, delay introductions of new products, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our products, or injure our\nreputation.\nWe could incur substantial costs as a result of any claim of infringement, misappropriation, or violation of another party’s intellectual property rights.\nIn recent years, there has been significant litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights in the software industry. We do not currently have\na large patent portfolio, which could prevent us from deterring patent infringement claims through our own patent portfolio, and our competitors and others may\nnow and in the future have significantly larger and more mature patent portfolios than we have. The intellectual property ownership and license rights, including\ncopyright, surrounding AI technologies has not yet been fully addressed by lawmakers or courts, and the use of third party AI in our products offerings may\nresult in exposure to claims of copyright infringement or other intellectual property misappropriation. We could incur substantial costs in prosecuting or\ndefending any intellectual property litigation. If we sue to enforce our rights or are sued by a third party that claims that our products infringe, misappropriate, or\nviolate their rights, the litigation could be expensive, time-consuming and could divert our management and other employee resources.\nAny intellectual property litigation to which we might become a party, or for which we are required to provide indemnification, may require us to do one or\nmore of the following:\n• cease selling or using products that incorporate or cover the intellectual property rights that we allegedly infringe, misappropriate, or violate;\n• make substantial payments for legal fees, settlement payments, or other costs or damages;\n• obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, to sell or use the relevant technology; or\n• redesign the allegedly infringing products to avoid infringement, misappropriation, or violation, which could be costly, time-consuming, or impossible.\nIf we are required to make substantial payments or undertake any of the other actions noted above as a result of any intellectual property infringement,\nmisappropriation, or violation claims against us or any obligation to indemnify our customers for such claims, such payments or actions could harm our\nbusiness.\n54\nTable of Contents\nWe may become subject to claims for remuneration or royalties for assigned service invention rights by our employees, which could result in litigation and\nwould adversely affect our business.\nA significant portion of our intellectual property has been developed by our employees in the course of their employment for us. Under the Israeli Patents\nLaw, 5727-1967 (the “Patents Law”), inventions conceived by an employee in the course and as a result of or arising from his or her employment with a\ncompany are regarded as “service inventions,” which belong to the employer, absent a specific agreement between the employee and employer giving the\nemployee service invention rights. The Patents Law also provides that if there is no such agreement between an employer and an employee, the Israeli\nCompensation and Royalties Committee (the “Committee”), a body constituted under the Patents Law, shall determine whether the employee is entitled to\nremuneration for his or her inventions. Case law clarifies that the right to receive consideration for “service inventions” can be waived by the employee and that,\nin certain circumstances, such waiver does not necessarily have to be explicit. The Committee will examine, on a case-by-case basis, the general contractual\nframework between the parties, applying interpretation rules of the general Israeli contract laws. Further, the Committee has not yet determined one specific\nformula for calculating this remuneration, but rather uses the criteria specified in the Patents Law. Although we generally enter into assignment-of-invention\nagreements with our employees pursuant to which such individuals assign to us all rights to any inventions created in the scope of their employment or\nengagement with us, we may face claims demanding remuneration in consideration for assigned inventions. As a consequence of such claims, we could be\nrequired to pay additional remuneration or royalties to our current and former employees, or be forced to litigate such claims, which could negatively affect our\nbusiness.\nIndemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement, misappropriation, violation,\nand other losses.\nOur agreements with customers and other third parties may include indemnification provisions under which we agree to indemnify them for losses suffered\nor incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or violation, damages caused by us to property or persons, or other\nliabilities relating to or arising from our software, services or other contractual obligations. Large indemnity payments could harm our business, results of\noperations, and financial condition. Pursuant to certain agreements, we do not have a cap on our liability and any payments under such agreements would harm\nour business, results of operations, and financial condition. Although we normally contractually limit our liability with respect to such indemnity obligations, we\nmay still incur substantial liability related to them. Any dispute with a customer with respect to such obligations could have adverse effects on our relationship\nwith that customer and other existing customers and new customers and harm our business and results of operations.\nOur use of open source software could negatively affect our ability to sell our products and subject us to possible litigation.\nOur paid products incorporate open source software, and we expect to continue to incorporate open source software in our paid products in the future. Few of\nthe licenses applicable to open source software have been interpreted by courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a manner that could\nimpose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our paid products. Moreover, we cannot assure you that we have not used\nadditional open source software in our software in a manner that is inconsistent with the terms of the applicable license or our current policies and procedures. If\nwe fail to comply with these licenses, we may be subject to certain requirements, including requirements that we offer additional portions of our solutions for no\ncost, that we make available additional source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating or using the open source software,\nand that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of applicable open source licenses. If an author or other third party that distributes\nsuch open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant\nlegal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from the sale of our products that contained the open\nsource software, and required to comply with onerous conditions or restrictions on these products, which could disrupt the distribution and sale of these\nproducts. In addition, there have been claims challenging the ownership rights in open source software against companies that incorporate open source software\ninto their products, and the licensors of such open source software provide no warranties or indemnities with respect to such claims. In any of these events, we\nand our customers could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products, and to re-engineer our products or discontinue\nthe sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis. We and our customers may also be subject to suits by parties\nclaiming infringement, misappropriation, or violation due to the reliance by our solutions on certain open source software, and such litigation could be costly for\nus to defend or subject us to an injunction. Some open source projects provided on an “as-is” basis have known vulnerabilities and architectural instabilities\nwhich, if not properly addressed, could negatively affect the performance of our product. Any of the foregoing could require us to devote additional research and\ndevelopment resources to re-engineer our solutions, could result in customer dissatisfaction, and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and\nfinancial condition.\n55\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Privacy, Data Protection, and Cybersecurity\nWe are subject to stringent and changing laws, regulations, standards, and contractual obligations related to privacy, data protection, and data security. Our\nactual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business.\nWe receive, collect, store, process, transfer, retain, use, and otherwise process personal information and other data relating to users of our products, our\nemployees and contractors, and other persons. We have legal and contractual obligations regarding the protection of confidentiality and appropriate use of\ncertain data, including personal information. We are subject to numerous federal, state, local, and international laws, directives, and regulations regarding\nprivacy, data protection, and data security and the collection, storing, sharing, use, processing, transfer, retention, security, disclosure, and protection of personal\ninformation and other data, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions or conflict with\nother legal and regulatory requirements. We are also subject to certain contractual obligations to third parties related to privacy, data protection, and data\nsecurity. We strive to comply with our applicable policies and applicable laws, regulations, contractual obligations, and other legal obligations relating to\nprivacy, data protection, and data security to the extent possible. However, the regulatory framework for privacy, data protection, and data security worldwide is,\nand is likely to remain for the foreseeable future, uncertain and complex, and it is possible that these or other actual or alleged obligations may be interpreted\nand applied in a manner that we do not anticipate or that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other legal obligations or our\npractices. Any perception of privacy, data security, or data protection concerns or an inability to comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry\nstandards, contractual obligations, or other legal obligations, even if unfounded, may result in additional cost and liability to us, harm our reputation and inhibit\nadoption of our products by current and future customers, and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, any\nsignificant change to applicable laws, regulations, or industry practices regarding the collection, storing, sharing, use, retention, security, protection, disclosure,\nother processing of data, or their interpretation, or any changes regarding the manner in which the consent of users or other data subjects for the collection, use,\nretention, disclosure, or other processing of such data must be obtained, could increase our costs and require us to modify our services and features, possibly in a\nmaterial manner, which we may be unable to complete, and may limit our ability to store and process user data or develop new services and features.\nIf we were found in violation of any applicable laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection, or data security, in addition to any regulatory fines,\npenalties, or litigation costs, our business may be materially and adversely affected and we would likely have to change our business practices and potentially\nthe services and features available through our platform. In addition, these laws and regulations could constrain our ability to use and process data in manners\nthat may be commercially desirable. In addition, if a breach of data security were to occur or to be alleged to have occurred, if any violation of laws and\nregulations relating to privacy, data protection, or data security were to be alleged, or if we had any actual or alleged defect in our safeguards or practices\nrelating to privacy, data protection, or data security, our solutions may be perceived as less desirable and our business, prospects, financial condition, and results\nof operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nVarious U.S. privacy laws are potentially relevant to our business, including the Federal Trade Commission Act, Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited\nPornography and Marketing Act, and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. Any actual or perceived failure to comply with these laws could result in a costly\ninvestigation or litigation resulting in potentially significant liability, loss of trust by our users, and a material and adverse impact on our reputation and business.\nWithin the U.S., we anticipate increasing regulation of privacy, data protection, and data security, including the adoption of more stringent laws. For example,\nin June 2018, California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which provides new data privacy rights for California consumers and new\noperational requirements for covered companies. The CCPA, among other things, provides that covered companies must provide new disclosures to California\nconsumers and afford such consumers new data privacy rights that include the right to request a copy from a covered company of the personal information\ncollected about them, the right to request deletion of such personal information, and the right to request to opt-out of certain sales of such personal information.\nThe CCPA became operative on January 1, 2020. The California Attorney General can enforce the CCPA, including seeking an injunction and civil penalties for\nviolations. The CCPA provides a private right of action for certain data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA has required us to\nmodify our data practices and policies and to incur certain costs and expenses in an effort to comply. Additionally, a new privacy law, the California Privacy\nRights Act (“CPRA”), was approved by California voters in November 2020. The CPRA modifies the CCPA significantly, potentially resulting in further\nuncertainty and requiring us to incur additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply. Additionally, other states have proposed or enacted privacy, data\nprotection, and data security laws, including, for example, Washington’s My Health, My Data Act, and other laws similar to the CCPA such as in Virginia,\nColorado, Utah, Connecticut, Iowa, Indiana, Montana, Tennessee, Oregon, Delaware, New Jersey, Texas, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire,\n56\nTable of Contents\nNebraska, and Rhode Island. These newly proposed or enacted laws could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business.\nWith respect to cybersecurity in the U.S., we are closely monitoring the development of rules and guidance pursuant to various executive orders that may\napply to us, including pursuant to Executive Order 14028 for “EO-critical software,” for example. These developing rules and guidance may increase our\ncompliance costs and delay customer contract execution.\nInternationally, we also expect that there will continue to be new laws, regulations, and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection, cybersecurity,\nand AI proposed and enacted in various jurisdictions. For example, the data protection and cybersecurity landscapes in the European Union (“EU”) continues to\nevolve, resulting in possible significant operational costs for internal compliance and risks to our business. The EU adopted the General Data Protection\nRegulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018, and contains numerous requirements and changes from previously existing EU laws, including\nmore robust obligations on data processors and heavier documentation requirements for data protection compliance programs by companies. Among other\nrequirements, the GDPR regulates the transfer of personal data subject to the GDPR to third countries that have not been found to provide adequate protection to\nsuch personal data, including the U.S. Failure to comply with the GDPR could result in penalties for noncompliance (including possible fines of up to the greater\nof €20 million and 4% of our global annual turnover for the preceding financial year for the most serious violations, as well as the right to compensation for\nfinancial or non-financial damages claimed by individuals under Article 82 of the GDPR). Despite our efforts to attempt to comply with the GDPR, a regulator\nmay determine that we have not done so and subject us to fines and public censure, which could harm our company.\nAmong other requirements, the GDPR regulates transfers of personal data outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) to third countries that have not\nbeen found to provide adequate protection to such personal data, including the U.S. With regard to transfers to the U.S. of personal data from our employees and\nEuropean customers and users, we rely upon the Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”). The “Schrems II” decision issued by the Court of Justice of the\nEuropean Union (“CJEU”) on July 16, 2020, invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as a mechanism to transfer personal data from the EEA to the\nU.S. In the same decision, the CJEU confirmed the validity of the SCCs, but advised that the SCCs must be considered on a case-by-case basis, in conjunction\nwith an assessment as to whether national security laws conflict with the guarantees provided by the data importer under the SCCs. The European Commission\nhas issued new SCCs that account for the CJEU’s “Schrems II” decision and that are required to be implemented. These developments represent a milestone in\nthe regulation of cross-border data transfers, and have required major changes to our data transfer policy, including the need to conduct legal, technical, and\nsecurity assessments for each data transfer from the EEA to a country outside of the EEA. This means that we may be unsuccessful in maintaining legitimate\nmeans for our transfer and receipt of personal data from the EEA. We may, in addition to other impacts, experience additional costs associated with increased\ncompliance burdens, and we and our customers face the potential for regulators in the EEA to apply different standards to the transfer of personal data from the\nEEA to the U.S., and to block, or require ad hoc verification of measures taken with respect to, certain data flows from the EEA to the U.S. We also anticipate\nbeing required to engage in new contract negotiations with third parties that aid in processing data on our behalf, and entering into the new SCCs. We may\nexperience reluctance or refusal by current or prospective European customers to use our products, and we may find it necessary or desirable to make further\nchanges to our handling of personal data of EEA residents.\nThe regulatory environment applicable to the handling of EEA residents' personal data, and our actions taken in response, may cause us to assume additional\nliabilities or incur additional costs and could result in our business, operating results, and financial condition being harmed. We and our customers may face a\nrisk of enforcement actions by data protection authorities in the EEA relating to personal data transfers to us and by us from the EEA. Any such enforcement\nactions could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, distract management and technical personnel, and negatively affect our business, operating\nresults and financial condition.\nIn addition to the GDPR, the European Commission has another draft regulation in the approval process that focuses on a person’s right to conduct a private\nlife. The proposed legislation, known as the Regulation of Privacy and Electronic Communications (“ePrivacy Regulation”), would replace the current ePrivacy\nDirective. Originally planned to be adopted and implemented at the same time as the GDPR, the ePrivacy Regulation is still being negotiated. Most recently, on\nFebruary 10, 2021, the Council of the EU agreed on its version of the draft ePrivacy Regulation. If adopted, ePrivacy Regulation is anticipated to have broad\npotential impacts on the use of internet-based services and tracking technologies, such as cookies. Aspects of the ePrivacy Regulation remain for negotiation\nbetween the European Commission and the Council. We expect to incur additional costs to comply with the requirements of the ePrivacy Regulation as it is\nfinalized for implementation. Additionally, on January 13, 2022, the Austrian data protection authority published a decision ruling that the collection of personal\ndata and transfer to the U.S. through Google Analytics and other analytics and tracking tools used by website operators violates the GDPR. On February\n57\nTable of Contents\n10, 2022, the French data protection authority issued a press release stating that the French data protection authority had issued a similar decision. On June 23,\n2022, the Italian data protection authority adopted a similar decision, and on September 21, 2022, the Danish data protection authority adopted a similar\ndecision. Other data protection authorities in the EU are increasingly focused on the use of online tracking tools and have indicated that they plan to issue\nsimilar rulings.\nFurther, on January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) left the EU (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). The U.K. enacted legislation substantially\nimplementing the GDPR, with penalties for noncompliance of up to the greater of £17.5 million or four percent of worldwide revenues. The U.K. has issued its\nown SCCs to support the transfer of personal data outside of the U.K. However, aspects of U.K. data protection regulation remain unclear in the medium to\nlonger term. The European Commission and the U.K. government announced an EU-U.K. Trade Cooperation Agreement on December 24, 2020, and on June\n28, 2021, the European Commission issued an adequacy decision under the GDPR and the Law Enforcement Directive, pursuant to which personal data\ngenerally may be transferred from the EU to the U.K. without restriction, subject to a four-year “sunset” period, after which the European Commission’s\nadequacy decision may be renewed. During that period, the European Commission will continue to monitor the legal situation in the U.K. and may intervene at\nany time with respect to its adequacy decision. The UK’s adequacy determination, therefore, is subject to future uncertainty, and may be subject to modification\nor revocation in the future, with the U.K. potentially being considered a “third country” under the GDPR, with personal data transfers needing to be made\nsubject to GDPR-compliant safeguards (for example, the SCCs). With uncertainty remaining over the interpretation and application of data protection law in the\nU.K., we may face challenges in addressing their requirements and making necessary changes to our policies and practices, and may incur significant costs and\nexpenses in an effort to do so.\nOther countries are considering or have enacted legislation that could impact our compliance obligations, expose us to liability, and increase the cost and\ncomplexity of delivering our services. In Israel, failure to meet the requirements of the Israeli Privacy Protection Law 5741-1981 and its regulations (the “Israeli\nPrivacy Law”) can serve as basis for civil claims (including class actions), and, in certain cases, criminal liability, as well as exposing the Company to\nadministrative fines. Recent amendment to the Privacy Law will enter effect in August 2025 and will introduce additional obligations that will apply to parties\nthat process personal data and will significantly increase the sanctions that can be imposed in case of failure to comply with the requirements of the Israeli\nPrivacy Law. Such monetary sanctions can, in certain cases, reach significant amounts of millions NIS. We are also monitoring recent or pending legislation in\nIndia and Japan, among others, for further impacts on our compliance obligations, including requirements for local storage and processing of data that could\nincrease the cost and complexity of delivering our services. Such current or pending legislation may also result in changes to current enforcement measures and\nsanctions.\nWe also expect that there will continue to be changes in interpretations of existing laws and regulations, or new proposed laws and regulations concerning\nprivacy, data security, and data protection. We cannot yet determine the impact these laws and regulations or changed interpretations may have on our business,\nbut we anticipate that they could impair our or our customers’ ability to collect, use, or disclose information relating to consumers, which could decrease demand\nfor our platform, increase our costs, and impair our ability to maintain and grow our customer base and increase our revenue. Moreover, because the\ninterpretation and application of many laws and regulations relating to privacy, security, and data protection, along with mandatory industry standards, are\nuncertain, it is possible that these laws, regulations and standards, or contractual obligations to which we are or may become subject, may be interpreted and\napplied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing or future data management practices or features of our platform and products. Any failure or perceived\nfailure by us to comply with our posted privacy notices, our privacy-related obligations to users or other third parties, or any other actual or asserted legal\nobligations or regulatory requirements relating to privacy, data protection, or data security, may result in governmental investigations or enforcement actions,\nlitigation, claims, or public statements against us by privacy advocacy groups or others and could result in significant liability, cause our customers to lose trust\nin us, and otherwise materially and adversely affect our reputation and business. Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the\nlaws, regulations, other obligations, and policies that are applicable to the businesses of our users may limit the adoption and use of, and reduce the overall\ndemand for, our platform. Additionally, if third parties we work with violate applicable laws, regulations, or contractual obligations, such violations may put our\nusers’ data at risk, could result in governmental investigations or enforcement actions, fines, litigation, claims, or public statements against us by privacy\nadvocacy groups or others, and could result in significant liability, cause our customers to lose trust in us, and otherwise materially and adversely affect our\nreputation and business. Further, public scrutiny of, or complaints about, technology companies or their data handling or data protection practices, even if\nunrelated to our business, industry, or operations, may lead to increased scrutiny of technology companies, including us, and may cause government agencies to\nenact additional regulatory requirements, or to modify their enforcement or investigation activities, which may increase our costs and risks.\n58\nTable of Contents\nA breach of our security measures or unauthorized access to proprietary and confidential data, or a perception that any security breach or other incident\nhas occurred, may result in our platform or products being perceived as not secure, lower customer use or stoppage of use of our products, and significant\nliabilities.\nAlthough our products do not involve the processing of large amounts of personal data or personal information, our platform and products support\ncustomers’ software, which may involve the processing of large amounts of personal data, personal information, and information that is confidential or\notherwise sensitive or proprietary. Data security incidents affecting widely trusted data security architecture (such as the incident affecting SolarWinds Orion,\nthe incident involving Accellion FTA, the incident affecting Microsoft Exchange, the incident affecting Kaseya VSA, and the incident involving Log4j – none of\nwhich have directly affected us) may increase customer expectations regarding the security, testing, and compliance documentation of our platform and products\nfor secure software development operations, management, automation, and releases. In addition, these or other incidents may trigger new laws and regulations\nthat increase our compliance burdens, add reporting obligations, or otherwise increase costs for oversight and monitoring of our platform, products, and supply\nchain.\nWe do collect and store certain sensitive and proprietary information, and to a lesser degree, personal data and personal information, in the operation of our\nbusiness. This information includes trade secrets, intellectual property, employee data, and other confidential data. We have taken measures to protect our own\nsensitive and proprietary information, personal data, and personal information, as well as such information that we otherwise obtain, including from our\ncustomers. We also engage vendors and service providers to store and otherwise process some of our and our customers’ data, including sensitive and\nproprietary information, personal data, and personal information. Our vendors and service providers have been and, in the future may be, the targets of\ncyberattacks, malicious software, supply chain attacks, phishing schemes, fraud, and other risks to the confidentiality, security, and integrity of their systems and\nthe data they process for us. Our ability to monitor our vendors and service providers’ data security is limited, and, in any event, third parties may be able to\ncircumvent those security measures, resulting in the unauthorized or unlawful access to, misuse, disclosure, loss, acquisition, corruption, unavailability,\nalteration, modification, or destruction of our and our customers’ data, including sensitive and proprietary information, personal data, and personal information.\nSecurity breaches and other security incidents that affect us may result from employee or contractor error or negligence or those of vendors, service\nproviders, and strategic partners on which we rely. These attacks may come from individual hackers, criminal groups, and state-sponsored organizations. There\nhave been and may continue to be significant supply chain attacks, and we cannot guarantee that our or our vendors or service providers’ systems and networks\nhave not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable vulnerabilities, defects, or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our systems and\nnetworks or the systems and networks of third parties that support us and our services. In addition, our customers and users may also disclose or leak their\npasswords, API keys, or secrets that could lead to unauthorized access to their accounts and data, including information about their software, source code, and\nsecurity environment, stored within our products. As we continue to expand the products that we can offer our customers, including through the acquisition of\ncomplementary businesses, such as our acquisition of Vdoo in 2021 and our acquisition of Qwak in July 2024, and through internal development, such as\ndeveloping new security services, our products could have access to more sensitive information of our customers, which could result in greater adverse effects\nfrom security breaches and other security incidents. Also, our expansion into new services and products could subject us to additional regulations. In addition,\nwe are subject to other laws and regulations that obligate us to employ reasonable security measures. From time to time, we do identify product vulnerabilities,\nincluding through our bug bounty program. Certain vulnerabilities under certain circumstances could be exploited if our customers do not patch vulnerable\nversions of the product. In the future, we also may experience security breaches, including breaches resulting from a cybersecurity attack, phishing attack, or\nother means, including unauthorized access, unauthorized usage, malwares, or similar breaches or disruptions. We incur significant costs in an effort to detect\nand prevent security breaches and other security-related incidents, including those to secure our product development, test, evaluation, and deployment\nactivities, and we expect our costs will increase as we make improvements to our systems and processes to prevent future breaches and incidents.\nDespite our efforts, our systems and those of our vendors, service providers, and strategic partners also are potentially vulnerable to computer malware,\nviruses, computer hacking, fraudulent use, social engineering attacks, phishing attacks, ransomware attacks, credential stuffing attacks, denial-of-service attacks,\nunauthorized access, exploitation of bugs, defects, and vulnerabilities, breakdowns, damage, interruptions, system malfunctions, power outages, terrorism, acts\nof vandalism, failures, security breaches and incidents, inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, contractors, consultants, partners, and/or other third\nparties, and other real or perceived cyberattacks. Our risks of cyberattacks and other sources of security breaches and incidents, and those faced by our vendors,\nservice providers, and strategic partners, may be heightened in connection with the war between Israel, Hamas and Hezbollah, the war between Russia and\nUkraine, and associated geopolitical tensions and regional instability. Any of these incidents or any compromise of our security or any unauthorized access to or\nbreaches of the security of\n59\nTable of Contents\nour or our service providers’ systems or data processing tools or processes, or of our platform and product offerings, as a result of third-party action, employee\nerror, vulnerabilities, defects or bugs, malfeasance, or otherwise, could result in unauthorized or unlawful access to, misuse, disclosure, loss, acquisition,\ncorruption, unavailability, alteration, modification, or destruction of our and our customers’ data, including sensitive and proprietary information, personal data\nand personal information, or a risk to the security of our or our customers’ systems.\nWe may be more susceptible to security breaches and other security incidents in view of many of our employees and employees of our service providers\nworking remotely, because we and our service providers have less capability to implement, monitor, and enforce our information security and data protection\npolicies for those employees. Based on the examples set in other recent incidents, the more widespread our platform and products become, the more they may be\nviewed by malicious cyber threat actors as an attractive target for such an attack. We and our service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques,\nreact, remediate, or otherwise address any security breach or other security incident in a timely manner, or implement adequate preventative measures. In the\npast, we have experienced vulnerabilities, none of which led to account takeover and all such known vulnerabilities have been remedied.\nA security breach or other incident could result in reputational damage, litigation, regulatory investigations and orders, loss of business, indemnity\nobligations, damages for contract breach, penalties for violation of applicable laws, regulations, or contractual obligations, and significant costs, fees, and other\nmonetary payments for remediation, including in connection with forensic examinations and costly and burdensome breach notification requirements. Any belief\nby customers or others that a security breach or other incident has affected us or any of our vendors or service providers, even if a security breach or other\nincident has not affected us or any of our vendors or service providers or has not actually occurred, could have any or all of the foregoing impacts on us,\nincluding damage to our reputation. Even the perception of inadequate security may damage our reputation and negatively impact our ability to gain new\ncustomers and retain existing customers. In the event of any such breach or incident, we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to\naddress our or our vendor or service provider’s incident. Considering the SolarWinds Orion incident and the Kaseya VSA incident, if our products were\ncompromised in a way that offered a means of malicious access or delivery of ransomware or other malicious software to our customers, the impact of such an\nincident would likely be significant.\nTechniques used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to systems or networks are constantly evolving and, in some instances, are not identified until\nlaunched against a target. For example, AI technologies may be used in connection with certain cybersecurity attacks, resulting in heightened risks of security\nbreaches and incidents. We and our vendors and service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques, react, remediate, or otherwise address any\nsecurity breach or other security incident in a timely manner, or implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, laws, regulations, government guidance,\nand industry standards and practices in the U.S. and elsewhere are rapidly evolving to combat these threats. We may face increased compliance burdens\nregarding such requirements with regulators and customers regarding our products and services and also incur additional costs for oversight and monitoring of\nour own supply chain.\nFurther, any provisions in our customer and user agreements, contracts with our vendors and service providers, or other contracts relating to limitations of\nliability, may not be enforceable or adequate or otherwise protect us from any liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim relating to a security\nbreach or other security-related matter. While our insurance policies include liability coverage for certain of these matters, subject to applicable deductibles, if\nwe experienced a widespread security breach or other incident that impacted a significant number of our customers, we could be subject to indemnity claims or\nother damages that exceed our insurance coverage. If such a breach or incident occurred, our insurance coverage might not be adequate for data handling or data\nsecurity liabilities actually incurred, such insurance may not continue to be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms, or at all, and insurers\nmay deny us coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the\noccurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results, and reputation.\nRisks Related to Foreign Operations\nOur international operations and expansion expose us to risks.\nOur primary research and development operations are located in Israel. As of September 30, 2024, we had customers located in over 90 countries, and our\nstrategy is to continue to expand internationally. In addition, as a result of our strategy of leveraging a distributed workforce. As of September 30, 2024, we had\nemployees located primarily in nine countries. Our current international operations involve, and future initiatives will involve, a variety of risks, including:\n60\nTable of Contents\n• unexpected changes in practices, tariffs, export quotas, custom duties, trade disputes, tax laws and treaties, particularly due to economic tensions and trade\nnegotiations or other trade restrictions;\n• different labor regulations, especially in Israel, the EU and India, where labor laws are generally more advantageous to employees as compared to the\nU.S., including differing hourly wages and overtime regulations in these locations;\n• exposure to many stringent and potentially inconsistent laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, AI, and data security, particularly in the\nEU and India;\n• changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions, such as the war between Israel, Hamas and Hezbollah and the war between\nRussia and Ukraine and the associated geopolitical tensions and regional instability, as well as economic sanctions the U.S., the EU, and other countries\nhave imposed on Russia and certain of its allies and the impact of the foregoing on the global economy;\n• risks resulting from changes in currency exchange rates, in particular, fluctuations in the value of the NIS compared to the U.S. dollar;\n• challenges inherent to efficiently managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement\nappropriate systems, policies, benefits, and compliance programs;\n• risks relating to the implementation of exchange controls, including restrictions promulgated by the OFAC, and other similar trade protection regulations\nand measures in the U.S., the EU, or in other jurisdictions;\n• reduced ability to timely collect amounts owed to us by our customers in countries where our recourse may be more limited;\n• slower than anticipated availability and adoption of cloud and hybrid infrastructures by international businesses;\n• limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations derived from one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries;\n• limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection; and\n• exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, and\nsimilar applicable laws and regulations in other jurisdictions.\nIf we are unable to address these difficulties and challenges or other problems encountered in connection with our international operations and expansion, we\nmay incur unanticipated liabilities or otherwise suffer harm to our business generally.\nAs we conduct operations in China, risks associated with economic, political, and social events in China could negatively affect our business and results of\noperations.\nWe currently conduct limited operations in China. Our operations in China are subject to a number of risks relating to China’s economic and political\nsystems, including but not limited to:\n• A government-controlled foreign exchange rate and limitations on the convertibility of the Chinese Renminbi;\n• Uncertainty regarding the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection for intellectual property rights and the practical difficulties of enforcing such\nrights;\n• Ability to secure our business proprietary information located in China from unauthorized acquisition;\n• Extensive government regulation;\n• Changing governmental policies relating to tax benefits available to foreign-owned businesses;\n61\nTable of Contents\n• A relatively uncertain legal system;\n• Application of and limitations related to the DSL and PIPL regulations over processing of data and personal data within China as well as cross-border data\ntransfers and other activities outside of China; and\n• Instability related to continued economic, political, and social reform.\nAny actions and policies adopted by the government of the People’s Republic of China, particularly with regard to intellectual property rights, any slowdown\nin China’s economy, or increased restrictions related to the transfer of data pursuant to the Chinese Cyber Security Law, could have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations, and financial condition.\nFurther, at various times during recent years, the U.S. and China have had disagreements over political and economic issues. Controversies may arise in the\nfuture between these two countries. Any political or trade controversy between the U.S. and China could adversely affect the U.S. and European economies and\nmaterially and adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares, our business, financial position, and financial performance.\nIf we are not successful in sustaining and expanding our international business, we may incur additional losses and our revenue growth could be harmed.\nOur future results depend, in part, on our ability to sustain and expand our penetration of the international markets in which we currently operate and to\nexpand into additional international markets. Our ability to expand internationally will depend upon our ability to deliver functionality and foreign language\ntranslations that reflect the needs of the international clients that we target. Our ability to expand internationally involves various risks, including the need to\ninvest significant resources in such expansion, and the possibility that returns on such investments will not be achieved in the near future or at all in these less\nfamiliar competitive environments. We may also choose to conduct our international business through strategic partnerships or other collaboration arrangements.\nIf we are unable to identify partners or negotiate favorable terms, our international growth may be limited. In addition, we have incurred and may continue to\nincur significant expenses in advance of generating material revenue as we attempt to establish our presence in certain international markets.\nWe are subject to various governmental export controls, trade sanctions, and import laws and regulations that could impair our ability to compete in\ninternational markets or subject us to liability if we violate these controls.\nIn some cases, our software is subject to export control laws and regulations, including the Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce, and our activities may be subject to trade and economic sanctions, including those administered by the United States Department of\nthe Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) (collectively, “Trade Controls”). As such, a license may be required to export or re-export our\nproducts, or provide related services, to certain countries and end-users, and for certain end-uses. Further, our products incorporating encryption functionality\nmay be subject to special controls applying to encryption items and/or certain reporting requirements.\nWhile we take precautions and maintain procedures to prevent our products and solutions from being exported in violation of these laws, we cannot\nguarantee that the precautions we take will prevent violations of export control and sanctions laws. We are currently working to enhance these procedures, with\nwhich failure to comply could subject us to both civil and criminal penalties, including substantial fines, possible incarceration of responsible individuals for\nwillful violations, possible loss of our export or import privileges, and reputational harm. Further, the process for obtaining necessary licenses may be time-\nconsuming or unsuccessful, potentially causing delays in sales or losses of sales opportunities. Trade Controls are complex and dynamic regimes, and\nmonitoring and ensuring compliance can be challenging, particularly given that our products are widely distributed throughout the world and are available for\ndownload without registration. Although we have no knowledge that our activities have resulted in violations of Trade Controls, any failure by us or our partners\nto comply with applicable laws and regulations would have negative consequences for us, including reputational harm, government investigations, and penalties.\nIn addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permit and license requirements, and have\nenacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our end-customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries.\nChanges in our products or changes in export and import regulations in such countries may create delays in the introduction of our products into international\nmarkets, prevent our end-customers with international operations from deploying our products globally or, in some cases, prevent or delay the export or import\nof our products to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether. Any change in export or import laws or regulations, economic sanctions or related\nlegislation, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing export, import or sanctions laws or regulations, or\n62\nTable of Contents\nchange in the countries, governments, persons, or technologies targeted by such export, import, or sanctions laws or regulations, could result in decreased use of\nour products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential end-customers with international operations. Any decreased use\nof our products or limitation on our ability to export to or sell our products in international markets could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nFailure to comply with anti-bribery, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering laws, and similar laws, could subject us to penalties and other adverse\nconsequences.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”), the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. § 201,\nthe U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010, the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, Chapter 9 (sub-chapter 5) of the Israeli\nPenal Law, 1977, the Israeli Prohibition on Money Laundering Law–2000 and possibly other anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries outside\nof the U.S. in which we conduct our activities. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years and are interpreted broadly\nto generally prohibit companies, their employees, agents, representatives, business partners, and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering, or\nproviding, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or private sector.\nWe sometimes leverage third parties to sell our products and conduct our business abroad. We, our employees, agents, representatives, business partners, and\nthird-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and\nmay be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these employees, agents, representatives, business partners, or third-party intermediaries, even if\nwe do not explicitly authorize such activities. We cannot assure you that all of our employees and agents will not take actions in violation of applicable law, for\nwhich we may be ultimately held responsible. As we increase our international sales and business, our risks under these laws may increase.\nThese laws also require that we keep accurate books and records and maintain internal controls and compliance procedures designed to prevent any such\nactions. While we have policies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that none of our employees, agents, representatives,\nbusiness partners, or third-party intermediaries will take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible.\nAny allegations or violation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption laws, and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower\ncomplaints, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, enforcement actions, fines, damages, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe\ncriminal or civil sanctions, or suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, all of which may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business,\nresults of operations, and prospects. Responding to any investigation or action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management’s attention\nand resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees. In addition, the U.S. government may seek to hold us liable for successor liability for\nFCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. As a general matter, investigations, enforcement actions, and sanctions could\nharm our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur functional currency is the U.S. dollar and our revenue and expenses are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. However, a significant portion of our\nheadcount related expenses, consisting principally of salaries and related personnel expenses as well as leases and certain other operating expenses, are\ndenominated in NIS. This foreign currency exposure gives rise to market risk associated with exchange rate movements of the U.S. dollar against the NIS.\nFurthermore, we anticipate that a material portion of our expenses will continue to be denominated in NIS. We currently utilize foreign currency contracts with\nfinancial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks, mainly the exposure to changes in the exchange rate of the NIS against the U.S. dollar that are\nassociated with future cash flows denominated in NIS.\nIn addition, increased international sales in the future may result in greater foreign currency denominated sales, increasing our foreign currency risk. A\nmaterial portion of our leases are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, mainly in NIS. The associated lease liabilities are remeasured using the\ncurrent exchange rate, which may result in material foreign exchange gains or losses. Moreover, operating expenses incurred outside the U.S. and denominated\nin foreign currencies are increasing and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If we are not able to successfully hedge\nagainst the risks associated with currency fluctuations, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. To date,\n63\nTable of Contents\nwe have entered into hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. While we may decide to continue to enter into\nhedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedging transactions may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge\nour exposure, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Taxation\nUnanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could expose us to greater\nthan anticipated tax liabilities.\nThe tax laws applicable to our business, including the laws of Israel, the U.S., and other jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation and certain jurisdictions\nmay aggressively interpret their laws in an effort to raise additional tax revenue. The tax authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our\nmethodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements or our revenue recognition policies, which could increase our worldwide\neffective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations. It is possible that tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken\nand any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and results of operations. Further, the determination of\nour worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are transactions where the ultimate\ntax determination is uncertain. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our\nconsolidated financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nIn addition, we typically invoice customers for the full contract amount at the time of entering into a contract, but recognize revenue over the term of the\nsubscription period. Applicable tax authorities may challenge our tax reporting position and may accelerate our tax obligation based on cash received, which\nmay materially affect our financial results.\nOur corporate structure and intercompany arrangements are subject to the tax laws of various jurisdictions, and we could be obligated to pay additional\ntaxes, which would harm our results of operations.\nBased on our current corporate structure, we are subject to taxation in several jurisdictions around the world with increasingly complex tax laws, the\napplication of which can be uncertain. The amount of taxes we pay in these jurisdictions could increase substantially as a result of changes in the applicable tax\nprinciples, including increased tax rates, new tax laws, or revised interpretations of existing tax laws and precedents. The authorities in these jurisdictions could\nreview our tax returns or require us to file tax returns in jurisdictions in which we are not currently filing, and could impose additional tax, interest, and\npenalties. These authorities could also claim that various withholding requirements apply to us or our subsidiaries, assert that benefits of tax treaties are not\navailable to us or our subsidiaries, or challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, including our transfer\npricing. The relevant tax authorities may determine that the manner in which we operate our business does not achieve the intended tax consequences. If such a\ndisagreement were to occur, and our position was not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest, and penalties. Any increase in the amount\nof taxes we pay or that are imposed on us could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our business and results of operations.\nThe tax benefits that are available to us require us to continue to meet various conditions and may be terminated or reduced in the future, which could\nincrease our costs and taxes.\nWe are eligible for certain tax benefits provided to a “Preferred Technology Enterprise” under the Israeli Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments,\n1959, referred to as the Investment Law. In order to remain eligible for the tax benefits for a Preferred Technology Enterprise, we must continue to meet certain\nconditions stipulated in the Investment Law and its regulations, as amended. If these tax benefits are reduced, canceled, or discontinued, our Israeli taxable\nincome from the Preferred Technology Enterprise would be subject to regular Israeli corporate tax rates. Additionally, if we increase our activities outside of\nIsrael through acquisitions, for example, our expanded activities might not be eligible for inclusion in future Israeli tax benefit programs.\nWe could be required to collect additional sales, use, value added, digital services, or other similar taxes or be subject to other liabilities that may increase\nthe costs our clients would have to pay for our products which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe collect sales, value added, and other similar taxes in a number of jurisdictions. One or more U.S. states or countries may seek to impose incremental or\nnew sales, use, value added, digital services, or other tax collection obligations on us. Further, an\n64\nTable of Contents\nincreasing number of U.S. states have considered or adopted laws that attempt to impose tax collection obligations on out-of-state companies. Additionally, the\nU.S. Supreme Court ruled in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. et al, (“Wayfair”), that online sellers can be required to collect sales and use tax despite not having a\nphysical presence in the state of the customer. In response to Wayfair, or otherwise, many U.S. states or local governments have adopted, and may begin to\nenforce, laws requiring us to calculate, collect, and remit taxes on sales in their jurisdictions. A successful assertion by one or more U.S. states requiring us to\ncollect taxes where we presently do not do so, or to collect more taxes in a jurisdiction in which we currently do collect some taxes, could result in substantial\nliabilities, including taxes on past sales, as well as interest and penalties. Furthermore, certain jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom and France, introduced\na digital services tax, which is generally a tax on gross revenue generated from users or customers located in those jurisdictions, and other jurisdictions have\nenacted or are considering enacting similar laws. A successful assertion by a U.S. state or local government, or other country or jurisdiction that we should have\nbeen or should be collecting additional sales, use, value added, digital services, or other similar taxes could, among other things, result in substantial tax\npayments, create significant administrative burdens for us, discourage potential customers from subscribing to our platform due to the incremental cost of any\nsuch sales or other related taxes, or otherwise harm our business.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had net operating loss carryforwards of $138.8 million in Israel and U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards of $51.5\nmillion, which may be utilized against future taxable income. Limitations imposed by the applicable jurisdictions on our ability to utilize net operating loss\ncarryforwards, including with respect to the net operating loss carryforwards of companies that we have acquired or may acquire in the future, could cause\nincome taxes to be paid earlier than would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such net operating loss carryforwards to expire unused,\nin each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such net operating loss carryforwards. Furthermore, we may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income\nto utilize our net operating loss carryforwards before they expire. If any of these events occur, we may not derive some or all of the expected benefits from our\nnet operating loss carryforwards.\nRisks Related to Our Ordinary Shares\nThe market price for our ordinary shares may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance.\nThe market price of our ordinary shares may be highly volatile and may fluctuate or decline substantially as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are\nbeyond our control, including but not limited to:\n• actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations;\n• the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections, or our failure to meet these projections;\n• announcements by us or our competitors of new offerings or new or terminated significant contracts, commercial relationships, or capital commitments;\n• industry or financial analyst or investor reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;\n• rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n• sales or expected future sales of our ordinary shares;\n• investor perceptions of us and the industries in which we operate;\n• price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n• changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\n• failure of industry or financial analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any analysts who follow our company, or our failure\nto meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n65\nTable of Contents\n• actual or anticipated developments in our business or our competitors’ businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\n• litigation involving us, our industry, or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;\n• developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property rights or our solutions, or third-party proprietary rights;\n• announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors;\n• actual or perceived breaches of, or failures relating to, privacy, data protection, or data security;\n• new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n• any major changes in our management or our board of directors;\n• general economic conditions, the recent global economic downturn and slow or negative growth of our markets; and\n• other events or factors, including those resulting from war, including the war between Israel, Hamas and Hezbollah, incidents of terrorism or responses to\nthese events.\nThe concentration of our share ownership with insiders will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters, including the ability to influence the\noutcome of director elections and other matters requiring shareholder approval.\nOur executive officers, directors, current 5% or greater shareholders and affiliated entities together beneficially owned approximately 21% of our ordinary\nshares outstanding as of September 30, 2024. As a result, these shareholders, acting together, will have control over certain matters that require approval by our\nshareholders, including matters such as the appointment and dismissal of directors, capital increases, amendment to our articles of associations, and approval of\ncertain corporate transactions. Corporate action might be taken even if other shareholders oppose them. This concentration of ownership might also have the\neffect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us that other shareholders may view as beneficial. It should be noted that we are not aware of any voting\nagreement or arrangement between our shareholders.\nIf industry or financial analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue inaccurate or unfavorable research regarding our\nordinary shares, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our ordinary shares is influenced by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We\ndo not control these analysts, or the content and opinions included in their reports. As a new public company, we may be slow to attract research coverage and\nthe analysts who publish information about our ordinary shares will have had relatively little experience with our company, which could affect their ability to\naccurately forecast our results and make it more likely that we fail to meet their estimates. In the event we obtain industry or financial analyst coverage, if any of\nthe analysts who cover us issues an inaccurate or unfavorable opinion regarding our company, our share price would likely decline. In addition, the share prices\nof many companies in the technology industry have declined significantly after those companies have failed to meet, or significantly exceed, the financial\nguidance publicly announced by the companies or the expectations of analysts. If our financial results fail to meet, or significantly exceed, our announced\nguidance or the expectations of analysts or public investors, analysts could downgrade our ordinary shares or publish unfavorable research about us. If one or\nmore of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, our visibility in the financial markets could decrease, which in\nturn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nSales of substantial amounts of our ordinary shares in the public markets, or the perception that they might occur, could reduce the price that our ordinary\nshares might otherwise attain.\nSales of a substantial number of ordinary shares in the public market, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers, and significant shareholders, or\nthe perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares and may make it more difficult for you to sell your\nordinary shares at a time and price that you deem appropriate. We have also registered the offer and sale of all ordinary shares that we may issue under our\nequity compensation plan and employee stock purchase plan.\n66\nTable of Contents\nThe issuance of additional shares in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our share incentive plans, or otherwise will dilute all other\nshareholders.\nOur amended and restated articles of association authorize us to issue up to 500 million ordinary shares and up to 50 million preference shares with such\nrights and preferences as included in our articles of association. Subject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations, we may issue ordinary shares or\nsecurities convertible into ordinary shares from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investment, our share incentive plans, or otherwise. Any\nsuch issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing shareholders unless pre-emptive rights exist and cause the market price of our ordinary shares to\ndecline.\nProvisions of Israeli law and our amended and restated articles of association may delay, prevent, or make undesirable an acquisition of all or a significant\nportion of our shares or assets.\nCertain provisions of Israeli law and our articles of association could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and may make it more\ndifficult for a third party to acquire us or for our shareholders to elect different individuals to our board of directors, even if doing so would be beneficial to our\nshareholders, and may limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for our ordinary shares. For example, Israeli corporate law regulates\nmergers and requires that a tender offer be effected when certain thresholds of percentage ownership of voting power in a company are exceeded (subject to\ncertain conditions). Further, Israeli tax considerations may make potential transactions undesirable to us or to some of our shareholders whose country of\nresidence does not have a tax treaty with Israel granting tax relief to such shareholders from Israeli tax.\nFurthermore, under the Encouragement of Research, Development and Technological Innovation in the Industry Law, 5744-1984, and the regulations,\nguidelines, rules, procedures, and benefit tracks thereunder, collectively, the Innovation Law, to which we are subject due to our receipt of grants from the Israeli\nNational Authority for Technological Innovation, or the Israeli Innovation Authority (the “IIA”), a recipient of IIA grants such as our company must report to the\nIIA regarding any change in the holding of means of control of our company which transforms any non-Israeli citizen or resident into an “interested party,” as\ndefined in the Israeli Securities Law, and such non-Israeli citizen or resident shall execute an undertaking in favor of IIA, in a form prescribed by IIA.\nOur amended and restated Articles of Association provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for\nresolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, which could limit our shareholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum\nfor disputes with us or our directors, shareholders, officers, or other employees.\nSection 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for U.S. federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both U.S.\nstate and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or\ncontrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our amended and restated Articles of Association provide that, unless we consent in writing to\nthe selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint\nasserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. This exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created\nby the Exchange Act. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and\nconsented to the foregoing provision of our amended and restated Articles of Association.\nAlthough we believe this exclusive forum provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of U.S. federal securities laws in the\ntypes of lawsuits to which they apply, the exclusive forum provision may limit a shareholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for\ndisputes with us or any of our directors, shareholders, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims against us and\nour current and former directors, shareholders, officers, or other employees. Our shareholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the U.S.\nfederal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder as a result of our exclusive forum provision. Further, in the event a court finds the exclusive\nforum provision contained in our amended and restated Articles of Association to be unenforceable or inapplicable in an action, we may incur additional costs\nassociated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our results of operations.\n67\nTable of Contents\nWe have not in the past and do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will\ndepend on appreciation in the price of our ordinary shares.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our shares. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the\noperation of our business and do not anticipate paying any dividends on our ordinary shares in the foreseeable future. Consequently, investors who purchase our\nordinary shares may be unable to realize a gain on their investment except by selling such shares after price appreciation, which may never occur.\nOur board of directors has sole discretion whether to pay dividends. If our board of directors decides to pay dividends, the form, frequency, and amount will\ndepend upon our future operations and earnings, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions, and other factors that our\ndirectors may deem relevant. The Israeli Companies Law, 5759-1999 (the “Companies Law”) imposes restrictions on our ability to declare and pay dividends.\nPayment of dividends may also be subject to Israeli withholding taxes.\nRisks Related to Our Incorporation and Location in Israel\nWhile JFrog’s operation runs smoothly with most of our go-to-market and support services outside of Israel (mainly in the U.S., India, and France), given\nthe conditions in Israel, including the recent attack by Hamas, other terrorist organizations, and Iran and Israel’s war against them, it is possible that our\noperations could be adversely affected over time, which could lead to a decrease in revenues.\nBecause a material part of our research and development is conducted in Israel and certain members of our board of directors and management (as well as\napproximately half of our employees and consultants) are located in Israel, our business and operations could be affected by economic, political, geopolitical,\nand military conditions in Israel. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have occurred between Israel and its\nneighboring countries and terrorist organizations active in the region.\nIn October 2023, Hamas militants and members of other terrorist organizations infiltrated Israel’s southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a series\nof terror attacks on civilian and military targets. Since the commencement of these events, there have been additional active hostilities, including with Hezbollah\nin Lebanon, the Houthi movement which controls parts of Yemen, and most recently with Iran. It is possible that these hostilities will escalate in the future into a\ngreater regional conflict, and that additional terrorist organizations and countries will actively join the hostilities. The intensity and duration of Israel’s current\nwar against Hamas, Hezbollah, and other terror organizations is difficult to predict, as are such war’s economic implications on the Company’s business and\noperations and on Israel's economy in general. These events may imply wider macroeconomic indications of a deterioration of Israel’s economic standing\n(including as the result of a downgrade in Israel’s credit rating by certain credit rating agencies), which may have a material adverse effect on the Company and\nits ability to effectively conduct its operations.\nCertain of our employees and consultants in Israel have been called, and additional employees may be called, for service in the current or future wars or other\narmed conflicts. Such employees may be absent for an extended period of time. As a result, our operations may be disrupted by such absences, which disruption\nmay materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nCertain countries, companies and organizations participate in a boycott of Israeli companies. In addition, there have been increased efforts recently to cause\ncompanies and consumers to boycott Israeli goods and services. Any boycott, restrictive laws, policies, or practices directed towards Israel, Israeli businesses, or\nIsraeli citizens could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, in January 2024 the International Court of\nJustice, or ICJ, issued an interim ruling in a case filed by South Africa against Israel in December 2023, making allegations of genocide amid and in connection\nwith the war in Gaza, and ordered Israel, among other things, to take measures to prevent genocidal acts, prevent and punish incitement to genocide, and take\nsteps to provide basic services and humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza. There are concerns that companies and businesses will terminate, and may have already\nterminated, certain commercial relationships with Israeli companies following the ICJ decision.\n68\nTable of Contents\nIt may be difficult to enforce a U.S. judgment against us, our officers and directors in Israel or the U.S., or to assert U.S. securities laws claims in Israel or\nserve process on our Israeli officers and directors.\nNot all of our directors or officers are residents of the U.S. Most of our assets and those of our non-U.S. directors and officers are located outside the U.S.\nService of process upon us or our non-U.S. resident directors and officers may be difficult to obtain within the U.S. We have been informed by our legal counsel\nin Israel that it may be difficult to assert claims under U.S. securities laws in original actions instituted in Israel or obtain a judgment based on the civil liability\nprovisions of U.S. federal securities laws. Israeli courts may refuse to hear a claim based on an alleged violation of U.S. securities laws against us or our non-\nU.S. officers or directors, reasoning that Israel is not the most appropriate forum to hear such a claim. In addition, even if an Israeli court agrees to hear a claim,\nit may determine that Israeli law and not U.S. law is applicable to the claim. If U.S. law is found to be applicable, the content of applicable U.S. law must be\nproved as a fact by expert witnesses, which can be a time-consuming and costly process. Certain matters of procedure may also be governed by Israeli law.\nThere is little binding case law in Israel addressing the matters described above. Israeli courts might not enforce judgments rendered outside Israel, which may\nmake it difficult to collect on judgments rendered against us or our non-U.S. officers and directors.\nMoreover, among other reasons, including but not limited to, fraud or absence of due process, or the existence of a judgment which is at variance with\nanother judgment that was given in the same matter if a suit in the same matter between the same parties was pending before a court or tribunal in Israel, an\nIsraeli court will not enforce a foreign judgment if it was given in a state whose laws do not provide for the enforcement of judgments of Israeli courts (subject\nto exceptional cases), or if its enforcement is likely to prejudice the sovereignty or security of the State of Israel.\nYour rights and responsibilities as our shareholder are governed by Israeli law, which may differ in some respects from the rights and responsibilities of\nshareholders of U.S. corporations.\nWe are incorporated under Israeli law. The rights and responsibilities of holders of our ordinary shares are governed by our amended and restated articles of\nassociation and the Companies Law. These rights and responsibilities differ in some respects from the rights and responsibilities of shareholders in typical U.S.\ncorporations. In particular, pursuant to the Companies Law, each shareholder of an Israeli company has to act in good faith and in a customary manner in\nexercising his or her rights and fulfilling his or her obligations toward the company and other shareholders and to refrain from abusing his or her power in the\ncompany, including, among other things, in voting at the general meeting of shareholders, on amendments to a company’s articles of association, increases in a\ncompany’s authorized share capital, mergers, and certain transactions requiring shareholders’ approval under the Companies Law. In addition, a controlling\nshareholder of an Israeli company or a shareholder who knows that it possesses the power to determine the outcome of a shareholder vote or who has the power\nto appoint or prevent the appointment of a director or officer in the company, or has other powers toward the company, has a duty of fairness toward the\ncompany. However, Israeli law does not define the substance of this duty of fairness. There is little case law available to assist in understanding the implications\nof these provisions that govern shareholder behavior.\nWe have received Israeli government grants for certain of our research and development activities. The terms of these grants may require us to satisfy\nspecified conditions in order to develop and transfer technologies supported by such grants outside of Israel. In addition, in some circumstances, we may be\nrequired to pay penalties in addition to repaying the grants.\nOur research and development efforts were financed, in part, through grants from the IIA. From our inception through 2015, we conducted projects with the\nIIA’s support and received grants totaling $1.2 million from the IIA and repaid to the IIA $1.3 million (the entire amount of the grants and accrued interest).\nThe Innovation Law requires, inter alia, that the products developed as part of the programs under which the grants were given be manufactured in Israel and\nrestricts the ability to transfer know-how funded by IIA outside of Israel. Transfer of IIA-funded know-how outside of Israel requires prior approval and is\nsubject to payment of a redemption fee to the IIA calculated according to a formula provided under the Innovation Law. A transfer for the purpose of the\nInnovation Law is generally interpreted very broadly and includes, inter alia, any actual sale of the IIA-funded know-how, any license to develop the IIA-funded\nknow-how or the products resulting from such IIA-funded know-how, or any other transaction, which, in essence, constitutes a transfer of IIA-funded know-\nhow. We cannot be certain that any approval of the IIA will be obtained on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. We may not receive the required approvals\nshould we wish to transfer IIA-funded know-how and/or development outside of Israel in the future.\nTransfer of IIA know-how created, in whole or in part, in connection with an IIA-funded project, to a third party outside Israel requires prior approval and is\nsubject to payment to the IIA of a redemption fee calculated according to a formula provided under\n69\nTable of Contents\nthe Innovation Law. Subject to prior approval of the IIA, we may transfer the IIA-funded know-how to another Israeli company. If the IIA-funded know-how is\ntransferred to another Israeli entity, the transfer would still require IIA approval but will not be subject to the payment of the redemption fee. In such case, the\nacquiring company would have to assume all of the applicable restrictions and obligations towards the IIA (including the restrictions on the transfer of know-\nhow and manufacturing capacity, to the extent applicable, outside of Israel) as a condition to IIA approval.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and divert management’s attention.\nAs a public company listed in the U.S., we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall\nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, Nasdaq listing requirements, and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these\nrules and regulations increases our legal and financial compliance costs, makes some activities more difficult, time-consuming, or costly, and increases demand\non our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and\nresults of operations.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including regulations implemented by the SEC\nand Nasdaq, may increase legal and financial compliance costs, and make some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations, and standards are\nsubject to varying interpretations, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing\nbodies.\nAs a result of disclosure of information in our filings with the SEC, our business and financial condition are visible, which may result in threatened or actual\nlitigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected, and\neven if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the\nresources of our management and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate\nfinancial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and regulations of the\napplicable Nasdaq listing standards. We are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other\nthings, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by\nour management in our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nIn order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended\nand anticipate that we will continue to expend significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight. For example,\nsince our IPO, we have implemented additional policies and procedures associated with the financial statement close process and implemented a system to\nsupplement our core accounting system as part of our control environment. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to\nincrease our legal, accounting, financial compliance and audit costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and increase demand on\nour personnel, systems, and resources.\nIn addition, our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in the conditions in our business,\nincluding increased complexity resulting from our international expansion. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial\nreporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report\nour financial condition or results of operations. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent\nregistered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in\nthe accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our ordinary share could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or\ninvestigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to\nimplement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\n70\nTable of Contents\nThe impact of the war between Israel, Hamas and Hezbollah, and regional conflict in the Middle East, the war between Russia and Ukraine, and other\nareas of geopolitical tension around the world, including the related global economic disruptions, remains uncertain at this time, and could harm or\ncontinue to harm our business and results of operations.\nThe war between Israel, Hamas and Hezbollah, and regional conflict in the Middle East, the war between Russia and Ukraine, and other areas of geopolitical\ntension around the world continue to impact worldwide economic activity and financial markets. As a result of the war between Israel, Hamas and Hezbollah,\nthe regional conflict in the Middle East, the war between Russia and Ukraine, and related global economic disruptions, we could experience disruptions in our\nbusiness or the business of our partners, customers, or the economy as a whole, any of which could adversely affect and could materially adversely impact our\nbusiness, results of operations, and overall financial condition in future periods.\nThe extent and continued impact of the war between Israel, Hamas and Hezbollah, the regional conflict in the Middle East, the Russia-Ukraine war, and\nrelated global economic disruptions on our operational and financial condition will depend on certain developments, including: government responses to the\nwars; the impact of the wars on our customers and our sales cycles; their impacts on customer, industry, or technology-based community events; and their effect\non our partners, some of which are uncertain, difficult to predict, and not within our control. General economic conditions and disruptions in global markets due\nto the war between Israel, Hamas and Hezbollah, the regional conflict in the Middle East, the Russia-Ukraine war, and other areas of geopolitical tension around\nthe world, and any actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response may also affect our future performance.\nAs of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the full impact of the war between Israel, Hamas and Hezbollah, the regional conflict in the Middle\nEast, the war between Russia and Ukraine, and related global economic disruptions on our financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain.\nFurthermore, because of our subscription-based business model, the impact of these factors may not be fully reflected in our results of operations and overall\nfinancial condition until future periods, if at all.\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our results of\noperations could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the trading price of our ordinary shares.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported\nin the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we\nbelieve to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, equity,\nrevenue, and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if\nactual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below our publicly announced guidance or the\nexpectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our ordinary shares. Significant items subject to such estimates and\nassumptions include, but are not limited to, the allocation of transaction price among various performance obligations, the estimated benefit period of deferred\ncontract acquisition costs, the allowance for credit losses, the fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill, the useful lives of acquired intangible assets\nand property and equipment, the incremental borrowing rate for operating leases, and the valuation of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions.\nWe are exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio.\nGiven the global nature of our business, we have diversified U.S. and non-U.S. investments. Credit ratings and pricing of our investments can be negatively\naffected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, sovereign risk, or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of our\ninvestments may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although we have not realized any significant losses on our investments, future fluctuations in their value\ncould result in a significant realized loss.\nCatastrophic events, or man-made problems such as terrorism, may disrupt our business.\nA significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, flood, or significant power outage could have an adverse impact on our business, results of\noperations, and financial condition. We have a number of our employees and executive officers located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for\nseismic activity and increasingly, wildfires. In the event our or our partners’ abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above, sales could be delayed,\nresulting in missed financial targets for a particular quarter. In addition, acts of terrorism, pandemics, such as the outbreak of the novel coronavirus or another\npublic health\n71\nTable of Contents\ncrisis, protests, riots, and other geo-political unrest could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our partners, customers, or the economy as a\nwhole. Any disruption in the business of our partners or customers that affects sales in a given fiscal quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our\nquarterly results for that and future quarters. All of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if our disaster recovery plans prove to be inadequate.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by changes in the U.S. political environment.\nPolicy changes implemented by the Biden administration could significantly impact our business as well as the markets in which we compete. Specific\nlegislative and regulatory proposals discussed during election campaigns and more recently that might materially impact us include, but are not limited to,\nchanges to trade agreements, immigration policy, import and export regulations, tariffs and customs duties, federal and state tax laws and regulations, public\ncompany reporting requirements, and antitrust enforcement. Further, an extended federal government shutdown resulting from failing to pass budget\nappropriations, adopt continuing funding resolutions, or raise the debt ceiling, and other budgetary decisions limiting or delaying deferral government spending,\nmay negatively impact U.S. or global economic conditions, including corporate and consumer spending, and liquidity of capital markets. To the extent changes\nin the political environment have a negative impact on us or on our markets, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and\nadversely affected in the future.\nITEM 2.

Ladies and gentlemen. thank you for joining us and welcome to JFrog's\nthird quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. I'll now hand the conference over to\nJeffrey Schreiner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Jeffrey, please go ahead.\nJeffrey Schreiner^ Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us as we review JFrog's third\nquarter 2024 financial results, which were announced following market close today via press\nrelease. Leading the call today will be JFrog's CEO and Co-Founder Shlomi Ben Haim and Ed\nGrabscheid, JFrog's CFO.\nDuring this call we may make statements related to our business that are forward-looking under\nFederal Securities laws and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 including statements related to our future financial\nperformance and including our outlook for Q4 and the full year of 2024.\nThe words anticipate, believe, continue, estimate, expect, intend, will, and similar expressions\nare intended to identify forward-looking statements or similar indications of future expectations.\nYou are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which\nreflect our views only as of today and not as of any subsequent date.\nPlease keep in mind that we are not obligating ourselves to revise or publicly release the results\nof any revision to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.\nThese statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual\nresults to differ materially from expectations.\nFor discussion of material risks and other important factors that could affect our actual results,\nplease refer to our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which is available on the\nInvestor Relations section of our website and the earnings press release issued earlier today.\nAdditional information will be made available in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September\n30, 2024, and other filings and reports that we may file from time to time with the SEC.\nAdditionally, non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this conference call. These\nnon-GAAP financial measures, which are used as measures of JFrog's performance, should be\nconsidered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, GAAP measures.\nPlease refer to the tables in our earnings release for a reconciliation of those measures to their\nmost directly comparable GAAP financial measures. A replay of this call will be available on the\nJFrog Ltd.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nJFrog Investor Relations website for a limited time. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to\nJFrog's CEO, Shlomi Ben Haim. Shlomi?\nShlomi Ben Haim^ Thank you, Jeff. Good afternoon, to you all.\nThank you for joining our call. This was a very active quarter for JFrog including at our annual\nuser conference SwampUp, where industry leaders like JP Morgan Chase, Intel, Google,\nSnowflake, Capital One, and others shared their powerful experience with the JFrog platform on\nstage.\nOur partners including GitHub, NVIDIA, and Docker, joined us in announcing new levels of\ncollaboration, underscoring our commitment to a unified platform experience.\nSwampUp was also an opportunity to spotlight and reveal the innovations driving JFrog's future\ngrowth including the release of JFrog ML, which extends our software supply chain platform as\nthe first to integrate DevOps, DevSecOps, and MLOps in one seamless solution.\nAdditionally, we expanded our security offerings with JFrog Runtime Security, with customers\nrecognizing it as critical solution for organizations seeking full visibility from development to\nproduction and back. At JFrog, we say once you leap forward, you won't go back.\nOur customers share this belief, as is well shown in our growth retention, and the opportunities\nahead align with our strategy, keeping us excited, focused, driven, and inspired. I'm pleased\nwith our success in the third quarter.\nWe believe we demonstrated not only strong execution within JFrog, but more broadly,\ncustomers are telling us that they see JFrog as a key strategic partner in the software\ndevelopment processes.\nNow allow me to cover some of our achievements during the quarter in more detail. JFrogs Q3\nwas strong on all fronts.\nOur disciplined go-to-market execution led to some of the largest platform wins in JFrogs\nhistory, fueled by DevOps workload migration to the cloud, coupled with comprehensive\nsoftware supply chain security. JFrogs unified solution empowers enterprises to seamlessly\nalign DevOps, security, and MLOps on a single source of tools, an approach that differentiates\nus and continues to strongly resonate with market demands.\nIn Q3, JFrogs total revenue was $109.1 million, up 23% year-over-year. Cloud revenue for the\nquarter reached $42.4 million, representing 38% year-over-year growth, fueled by strategic\ncloud migration and steady usage patterns among committed annual customers. Based on\nthese Q3 results, we remain confident in our full year 2024 guidance for cloud growth of around\nJFrog Ltd.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n40%. Customers in Q3 with ARR over $100,000 grew to a total of $966, up from $848 in the\nyear-ago period.\nThe number of customers with an ARR exceeding $1 million increased to 46, up from 30 in the\nyear-ago period, representing 53% year-over-year growth.\nIn Q3, our go-to-market team demonstrated strong execution, winning large deals for our\ncomplete platform, primarily driven by demand for our cloud and security offerings.\nAs previously shared, some of the significant deals we won faced delays due to a slower, more\nrigid consumer environment. Let me first address the cloud.\nOur cloud business experienced sequential growth driven by increased migration activity,\nthough overall usage trends remained more moderate compared to the previous year.\nCustomers tell us that the scalable and hybrid nature of the JFrog platform gives them the\nconfidence they need to modernize their software development business, and we were pleased\nwith an increased migration pace and usage in Q3.\nWe maintain a cautious outlook regarding large migration deals in our 2024 pipeline, as we do\nnot believe customers' migration activity has yet turned the corner.\nNext, to highlight security. The market continues to demand higher standards for software\nintegrity, with a focus on achieving trusted, secure, and traceable processes from software\ncreation on the left to distribution and production on the right.\nDevOps and DevSecOps are therefore inseparable, and the JFrog platform is purpose-\nengineered to meet this requirement. In line with this industry shift, enterprises are prioritizing\nmodernization of their holistic software supply chain security.\nThey seek to streamline developer workflows by consolidating point solution tools and reducing\nvendor dependencies, thereby enhancing security and efficiency across the software supply\nchain. This trend has been voiced by our customers and prospects over the recent quarters and\nwas evident in our Q3 wins, which, as predicted, included JFrog Advanced security and JFrog\ncuration as key drivers.\nIt's not a question anymore about if a company will adopt a holistic platform that incorporates\nend-to-end software supply chain security, but the question of when.\nAs mentioned, in Q3 we held our 10th Annual User Conference SwampUp in Austin, Texas.\nJFrog Ltd.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nAs the industry continues to demand more from development teams, we gathered with our\ncustomers and the community to drive the future of DevOps, DevSecOps, and MLOps.\nWe were excited to announce the availability of JFrog Runtime security, delivering as part of our\nplatform the very first DevSecOps solution that allows companies to have full integrity and\nsoftware lineage traceability from cost to production and back across every development and\npipeline phase.\nIn addition, we showcase the second phase of our strategic partnership with GitHub,\nannouncing co-engineered solutions that unify both companies' advanced security capabilities\nand, importantly, bring AI capabilities via the co-pilot integration with JFrog Curation and JFrog\nCatalog. GitHubs CEO Thomas Dohmke, joined me on a keynote session, shared, Òtogether\nwith JFrog we have let this lightning out of the bottle, and, of course we're bringing the power of\nJFrog to GitHub co-pilot.\nNow you can ask co-pilot about your packages in artifactory and about your internal processes\nand configurations specific to your company.\nThis is just the beginning.Ó\nWe also announced a strategic collaboration with NVIDIA to bring secured, optimized machine\nlearning models into the software supply chain and serve our joint customers with artifactory as\nNVIDIA's new model trusted registry. This announcement was also shared in our shareholder\nand analyst briefing we conducted onsite in Austin and are available on our IR website or at\nswampup.jfrog.com.\nBefore we dive into financials, in Q3, we demonstrated strong execution across our product\nstrategy and deliveries, ecosystem partnerships, platform expansion, sales wings, free cash\nflow, and overall business efficiency. This success is in line with our strategy, and we are\nexcited about the opportunities ahead.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Ed Grabscheid, who will provide an in-depth recap of\nour Q3 financial results and our outlook for Q4 and full fiscal year of 2024. Ed.\nEd Grabscheid^ Thank you, Shlomi. And good afternoon, everyone. During the third quarter of\n2024, total revenues were $109.1 million, up 23% year-over-year.\nAs noted by Shlomi, cloud revenues in the quarter equaled $42.4 million, up 38% year-over-\nyear, representing 39% of total revenues versus 35% in the prior year.\nSelf-managed revenues, or on-prem, were $66.7 million, up 15% year-over-year during the third\nquarter.\nJFrog Ltd.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nWe anticipate self-managed revenue growth trends to remain stable in the fourth quarter but\nnote some customers who are planning to migrate to the cloud have paused their investment in\non-prem deployments.\nNet dollar retention for the four trailing quarters was 117%, in line with our guidance.\nOur gross retention rate remained at 97%. A key motion driving our growth has been customer\nexpansion through the adoption of Enterprise Plus, our full platform subscription.\nAs we expand our platform capabilities with security and MLOps, we believe further penetration\ninto our existing customer base presents an opportunity for continued growth.\nIn Q3, 50% of total revenue came from Enterprise Plus subscriptions, up from 46% in the prior\nyear. Revenue contribution from Enterprise Plus subscriptions grew 35% year-over-year.\nNow I'll review the income statement in more detail. Gross profit in the quarter was $90.3\nmillion, representing a gross margin of 82.8%, compared to 83.7% in the year-ago period. The\ndecrease in gross margin relative to the year-ago period is primarily due to the higher mix of\ncloud revenues, which carries a lower gross margin profile than corporate average.\nWe maintain expectations for annual gross margin targets, remaining between 83% and 84% in\nfiscal year 2024.\nOperating expenses for the third quarter were $75.5 million, up $2.2 million sequentially,\nequaling 69.3% of revenues, up from $62.3 million, or 70.3% of revenues in the year-ago\nperiod. Current quarter expenses include contributions from the acquisition of Qwak, which\nclosed in early July.\nWe remain focused on expense discipline while continuing to maintain the proper level of\ninvestment to capture future growth opportunities.\nOur operating profit in Q3 was $14.7 million, or 13.5% operating margin, compared to an\noperating profit of $11.9 million, or 13.4% operating margin in the year-ago period. Diluted\nearnings per share equaled $0.15, based on approximately 115.3 million weighted average\ndiluted shares, compared to $0.15 per share in the prior year on 110.2 million weighted average\ndiluted shares.\nTurning now to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the third quarter of 2024 with $467.8\nmillion in cash and short-term investment, down from $591.3 million as of June 30, 2024.\nJFrog Ltd.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nI would like to note that we utilized $163.7 million in cash for the initial consideration paid for the\nacquisition of Qwak in early July. Cash flow from operations was $27.6 million in the quarter.\nAfter taking into consideration our CapEx requirements, free cash flow was $26.7 million, or\n24.5% free cash flow margin.\nAs of September 30, 2024, our remaining performance obligations totaled $346.1 million. Now\nI'd like to speak about our outlook and guidance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2024. For\nthe fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $113.5 million to $114.5 million.\nWe forecast non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $14 million to $15 million,\nand non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.13 to $0.15, based on 117 million\nestimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding.\nFor the full fiscal year 2024, we expect revenues to be in the range of $425.9 million to $426.9\nmillion, non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $56.4 million to $57.4 million,\nand non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.59 to $0.61, based on 116 million\nestimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding.\nNow let me provide more context around our guidance.\nWe anticipate our cloud revenue to achieve around 40% year-over-year growth in 2024, with\nyear-to-date cloud growth currently at 42%.\nfourth quarter cloud growth will be supported by a full quarter of contribution from large-scale\nwins in the third quarter, annual customer commitment, as well as contribution from smaller-\nscale migrations to the cloud.\nWe believe our cloud growth forecast for 2024 still represents strong execution in what remains\nto be a challenging spend and procurement environment.\nWe continue to be cautious in our forward outlook, de-risking large-scale pipeline opportunities\nfrom our current guidance.\nWe have not observed a material shift in sentiment in regards to the overall spending\nenvironment and still observe customers being sensitive to the timing of large-scale budgetary\ncommitments.\nDuring the third quarter, we saw security become a critical driver of larger customer deals and\nview the JFrog platform combined with security as the industry standard for enterprise\ncustomers looking to manage and secure their software supply chain and consolidate point\nsolutions.\nJFrog Ltd.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nWe continue to anticipate that JFrog advanced security and JFrog Curation will achieve material\nrevenue contribution in 2025. Given our fourth quarter guidance, we reiterate our net dollar\nretention range for the full year 2024 in the mid-team.\nFinally, the acquisition of Qwak closed in the beginning of July. Revenue contribution in the third\nquarter associated with this transaction was less than 0.5%.\nAs we integrate Qwak into JFrog over the coming period, we will provide further updates\nregarding our outlook for growth and profitability. Now I'll turn the call back to Shlomi for closing\nremarks before we take your questions.\nShlomi Ben Haim^ Thank you, Ed.\nOur Q3 achievements and successes belong to our global team. Driven by the thirst for\ninnovation and followed by our customers' happiness, our team delivered a robust quarter with\ngrowth and cloud and security leading the way.\nFrogs, I'm incredibly proud of each of you and constantly inspired by your resilience and spirit.\nWe remain focused and committed to achieving a solid 2024 in line with our guidance.\nWhile macroeconomic challenges persist, we believe the foundation laid are bearing fruit.\nBefore we take your questions, let us all remember that it has now been over a year since the\nterrorist attacks on Israel began. And as we speak, 101 of our brothers and sisters remain held\ncaptive by Hamas in Gaza.\nWe pray for peace in the region and for the fast and safe return of those hostages to their\nfamilies. Thank you for attending our call today and may the Frog be with you.\nOperator, we are now open to take questions.\nOperator^ (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Sanjit Singh with\nMorgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSanjit Singh^ Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on the solid Q3 results. I wanted\nto get a sense of how you saw Q3 come in.\nIf I rewind back to 90 days ago, you guys did see some deals push out.\nSo would you characterize Q3 as a function of some of those deals closing and generating\nrevenues quarter or was it more kind of a more broad-based strength beyond just closing deals?\nJFrog Ltd.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nThen I had a follow-up.\nEd Grabscheid^ Hi, Sanjit, this is Ed. Thank you for the question.\nSo we're really pleased with the results.\nWe thought it was a strong quarter of execution. The overall performance that we saw during\nQ3 was largely due to these significant projects that we talked about that we de-risked from our\nforecast.\nWe saw several of those deals close in Q3, one of those being a deal that was pushed from Q2.\nSo therefore, the over-performance of what we saw was largely due to the fact that we saw\nmany of those large deals being closed.\nSanjit Singh^ That's great context and great to hear that these strategic deals are coming over\nthe line. My follow-up question was around security and showing me your comments around\n2025 being the year.\nIt's hard to go from, we have to sort of build that pipeline.\nSo in terms of what you're seeing right now to give you that confidence that 2025 will be the\nyear for more material contribution from security, what are some of the proof points that you're\nseeing right now that gives you that confidence on the advanced security side?\nThank you very much.\nShlomi Ben Haim^ Yes, Sanjit, this is Shlomi.\nSecurity is being part of all big deals that we secured in Q3. And as we reported, those are our\nstrategic customers.\nSo the sell cycle took longer than expected.\nBut then when we won this deal, that was a sizable deal that was triggered by cloud and\nsecurity very much aligned with our strategy. When we are looking at the pipeline, though being\nvery cautious about it and de-risking it, we see more opportunities that combine cloud growth\nand security and as we mentioned, it is now coupled together on all the big platform deals.\nSo that gives us the confidence that we are getting into 2025 with the same momentum we\ncreated.\nJFrog Ltd.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nSanjit Singh^ Thank you for the context, Shlomi.\nOperator^ Thank you.\nOur next question comes from the line of Pinjalim Bora from JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nPinjalim Bora^ Oh, great. Thank you for the questions and congrats from me as well.\nShlomi, just wanted to ask you, staying on the security thread a little bit more, I believe you have\na lot of deals that came for renewal, coming for renewal Q3, Q4 that had a big security\ncomponent signed about a year ago. There was some introductory pricing involved in there.\nI want to ask you, what is the customer behavior in those deals as they're coming for renewals?\nIs it possible to understand the conversion rates of those deals, signing into bigger security\ndeals, any way to understand that you're seeing on the ACV side?\nEd Grabscheid^ Hi, Pinjalim. This is Ed. I'll go ahead and start with that.\nSo we went general announcement of the security in the second half of last year. And as you\nmentioned, we did a lot of introductory pricing. Those are now coming up to renewals and we're\nstarting to see the adoption of those and expansion of seats on those customers.\nThe focus has really been on these large projects, these migration and large projects, where\nwe're seeing sizable deals in terms of the number of seats and security.\nThose are what's leading most of these projects that we talk about. These projects, once we\nhave a proof of concept, we have a win in terms of we know they're committed to JFrog. The\ntiming of those projects are still uncertain. That's why we're de-risking those.\nShlomi Ben Haim^ And if I may Pinjalim, thank you for the question.\nWhat we designed into the offering is that advanced security duration and now JFrog Runtime\nare all part only of the Enterprise-X and Enterprise Plus subscription as an add-on.\nSo what we see is not only that the introductory prices gave us kind of the runway that we\nneeded in order to penetrate the market and to displace other products, but also to consolidate\nour customers around the platform play and not just security as an add-on.\nPinjalim Bora^ Yes, understood.\nJFrog Ltd.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nOne follow-up for Ed.\nI know you're not really talking anything about 2025, but I want to ask you, how we should think\nabout the puts and takes. You're exiting at about 17-18%. Growth seems like the macro\nenvironment is still not kind of green light as of now.\nOn the other hand, you have seemed like built a big RPO base that probably gives you more\nvisibility.\nThen there is the security trend. How should we think about 2025 as we think about our\nmodels?\nEd Grabscheid^ Yes. Thank you for your comments and question on that, Pinjalim.\nWe're not at the moment commenting on 2025 as we normally do.\nWe'll do that at the end of the fiscal year and during our fourth quarter.\nBut one comment I'd like to make is that we're being more conservative in the way that we are\nbuilding our outlook and as we build our overall guidance going forward.\nPinjalim Bora^ Understood. Thank you very much.\nOperator^ Thank you.\nOur next question comes from the line of Mike Cikos from Needham. Your line is open.\nMichael Cikos^ Hi. Guys. Thanks for taking the question here.\nI just wanted to circle up on two components, really first closing out the point from Pinjalim.\nBut I know that you're talking about how you're being more conservative in building this\nguidance from the ground up going forward.\nSo is that a comment as it relates to where we stand today?\nBecause I know you've obviously signaled that you're more cautious and de-risking for these\nlarge cloud migrations.\nOr is there potential for incremental prudence to be introduced?\nShlomi Ben Haim^ Hi, Mike. This is Shlomi.\nJFrog Ltd.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nWe are looking at Q3.\nWe are very pleased, very strong beat, very strong delivery on the quarter on all fronts.\nWe are doing Q4 now and we de-risk our pipeline.\nWe looked at the opportunities.\nBut we still remain cautious because what we are seeing is that the big cloud migration, the big\nsecurity deals, the big platform deals are not yet completely out of the woods.\nSo we have to remain cautious and to deliver on a strong 2024.\nWe are committed to what we guide you with.\nBut we will take the conservative approach as we communicated in the past.\nMichael Cikos^ I appreciate that.\nThen I guess my follow up, I know it's probably a secondary, even admittedly, maybe more of a\ntertiary metric.\nBut if I look at billings and RPO, this quarter specifically, both those metrics were significantly\nstronger versus what it's been more recently.\nI just wanted to get a better sense.\nShould we equate that to maybe some of the catch up in these larger deals that push from Q2\nto Q3?\nOr is there anything else to kind of point to help us understand those dimensions?\nEd Grabscheid^ Hi, Mike.\nIt's Ed. Thanks for your question. Yes.\nThank you for noticing that.\nIt was a very strong quarter and much of that is the contribution that we saw in these very large\ndeals.\nJFrog Ltd.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nIn addition to that, when you start to look at RPO, the fact that now we are starting to see many\nof these deals be multi-year deals.\nSo that's taken into consideration, obviously in the RPO as well.\nShlomi Ben Haim^ I mentioned, Mike, in the previous call that some of those sizable deals that\nwere kind of pushed from the second quarter to the third, and maybe some will be pushed in the\nfuture, are sizable, not only because of the potential, but also because of the strategic play that\nour team is working according to.\nIf the deal can be larger, and it requires me to wait a bit more, but to bring a multi-deal, multi-\ncloud, multi-technologies in a completely different size, we will wait and we will deliver.\nWhat you see in the RPO is a result of that exact strategy.\nMichael Cikos^ Great. Thank you very much, guys.\nOperator^ Thank you.\nOur next question comes from the line of Ryan McWilliams from Barclays. Your line is open.\nRyan MacWilliams^ Thanks for taking the question. Just on the cloud side, how would you say\nmacro is currently impacting cloud usage at this point?\nAnd do you notice any linearity for cloud consumption throughout the quarter, like maybe getting\nbetter towards the end of the quarter or since in 4Q?\nI'd love to hear about how those usage trends are going. Thanks.\nShlomi Ben Haim^ Hi, Ryan. This is Shlomi. Thank you for joining the call. Listen, we see in our\npipeline some of our biggest customers still planning on migrating to the cloud, but it's not ready\nyet to be executed in full steam ahead.\nSo proof of concepts are being made. The cloud vendor has been chosen. Deals are being\nnegotiated not only with us, but also on the marketplace.\nIt takes a bit longer. This is why our approach about cloud migration is more conservative than it\nused to be in the past.\nThe second thing is that these customers, if they are customers and not prospects, they are not\ninvesting in their self-hosted while planning the move to the cloud.\nJFrog Ltd.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nThat's kind of a double click also on what happened until they decide to kind of shift gears and\nstart to move to the cloud.\nWe will partner with them until they will be ready, but that takes a bit longer in today's macro.\nRyan MacWilliams^ And just to follow up on that migration point, is there any way to further\nincentivize those migrations, like maybe taking more price on the self-hosted side?\nAnd let's just say the macro does become clear in the fourth quarter. Are these migrations ready\nto go?\nCould you activate more quickly to the cloud and they could like accelerate their timing to\nmoving over?\nOr would this be like a multi-quarter migration process?\nShlomi Ben Haim^ Yes. That's a very good point. When we speak about incentive, you don't\npunish your customers that are now struggled with today's macro by raising the price on the\nself-hosted. Unless you don't want to partner with them in the future.\nBut we will think as we do every year about the pricing for the self-hosted solution next year.\nThat might motivate our future migrator to the cloud. Those that are currently in the pipeline, we\nare partnering with them to make sure that we accomplish a full successful migration that will\nnot only lead to the migration per se, but also a cohort that will show year-over-year goals as\nthey keep using our platform.\nRyan MacWilliams^ That makes sense. Thanks so much.\nOperator^ Thank you.\nOur next question comes from the line of Kingsley Crane from Canaccord. The line is open.\nKingsley Crane^ Hi, congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking the question. I want to start with\ncloud growth, 40% growth on the year.\nI think that implies some pretty significant acceleration in Q4.\nYou called out a couple of things, full quarter of large-scale ones in Q3, annual customer\ncommitment, and then smaller migrations to the cloud.\nJFrog Ltd.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nIs there any way to stack rank those?\nThen I guess as a follow-up, is there any sort of consumption true of expected similar to last\nQ4?\nThanks.\nEd Grabscheid^ Hi, Kingsley. This is Ed. Thanks for your question. There's no way really to\nstack rank those. Those are the three contributing factors to what we see as we move into Q4.\nThe cloud usage so far has been kind of consistent with what our expectations have been.\nIn terms of the sequential growth, when you look at it last year compared to this year, I want to\nremind everybody first off that we had a one-time benefit in Q4 of 2023.\nWe don't anticipate a similar level of a true up one-time benefit during Q4 of the same time this\nyear.\nBut on a sequential, when you remove that one-time benefit, it will be somewhere around the\nsame range from a dollar's perspective.\nThen overall, I think what you'll see is that the execution in terms of our strategy around cloud\nhas still delivered very strong cloud growth in a tough budgetary environment.\nKingsley Crane^ Okay. Thank you. That's it for me.\nOperator^ Thank you.\nOur next question comes from the line of Shrenik Kothari from Baird. The line is open.\nShrenik Kothari^ Thanks for taking my question. Great execution. Shlomi, you mentioned it's no\nlonger a question of if companies will adopt this end-to-end security, but when?\nOf course you showcased hundreds of logos at SwampUp and saw these, I would say larger\ndeals are showing up in RPO. Just curious, are customers still in early stage of deploying these\nadvanced securities?\nHow are you helping them overcome the deployment integration bottlenecks?\nAre you needing to ramp up your sales marketing efforts?\nAre you really pushing hard on training support about deeper integration into the DevSecOps\nworkflows?\nJFrog Ltd.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nJust curious or be it both. Then I have a quick follow-up.\nShlomi Ben Haim^ Well hi, Shrenik. I hope that I heard the question right. If you're asking about\nour strategy of how to take these technologies that was some of it innovated and announced at\nSwampUp, how we take it to the market, I guess that this is what you asked.\nOur strategy is that the JFrog platform will consolidate all the solutions that you need around\nsoftware supply chain management with one platform. Therefore, the end-to-end security from\nthe creation of the code all the way to production including runtime security that was announced\nat SwampUp, and therefore the MLOps technology following the acquisition of Qwak to provide\nour customers the ability to use the same platform for MLOps and not just DevOps and\nDevSecOps.\nAll of these head-ons are available for our customers on the Enterprise-X and the Enterprise\nPlus subscription.\nIf you are not there, it will generate an upgrade. If you are there, it will be a buy-seat mechanism\nthat will allow them to implement these technologies on top of the platform.\nShrenik Kothari^ Got it. I appreciate it. Very helpful. A quick follow-up, Ed and Shlomi, feel free\nto chime in. In terms of the strategic partners with GitHub, which includes unification of the\nadvanced security and bringing AI to co-pilot integration, can you give us some color in terms of\nthis deeper integration?\nIs it already playing or how is it expected to play out in perhaps 2025 specifically and beyond?\nHow should we think about that influencing overall adoption and retention amongst the 7%\ncustomer base, of course upsell and what are the key APIs that you're tracking to measure\nthat?\nThanks.\nShlomi Ben Haim^ Wonderful question. There are actually three factors that will determine\nwhether this partnership is good or not.\nOne is the retention of our customers. Two, bringing prospects and new customers on board.\nThree is to generate more innovation together with our partners.\nSome of it might be a business innovation of what we can sell together.\nJFrog Ltd.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nCurrently, we are at the face of co-engineering and pushing very hard including just a week ago\nat GitHub Universe the GitHub conference that we announced more capabilities with co-pilot.\nWe are on all three fronts, DevOps, security, and AI with co-pilot. At this moment, we are not\npursuing a co-sell mechanism with Microsoft.\nWe might consider it in the future together with our partners.\nShrenik Kothari^ Got it. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.\nOperator^ Thank you.\nOur next question comes from the line of Miller Jump with Schwartz Securities. Line is open.\nMiller Jump^ Great. Thank you for taking the question. I want to go back to your comments on\nRyan's question earlier. You talked about cloud migration causing some customers to kind of\ndrag their feet signing deals on the self-managed side as well. Just looking at the top line this\nquarter, self-managed was the larger driver of outperformance against our estimates.\nI'm just trying to understand, are customers getting more comfortable staying on-prem, or are\nyou saying there's no change there?\nShlomi Ben Haim^ No. Actually, if you remember, Miller, what we called the last quote of the\ntwilight zone, this is where they are staying because they know strategically that they are going\nto migrate to the cloud, but they don't have the bless of the business, of their managers, or even\nthe bold to complete the process.\nSo while staying on the self-hosted, not because they chose to, but because they don't have\nany other options, they cannot invest in adopting security, in adopting MLOps, in adding more\nservers.\nSo what happens is that they keep the business running with what they have for years, and they\nare planning with a strategic migration to the cloud.\nWe believe that this momentum that we saw in Q3 with the big deal will go on to the fourth\nquarter in 2025, but we have to be very conservative because we are not yet out of the woods.\nMiller Jump^ Understood.\nOkay.\nJFrog Ltd.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nSo I guess I also just want to double-click on the consolidation opportunities that you all called\nout.\nIn these cases, are you having to wait for other vendors' contracts to end to expand with the\ncustomer?\nAnd if that is the case, do you expect Q4 to actually have relatively more of those opportunities\nthan the rest of the year?\nShlomi Ben Haim^ Consolidation is a matter of what technology we are talking about. I never\nseen an enterprise customer that never had a security vendor or even five or 10 covering their\nsoftware supply chain, and nobody just switched from one tool to another over a day not even\nover a year.\nBut what we hear from the CIO, what I hear from our customers, what you heard at SwampUp\nwhen you met our customers, is that they want to consolidate.\nThey don't want to have multiple vendors. They don't want to have a technology that is\ncompromising on how they do software supply chain security.\nSo it would be probably in the beginning, running in parallel, and slowly kind of sunsetting the\ncompetitive point solution. This is what we hear from the market. This is being expressed very\nloudly by the CISOs and the CIOs of our customers.\nMiller Jump^ Understood. Thank you. Thank you.\nOperator^ (inaudible) from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nKoji Ikeda^ Hi, Shlomi. Hi, Ed. Thanks for taking the question.\nIt's just one from me.\nI wanted to double-click here on kind of the reservedness of the buyer into committing with\nJFrog on a bigger scale today.\nSo is there something very specific in the way that JFrog is being used or deployed within\nenterprises that's driving this more reserved posture?\nAnd Shlomi, you maybe alluded to this a little bit in your answer to another question.\nJFrog Ltd.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nIt sounds like there's also a component of the buyer needing to catch up a little bit with the\nunderstanding of what JFrog is offering today to really invest in the future with JFrog. I'm just\ntrying to understand this a little bit more. Thanks.\nShlomi Ben Haim^ Thank you, Koji.\nSo what is it that we see?\nWe see that in Q3, JFrog won three of the most sizable deals ever in the company's history.\nThese deals were not born in Q3. They were born a year ago and even more.\nSome of our customers not only grew by doubling their spend on JFrog, but by adding more\ntechnologies, not just DevOps, now also DevSecOps, and even other technologies like the\nConnect for IoT devices.\nStrategically, our customers start to understand that software supply chain needs to be\nmanaged by one platform and they have to choose.\nI'm very glad that they chose JFrog.\nWhat the buyers, to your question about the buyers, they start to see the JFrog budget line\ngrowing. And from being discussed on a VP level to a fee level, board level, this is a completely\ndifferent playbook and we are very happy that we got there. This is what we saw in the pipeline\nwhen we communicated Q2. This is what we see now.\nBut again we would be very conservative with what happened in the macro and with the size of\nthe deals that are not being signed by a CEO minus four, minus five, but sometimes by the\nBoard approvals themselves.\nKoji Ikeda^ Thanks, Shlomi.\nOperator^ Thank you.\nOur next question comes from the line of Andrew Sherman from TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nAndrew Sherman^ Oh, great. Thank you. And congrats on the quarter. Great to hear about\nthese big deals closing. Wondering about Q4 pipeline. Are there more of these type of big deals\nin the pipeline and what's your visibility into those and how have you factored in closure rates\nand the timing of any deals there?\nShlomi Ben Haim^ Yes. That's obviously something that we see for a few quarters, right?\nJFrog Ltd.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nThere is no pipeline for big deals or mega deals, as we call it, the JFrog that was born a quarter\nbefore.\nSo the answer is yes, we see those sizable deals in the future quarters as well pipeline, but we\ndid the pipeline and we are looking at every deal from the bottom up and top down.\nWe communicate with our customers about the strategy.\nSometimes it's even our decision to push it a bit because we can win a deal now and maybe\nmiss the opportunity to add security to it.\nSo when we strategically speak with our customers, we might take a bit longer. It's not only the\nmacro, it's also the strategy of the adoption of the full platform.\nSo to optimize the opportunity and also to take into consideration the macro environment, we\nare de-risking the pipeline on a daily basis as we reported before.\nTo your question, we are very excited about what we see in the pipeline moving forward.\nAndrew Sherman^ That's great, Shlomi.\nOne more for you.\nOn the AI front, when do we think we could see that show up in revenues for you?\nI know we're still early, but these AI binaries are huge and that could potentially drive more\nstorage revenue for you, I would think but we'd love to hear your thoughts on that.\nShlomi Ben Haim^ Yes, great question. AI, let's make it very clear. Putting flap aside, AI equals\nmodels. Models equals binaries.\nSo if we plant the right seeds in the ground now we will see the food. The question about when,\nI wish I had an answer for you.\nI know that all of my customers including the paying customers for the MLOps solution, are at\nthe experiment mode. And most of them, even those that were brave enough to take it to\nproduction, are looking at compliance and regulation and security and adoption and scale and\nbudget.\nSo many open questions there that I think it will take a bit longer than just a few quarters. When\nwe will have more clarity, obviously we will include it in our guidance. Currently, we are investing\nin R&D and paving the path for future growth with this growth engine.\nJFrog Ltd.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nAndrew Sherman^ Excellent. Thank you.\nOperator^ Thank you.\nOur next question comes from the line of Jeff Hickey from UBS. The line is open.\nJeff Hickey^ Great. Thanks so much for taking just a couple questions. I wanted to ask if we\ncould get any color on monthly customers.\nI think you described steady usage patterns on the cloud side amongst committed customers.\nLast quarter, you had de-risked the cloud guide this year, partially from the monthly side. Are\nthose trends that you're seeing there really consistent with where we were back in early to mid-\nAugust, or has there been any kind of change from what you're seeing internally?\nShlomi Ben Haim^ Yes. Thank you, Jeff. I'll start, and Ed will chime in. What we are\nstrategically doing is incentivize our cloud monthly users to go annual. The main reason for that\nis not only growth, but reducing volatility. This is what we discussed last quarter. What we see is\nthat the retention of our customers in the cloud is high.\nWe see two groups, those that are ready to go annual and to become enterprise, not only by\ntheir profile, but also by their usage, and those that are happy with a couple of thousands of\ndollars of ARR a year. The platform will serve them, but I don't see them as top of the funnel.\nThis is what we de-risk.\nCurrently, we are very happy with the progress of migrating some of them to an annual base,\nand hopefully to reduce the volatility and the pull-up movement that we had last year. Moving on\nto the future, we want to see more of these customers adopting more than just the DevOps\nmonthly solution, but also security. This will be part of our strategy for upgrades in 2025.\nEd Grabscheid^ And just to carry on with what Shlomi is saying, the cloud usage for those\nmonthly customers has been stable compared to what we saw previously and it's consistent\nwith our expectation. Those monthly customers are around 20% and have come down over\ntime.\nWe expect, as we continue to move forward with the strategy of moving those monthly\ncustomers to annual customers that the contribution from them would start to decline over time.\nJeff Hickey^ Got it. That's really helpful, color.\nThen one quick follow-up. Ed, just on the net dollar retention guidance, reiterating for mid-teens,\nyou're at 117 right now and that's a trailing 12-month metric.\nJFrog Ltd.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nIs there anything else we should keep in mind as we're just thinking through the growth\nalgorithm, outside of maybe just the relative conservatism you mentioned earlier?\nEd Grabscheid^ Yes, Jeff, that's a good question.\nI wouldn't take too much from that besides the fact that we remain very conservative in the\noutlook approach, and that's being factored into the guidance in the mid-teens that we're\nprojecting going forward.\nJeff Hickey^ Great. Thank you.\nOperator^ Thank you.\nOur next question comes from the line of Brad Reback from Stifel. The line is open.\nBrad Reback^ Great. Thanks very much. Ed, can you give us a sense of the $74 million\nsequential increase in RPO?\nHow much of that was current RPO versus long-term?\nEd Grabscheid^ Sure.\nWe had $245 million of that is current RPO, and growth on our current RPO is around 24% on a\nyear-over-year basis.\nBrad Reback^ Great. That's super helpful.\nThen last numbers question, hopefully for the night. Gross margin obviously down-ticked each\nquarter this year, and I know you talked about 83 to 84 for the year, but looks like will exit less\nthan that. How should we think about that stabilizing going forward?\nIs it in the low 80s or maybe into the 70s?\nThanks.\nEd Grabscheid^ So what we see is we start to see more cloud revenue and a change in the\nmix.\nWe have a lower margin profile for our cloud.\nWe continue to focus on optimization in terms of our cloud cost of revenue.\nJFrog Ltd.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nHowever as that mix shifts, you would expect that gross margins would start to decline over\ntime. This is what we saw during Q3.\nWe had a greater mix in terms of our cloud on a year-over-year basis.\n39% of our revenue is coming from cloud versus last year at 34%.\nI would expect as we move forward and that becomes a bigger piece of our total revenue, our\ngross margins would start to decline.\nBrad Reback^ Got it. Thanks very much.\nOperator^ Thank you.\nOur next question comes from the line of Jason Celino from Keybanc Capital Markets. Your line\nis open.\nJason Celino^ Hi, thanks for fitting me in. Actually a free cash flow question, so not quite the\nlast numbers question of the night.\nLooks like the free cash flow guide is coming up nicely by more than kind of the revenue raise.\nJust curious what's kind of leading to that.\nEd Grabscheid^ Well what's leading to that is the fact that we closed several very, very large\ndeals is what we talked about during the quarter.\nSo the execution during the quarter with three of the largest deals in the history of the company\nis contributing to the free cash flow.\nIn addition to just a very strong collections in general, we do have some customers that are a\nmulti-year that pay up front.\nBut the timing of the free cash flow can shift from quarter to quarter.\nJason Celino^ Okay. That makes sense.\nThen Shlomi, with the GitHub partnership, I think you talked about being in the co-innovation\nphase at the moment.\nJFrog Ltd.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nI'm curious if you can share any anecdotal top-of-funnel metrics or anecdotal drivers for\nadvanced security curation, like what that looks today maybe before versus before the GitHub\npartnership announcement.\nI guess what I'm trying to ask is if you've seen some media pipeline or top-of-funnel interest over\nthe last couple of quarters.\nShlomi Ben Haim^ Yes. That's a good question.\nI don't think that any of our customers will buy security only because of the co-engineered\nintegration with GitHub or the single pane of glass for security on one platform.\nBut it's a very strong differentiator. And even customers that are using GitHub, customers that\nare using\nAtlassian big bucket, even these customers are exposed to this integration of the best of breed\nplatform, JPOG and GitHub, and they are sensitive to it.\nIt's also being presented that way on our pricing page as a feature, as a differentiator for\nEnterprise X and Enterprise Plus users.\nSo I think it creates some momentum on the top-of-funnel, but it cannot be the only reason.\nIt's just one of the catalysts.\nJason Celino^ Okay. No. That makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator^ Thank you.\nOur next question comes from the line of Jason Ader from William Blair. Your line is open.\nJason Ader^ Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Just a couple of quick ones for me. Ed, I\njust want to clarify. Did you say that the self-managed subscription business would have a\nsimilar growth rate in Q4 as Q3?\nDid I hear that incorrectly?\nEd Grabscheid^ I didn't.\nI don't believe I said that, but what I would -- Jason, the way to think about it is Q4 is our highest\nrenewal quarter. Therefore, the self-managed, because of the upfront portion, you would see\nthat we would get revenue contribution in Q4.\nJFrog Ltd.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nWe expect that the self-managed growth will be basically in line with what we've seen over the\nlast few quarters.\nJason Ader^ Okay.\nI'm just trying to square that because to get to 40% growth in cloud for the full year, that would\nassume around $48 million in cloud-managed subscription in Q4, which means that self-\nmanaged would have to be down somewhat sequentially, and 8% growth year-over-year, which\nwould be a much lower growth rate, not even double-digit growth rate in self-managed, unless\nI'm missing something like with licenses, if licenses are way down in Q4.\nBut otherwise, the math just doesn't work, so I'm trying to figure that out.\nEd Grabscheid^ Your self-managed will be around the same rate, maybe up or down a\n1percentage point, most likely down.\nJason Ader^ Okay but then you can't get to 40% for the year on cloud. That's the point.\nIt's just the math doesn't work. You gave 114 million midpoint guidance. Maybe we could take\nthis offline, but the math doesn't work.\nEd Grabscheid^ We guide it to around 40% for the year.\nJason Ader^ Okay.\nIf your growth rate in self-managed is close to the growth rate in Q3 year-over-year, the cloud\nnumber will not get you to 40% growth.\nIt'll get you to like 38% for the year.\nI'm just telling you that's the math.\nEd Grabscheid^ Yes. That's correct.\nIt's around 40%, and we'll talk to you after the call.\nWe can help you with that, but it's around 40% for the full year.\nJason Ader^ Okay but it sounds like it's going to be below 40%.\nShlomi Ben Haim^ Jason, I think we can take it as a follow-up.\nJFrog Ltd.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nOur guidance for the street is 40% on the cloud, the self-fostered with no significant change.\nThis is what we guided. This is what we think the pipeline, and we can do the math later if you\nwant, but that's what we committed.\nJason Ader^ Okay. All right. Then on the net retention, I know you said sort of mid-teens exiting\nthe year, right?\nI just want to get a sense if you believe net retention.\nFirst of all, do you think it's going to be stable with Q3 and Q4?\nThen what are the puts and takes kind of going forward, and where do you expect that to get to,\nlet's say in a year?\nI mean is there a specific target in your mind, and then how do you get there?\nWhat drives that to that target?\nEd Grabscheid^ Yes.\nSo we're focused for this call on Q4 and the full fiscal year, and what we see going into Q4 is\nstabilization of our net dollar retention rate around the mid-teens.\nShlomi Ben Haim^ As predicted.\nJason Ader^ Got you.\nI know you're not giving guidance, but whatever the puts and takes, like what drive net dollar\nretention higher?\nWould it be security?\nWould it be some of these larger renewals?\nI'm just trying to, again I'm just trying to understand like what's...\nShlomi Ben Haim^ Jason, net dollar retention is triggered by security add-ons and cloud\nmigration.\nJason Ader^ Security add-ons and cloud migration.\nJFrog Ltd.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nOkay. Thank you.\nOperator^ Thank you. Due to time constraints, we will end the Q&A session here. I will now turn\nthe call back over to Shlomi for closing remarks.\nShlomi Ben Haim^ Yes. Hi. Well guys, we had a very strong quarter. This is not happening by\nitself. I have 1,700 heroes working for JFrog, resilient, smart, and committed to deliver a very\nstrong 2024, and we will deliver.\nWe want to thank you for joining us here today and from the Swamp, may the Frog be with you.\nTake care.\nOperator^ This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect."
