Karooooo maximizes the value of data through its IoT SaaS cloud, with an offering that extends beyond connected vehicles and equipment to assisting more than 90,000 diverse enterprise customers (Q1 2022: 76,000+) to digitally transform their operations. \n\n> “With record earnings and cash generation from operating activities, this is a pleasingly solid start to our 2023 financial year (“2023”\n> \n> [Post this](#)\n\nAssessing the results for the first quarter ended May 31, 2022 (“Q1 2023”),**Zak Calisto, CEO and Founder** , said:“With record earnings and cash generation from operating activities, this is a pleasingly solid start to our 2023 financial year (“2023”). It confirms our robust business model and extends our decade-plus track record of execution and ability to scale operations in variable market conditions. \n\nDespite global economic headwinds, specifically higher energy and raw material prices and electronic component shortages, we maintained the momentum in our top-line growth. Total revenue was up 28% to ZAR801 million (Q1 2022: ZAR626 million). Revenue growth coupled with ongoing operating efficiencies resulted in profit for the period increasing 44% to ZAR156 million (Q1 2022: ZAR108 million) and earnings per share 42% to ZAR4.96 million (Q1 2022: ZAR3.49). Strong free cash flow generation bolstered our robust cash position, notwithstanding our investment in future growth. A net cash and cash equivalents balance of ZAR854 million at the end of Q1 2023 (Q4 2022: ZAR718 million; Q1 2022: ZAR 554 million) supported an interim dividend of 60 U.S. cents per ordinary share, declared on April 27, 2022. \n\nThe traction in our Southeast Asia operations was particularly encouraging. As COVID-19 disruptions eased, we accelerated the investment in our operations in this region. Among other highlights, Coca-Cola selected Cartrack as their technology partner in the Philippines to strengthen their operations. \n\nLooking ahead, we believe we have multiple levers for expansion and are well positioned to capitalize on a large and growing market opportunity. Our ability to create compelling value from the billions of data points we collect continues to improve, differentiating our offering to enterprise customers. Underpinned by our evolving end-to-end all-inclusive IoT platform, vertically integrated business model, established infrastructure, expanding distribution network and ability to execute, we believe that we have proved that we can scale our customer base in varying market conditions.” \n\n**Full earnings release and webinar details at[https://www.karooooo.com/](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.karooooo.com%2F&esheet=52792205&newsitemid=20220726005831&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.karooooo.com%2F&index=1&md5=1aae36744e872b4f34d964285ee223a7)**\n\n## Contacts\n\nLauren Human +65 6876 7900 +27 73 287 6064 \n\n[ ![](https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20220726005831/en/1524590/2/logo_vertical_KAROOOOO_Main_no_tag_line.jpg) ](https://www.karooooo.com)\n\n### Karooooo Limited\n\n[NASDAQ:KARO ![](/images/icons/icon_stocks.gif)](https://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/index.jsp?epi-content=MY_COMPANIES_CHART&symbol=KARO) [![](/images/icons/icon_filings.gif)](https://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/index.jsp?epi-content=FINANCIAL_POPUP&sec=1&action=showFilingResults&symbol=KARO)\n\n  * **Headquarters:** Singapore, Singapore\n  * **Website:** [www.karooooo.com](http://www.karooooo.com)\n  * **CEO:** Zak Calisto\n  * **Employees:** 3000+\n  * **Organization:** PUB\n\n\n\n## Release Summary\n\nKarooooo Limited reported solid results for FY23 Q1.

We made good inroads in delivering on our core strategic priorities, building for relevance and sustainability. As a technology partner, we continue to improve our platform and enhance our value proposition to our customers, giving them a competitive advantage in the dynamic and challenging environment they operate in. \n\nTotal revenue for 2022 is up 20% which equates to a 23% increase on a constant currency basis (a non-IFRS measure). Our decade-plus track record of growth, sustained profitability and a highly cash-generative business model, coupled with consistent innovation and strong customer acquisition, continues. At the end of 2022 we had more than 88,000 commercial customers. \n\nWe are excited about what we have built and continue to build. Our evolving end-to-end all-inclusive IoT platform, vertically integrated business model, established infrastructure, expanding distribution network and ability to execute and scale gives me comfort that we can continue scaling our customer base. \n\nExecution on core strategic priorities in 2022 included the expansion of partnerships with Original Equipment Manufacturers which are a springboard for future collaboration, given our shared commitment to continually enhance the distinctive value proposition we offer our customers. \n\nOur disciplined approach to capital allocation allows us to be profitable and highly cash-generative. Plenty of runway exists to remain profitable should we accelerate our revenue growth rate in excess of our average historical growth rate. \n\nKarooooo reported a net cash and cash equivalents balance of ZAR718 million at the end of 2022 (2021: ZAR76 million) after raising ZAR349 million of net proceeds when Karooooo listed on the NASDAQ in April 2021 and after paying ZAR70 million when acquiring Picup in September 2021. Given our profitability, inherently cash-generative business model and our strong balance sheet, the board declared a dividend of 60 U.S. cents per share which shall be payable entirely out of Karooooo’s retained earnings.“ **Zak Calisto, CEO and Founder.**\n\n**Full release and webinar details at[https://www.karooooo.com/](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.karooooo.com%2F&esheet=52699582&newsitemid=20220427005910&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.karooooo.com%2F&index=1&md5=fb381a48aa5c190b05c0601325f2bfeb)**\n\n## Contacts\n\n**Investor Relations** Phillipe Welthagen IR@karooooo.com  **Media**media@karooooo.com\n\n![](https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20220427005910/en/1435058/2/logo_vertical_KAROOOOO_Main_no_tag_line.jpg)\n\n### Karooooo Limited\n\n[NASDAQ:KARO ![](/images/icons/icon_stocks.gif)](https://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/index.jsp?epi-content=MY_COMPANIES_CHART&symbol=KARO) [![](/images/icons/icon_filings.gif)](https://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/index.jsp?epi-content=FINANCIAL_POPUP&sec=1&action=showFilingResults&symbol=KARO)\n\n  * **Headquarters:** Singapore, Singapore\n  * **Website:** [www.karooooo.com](http://www.karooooo.com)\n  * **CEO:** Zak Calisto\n  * **Employees:** 3000+\n  * **Organization:** PUB\n\n\n\n## Release Summary\n\nKarooooo's performance for FY22 is in line with management's outlook, Revenue up 20% under difficult trading conditions\n\n## More News[![RSS feed for null](/images/icons/icon_rss.gif)](http://feed.businesswire.com/rss/home/company/Karooooo+Limited/ZKop4M3MIviZ7mDGdapyIg==)\n\n  * October 15, 2024\n\n[Karooooo Increases Earnings by 31% Driven by Strong Subscription Revenue Growth and Higher Gross Margins](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241014203395/en/Karooooo-Increases-Earnings-by-31-Driven-by-Strong-Subscription-Revenue-Growth-and-Higher-Gross-Margins)\n  * September 30, 2024\n\n[Karooooo to Announce Second Quarter 2025 Results on October 14, 2024](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240930277032/en/Karooooo-to-Announce-Second-Quarter-2025-Results-on-October-14-2024)\n  * July 26, 2024\n\n[Karooooo Ltd.
