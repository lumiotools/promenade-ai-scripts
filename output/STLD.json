Investors\n\n# Press Releases\n\nPrint [View List](/press-releases)\n\n## Steel Dynamics Recognized for Increased Use of Green Power\n\nOct 30, 2024\n\nFORT WAYNE, Ind., Oct. 30, 2024 — Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ/GS: STLD) today announced that they recently joined the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Green Power Partnership (GPP). Steel Dynamics was recognized by the U.S. EPA appearing number 21 on their list of Green Power Partners from the Fortune 500® and number 33 on their National Top 100 List of the largest green power users from the GPP. In 2023, Steel Dynamics steel mills utilized 690 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of green power, which is enough to meet 10 percent of its steel mill operations’ electricity use and achieve its 2025 renewable electrical energy goal.\n\n[ ![Steel Dynamics \\(PRNewsfoto/Steel Dynamics, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1679329/Steel_Dynamics_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1679329/Steel_Dynamics_Logo.html)\n\n“We are proud to be recognized by the U.S. EPA for our use of green power,” said Jeff Hansen, Vice President Environmental Sustainability. “By making the choice to use renewable power in our energy mix, we are reducing our emissions footprint, while also supporting the build-out of the renewable power market and development of those resources.”\n\n“This list of the largest users of green power across the nation is proof that good business practices can also benefit the environment,” said James Critchfield, Program Director of EPA’s Green Power Partnership. “EPA applauds the leading organizations in the Green Power Partnership’s Top Partner Rankings for their notable commitment to expanding their use of green power and protecting the environment.”\n\nIn 2023, Steel Dynamics signed the largest renewable product purchase agreement for the steel industry in North America, equivalent to approximately 15% of the company’s steel mills’ electricity usage. This wind energy center began commercial operation in the first quarter of 2024 and represents the single most significant step in increasing its exposure to renewable energy, propelling the company much of the way to its 2030 goal of 30% renewable electricity. This project is also expected to meaningfully contribute to its long-term reduction of Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions intensity.\n\nSteel Dynamics is already a leader in producing lower-carbon, high-quality steel products and plans to continue to play a leadership role in decarbonization.\n\n**About EPA’s Green Power Partnership** The Green Power Partnership is a voluntary program that helps increase green power use among U.S. organizations to advance the American market for green power and development of those sources as a way to reduce air pollution and other environmental impacts associated with electricity use. In 2022, the Partnership had nearly 700 Partners voluntarily using nearly 95 billion kilowatt-hours of green power annually. Partners include a wide variety of leading organizations such as Fortune 500® companies; small and medium sized businesses; local, state, and federal governments; and colleges and universities. For additional information, please visit [www.epa.gov/greenpower](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4291333-1&h=893753456&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.epa.gov%2Fgreenpower&a=www.epa.gov%2Fgreenpower).\n\n**About Steel Dynamics, Inc.** Steel Dynamics is one of the largest domestic steel producers and metals recyclers in North America, based on estimated annual steelmaking and metals recycling capability, with facilities located throughout the United States, and in Mexico. Steel Dynamics produces steel products, including hot roll, cold roll, and coated sheet steel, structural steel beams and shapes, rail, engineered special-bar-quality steel, cold finished steel, merchant bar products, specialty steel sections, and steel joists and deck. In addition, the company produces liquid pig iron and processes and sells ferrous and nonferrous scrap.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements** This press release contains some predictive statements about future events, including statements related to conditions in domestic or global economies, conditions in steel, aluminum, and recycled metals market places, our revenues, costs of purchased materials, future profitability and earnings, the operation of new, existing or planned facilities and decarbonization goals and sustainability efforts. These statements, which we generally precede or accompany by such typical conditional words as “anticipate”, “intend”, “believe”, “estimate”, “plan”, “seek”, “project”, or “expect”, or by the words “may”, “will”, or “should”, are intended to be made as “forward-looking”, subject to many risks and uncertainties, within the safe harbor protections of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements speak only as of this date and are based upon information and assumptions, which we consider reasonable as of this date, concerning our businesses and the environments in which they operate. Such predictive statements are not guarantees of future performance, and we undertake no duty to update or revise any such statements. Some factors that could cause such forward-looking statements to turn out differently than anticipated include: (1) domestic and global economic factors; (2) global steelmaking overcapacity and imports of steel, together with increased scrap prices; (3) pandemics, epidemics, widespread illness or other health issues; (4) the cyclical nature of the steel industry and the industries we serve; (5) volatility and major fluctuations in prices and availability of scrap metal, scrap substitutes and supplies, and our potential inability to pass higher costs on to our customers; (6) cost and availability of electricity, natural gas, oil, and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions; (7) increased environmental, greenhouse gas emissions and sustainability considerations from our customers or related regulations; (8) compliance with and changes in environmental and remediation requirements; (9) significant price and other forms of competition from other steel and aluminum producers, scrap processors and alternative materials; (10) availability of an adequate source of supply of scrap for our metals recycling operations; (11) cybersecurity threats and risks to the security of our sensitive data and information technology; (12) the implementation of our growth strategy; (13) litigation and legal compliance; (14) unexpected equipment downtime or shutdowns; (15) governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew some of our licenses and permits required to operate our business; (16) our senior unsecured credit facility contains, and any future financing agreements may contain, restrictive covenants that may limit our flexibility; and (17) the impacts of impairment charges.\n\nMore specifically, we refer you to our more detailed explanation of these and other factors and risks that may cause such predictive statements to turn out differently, as set forth in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K under the headings Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors, in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, or in other reports which we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

\\(PRNewsfoto/Steel Dynamics, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1679329/Steel_Dynamics_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1679329/Steel_Dynamics_Logo.html)\n\nThird Quarter 2024 Performance Highlights:\n\n  * Steel shipments of 3.2 million tons\n  * Net sales of $4.3 billion, operating income of $395 million, net income of $318 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $557 million\n  * Cash flow from operations of $760 million\n  * Strong liquidity of $3.1 billion, as of September 30, 2024\n  * Share repurchases of $310 million of the company’s common stock, representing 1.6 percent of its outstanding shares\n\n\n\nSteel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ/GS: STLD) today announced third quarter 2024 financial results. The company reported third quarter 2024 net sales of $4.3 billion and net income of $318 million, or $2.05 per diluted share. Comparatively, the company’s sequential second quarter 2024 net income was $428 million, or $2.72 per diluted share and prior year third quarter net income was $577 million, or $3.47 per diluted share.\n\n“The teams achieved a solid third quarter 2024 performance across the platforms, with adjusted EBITDA of $557 million and cash flow from operations of $760 million,” said Mark D. Millett, Co-Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer. “With our proven through-cycle cash generation, we increased liquidity to $3.1 billion, while also investing $621 million in our internal ongoing growth initiatives and distributing $381 million to our shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases. Our three-year after-tax return-on-invested capital of 26 percent is a testament to our ongoing high-return capital allocation execution.\n\n“Underlying steel demand continued to be stable in the third quarter,” continued Millett. “However, earnings declined sequentially, based on lower average realized steel pricing, primarily within the flat rolled operations as generally 80 percent of this business is contractually based and tied to lagging pricing indices. Steady steel demand, coupled with continued low customer inventory and stabilized scrap prices, resulted in stabilization and improvement in flat rolled steel prices during the later part of the third quarter. Our long product steel operations realized a slight improvement in metal spread as scrap pricing declined more than average realized pricing.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Comments**\n\nThird quarter 2024 operating income for the company’s steel operations was $305 million, lower than sequential results, as realized selling values declined more than scrap costs in the quarter. The third quarter 2024 average external product selling price for the company’s steel operations decreased $79 per ton sequentially to $1,059 per ton. The average ferrous scrap cost per ton melted at the company’s steel mills decreased $21 sequentially to $367 per ton. The company’s Sinton Texas Flat Roll Steel Mill team has completed the planned changes discussed on the second quarter 2024 earnings call. The team had great operating momentum in September and operated at 72 percent of its capability, excluding scheduled downtime.\n\nCompared to the sequential quarter, third quarter 2024 operating income from the company’s metals recycling operations decreased to $12 million, based on softer demand as many domestic steel mills had scheduled maintenance outages. Shipments and pricing declined for both ferrous and nonferrous materials in the quarter. Additionally, the platform experienced an unexpected unrealized, non-cash copper hedging loss of $10 million, as copper prices sequentially increased significantly from August to September. \n\nThe company’s steel fabrication operations achieved strong operating income of $166 million in the third quarter 2024, modestly lower than sequential second quarter results, as demand remained steady, and average realized pricing softened five percent yet remained historically strong. The order backlog was steady, extending into the first quarter 2025 at attractive pricing levels. Current order activity is steady with expectations for improved volumes in 2025, as interest rates decline and the support from the U.S. infrastructure program and onshoring are expected to positively impact demand for not only steel joist and deck products, but also for flat rolled and long product steels. \n\n**Year-to-Date September 30, 2024 Comparison**\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income was $1.3 billion, or $8.46 per diluted share, with net sales of $13.7 billion, as compared to net income of $2.0 billion, or $11.98 per diluted share, with net sales of $14.6 billion for the same period in 2023.\n\nFor the first nine months 2024, net sales decreased six percent to $13.7 billion and operating income declined 35 percent to $1.7 billion, when compared to the same period in 2023. Decreased earnings were the result of lower volume and pricing from the company’s steel and steel fabrication operations during the period. For the first nine months 2024, operating income from the company’s steel fabrication operations was $525 million, compared to $1.3 billion in the same prior year period. Operating income from the company’s steel operations was $1.4 billion, compared to $1.5 billion for the same prior year period. The average nine-month 2024 external selling price for the company’s steel operations decreased $38 per ton to $1,133 per ton compared to the first nine months of 2023, and the average ferrous scrap cost per ton melted at the company’s steel mills decreased $30 per ton to $391 per ton.\n\nBased on the company’s differentiated business model and highly variable cost structure, the company achieved cash flow from operations of $1.5 billion in the first nine months of 2024, representing a strong performance. The company also invested $1.4 billion in capital investments, paid cash dividends of $212 million, and repurchased $917 million of its outstanding common stock, representing 4.5 percent of its outstanding shares, while maintaining strong liquidity of $3.1 billion.\n\n**Outlook**\n\n“Based on domestic steel demand fundamentals, we are constructive regarding the outlook for 2025 metal market dynamics,” said Millett. “We expect steel pricing to recover with an anticipated lower domestic interest rate environment, coupled with continuing onshoring of manufacturing businesses, and the expectation of significant fixed asset investment to be derived from public funding related to the U.S. Infrastructure, Inflation Reduction Act, and Department of Energy programs. We believe current trade actions could also reduce volumes of unfairly traded steel imports into the United States, especially for coated flat rolled steel, which could have a significant positive impact for us, as we are the largest non-automotive flat rolled steel coater in the United States. We believe these dynamics collectively could benefit all of our operating platforms, especially our steel and steel fabrication businesses.\n\n“Our four new value-added flat rolled steel coating lines that began operating earlier this year continue to increase production. The teams have produced prime quality galvanized and painted products on all four lines in record time. We have had limited benefit from these new lines so far this year, as we have been increasing production, and expect to realize the additional earnings potential in 2025. Value-added product investments such as these enhance our differentiated supply-chain capabilities, while also increasing our higher-margin product offerings, which already represent upwards of 65 percent of our steel revenues. \n\n“We are also quickly progressing on our aluminum flat rolled products mill construction and are incredibly excited about this meaningful growth opportunity, which is aligned with our existing business and operational expertise,” said Millett. “We plan to begin operating the aluminum flat rolled mill mid-2025. We have intentionally grown with our customers’ needs, providing efficient sustainable supply chain solutions for the highest quality products. We are pleased to further diversify our end markets with plans to supply aluminum flat rolled products with high recycled content to the countercyclical sustainable beverage can and packaging industry, in addition to the automotive, industrial, and construction sectors. Our customers and our people are incredibly excited for this growth opportunity.\n\n“Our commitment is to the health and safety of our teams, families, and communities, while meeting the current and future needs of our customers. Our culture and business model continue to positively differentiate our performance from the rest of the industry. We are competitively positioned and focused to generate long-term sustainable value,” concluded Millett.\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nSteel Dynamics, Inc. will hold a conference call to discuss third quarter 2024 operating and financial results on Thursday, October 17, 2024, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time. You may access the call and find dial-in information on the Investors section of the company’s website at [www.steeldynamics.com](http://www.steeldynamics.com). A replay of the call will be available on our website until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on October 24, 2024.\n\n**About Steel Dynamics, Inc.**\n\nSteel Dynamics is one of the largest domestic steel producers and metals recyclers in North America, based on estimated annual steelmaking and metals recycling capability, with facilities located throughout the United States, and in Mexico. Steel Dynamics produces steel products, including hot roll, cold roll, and coated sheet steel, structural steel beams and shapes, rail, engineered special-bar-quality steel, cold finished steel, merchant bar products, specialty steel sections, and steel joists and deck. In addition, the company produces liquid pig iron and processes and sells ferrous and nonferrous scrap.\n\n**Note Regarding Financial Metrics**\n\nThe company believes that after-tax return-on-invested capital (After-tax ROIC) provides an indication of the effectiveness of the company’s invested capital and is calculated as follows:\n\nAfter-tax ROIC = |  Net Income Attributable to Steel Dynamics, Inc.  \n---|---  \n(Quarterly Average Current Maturities of Long-term Debt + Long-term Debt + Total Equity)  \n  \n**Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThe company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide additional meaningful information regarding the company’s performance and financial strength. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative for the company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, not all companies use identical calculations for EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA; therefore, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA included in this release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains some predictive statements about future events, including statements related to conditions in domestic or global economies, conditions in steel, aluminum, and recycled metals market places, Steel Dynamics’ revenues, costs of purchased materials, future profitability and earnings, and the operation of new, existing or planned facilities.

BUSINESS\nSteel Dynamics, Inc. is one of the largest domestic steel producers and metal recyclers in the\nUnited States, based on estimated steelmaking and steel coating capacity of approximately 16 million tons and\nactual metals recycling volumes as of December 31, 2023, with one of the most diversified product and end\nmarket portfolios in the domestic steel industry, combined with meaningful downstream steel fabrication\noperations. The company’s primary sources of revenue are currently from the manufacture and sale of steel\nproducts, the processing and sale of recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals, and the fabrication and sale of\nsteel joists and deck products.\nWe refer to our founding principles as our six core strategic pillars. They bring us together with a\ncommon focus, and they provide the foundation upon which we operate and grow. Our unique entrepreneurial\nculture and business model benefit us operationally, financially, and through the responsible use of our\nresources in diverse economic environments. Innovation in all forms is essential to our success, and our teams\nfocus on how to do things ‘‘smarter’’within our current operations, as well as how we continue to grow.\nThis means creating solutions for our teammates, customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders. It also includes\nfinding ways to ‘‘do business’’with fewer resources and less environmental impact. Our six strategic pillars\nand the team’s execution of them each day has driven our success and sustainability.\n• Health & Safety – Safety is our primary focus and core value. Nothing surpasses the importance of\ncreating and maintaining a safe work environment. Our goal is zero injuries—no accidents.\n• Entrepreneurial Culture – Fosters a team of energetic, positive, driven, innovative and diverse\nindividuals by utilizing open communication and meaningful performance-based compensation\naligned to our strategic focus.\n• Customer Commitment – We focus on being a preferred partner of our customers by providing\nquality products and unique supply chain solutions to meet their current and future needs.\n• Strategic Sustainable Growth – We focus on strategic growth with intentional margin expansion\nand consistency through-the-cycle.\n• Innovation – Through individual creativity and ingenuity, our teams drive innovation to improve\nsafety, quality, productivity, and resource sustainability. We strive to provide unique, superior\nproducts, customer supply chain solutions, and next-generation technologies and processes.\n• Financial Strength – Through our adaptable value-added product diversification, vertically\nconnected businesses model, coupled with our highly variable operating cost structure and\nperformance-based incentive compensation, along with our continued operating innovations and\nefficiency, we achieve higher utilization and lower costs, which provide strong cash flow generation\nthrough both strong and weak market cycles.\nDifferentiated Model - Uniquely Steel Dynamics\nCompetitively advantaged differentiation is core to our long-term value creation strategy. We set\nourselves apart in every aspect of our business with a spirit of excellence.\nUnique Entrepreneurial Culture\nOur entrepreneurial culture is at the core of our success and is driven by our extensive\nperformance-based incentive compensation philosophy from those on the plant floor to our senior leadership.\nOver 60% of a production team member’s total potential compensation is ‘‘at risk’’to both quality production\nand cost-effectiveness metrics. Over 85% of our senior leadership team’s total potential compensation is ‘‘at\nrisk’’to companywide financial performance metrics that encourage long-term value creation, including return\non equity, growth, cash generation, and return on invested capital measures. We believe diversity within our\nteams enhances broad-based thinking, innovation, and value creation. Our common goal of consistently\nachieving excellence in all we do is reflected in the esprit de corps that permeates our team.\nDiversified, Value-Added Product Offerings and Supply-Chain Solutions\nWe have one of the most diversified, high-margin product offerings within the domestic steel industry.\nWe have a track record of profitable growth, driving diversification in both end markets and value-added\n2023AnnualReport\nBroadridgeFinancialSolutions,Inc.•Tel:(631)254-7494 Operator:kaplowitzk Date:March 21, 2024Time:19:32:59\n@edipvwctxa217/PRODUCTION_Jobs/CLS_Funds/GRP_Steel_Dynamics/JOB_ny20020056x1_print/DIV_102-part1 Page4of34 Session:56\n4\nproduct offerings to sustain higher volume and profitability through varying market environments. Over\n70% of our steel and steel fabrication sales are considered value-added. Throughout our history and today, we\nseek to provide unique supply-chain alternatives for our customers to increase efficiency, reduce time and\ncosts, and promote decarbonization opportunities. Growing with our customers in this way has proven to be\ninvaluable in creating long-lasting relationships and product development.\nThe majority of our steelmaking operations are in locations near sustainable sources of scrap metals and\nnear our customer base, allowing us to realize freight savings for inbound scrap as well as for outbound steel\nproducts destined for our customers. This also allows us to provide consistent on-time delivery to our\ncustomer base with relatively short lead times, further solidifying our customer relationships.\nThis diversified portfolio of products enables us to access a broad range of markets, serve a large\ncustomer base, and helps mitigate our market exposure to any one product or sector, resulting in increased\nthrough-cycle steel mill utilization. In addition, our value-added steel product offerings help to balance our\nexposure to commodity grade products supplied by other steel manufacturers. We will continue to seek\nadditional opportunities, such as entering into the recycled aluminum flat rolled products market, and to\ncollaborate with our customers to anticipate their future needs by further expanding our range of products and\nofferings.\nOur Southwest-Sinton Flat Roll Division (Sinton) is a prime example of our internal growth and\ndifferentiated business model. This electric arc furnace (EAF) flat roll steel mill has approximately 3.0 million\ntons of annual steel production capacity, currently including two value-added coating lines comprised of a\ngalvanizing line with annual coating capacity of 550,000 tons with galvalume capability, and a paint line with\nannual coating capacity of 250,000 tons. We are also currently building four additional value-added flat roll\nsteel coating lines comprised of an additional paint line and galvanizing line located onsite at Sinton and a\npaint line and galvanizing line at our Heartland Flat Roll Division. These new coating lines are expected to\nbegin operating in early 2024.\nAs with all our growth initiatives, we seek to competitively differentiate ourselves through service,\nproduct capability and quality, and supply-chain solutions. Sinton is a ‘‘next-generation’’EAF flat roll steel\nmill, which has the capability to provide higher-strength, tougher grades of flat roll steel for the energy and\nautomotive markets. These ultra-high-strength steel products are not currently readily available from other\ndomestic steel producers. Sinton is adhering to the same sustainability model as our other steelmaking\nfacilities, utilizing state-of-the-art environmental controls and processes to produce high quality sustainable\nsteel. Sinton was fully commissioned during the first half of 2022, and operations have continued to ramp up\nas the team navigated unexpected challenges related to equipment during 2023.\nVertically Connected Businesses and Pull-Through VolumeAdvantage\nOur vertically connected businesses contribute to our higher through-cycle steel production and overall\nprofitability. Our internal manufacturing businesses are a significant competitive advantage supporting higher\nand more stable through-cycle earnings and cash flow generation. Our steel fabrication operations and\ndownstream processing locations use a significant amount of steel in their operations. During weaker steel\ndemand environments, we can source more of their steel needs internally, and during strong steel demand\nenvironments, we have the option to also purchase their steel needs externally. Ultimately, we optimize our\ncompanywide profitability and minimize earnings volatility. In 2023, our own steel consuming businesses\npurchased 1.8 million tons of steel from our steel mills, representing 14% of our total 2023 steel shipments.\nAstrategic and synergistic relationship also exists between our steel mills and metals recycling\noperations. Our metals recycling platform is the largest supplier of recycled ferrous scrap to our steel\noperations and is expected to be the largest supplier of recycled nonferrous scrap to our aluminum operations.\nThis allows us to reduce companywide working capital, as lower scrap volume is required at our steel mills.\nWe are also able to source higher-quality scrap for our steel mills, optimizing cost and quality.\nTechnicallyAdvanced, Low-Cost, Highly-Efficient Operations\nWe operate some of the most technically advanced and environmentally responsible steel mills in the\nworld. Our steel mills generate a fraction of the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) per ton of steel produced as\nBroadridgeFinancialSolutions,Inc.•Tel:(631)254-7494 Operator:kaplowitzk Date:March 21, 2024Time:19:32:59\n@edipvwctxa217/PRODUCTION_Jobs/CLS_Funds/GRP_Steel_Dynamics/JOB_ny20020056x1_print/DIV_102-part1 Page5of34 Session:56\n5\ncompared to traditional blast furnace steel production and the average global steel industry. Our value-added\nproduct diversification, vertically connected businesses, and performance-based incentive compensation\nprograms support our efficient, environmentally responsible, and competitively advantaged footprint. Coupled\nwith our low-cost, highly variable operating cost structure and our continued operating innovation and\nefficiency, we are one of the most profitable and lowest-cost domestic steel producers.\nTransformational Growth / New RecycledAluminum Flat Rolled Products Mill\nIn 2022, we announced our $2.7 billion project to construct and operate a 650,000 metric ton recycled\naluminum flat rolled products mill in Columbus, Mississippi, with two supporting satellite recycled aluminum\nslab centers.Asignificant number of our steel customers are also consumers and processors of aluminum flat\nrolled products. We have had customers indicate that they would like to co-locate on the rolling mill site in\nColumbus, enhancing cost efficiencies and reducing emissions across the supply chain. This investment will\nallow us to broaden our ability to serve both our existing and new customers by adding high-quality,\nlow-carbon flat rolled aluminum to our product portfolio. The product mix from the flat rolled products mill is\nexpected to be approximately 45% can stock, 35% automotive, and 20% common alloy and industrial use.\nThe product offering will be supported by various value-added finishing lines, including CASH (continuous\nannealing solutions heat treating) lines, continuous coating, and various slitting and packaging operations.\nThe state-of-the-art recycled aluminum flat rolled products mill will utilize a significant amount of aluminum\nscrap, and as such is also a complementary extension of the company’s metals recycling platform. The\ntwo satellite recycling aluminum slab centers are expected to begin operations in late 2024 and mid-2025, and\nthe recycled aluminum flat rolled products mill is expected to begin commissioning in mid-2025. Our unique\nperformance-based operating culture, coupled with our experience in successfully constructing and operating\ncost-effective, highly profitable carbon flat roll steel mills, positions us exceptionally well to execute strategic\nopportunities and to deliver strong long-term value creation.\nSustainability\nSustainability is a part of our long-term value creation strategy. We are dedicated to our people, our\ncommunities and our environment. We are committed to operating our business with the highest integrity and\nhave been since our founding. We only produce steel using EAF technology with recycled ferrous scrap as the\nprimary raw material. This method of steelmaking emits approximately one-third of the Scope 1, 2 and 3\nGHG emissions and uses less than one-quarter of the energy of the global blast furnace steelmaking averages\non a per metric ton basis. We believe EAF production is the best commercially available steelmaking, is the\nmost cost efficient, and provides the most flexibility, and as such, has been our method of growth for our steel\noperations. We encourage the use of new technologies and processes to reduce our impact on the environment,\nincluding a strategic focus on lowering carbon emissions. We are taking further action to reduce our\nenvironmental footprint through our 2025, 2030, and 2050 goals for GHG emissions reduction and increased\nrenewable energy usage.\nWe intentionally developed a vertically connected operating model, further strengthening our company.\nOur metals recycling platform collects and processes scrap from manufacturing and end-of-life items, such as\nautomobiles, appliances, and machinery. This processed scrap is then sold to end-users for reuse, including our\nEAF steel mills, which produce new steel from the scrapped material. Our steel is then sold to consumers that\nboth further process and manufacture end products. We sell a meaningful amount of steel to our own\nmanufacturing businesses that in turn sell finished products to consumers. Ultimately, when these products\nreach the end of their useful lives, they can be collected as scrap and used again in our steelmaking\noperations, creating our circular manufacturing model.\nOur growth strategy focuses on increasing through-cycle cash generation and providing growth\nopportunities for our people, partners, communities, and shareholders, all while keeping the sustainability of\nresources and carbon impact in focus.\nWe endeavor for continuous improvement in decarbonization, while maintaining compliance with\nregulated emission limits. We evaluate our GHG emissions by regularly reviewing furnace performance and\nefficiency. We analyze the latest available technologies to also determine whether emissions can be further\nlowered. In 2022, we announced a strategic joint venture, SDI Biocarbon Solutions, LLC. The joint venture,\n2023AnnualReport\nBroadridgeFinancialSolutions,Inc.•Tel:(631)254-7494 Operator:kaplowitzk Date:March 21, 2024Time:19:32:59\n@edipvwctxa217/PRODUCTION_Jobs/CLS_Funds/GRP_Steel_Dynamics/JOB_ny20020056x1_print/DIV_102-part1 Page6of34 Session:56\n6\nwhich is in the process of construction, will operate a biocarbon production facility in Columbus, Mississippi\nand is planned to supply our EAF steel mills with a renewable product alternative to anthracite used in our\nsteelmaking operations. The facility is expected to produce up to 228,000 metric tons per year, which could\nresult in as much as an estimated 35% reduction in our steel mills’Scope 1 GHG emissions. Operations are\nplanned to begin in late 2024.\nExperienced Leadership Team / Fosters an Entrepreneurial Culture\nOur senior leadership team is highly experienced and has a proven track record in the steel, metals\nrecycling, and steel fabrication industries, as well as in the construction and start-up of new operations. Our\nleadership objectives are closely aligned with our stakeholders through meaningful stock ownership positions\nand performance-based incentive compensation programs that are correlated to the company’s profitability and\noperational performance in relationship to our steel manufacturing peers. We emphasize decentralized\noperational decision making and responsibility, while continuing to maintain appropriate corporate governance\nand risk oversight. We reward teamwork, innovation, and operating efficiency, and focus on maintaining the\neffectiveness of our performance-driven incentive bonus plans that are designed to maximize overall\nproductivity and align the interests of our leadership and teams with our stakeholders.\nName Age Position\nMark D.

Safety is, and always will be, our\nprimary focus and core value. We intend for each individual to arrive at the workplace safely and return home\nsafely each day. This is achievable when we all work together. It requires commitment from leadership and\nteam members at every level to take ownership and responsibility for their safety and the safety of others.\nUnder no circumstance does the desire to maximize production or earnings override the value of individual\nsafety.\nSafety is our first core strategic pillar — it is the foundation of our decision making. Safety is always at\nthe forefront and is discussed regularly across the company, whether led by a team member from the plant\nfloor, a supervisor, or a manager. Leadership is engaged and continuously evaluates where we can improve.\nWe believe having every individual engaged in safety will lead to zero injuries.

The various components of our compensation programs promote\na balance of high-return growth, effective capital investment, low-cost operations, and risk mitigation. By\nrewarding our teams based on their performance as an individual, as a team, as a company, and based on\nshareholder interests, we believe we have the ultimate alignment with our external constituents. This is\nachieved through the following methods:\n• Individual performance awards consist of an individual’s base compensation, which is determined by\ntheir individual performance, responsibilities, and skills.\n• Team performance awards are based on departmental results, rewarding cost effectiveness and\nquality production. Our performance-based incentive programs reward team members for reducing\nwaste and increasing efficiency, while also producing quality products for our customers. These\nawards can be well over 100% of base wages, based on strong performance and on the teams doing\nthings that are within their control.\n• Companywide performance awards unite everyone through our profit-sharing program, which is\nbased on consolidated pretax profitability, and our 401(k) match, which is based on consolidated\nreturn on assets.\n• Alignment with our shareholders and the pursuit of long-term value creation is fostered through the\nissuance of restricted stock units. Each full-time, non-union, United States-based team member\nreceives annual equity awards. These awards generally have a two-year vesting period, supporting\nretention and companywide strategy alignment.\nOur team-based culture and competitive pay structure supported continued high retention. In 2023, our\noverall team retention was approximately 80%, with U.S.-based teams retention of 89%.\nOur compensation framework helps ensure that we remain strong with best-in-class performance and\nretain top talent even in economic downturns. We all share in the company’s successes, as well as the\nchallenges.\n2023AnnualReport\nBroadridgeFinancialSolutions,Inc.•Tel:(631)254-7494 Operator:kaplowitzk Date:March 21, 2024Time:19:32:59\n@edipvwctxa217/PRODUCTION_Jobs/CLS_Funds/GRP_Steel_Dynamics/JOB_ny20020056x1_print/DIV_102-part1 Page10of34 Session:56\n10\nTalent Development and Educational Opportunities\nOur people represent the foundation of our six strategic pillars.

Steel of\nWest Virginia’s customers are primarily OEMs producing solar panel structures, truck trailers, industrial lift\ntrucks, merchant products, guardrail posts, manufactured housing, mining, and off-highway construction\nequipment. Steel of West Virginia’s flexible manufacturing capabilities enable us to meet demand for a variety\nof custom-ordered and designed products. Many of these products are produced in small quantities for\nlow volume end-uses resulting in a wide variety of customers, the largest of which are in the truck trailer and\nindustrial lift truck industries.\nSteel Operations Segment Competition\nThe markets in which we conduct business are highly competitive with an abundance of competition in\nthe carbon steel industry from NorthAmerican and foreign integrated and mini-mill steelmaking and\nprocessing operations. We compete in numerous industry sections, most significantly tied to the construction,\nautomotive, and other manufacturing sectors. In many applications within these industry sections, steel\ncompetes with other materials, such as aluminum, cement, composites, plastics, carbon fiber, glass and wood.\nSome of our products are commodities, subject to their own cyclical fluctuations in supply and demand.\nHowever, we are focused on providing a broad range of diversified value-added products that de-emphasize\ncommodity steel. The primary competitive influences on products we sell are price, quality and value-added\nservices.\n2023AnnualReport\nBroadridgeFinancialSolutions,Inc.•Tel:(631)254-7494 Operator:kaplowitzk Date:March 21, 2024Time:19:33:0\n@edipvwctxa217/PRODUCTION_Jobs/CLS_Funds/GRP_Steel_Dynamics/JOB_ny20020056x1_print/DIV_102-part1 Page16of34 Session:56\n16\nMetals Recycling Operations Segment\nMetals Recycling operations include both ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal processing, transportation,\nmarketing, brokerage and scrap management services, strategically located primarily in close proximity to our\nsteel mills and other end-user scrap consumers, throughout the United States, and Central and\nNorthern Mexico. Our metals recycling operations accounted for 12%, 10% and 12% of our consolidated net\nsales during 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Through acquisitions in 2020 and 2022, we have increased\nshipments into Mexico, and export sales represented 18%, 14% and 11% of metals recycling segment net\nsales during 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nWe shipped the following from our metals recycling operations:\n2023 2022 2021\nFerrous metal total (gross tons). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5,779,114 5,301,774 5,442,478\nShipments to our steel mills . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3,579,958 3,475,662 3,574,668\nPercent of total to our steel mills. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 62% 66% 66%\nNonferrous metals (thousands of pounds). . . . . . . . . . . . 1,108,211 1,053,852 1,093,472\nWe sell various grades of processed ferrous scrap primarily to steel mills and foundries. Ferrous scrap\nmetal is the primary raw material for EAFs, including our steel mills. In addition, we sell various grades of\nnonferrous metals including copper, brass, aluminum, and stainless steel, to smelters, refineries, alloy\nmanufacturers, specialty mills and other consumers.\nWe purchase processed and unprocessed ferrous and nonferrous scrap metals, in a variety of forms for\nour metals recycling facilities.\nFerrous scrap comes from two primary sources:\n• Manufacturing industrial facilities, metal fabrication plants, and machine shops, which generate\nferrous scrap referred to as prompt or industrial scrap, and\n• Scrap dealers, retail individuals, auto wreckers, demolition firms and others who provide steel and\niron scrap, referred to as obsolete scrap. Obsolete scrap includes scrap recycled from end-of-life\nitems, such as automobiles, appliances, and machinery.\nNonferrous scrap comes from three primary sources:\n• Manufacturers and other nonferrous scrap sources, which generate or sell scrap aluminum, copper,\nstainless steel, and other nonferrous metals,\n• Producers of items such as electric wire, telecommunication service providers, aerospace, defense\nand recycling companies that generate nonferrous scrap consisting primarily of copper wire,\naluminum beverage cans, and various other metals and alloys, and\n• Retail transactions conducted with the general public who sell material directly to our facilities,\ncollected from a variety of sources.\nWe do not purchase a significant amount of scrap metal from a single source or from a limited number\nof major sources. Market demand and the composition, quality, size, weight, and location of the materials are\nthe primary factors that determine prices.\nProducts. Our metals recycling operations primarily involve the purchase, processing, and resale of\nferrous and nonferrous scrap metals into reusable forms and grades. We process an array of ferrous products\nthrough a variety of methods, including sorting, shredding, shearing, cutting, bailing, and breaking. Our major\nferrous products include heavy melting steel, busheling, bundled scrap, shredded scrap and other scrap metal\nproducts, such as steel turnings and cast iron. These products vary in properties or attributes related to\ncleanness, size of individual pieces, and residual alloys. The necessary characteristics of the ferrous products\nare determined by the specific needs and requirements of the consumer and affect the individual product’s\nBroadridgeFinancialSolutions,Inc.•Tel:(631)254-7494 Operator:kaplowitzk Date:March 21, 2024Time:19:33:0\n@edipvwctxa217/PRODUCTION_Jobs/CLS_Funds/GRP_Steel_Dynamics/JOB_ny20020056x1_print/DIV_102-part1 Page17of34 Session:56\n17\nrelative value. We process numerous grades of nonferrous products, including aluminum, brass, copper,\nstainless steel, and other nonferrous metals.Additionally, we provide transportation logistics (truck, rail, and\nriver barge), marketing, brokerage, and scrap management services, providing competitive price and cost\nadvantages to our suppliers and customers. We design, install, and manage customized scrap management\nprograms for industrial manufacturing companies.\nCustomers. We sell various grades of processed ferrous scrap to end-users, such as EAF steel mills,\nintegrated steelmakers, foundries, secondary smelters, and metal brokers, who aggregate materials for other\nlarge users. Ferrous scrap metal is the primary raw material for EAFs, including our steel mills. Most of our\nferrous scrap customers purchase processed scrap through negotiated spot sales contracts which establish a\nquantity purchase for the month. The price we charge for ferrous scrap depends upon market demand,\ncomposition, quality, size, weight, and transportation costs, as well as the quality and grade of the scrap. We\nsell various grades of processed nonferrous scrap to end-users such as aluminum sheet and ingot\nmanufacturers, brass and bronze ingot makers, copper refineries, mills, smelters, specialty steelmakers, alloy\nmanufacturers, wire and cable producers, utilities, and telephone networks. The price we charge for nonferrous\nscrap also depends upon market demand and pricing, transportation costs, as well as the quality and grade of\nthe scrap.\nCompetition. Scrap is a global commodity influenced by conditions in a number of industrialized and\nemerging markets throughoutAsia, Europe and NorthAmerica. The markets for scrap metals are highly\ncompetitive, both in the purchase of raw or unprocessed scrap, and the sale of processed scrap. With regard to\nthe purchase of unprocessed scrap, we compete with numerous independent recyclers, as well as smaller scrap\ncompanies engaged only in collecting obsolete scrap. In many cases, we also purchase unprocessed scrap\nmetal from smaller scrap dealers and other processors. Successful procurement of materials is determined\nprimarily by the price offered by the purchaser for the raw scrap and the proximity of our processing facility\nto the source of the raw scrap. Both ferrous and nonferrous scrap sell as a commodity in both domestic and\ninternational markets, which are affected, sometimes significantly, by relative economic conditions, currency\nfluctuations, and the availability and cost of transportation. Competition for sales of processed scrap is based\nprimarily on the price, quality, and location of the scrap metals, as well as the level of service provided in\nterms of reliability and timing of delivery.\nWe also face potential competition for sales of processed scrap from other producers of steel products,\nsuch as EAFs and integrated steel mills, some of which, like us, are also vertically connected in the scrap\nmetals recycling business. In addition, other steel mills may compete with us in attempting to secure scrap\nsupply through direct purchasing from our scrap suppliers. Scrap metal processors also face competition from\nsubstitutes for prepared ferrous scrap, such as pig iron, pelletized iron, hot briquetted iron (HBI), direct\nreduced iron (DRI), and other forms of processed iron.\nThe industry is highly fragmented with many smaller, regional, national and global companies, which\nhave multiple locations in areas in which our metals recycling operations also operate. No single scrap metals\nrecycler has a significant market share in the domestic market.\n2023AnnualReport\nBroadridgeFinancialSolutions,Inc.•Tel:(631)254-7494 Operator:kaplowitzk Date:March 21, 2024Time:19:33:0\n@edipvwctxa217/PRODUCTION_Jobs/CLS_Funds/GRP_Steel_Dynamics/JOB_ny20020056x1_print/DIV_102-part1 Page18of34 Session:56\n18\nSteel Fabrication Operations Segment\nOur steel fabrication operations include seven New Millennium Building Systems plants that primarily\nserve the non-residential construction industry throughout the United States. We have a national operating\nfootprint that allows us to serve the entire domestic non-residential construction market including large retail\nchains and e-commerce distribution channels.\nSteel fabrication operations accounted for 15%, 19%, and 10% of our consolidated net sales during 2023,\n2022 and 2021, respectively. We sold 663,000, 856,000, and 789,000 tons of joist and deck products during\n2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nProducts. Our steel fabrication operations produce steel non-residential building components, including\nsteel joists, trusses, girders, and steel deck. Our joist products include bowstring, arched, scissor,\ndouble-pitched and single-pitched joists. Our deck products include a full range of steel decking: roof, form,\ncellular, composite floor, specialty architectural, floor systems, and bridge deck.\nCustomers and Markets. Our primary steel fabrication operations customers are non-residential steel\nfabricators, metal building companies, general construction contractors, developers, owners, brokers, and\ngovernmental entities. Our customers are located throughout the United States, including national accounts.\nOur non-residential construction market consists primarily of e-commerce warehouses, data centers, metal\nbuildings, education, and commercial building projects. Our steel fabrication operations maintain\napproximately one-third of the total domestic steel joist and deck market for bookings, of approximately\n1.8 million tons, 2.1 million tons. and 3.6 million tons during 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nCompetition. We compete with other NorthAmerican joist and steel deck producers primarily on the\nbasis of price, quality, customer service, and proximity to the customer. Our national footprint allows us to\nservice the entire domestic non-residential construction market, as well as national accounts such as large\nretail chains, including their distribution warehouse facilities, and certain specialty deck customers.\nBroadridgeFinancialSolutions,Inc.•Tel:(631)254-7494 Operator:kaplowitzk Date:March 21, 2024Time:19:33:0\n@edipvwctxa217/PRODUCTION_Jobs/CLS_Funds/GRP_Steel_Dynamics/JOB_ny20020056x1_print/DIV_102-part1 Page19of34 Session:56\n19\nOther Information\nSources,Availability, and Cost of Steel and Other Operations’Raw Materials\nScrap Metals. The principal raw material of our EAF steel operations is recycled ferrous scrap derived\nfrom, among other sources, ‘‘home scrap,’’generated internally at our steel mills themselves; industrial scrap,\ngenerated as a by-product of manufacturing; obsolete scrap, recycled from end-of-life automobiles, appliances,\nand machinery, and demolition scrap, recycled from obsolete structures, containers and machines.\nRecycled ferrous scrap typically comprises more than 80% of the metallic melt mix in EAF steelmaking,\nin contrast to integrated mill steelmaking, where the proportion of scrap has traditionally been approximately\n25% to 35%. Depending upon the scrap substitute material that may be available from time to time, and the\nrelative cost of such material, the percentage of scrap used in our steelmaking operations could be increased\nor reduced in our metallic melt mix.\nMany variables can impact ferrous scrap prices, all of which reflect the pushes and pulls of the supply\ndemand equation. These factors include the level of domestic steel production (high quality low-residual scrap\nis a by-product of manufacturing activity), the level of exports of scrap from the United States, and the\namount of obsolete scrap recycled. In addition, historical domestic ferrous scrap prices typically have a strong\ncorrelation and spread to global pig iron pricing. Generally, as domestic steel demand increases, so does scrap\ndemand and resulting scrap prices. The reverse is also normally, but not always, true with scrap prices\nfollowing steel prices downward when supply exceeds demand. When scrap prices greatly accelerate, this can\nchallenge one of the principal elements of an EAF based steel mill’s traditional lower cost structure—the cost\nof its metallic raw material.\nIron Units. In addition to scrap, pig iron, DRI, HBI, and internally sourced liquid pig iron are used in\nour EAF steel mill production. During 2023, 2022, and 2021 we consumed 13.0 million, 12.0 million, and\n11.0 million tons, respectively, of metallic materials in our steelmaking furnaces, of which, iron units other\nthan scrap, represented approximately 15% of the tons in 2023, and 13% of the tons in 2022 and 2021.\nEnergy Resources\nElectricity. Electricity is a significant input required in our EAF steel operations, representing\napproximately 4% of steel production costs of goods sold in 2023, 2022 and 2021. We have entered into fixed\nprice electricity contracts for the Butler Flat Roll Division, Columbus Flat Roll Division, Roanoke Bar\nDivision and Steel of West Virginia, while our Engineered Bar Products Division has a combination of fixed\npricing and market pricing for the various components of the electrical services (demand charge, energy\ncharge, riders, etc.). Our Sinton Flat Roll Division purchases electricity at current market prices. Our\nStructural and Rail Division purchases electricity at current market prices and through fixed price forward\ncontracts.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development activities have consisted of efforts to expand, develop and improve our\nsteel products and operating processes, such as our Sinton Flat Roll Division, and our efforts to develop and\nimprove alternative ironmaking technologies. Most of these research and development efforts have been\nconducted in-house by our team members.\nEnvironmental Matters\nOur operations are subject to substantial and evolving environmental, health and safety laws and\nregulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air, discharges to surface and ground water and\nto sewer systems, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of solid and\nhazardous wastes and secondary materials. Our operations are dependent upon permits regulating discharges\ninto the environment or the use and handling of by-products in order to operate our facilities. We dedicate\nconsiderable resources aimed at achieving compliance with applicable laws concerning the environment.\nWhile we do not currently believe that our future compliance efforts with such provisions will have a material\nadverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, this is subject to change in the\never-evolving regulatory environment in which we operate.\n2023AnnualReport\nBroadridgeFinancialSolutions,Inc.•Tel:(631)254-7494 Operator:kaplowitzk Date:March 21, 2024Time:19:33:0\n@edipvwctxa217/PRODUCTION_Jobs/CLS_Funds/GRP_Steel_Dynamics/JOB_ny20020056x1_print/DIV_102-part1 Page20of34 Session:56\n20\nSince the interpretation and enforcement of environmental laws and regulations that may be enacted from\ntime to time can be subject to changing social or political norms, our environmental capital expenditures and\ncosts for environmental compliance may increase in the future. In addition, due to the possibility of\nunanticipated regulatory or other developments, the amount and timing of future environmental expenditures\nmay vary substantially from those currently anticipated. The cost of current and future environmental\ncompliance may also place our operations at a competitive disadvantage with respect to foreign producers,\nwhich may not be required to undertake equivalent costs in their operations.\nPursuant to the Resource Conservation and RecoveryAct (RCRA), which governs the treatment, handling\nand disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, the United States Environmental ProtectionAgency (United States\nEPA) and authorized state or local environmental agencies may conduct inspections to identify alleged\nviolations or areas where there may have been releases of solid or hazardous constituents into the environment\nand require the facilities to pay penalties and/or take corrective action to address any such releases. RCRA\nalso allows citizens in certain situations to bring suits against regulated facilities for potential damages and\ncleanup. Many states have statutes and regulatory authorities similar to RCRAthat can also apply. Many of\nour facilities generate wastes subject to these requirements. Our operations produce various by-products, some\nof which, for example EAF dust, may be categorized as hazardous waste, requiring special handling for\ndisposal or for the recovery of metallics. We collect by-products in pollution control equipment such as\nbaghouses, and then recycle or appropriately dispose of the by-products. While we cannot predict the future\nactions of the regulators or other interested parties, the potential exists for required corrective action, the costs\nof which could be substantial.\nUnder the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and LiabilityAct, known as CERCLA\nor Superfund, the United States EPA, state agencies and, in some instances, private parties have the authority\nto impose joint and several liability for the remediation of contaminated properties upon generators of\nhazardous substances, current and former site owners and operators, transporters and other potentially\nresponsible parties, regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity. Many states have\nstatutes and regulatory authorities similar to CERCLAthat can also apply. We have a number of material\nhandling agreements with various contractors to properly dispose of or recycle our EAF dust and certain other\nby-products of our operations. However, we cannot assure that, even if there has been no fault by us, we may\nnot still be cited as a hazardous substances generator by reason of an environmental cleanup at one of our\nfacilities or a site to which our by-products were transported.\nThe Clean WaterAct and similar state and local laws apply to aspects of our operations and impose\nregulatory restrictions related to the discharge of wastewater, storm water and dredged or fill material. The\nUnited States EPA, state agencies and, in certain instances, private parties have the ability to bring suit\nalleging violations and seeking penalties and injunctive relief. These legal provisions can also require new or\nexpanded water treatment investments to be made and can limit or even prohibit certain current or planned\nactivities at our operations.\nThe CleanAirAct and analogous state and local laws require many of our facilities to obtain and\nmaintain air permits in order to operate.Air permits can impose new or expanded obligations to limit or\nprevent current or future emissions and to add costly pollution control equipment. Enforcement for alleged\nviolations can be brought by the United States EPA, state and local agencies, and in certain instances private\nparties, and can result in penalties and injunctive relief.\nIn addition, there are a number of other environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that apply\nto our facilities and may affect our operations. By way of example and not of limitation, certain portions of\nthe federal Toxic Substances ControlAct, Oil PollutionAct, Safe Drinking WaterAct and Emergency\nPlanning and Community Right-to-KnowAct, as well as state and local laws and regulations implemented by\nthe regulatory agencies, apply to aspects of our facilities’operations. Our current and planned operations in\nMexico are similarly subject to environmental requirements applicable to those operations. In some instances,\nwe may also be subject to other foreign governments’regulations and international treaties and laws.

RISK FACTORS\nMany factors may have an effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash\nflows. We are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic, environmental, regulatory, political,\nindustry, business and financial conditions. The factors described below are some of the risks that could\nmaterially negatively impact us.\nGlobal and National Risks Related to our Business\nOur industry, as well as the industries of many of our customers and suppliers upon whom we are\ndependent, is affected by domestic and global economic factors including periods of slower than anticipated\neconomic growth and the risk of a recession.\nOur financial results are substantially dependent not only upon overall economic conditions in the United\nStates and globally, including NorthAmerica, Europe and inAsia, but also as they may affect one or more of\nthe industries upon which we depend for the sale of our products. Global or domestic actions or conditions,\nincluding political actions, trade policies or restrictions, proposed or actual changes in tax laws, such as those\nintroduced, proposed or actual regulation, including those related to the environment, interest rates, terrorism,\nacts of war or hostility, natural disasters, or pandemics, epidemics, widespread illness or other health issues,\ncould result in changing economic conditions in the United States and globally, disruptions to or slowdowns\nin our business, our supply chain, or our global or domestic industry, or those of our customers or suppliers\nupon whom we are dependent.Additionally, periods of slower than anticipated economic growth could reduce\ncustomer confidence and adversely affect demand for our products and further adversely affect our business,\nresults of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Metals industries have historically been vulnerable to\nsignificant declines in consumption and product pricing during periods of economic downturn or continued\nuncertainty, including the pace of domestic non-residential construction activity.\nOur business is also dependent upon certain industries, such as construction, automotive, manufacturing,\ntransportation, heavy and agriculture equipment, energy and pipe and tube (including OCTG) markets, and\nthese industries are also cyclical in nature and may experience supply chain disruptions. Therefore, these\nindustries may experience their own fluctuations in demand for our products based on such things as\neconomic conditions, interest rates, supply chain disruptions, raw material and energy costs, consumer\ndemand, the rate of inflation and infrastructure funding decisions by governments. Many of these factors are\nbeyond our control.As a result of volatility in our industry or in the industries we serve, we may have\ndifficulty increasing or maintaining our level of sales or profitability.Adownturn in our industry or the\nindustries we serve may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash\nflows.\nAprospective decline in consumer and business confidence and spending, which is often coupled with\nreductions in the availability of credit or increased cost of credit and interest rates, as well as volatility in the\ncapital and credit markets, may adversely affect the business and economic environment in which we operate\nand the profitability of our business. We are also exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our\ncustomers and suppliers, which during times of high interest rates can be intensified. If the availability of\ncredit to fund or support the continuation and expansion of our customers’business operations is curtailed or\nif the cost of that credit is high, the resulting inability of our customers or of their customers to either access\ncredit or absorb the cost of that credit may adversely affect our business by reducing our sales or by\nincreasing our exposure to losses from uncollectible customer accounts.Adisruption of the credit markets\ncould also result in financial instability of some of our customers and suppliers. The consequences of such\nadverse effects could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers, the reduction,\ndelay or cancellation of customer orders, delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase,\nand bankruptcy of customers, suppliers or other creditors.Any of these events may adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nBroadridgeFinancialSolutions,Inc.•Tel:(631)254-7494 Operator:kaplowitzk Date:March 21, 2024Time:19:33:0\n@edipvwctxa217/PRODUCTION_Jobs/CLS_Funds/GRP_Steel_Dynamics/JOB_ny20020056x1_print/DIV_102-part1 Page23of34 Session:56\n23\nGlobal steelmaking overcapacity and imports of steel into the United States may adversely affect United\nStates steel prices, which, together with increased scrap prices, may adversely affect our business, results of\noperations, financial condition and cash flows.\nGlobal steelmaking capacity currently exceeds global consumption of steel products, which adversely\naffects United States and global steel prices. Such excess capacity sometimes results in steel manufacturers in\ncertain countries exporting steel and steel products, at prices that are lower than prevailing domestic prices,\nand sometimes at or below their cost of production. Excessive imports of steel and steel products, into the\nUnited States, may exert downward pressure on United States steel and steel products prices, which adversely\naffects our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Fluctuations in the value of the\ndollar can also affect imports, as a strong United States dollar makes imported products less expensive,\npotentially resulting in more imports of steel and steel products into the United States by our foreign\ncompetitors. Furthermore, the introduction of additional domestic steel capacity could increase this global\novercapacity. This, in turn, has led to and may further lead to increased domestic demand for ferrous scrap\nresulting in increased scrap prices. Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows are driven\nprimarily from the metal spread achieved from the price we sell steel and steel products compared to the price\nof our metallic raw materials, including scrap. During prolonged periods of steel and steel products\novercapacity, leading to lower selling prices, combined with high demand for scrap and raw materials, leading\nto higher buying prices, our metal spreads could be compressed, which may adversely affect our business,\nresults of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nUnited States steel producers compete with many foreign producers, including those in China, Vietnam\nand otherAsian and European countries. Competition from foreign producers is typically strong and is\nperiodically exacerbated by weakening of the economies of certain foreign steelmaking countries, at times\nleading to imports of steel involving dumping and subsidy abuses by foreign steel producers. Some foreign\nsteel producers are owned, controlled or subsidized by foreign governments.As a result, decisions by these\nproducers with respect to their production, sales and pricing are sometimes influenced to a greater degree by\npolitical and economic policy considerations than by prevailing market conditions, realities of the marketplace\nor consideration of profit or loss.Additionally, at times when iron ore prices are low, disruption of the scrap\nprice correlation to iron ore may occur, which may lead to reduced global costs to produce steel, further\ndepressing steel import prices.Ahigher volume of steel imports into the United States tends to occur at\ndepressed prices when foreign steelmaking countries experience periods of economic difficulty, decreased\ndemand for steel products or excess capacity. The global steelmaking overcapacity is exacerbated by Chinese\nsteel production capacity that far exceeds that country’s demand and has made China a major global exporter\nof steel, resulting in weakened global steel pricing than otherwise would be expected. While measures to curb\nunfair trade such as tariffs, duties or quotas, along with trade agreements with other countries, have decreased\nthe volume of steel and steel products imports, domestic steel and steel products prices can be negatively\nimpacted by excessive imports of steel and steel products. Should current tariffs, duties or quotas expire or be\nrelaxed, repealed or circumvented by importers of steel and steel products, or should trade agreements be\nrenegotiated, downward pressure may be exerted on United States steel and steel products prices, which may\nadversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nPandemics, epidemics, widespread illness or other health issues may adversely affect our business, results\nof operations, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity, and stock price.\nPandemics, epidemics, widespread illness or other health issues may adversely affect our business, results\nof operations, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and stock price. Government actions globally,\nincluding United States federal and state governmental actions, related to pandemics, epidemics, widespread\nillness or other health issues have historically impacted demand for our products, our supply chain, our\nemployees, the economy generally, inflation and high interest rates, and any similar future actions may result\nin similar or additional impacts.\n2023AnnualReport\nBroadridgeFinancialSolutions,Inc.•Tel:(631)254-7494 Operator:kaplowitzk Date:March 21, 2024Time:19:33:0\n@edipvwctxa217/PRODUCTION_Jobs/CLS_Funds/GRP_Steel_Dynamics/JOB_ny20020056x1_print/DIV_102-part1 Page24of34 Session:56\n24\nIndustry Risks Related to our Business\nOur level of production and our sales and earnings are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of the\ncyclical nature of the steel industry and some of the industries we serve.\nThe steel manufacturing business is cyclical in nature, and the selling price of the steel we make may\nfluctuate significantly due to many factors beyond our control. Furthermore, a number of our products are\ncommodities, subject to their own cyclical fluctuations in supply and demand in both metal consuming and\nmetal generating industries, including the construction and manufacturing industries. The timing, magnitude\nand duration of these cycles and the resulting price fluctuations are difficult to predict. The sale of our\nmanufactured steel products is directly affected by demand for our products in other cyclical industries, such\nas construction, automotive, manufacturing, transportation, heavy and agriculture equipment, energy and pipe\nand tube (including OCTG) markets. Economic difficulties, stagnant or slow global economies, supply and\ndemand imbalances, supply chain disruptions, periods of heightened inflation or high interest rates, and\ncurrency fluctuations in the United States or globally may decrease the demand for our products or increase\nthe amount of imports of steel into the United States, which may decrease our sales, margins and profitability.\nVolatility and major fluctuations in prices and availability of scrap metal, scrap substitutes and supplies,\nand our potential inability to pass higher costs on to our customers, may constrain operating levels and\nreduce profit margins.\nSteel producers require large amounts of raw materials, including ferrous scrap metal and scrap substitute\nproducts such as pig iron and pelletized iron, and other supplies such as zinc, graphite electrodes and\nferroalloys. The principal raw material of our EAF steel operations is recycled ferrous scrap derived from,\namong other sources, ‘‘home scrap,’’generated internally at steel mills themselves, industrial scrap, generated\nas a by-product of manufacturing, obsolete scrap, recycled from end-of-life automobiles, appliances and\nmachinery, and demolition scrap, recycled from obsolete structures, containers and machines. The prices for\nscrap are subject to market forces largely beyond our control, including demand by United States and foreign\nsteel producers, freight costs and speculation. The scrap metal recycling industry has historically been, and is\nexpected to remain, highly cyclical and the prices for scrap have varied significantly in the past, may vary\nsignificantly in the future and do not necessarily fluctuate in tandem with the price of steel. Moreover, some\nof our integrated steel producer competitors are not as dependent as we are on ferrous scrap as a part of their\nraw material melt mix, which, during periods of high scrap costs relative to the cost of blast furnace iron used\nby the integrated producers, give them a raw material cost advantage over EAF mills. However, given\nenvironmental considerations of investors, customers and regulators, additional EAF mills may be constructed,\nor companies currently operating blast furnace mills may invest in EAF mills, leading to increased demand in\nferrous scrap possibly resulting in higher scrap prices. While our vertical integration into the metals recycling\nbusiness and our liquid pig-iron operations are expected to enable us to continue being a cost-effective\nsupplier to our own steelmaking operations, for some of our metallics requirements, we still rely on other\nmetallics and raw material suppliers, as well as upon general industry supply conditions for the balance of our\nneeds.\nThe availability and prices of raw materials and supplies, particularly those with positive environmental\nattributes, may also be negatively affected by new, existing or changing laws, regulations, sanctions or\nembargoes, including those that may impose output limitations or higher costs associated with climate change\nor GHG allocation by suppliers, interruptions in production, accidents or natural disasters, changes in\nexchange rates, global price fluctuations, the availability and cost of transportation, and competing uses, all of\nwhich may be heighted during times of war or hostilities.As a major producer of galvanized steel products,\nwe purchase and consume a large amount of zinc, which if purchased at high prices, may adversely affect our\nprofit margins.Any inability to secure a consistent, cost-effective and timely supply of our raw materials and\nsupplies may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, our inability to pass on all or a substantial part of any cost increases, whether due to\npositive environmental attributes, inflation, supply and demand imbalances, or otherwise, or to provide for our\ncustomers’needs because of the potential unavailability of raw materials, supplies or required environmental\nattributes, may result in production slowdowns or curtailments or may otherwise adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBroadridgeFinancialSolutions,Inc.•Tel:(631)254-7494 Operator:kaplowitzk Date:March 21, 2024Time:19:33:0\n@edipvwctxa217/PRODUCTION_Jobs/CLS_Funds/GRP_Steel_Dynamics/JOB_ny20020056x1_print/DIV_102-part1 Page25of34 Session:56\n25\nThe cost and availability of electricity, natural gas, oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile\nmarket conditions.\nWe consume large amounts of energy to melt scrap, reheat semi-finished products for rolling into\nfinished products and perform other steps necessary to our production process. We rely on third parties for the\nsupply of energy resources we require in our production activities. The prices for and availability of\nelectricity, natural gas, oil and other energy resources, including renewable or other clean energy sources, are\nsubject to regulation and volatile market conditions, often affected by weather conditions as well as political,\nenvironmental and economic factors beyond our control.As large consumers of electricity and natural gas, we\nmust have dependable delivery in order to operate.Accordingly, we are at risk in the event of an energy\ndisruption, including power outages, power unavailability or inability to obtain power at a reasonable price or\nwith sufficient desired environmental attributes. Prolonged blackouts, curtailments or disruptions caused by\nnatural disasters or by political or environmental considerations would substantially disrupt our production.\nSince a significant portion of our finished products are delivered by truck, unforeseen fluctuations in the price\nof fuel would also adversely affect our costs or the costs of many of our customers.\nIncreased environmental, GHG emissions and sustainability considerations from our customers or related\nregulations could affect demand for our products and add significant costs.\nCustomers, investors and regulators have increased their focus on the environment, GHG emissions and\nsustainability. We are committed to the environment and sustainability. We are taking further action to reduce\nour environmental footprint through our 2025, 2030, and 2050 goals for GHG emission reduction and\nincreased renewable energy usage. We believe that achievement of these goals will comport with expectations\nof our customers and investors, but certain customers and investors may have differing requirements. To\nachieve these goals, our operational costs may increase and we have had and will continue to have additional\ncapital expenditures, some of which we may not be able to pass along to our customers.Any failure to timely\nmeet these goals, or other requirements of customers or investors, may have an adverse effect on our business,\nresults of operations and stock price.\nAdditionally, governmental agencies, regulators, investors or other groups have introduced, and may\nrequest or require, environmental monitoring, disclosures or regulations in response to the potential impacts of\nclimate change. International treaties or agreements may also result in increasing regulation of GHG\nemissions, including the introduction of carbon emissions limitations or trading mechanisms.Any such\nregulation or disclosure requirement could impose significant costs on our operations and on the operations of\nour customers and suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, emissions controls, environmental\nmonitoring and reporting and other costs in order to comply with current or future laws, regulations or\ndemands concerning the environment, climate change, GHG emissions and sustainability.Any adopted\nregulations could negatively impact our ability, and that of our customers and suppliers, to compete with\ncompanies situated in areas not subject to or not complying with such regulations, or could affect our\nenvironmental disclosures for any allowances, offsets or credits. We may see an increase in costs relating to\nour assets that emit GHGs as a result of these initiatives, which may impact our operations directly or through\nour customers and suppliers.\nCompliance with and changes in environmental and remediation requirements may result in substantially\nincreased capital requirements and operating costs.\nExisting laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or as may be interpreted in the future, as well as\nfuture laws or regulations, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to numerous local, state, federal and international statutory and regulatory environmental\nrequirements relating to, among other things:\n• the generation, storage, treatment, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and secondary\nmaterials;\n• the discharge of materials into the air, including periodic changes to the NationalAmbientAir\nQuality Standards and to emission standards;\n• the management, treatment and discharge of wastewater and storm water;\n2023AnnualReport\nBroadridgeFinancialSolutions,Inc.•Tel:(631)254-7494 Operator:kaplowitzk Date:March 21, 2024Time:19:33:1\n@edipvwctxa217/PRODUCTION_Jobs/CLS_Funds/GRP_Steel_Dynamics/JOB_ny20020056x1_print/DIV_102-part1 Page26of34 Session:56\n26\n• the use and treatment of groundwater;\n• the remediation of soil and groundwater contamination;\n• climate change legislation or regulation;\n• the need for and the ability to timely obtain air, water or other environmental permits;\n• the timely reporting of certain chemical usage, content, storage and releases;\n• the remediation and reclamation of land used in our operations;\n• natural resource protections; and\n• the protection of our employees’health and safety.\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations, which affect our EAF steelmaking, metals\nrecycling, liquid pig-iron, and copper and aluminum production operations, is a significant factor in our\nbusiness. We are required to obtain and comply with environmental permits and licenses, and failure to obtain\nor renew or the violation of any permit or license may result in substantial fines and penalties, capital\nexpenditures, operational changes, suspension of operations and/or the closure of a subject facility. Similarly,\ndelays, increased costs and/or the imposition of onerous conditions to the securing or renewal of permits may\nadversely affect these operations.\nUncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels, testing and sampling procedures, and new\npollution control technology are factors that may increase our future compliance expenditures. We are unable\nto predict the ultimate cost of future compliance with environmental requirements or their effect on our\noperations.Although we strive to be in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, legal\nrequirements frequently change and are subject to interpretation such that regulatory agencies may bring\nenforcement actions for alleged noncompliance. Private parties might also bring claims against us under\ncitizen suit provisions and/or for property damage or personal injury allegedly resulting from our operations.\nNew laws, regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities, together with uncertainty\nregarding the application of existing requirements, are among the factors that may increase our future\nexpenditures to comply with environmental requirements. The cost of complying with existing laws or\nregulations as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, or with future laws or regulations, may\nadversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations produce significant amounts of by-products, some of which are handled as solid or\nhazardous waste or as hazardous secondary materials. For example, our steel mills generate EAF dust, which\nthe United States Environmental ProtectionAgency (United States EPA) and other regulatory authorities\nclassify as hazardous waste and regulate accordingly unless recycled in an exempt manner.\nIn addition, the feed materials for the shredders operated by our metals recycling operations include\nautomobile bodies.Aportion of the feed materials consist of currently unrecyclable material known as\nshredder residue. If laws or regulations or the interpretation of the laws or regulations change with regard to\nEAF dust or shredder residue or other by-products created by our operations, we may incur significant\nadditional expenditures.\nFederal and state environmental laws enable federal and state agencies and certain private parties to\nrecover from owners, operators, generators and transporters the cost of investigation and cleanup of sites at\nwhich wastes or hazardous substances were disposed and/or migrated. In connection with these laws, we may\nbe required to clean up contamination discovered at our sites including contamination that may have been\ncaused by former owners or operators of the sites, to conduct additional cleanup at sites that have already had\nsome cleanup performed, to address emerging and newly-regulated contaminants such as per- and\npolyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and 1,4-dioxane, and/or to perform cleanup with regard to sites formerly\nused in connection with our operations.\nIn addition, we may be required to pay for, or to pay a portion of, the costs of cleanup at sites to which\nwe sent materials for disposal or recycling, notwithstanding that the original disposal or recycling activity may\nhave complied with all regulatory requirements then in effect. Under certain laws, a party can be held jointly\nBroadridgeFinancialSolutions,Inc.•Tel:(631)254-7494 Operator:kaplowitzk Date:March 21, 2024Time:19:33:1\n@edipvwctxa217/PRODUCTION_Jobs/CLS_Funds/GRP_Steel_Dynamics/JOB_ny20020056x1_print/DIV_102-part1 Page27of34 Session:56\n27\nand severally liable for all of the cleanup costs associated with a disposal site. In practice, a liable party often\nsplits the costs of cleanup with other potentially responsible parties. We have received notices from the United\nStates EPA, state agencies and third parties that we have been identified as potentially responsible for the\ncosts of investigating and cleaning up a number of disposal sites. In most cases, many other parties are also\nnamed as potentially responsible parties and also contribute to payment of those costs.\nBecause cleanup liability can in some cases be imposed retroactively on activities that occurred many\nyears ago, and because federal and state agencies are still discovering sites that pose a threat to public health\nor the environment, we can provide no assurance that we will not become liable for significant costs\nassociated with investigation and remediation of cleanup sites.\nOperational and Commercial Risks Related to our Business\nWe may face significant price and other forms of competition from other steel and aluminum producers,\nscrap processors and alternative materials, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations and cash flows.\nThe global markets in which steel companies and scrap processors conduct business are highly\ncompetitive and became even more so due to consolidations in the steel and scrap industries.Additionally, in\nmany applications, steel competes with other materials, such as aluminum, cement, composites, plastics,\ncarbon fiber, glass and wood. Increased use of alternative materials for any reason, including as a response to\nregulations or customer demands, could decrease demand for steel or force other steel producers into new\nproducts or markets that compete more directly with us, and combined with increased competition could cause\nus to lose market share, increase expenditures or reduce pricing, any one of which may adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, during 2022 we announced our planned project to construct and operate a recycled\naluminum flat rolled products mill with an anticipated annual production capacity of 650,000 tonnes of\nfinished products to be located in Columbus, Mississippi, with two supporting satellite recycling aluminum\nslab centers.Although we anticipate being able to effectively compete in the aluminum industry, along with\nthe other risks described herein, we may face unexpected and enhanced competition, which may adversely\naffect the expected contributions of our aluminum operations and our resulting business, financial condition,\nresults of operations and cash flows.\nAvailability of an adequate source of supply of scrap is required for our metals recycling operations.\nWe procure our scrap inventory from numerous sources. These suppliers generally are not bound by\nlong-term contracts and generally have no obligation to sell recyclable metal to us. In periods of low industry\nscrap prices, scrap suppliers may elect to hold recyclable metal to wait for higher prices or intentionally slow\ntheir metal collection activities. If a substantial number of scrap suppliers cease selling recyclable metal to us,\nwe may be unable to recycle metal at desired levels which may adversely affect our results of operations and\nfinancial condition. In addition, a slowdown of industrial production in the United States reduces the supply of\nindustrial grades of metal to the metals recycling industry, resulting in our having less recyclable metal\navailable to process and sell. Further, additional EAF steel mill construction or blast furnace mills investing in\nEAF mills could increase the demand for scrap, potentially resulting in higher scrap prices or periods of\ndecreased scrap supply.Any inability to secure scrap for our EAF steel mills could adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to cybersecurity threats and may face risks to the security of our sensitive data and\ninformation technology which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition\nand cash flows.\nIncreased cybersecurity and information technology security requirements, vulnerabilities and threats and\na rise in sophisticated and targeted cybercrime, all of which may be heightened during times of war or\nhostilities, pose a risk to the security and functionality of our systems and information networks, and to the\nconfidentiality, availability and integrity of sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary\ninformation, financial information, customer and supplier information, and personally identifiable information.\nAdditionally, cybersecurity vulnerabilities or attacks could result in an interruption of the functionality of our\n2023AnnualReport\nBroadridgeFinancialSolutions,Inc.•Tel:(631)254-7494 Operator:kaplowitzk Date:March 21, 2024Time:19:33:1\n@edipvwctxa217/PRODUCTION_Jobs/CLS_Funds/GRP_Steel_Dynamics/JOB_ny20020056x1_print/DIV_102-part1 Page28of34 Session:56\n28\nautomated and electronically controlled manufacturing operating systems, which, if compromised, could cease,\nthreaten, delay or slow down our ability to melt, roll or otherwise process steel or any of our other products\nfor the duration of such interruption. Our customers and suppliers may also store certain of our sensitive\ninformation on their information technology systems, which if breached or attacked, could likewise expose our\nsensitive information. Similarly, information system vendors and software suppliers may experience a\ncybersecurity or information technology breach that exposes our systems or sensitive data.Any of these\ncybersecurity and information technology breaches or disruptions may result in reputational harm and may\nadversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAlthough we believe we have adopted procedures, training programs, and controls to adequately protect\nour sensitive data, networks and information and operating technology and systems, there can be no assurance\nthat a system or network failure, or cybersecurity breach or attack, will be prevented, whether due to attacks\nby cyber criminals or due to employee, contractor or other error or malfeasance. This could lead to system\ninterruption, production delays or downtimes and operational disruptions, and the disclosure, modification or\ndestruction of sensitive data, which may adversely affect our reputation, customer and supplier relationships,\nfinancial results and results of operations, and could result in litigation or regulatory investigations, actions,\nfines or penalties, as well as increased cybersecurity monitoring and protection costs, including the cost or\navailability of insurance.Additionally, as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve and become more\nsophisticated, we may need to invest additional time, resources and finances to protect the security of our\nsensitive data, systems and information networks. We maintain an information security risk insurance policy to\nmitigate the impact of cybersecurity threats.\nWe may face risks associated with the implementation of our growth strategy.\nOur growth strategy subjects us to various risks.As part of our growth strategy, we may expand existing\nfacilities, enter into new business lines, products or process initiatives, acquire or build additional plants,\nacquire other businesses and assets, enter into joint ventures, or form strategic alliances that we believe will\ncomplement our existing business. These expansions and transactions, including our planned recycled\naluminum flat rolled products mill with an anticipated annual production capacity of 650,000 tonnes of\nfinished products to be located in Columbus, Mississippi, may involve some or all of the following risks:\n• the risk of entering business lines or product, domestic, or foreign markets, in which we have little\nexperience, including the aluminum industry;\n• the risk of a newly constructed facility being completed over budget or not on time, including due to\nequipment delays or labor shortages;\n• the risk of not being able to adequately obtain sufficient labor to efficiently build or staff a new\nfacility, while maintaining our culture;\n• the risk of expected markets, products, customers and demand for products produced by a new\nfacility being lower than expected;\n• the risk of new product development, technology development or customer acquisition and\npenetration being more costly or difficult than expected;\n• the difficulty of competing for acquisitions and other growth opportunities with companies having\nmaterially greater financial resources than us;\n• the inability to realize anticipated synergies or other expected benefits;\n• the difficulty of integrating new or acquired operations and personnel into our existing operations,\nwhile maintaining our culture;\n• the potential disruption of ongoing operations;\n• the diversion of financial resources or management attention to new operations or acquired\nbusinesses;\n• the loss of key employees, customers or suppliers of acquired businesses;\nBroadridgeFinancialSolutions,Inc.•Tel:(631)254-7494 Operator:kaplowitzk Date:March 21, 2024Time:19:33:1\n@edipvwctxa217/PRODUCTION_Jobs/CLS_Funds/GRP_Steel_Dynamics/JOB_ny20020056x1_print/DIV_102-part1 Page29of34 Session:56\n29\n• the potential exposure to unknown liabilities;\n• the inability of management to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n• the difficulty of managing the growth of a larger company;\n• the risk of becoming involved in labor, commercial, or regulatory disputes or litigation related to\nnew operations or acquired businesses;\n• the risk of becoming more highly leveraged;\n• the risk of contractual or operational liability to other venture participants or to third parties as a\nresult of our participation;\n• the inability to work efficiently with joint venture or strategic alliance partners; and\n• the difficulties of terminating joint ventures or strategic alliances.\nDelays in achieving full operational capacity at our Sinton Flat Roll Division has and may continue to,\nand any delays in our announced planned recycled aluminum flat rolled products mill may, adversely affect\nour prospects, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThese expansions or transactions might be required for us to remain competitive, but we may not be able\nto complete any such expansions or transactions on favorable terms or obtain financing, if necessary.

These risks include, among other things:\noperational risks, intellectual property theft, fraud, extortion, harm to team members or customers and\nviolations of data privacy or security laws.\nOur Director of Information Security has twenty years of cybersecurity experience, has completed a\nMasters in Homeland Security, with an emphasis on cybersecurity, and holds several cybersecurity\ncertifications. Our Director of Information Security is responsible for leading the Information Security Team\nwhich has established a cybersecurity risk management program of policies and processes for assessing,\nidentifying, and managing risk from cybersecurity threats. We have integrated these processes into our overall\nrisk management systems and processes, and routinely assess risks from cybersecurity threats, including any\npotential unauthorized access to or activity conducted through our information systems that may result in\nmaterial adverse effects on the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our information systems or any\ninformation residing therein. This program includes established reasonable safeguards to minimize the\nidentified risks; processes to reasonably address any identified gaps in existing safeguards; updates to existing\nsafeguards as necessary; and monitoring the effectiveness of those safeguards.\nOur safeguards include continuous network monitoring, complex passwords, team member training that\nreinforces our policies, standards and practices, incident response capability reviews and exercises, and\ncybersecurity insurance and disaster recovery plans for the protection of our assets. The information security\ntraining and awareness program engages personnel through training modules on how to identify potential\ncybersecurity risks and protect the Company’s resources and information. This training is mandatory for all\nteam members monthly, and is supplemented by companywide testing initiatives, including periodic phishing\ntests.\nOur cybersecurity risk management program also assesses third party providers, such as vendors,\nsuppliers, and other business partners. Cybersecurity risks are evaluated when determining the selection and\noversight of applicable third party providers and potential risks when handling and/or processing our\nemployee, business or customer data.\nFurther, we have designated a member of our senior leadership team, our Chief Financial Officer, to\noversee the management of the safeguards, cybersecurity risk assessment and mitigation process. From time to\ntime, the Company’s program is reviewed and validated by internal and external experts.\nIn general, our incident response process follows the NIST framework and focuses on four phases:\n(i) preparation; (ii) detection and analysis; (iii) containment, eradication, and recovery; and (iv) post-incident\nremediation.As cybersecurity incidents occur, including at third party providers, the Director of Information\nSecurity leads the Information Security Team through a standardized incident response process that focuses on\nresponding to and containing the threat, minimizing any business impact, and evaluating its severity level. The\nseverity level assessment determines how widespread the incident is and to what degree it could impact our\noverall business and manufacturing environment. In the event an incident is determined by the Information\nSecurity Team to be a high severity level, our cross functional team, with expertise in various disciplines, will\nassess the incident to determine if it has had a material affect or is reasonably likely of having a material\neffect on the Company’s business strategy, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe do not believe that risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous\ncybersecurity incidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our overall\nbusiness strategy, results of operations, or financial condition over the long term. In the last three years, the\nCompany has not experienced any material cybersecurity incidents and we have not incurred material\nexpenses from cybersecurity incidents (including penalties and settlements, of which there were none). For\nadditional discussion of whether and how risks from cybersecurity threats could materially affect or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect the Company, see Item 1A.

These\nreports are available publicly on the Securities and Exchange Commission website, www.sec.gov, and on our\nwebsite, www.steeldynamics.com under ‘‘Investors – SEC Filings.’’\nOperating Statement Classifications\nNet Sales. Net sales from our operations are a factor of volumes shipped, product mix and related\npricing. We charge premium prices for certain grades of steel, product dimensions, certain smaller volumes,\nand for value-added processing or coating of our steel products. Except for the steel fabrication operations, we\nrecognize revenues from sales and the allowance for estimated returns and claims from these sales at the point\nin time control of the product transfers to the customer, upon shipment or delivery. Our steel fabrication\noperations recognize revenues over time based on completed fabricated tons to date as a percentage of total\ntons required for each contract.\nCosts of Goods Sold. Our costs of goods sold represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the\nmanufacture of our products. The principal elements of these costs are scrap and scrap substitutes (which\nrepresent the most significant single component of our consolidated costs of goods sold), steel substrate, direct\nand indirect labor and related benefits, alloys, zinc, transportation and freight, repairs and maintenance,\nutilities such as electricity and natural gas, and depreciation.\nBroadridgeFinancialSolutions,Inc.•Tel:(631)254-7494 Operator:kaplowitzk Date:March 21, 2024Time:19:33:2\n@edipvwctxa217/PRODUCTION_Jobs/CLS_Funds/GRP_Steel_Dynamics/JOB_ny20020056x1_print/DIV_103-part2 Page5of15 Session:54\n39\nSelling, General andAdministrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of all\ncosts associated with our sales, finance and accounting, and administrative departments, including, among\nother items, labor and related benefits, and professional services.\nCompanywide profit sharing and amortization of intangible assets are each separately presented in the\nstatement of income.\nInterest Expense, net of Capitalized Interest. Interest expense consists of interest associated with our\nsenior credit facilities and other debt, net of interest costs that are required to be capitalized during the\nconstruction period of certain capital investment projects.\nOther (Income) Expense, net. Other income consists of interest income earned on our temporary cash\ndeposits, short-term and other investments, and any other non-operating income activity, including income\nfrom investments in unconsolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method. Other expense consists\nof any non-operating costs, such as certain acquisition and financing expenses.\n2023 Overview\nDuring 2023, underlying domestic steel demand was firm, supported by the construction, automotive, and\nenergy sectors. Customer steel inventories also remained below historical averages, in combination resulting in\ngenerally steady order patterns. This solid market environment, coupled with the continued ramp-up of Sinton,\ndrove record annual shipments of 12.8 million tons for our steel operations. Despite a challenging pricing\nenvironment throughout much of the year, our metals recycling teams meaningfully increased volume during\n2023 compared to 2022. Our steel fabrication business achieved its second highest annual earnings during\n2023, on continued solid non-residential construction demand. Our consolidated net sales of $18.8 billion and\ncash flow from operations of $3.5 billion were our second-best and our consolidated operating income of\n$3.2 billion was our third-best performance in company history. Metal spread compression among each of our\noperating segments resulted in significantly lower operating income in 2023 compared to our record\n2022 earnings despite continued strong market demand and volumes.\nConsolidated operating income for 2023 decreased $1.9 billion, or 38%, to $3.2 billion, compared to a\nrecord $5.1 billion in 2022. Net income attributable to Steel Dynamics, Inc. for 2023 decreased $1.4 billion,\nor 37%, to $2.5 billion, compared to a record in 2022. Diluted earnings per share attributable to Steel\nDynamics, Inc. was $14.64 for 2023, compared to $20.92 for 2022.\nEffective the fourth quarter 2023, the company changed its reportable segments, consistent with how it\ncurrently manages the business, representing four reporting segments: steel operations (now including\nwarehouse operations previously included in Other), metals recycling operations, steel fabrication operations,\nand a new reportable segment, aluminum operations. Segment information provided within this Form 10-K\nhas been recast for all prior periods consistent with the current reportable segment presentation.Aluminum\nOperations includes the results of the recycled aluminum flat rolled products mill in Columbus, Mississippi,\nand two satellite recycled aluminum slab centers located inArizona and Mexico, all of which are currently\nbeing constructed. The results of this segment currently consist of construction and start-up costs recorded in\nselling, general and administrative expenses, included within the discussion of consolidated results within the\nOther Operations section below. During 2023, there were no additional results of operations, such as those\nrelated to shipments or production, to be discussed. Operations are expected to begin in 2025.\nRefer to Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations in Part II of ourAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, for\nadditional information regarding results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to\nthe year ended December 31, 2021, and segment operating results for 2022 as compared to 2021.

Customer order activity and steel demand were strong during 2023, with\nthe construction, automotive, industrial, and energy sectors continuing to lead demand. In spite of strong\nmarket demand, average selling prices were lower during 2023 compared to 2022, as total steel segment\naverage selling prices decreased 18%, or $249 per ton, compared to 2022. Sheet steel pricing was 22% lower,\nwhile long products pricing decreased 6%. Net sales for the steel operations segment were 13% lower in\n2023 when compared to historically high prices in 2022, due to lower average steel selling prices more than\noffsetting record volumes.\n2023AnnualReport\nBroadridgeFinancialSolutions,Inc.•Tel:(631)254-7494 Operator:kaplowitzk Date:March 21, 2024Time:19:33:2\n@edipvwctxa217/PRODUCTION_Jobs/CLS_Funds/GRP_Steel_Dynamics/JOB_ny20020056x1_print/DIV_103-part2 Page8of15 Session:54\n42\nMetallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our single most significant steel\nmanufacturing cost, generally comprising approximately 55% to 65% of our steel mill operations’\nmanufacturing costs. Our metallic raw material cost consumed in our steel mills decreased $61 per net ton, or\n13%, in 2023 compared to 2022, consistent with overall decreased domestic scrap pricing noted below in the\nmetals recycling operations segment discussion.\nAs a result of average selling prices decreasing more than scrap costs, specifically for sheet steel\nproducts, metal spread (which we define as the difference between average steel mill selling prices and the\ncost of ferrous scrap consumed in our steel mills) decreased 20% in 2023 compared to 2022. Due to this\nmetal spread compression, operating income for the steel operations decreased 39%, to $1.9 billion, in\n2023 compared to 2022.\nMetals Recycling Operations Segment\nMetals recycling operations includes both ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal processing, transportation,\nmarketing, brokerage, and scrap management services. Our steel mills utilize a large portion of the ferrous\nscrap sold by our metals recycling operations as raw material in our steelmaking operations, and the\nremainder is sold to other consumers, such as other steel manufacturers and foundries. In 2023 and 2022,\n62% and 66%, respectively, of metals recycling operations ferrous scrap was sold to our own steel mills,\nwhile our steel mill utilization was 82% and 77% including Sinton (91% and 92% exclusive of Sinton) in\n2023 and 2022, respectively. Metals recycling operations accounted for 12% and 10% of our consolidated net\nsales during 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nMetals Recycling Operations Shipments:\nYearsEndedDecember31,\n2023 %Change 2022\nFerrous metal (gross tons)\nTotal . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5,779,114 9% 5,301,774\nInter-company. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The continued\nonshoring of manufacturing, coupled with the robust U.S. infrastructure and Inflation ReductionAct programs\nand industrial construction, supports consistent strong demand. Net sales for the steel fabrication operations\ndecreased 34% during 2023 compared to the record levels during 2022, as average selling prices decreased\n$740 per ton, or 15%, and volumes decreased 23% from the record volume during 2022.\nThe purchase of various steel products is the largest single cost of production for our steel fabrication\noperations, historically representing approximately two-thirds of the total cost of manufacturing. The average\ncost of steel consumed decreased 26% in 2023, as compared to 2022. Due to decreased selling prices per ton\nmore than offsetting decreased steel input costs per ton, metal spread (which we define as the difference\nbetween average selling prices and the cost of purchased steel) contracted 10% in 2023 compared to 2022.\nMetal spread compression coupled with decreased volume resulted in operating income decreasing 34% to\n$1.6 billion in 2023, compared to $2.4 billion in 2022.\nOther Operations\nConsolidated Results 2023 vs. 2022\nSelling, General andAdministrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses of\n$588.6 million during 2023 increased 8% from $545.6 million during 2022 primarily due to a 10% increase in\npayroll and benefits expense related to the execution of our growth strategy during 2023, including\nconstruction and start-up costs of ourAluminum Operations.

Refer to Note 11. Retirement Plans to the consolidated\nfinancial statements elsewhere in this report for further information.\nInterest Expense, net of Capitalized Interest. During 2023, interest expense of $76.5 million decreased\n16% from $91.5 million during 2022, due to higher capitalized interest in 2023 ($33.0 million, compared to\n$15.8 million in 2022) related to our ongoing expansion projects, most notably withinAluminum Operations.\nOther (Income) Expense, net. Net other income was $144.2 million in 2023, compared to $20.8 million\nin 2022, due primarily to an increase in interest income of $88.2 million associated with an increase in\ninvested balances and an increase in yield earned on our invested cash and short-term investments in 2023.\nIncome Tax Expense. During 2023, income tax expense of $751.6 million, at an effective income tax\nrate of 23.3%, decreased 34% compared to the $1.1 billion, at an effective income tax rate of 22.7%, during\n2022, consistent with decreased pretax earnings. Refer to Note 4. Income Taxes to the consolidated financial\nstatements elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nIncluded in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2023, are potential benefits of\n$27.8 million that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. We recognize interest and penalties\nrelated to our tax contingencies on a net-of-tax basis in income tax expense. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, we recognized expense from the increase of interest expense and penalties of\n$1.6 million, net of tax. In addition to the unrecognized tax benefits noted above, we had $3.2 million accrued\nfor the payment of interest and penalties at December 31, 2023.\nWe file income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction as well as income tax returns in\nvarious state jurisdictions. The tax years 2020 through 2022 remain open to examination by the Internal\nRevenue Service and various state and local jurisdictions.At this time, we do not believe there will be any\nsignificant examination adjustments that would result in a material change to our financial position, results of\noperations or cash flows. It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could change\nin the next twelve months in an amount ranging from zero to $10.0 million, as a result of the expiration of the\nstatute of limitations and other federal and state income tax audits.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCapital Resources and Long-term Debt. Our business is capital intensive and requires substantial\nexpenditures for, among other things, the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our operations, and\nto remain in compliance with environmental laws. Our short-term and long-term liquidity needs arise\nprimarily from working capital requirements, capital expenditures, including expansion projects, principal and\ninterest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness, dividends to our shareholders, and potential stock\nrepurchases and acquisitions or investments. We have met and intend to continue to meet these liquidity\nrequirements primarily with available cash and cash provided by operations, long-term borrowings, and we\nalso have availability under our unsecured Revolver. Our liquidity at December 31, 2023, is as follows\n(in thousands):\nCash and equivalents. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $1,400,887\nShort-term and other investments . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 951,873\nUnsecured revolver availability. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,190,873\nTotal liquidity. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $3,543,633\nOur total outstanding debt of $3.1 billion is consistent with our total outstanding debt at December 31,\n2022. Our total long-term debt to capitalization ratio (representing our long-term debt, including current\nmaturities, divided by the sum of our long-term debt, redeemable noncontrolling interests, and our total\nstockholders’equity) was 25.8% and 27.7% at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nIn the third quarter of 2023, we entered into a new unsecured credit agreement, replacing the previous\none, which has a senior unsecured revolving credit facility (Facility), which provides a $1.2 billion Revolver\nand matures in July 2028. Subject to certain conditions, we have the ability to increase the Facility size by\n$500.0 million. The unsecured Revolver is available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and other\nBroadridgeFinancialSolutions,Inc.•Tel:(631)254-7494 Operator:kaplowitzk Date:March 21, 2024Time:19:33:2\n@edipvwctxa217/PRODUCTION_Jobs/CLS_Funds/GRP_Steel_Dynamics/JOB_ny20020056x1_print/DIV_103-part2 Page11of15 Session:54\n45\ngeneral corporate purposes. The Facility contains financial covenants and other covenants pertaining to our\nability to incur indebtedness and permit liens on certain assets. Our ability to borrow funds within the terms\nof the unsecured Revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial and other\ncovenants.At December 31, 2023, we had $1.2 billion of availability on the Revolver, $9.1 million of\noutstanding letters of credit and other obligations which reduce availability, and there were no borrowings\noutstanding.\nThe financial covenants under our Facility state that we must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not\nless than 2.50:1.00. Our interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing our last-twelve-months (LTM)\nconsolidatedAdjusted EBITDAas defined in the Facility (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation,\namortization, and certain other non-cash transactions as defined in the Facility) by our LTM gross interest\nexpense, less amortization of financing fees. In addition, a debt to capitalization ratio of not more than\n0.60:1.00 must be maintained.At December 31, 2023, our interest coverage ratio and debt to capitalization\nratio were 36.13:1.00 and 0.26:1.00, respectively. We were, therefore, in compliance with these covenants at\nDecember 31, 2023, and we anticipate we will continue to be in compliance during the next twelve months.\nWorking Capital (representing excess of current assets over current liabilities). We generated cash flow\nfrom operations of $3.5 billion in 2023 compared to $4.5 billion in 2022. Working capital decreased\n$1.2 billion, or 21%, during 2023 to $4.5 billion at December 31, 2023, due primarily to our accounts\nreceivable and inventories decreasing $683.1 million, or 13%, compared to December 31, 2022, due to lower\nsales and inventory values in 2023. In addition, our $400 million 2.800% senior notes were recorded as\ncurrent at December 31, 2023.\nCapital Investments. During 2023, we invested $1.7 billion in property, plant and equipment, primarily\nwithin our aluminum operations and steel operations segments, compared with $908.9 million invested during\n2022. We are currently executing our plan to invest $2.7 billion in a new state-of-the-art low-carbon recycled\naluminum flat rolled products mill with two supporting satellite recycled aluminum slab centers, which is\nplanned to be funded by available cash and cash flow from operations. Related expenditures began in the third\nquarter of 2022 and are expected to continue through early 2025. Our liquidity of $3.5 billion and anticipated\nfuture operating cash flow generation is sufficient to provide for our planned 2024 capital requirements.\nCash Dividends.As a reflection of continued confidence in our current and future cash flow generation\ncapability and financial position, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 25% to $0.425 per share in the\nfirst quarter of 2023, and continued at that level through the remainder of 2023 (from $0.34 per share in\n2022), resulting in declared cash dividends of $280.5 million during 2023, compared to $245.3 million during\n2022. We paid cash dividends of $271.3 million and $237.2 million during 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our\nboard of directors, along with executive management, approves the payment of dividends on a quarterly basis.\nThe determination to pay cash dividends in the future is at the discretion of our board of directors, after\ntaking into account various factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, outstanding\nindebtedness, current and anticipated cash needs and growth plans.\nOther. Our board of directors has authorized share repurchase programs during prior years, the most\nrecent of which occurred in November 2023 for a program of up to $1.5 billion of the company’s common\nstock. Under the share repurchase programs, purchases take place as and when we determine in open market\nor private transactions made based upon the market price of our common stock, the nature of other investment\nopportunities or growth projects, our cash flows from operations, and general economic conditions. The share\nrepurchase programs do not require us to acquire any specific number of shares, and may be modified,\nsuspended, extended, or terminated by us at any time. The share repurchase programs do not have an\nexpiration date. There were $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion of share repurchases during 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.As of December 31, 2023, we had $1.4 billion remaining available to purchase under the\nNovember 2023 share repurchase program. See Part II, Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity,\nRelated Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for additional information.\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future\nperformance which, in turn, will depend upon general economic, financial, and business conditions, along with\ncompetition, legislation and regulatory factors that are largely beyond our control. In addition, we cannot\nassure that our operating results, cash flows, access to credit markets and capital resources will be sufficient\n2023AnnualReport\nBroadridgeFinancialSolutions,Inc.•Tel:(631)254-7494 Operator:kaplowitzk Date:March 21, 2024Time:19:33:3\n@edipvwctxa217/PRODUCTION_Jobs/CLS_Funds/GRP_Steel_Dynamics/JOB_ny20020056x1_print/DIV_103-part2 Page12of15 Session:54\n46\nfor repayment of our indebtedness in the future. We believe that based upon current levels of operations and\nanticipated growth, cash flows from operations, together with other available sources of funds, including\nborrowings under our Facility, if necessary, will be adequate for the next twelve months for making required\npayments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, funding working capital requirements, and funding\nanticipated capital expenditures.\nContractual Obligations and Other Long-Term Liabilities\nWe have the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations, including purchase\nobligations, as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission.A‘‘purchase obligation’’is defined as an\nagreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all\nsignificant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price\nprovisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.\nLong-term debt and estimated interest. Refer to Note 3. Long-Term Debt to the consolidated financial\nstatements elsewhere in this report for our long-term debt maturities. Estimated interest payments on our\nsenior unsecured notes were determined based on their outstanding balances through maturity at their\ncontractual interest rates, as detailed in Note 3. Estimated interest payments also include a 0.15% commitment\nfee on our available Revolver, and an average interest rate of 7.0% on our other debt of $61.8 million. Our\nestimated interest payments are $102.2 million, $80.1 million, $74.9 million, $54.5 million, $50.0 million, for\nthe years 2024 through 2028, respectively, and $343.2 million thereafter.\nPurchase obligations.

We have entered into operating leases relating principally to transportation and other\nequipment, and some real estate. Refer to Note 12. Leases to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere\nin this report for this information.\nUnrecognized tax benefits. We expect to make cash outlays in the future related to our unrecognized tax\nbenefits; however, due to the uncertainty of the timing, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates\nregarding the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Refer to Note 4. Income Taxes\nto the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for this information.\nOther Matters\nEnvironmental and Other Contingencies\nWe have incurred, and in the future will continue to incur, capital expenditures and operating expenses\nfor matters relating to environmental control, remediation, monitoring and compliance. During 2023, we\nincurred costs related to the monitoring and compliance of environmental matters in the amount of\napproximately $54.6 million and capital expenditures related to environmental compliance of approximately\n$5.4 million. Of the costs incurred during 2023 for monitoring and compliance, approximately 71% were\nrelated to the normal transportation of certain types of by-products produced in our steelmaking processes and\nother facilities, in accordance with legal requirements. We incurred combined environmental remediation costs\nof approximately $3.1 million at all of our facilities during 2023. We have an accrual of $6.6 million recorded\nfor environmental remediation related to our metals recycling operations, and $2.6 million related to our idled\nMinnesota ironmaking operations. We believe, apart from our dependence on environmental construction and\noperating permits for our existing and any future manufacturing facilities, that compliance with current\nenvironmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition,\nBroadridgeFinancialSolutions,Inc.•Tel:(631)254-7494 Operator:kaplowitzk Date:March 21, 2024Time:19:33:3\n@edipvwctxa217/PRODUCTION_Jobs/CLS_Funds/GRP_Steel_Dynamics/JOB_ny20020056x1_print/DIV_103-part2 Page13of15 Session:54\n47\nresults of operations or liquidity. However, environmental laws and regulations evolve and change, and we\nmay become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future, such as the impact of\nvarious governmental legislatures and agencies introducing regulatory changes in response to the potential of\nclimate change.\nCriticalAccounting Estimates\nManagement’s Discussion andAnalysis of Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based\nupon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States. We review the accounting estimates we use in reporting our\nfinancial results on a regular basis. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates\nand judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related\ndisclosure of contingent liabilities. We evaluate the appropriateness of these estimations and judgments on an\nongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are\nbelieved to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments\nabout the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Results may\ndiffer from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our\nassumptions.

Key assumptions used to\ndetermine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the market approach include the expected\nrevenues and cash flows in the next year. We consider historical and anticipated future results, general\neconomic and market conditions, the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available\ninformation at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated. Those estimates and judgments may\nor may not ultimately prove accurate.\nGoodwill acquired in past transactions is naturally more susceptible to impairment, primarily due to the\nfact that they are recorded at fair value based on operating plans and economic conditions at the time of\nacquisition. Consequently, if operating results and/or economic conditions deteriorate after an acquisition, it\ncould result in the impairment of the acquired asset.Adeterioration of economic conditions may not only\nnegatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models but may also negatively\nimpact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the estimated cost of capital\nand/or discount rates.Additionally, we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in\nour analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use.As a result,\nthe cost of capital and/or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market\nconditions and trends, regardless of whether our actual cost of capital has changed. Therefore, we may\nrecognize an impairment in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to or greater than\nour previously forecasted amounts.Accordingly, discount rate scenario analysis is performed to evaluate the\nimpact on estimated reporting unit fair values.\nOur fourth quarter 2023, 2022, and 2021 annual goodwill impairment analyses did not result in any\nimpairment charges. Management does not believe that it is reasonably likely that our reporting units will fail\nthe goodwill impairment test in the near term, as the determined fair value of the reporting units with\ngoodwill exceeded their carrying value by more than an insignificant amount. Changes in judgments and\nestimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment, including expected future operating\ncash flows and discount rate, could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the future and\ncould result in an impairment of goodwill.\nIncomeTaxes.Wearerequiredtoestimateourincometaxesasapartoftheprocessofpreparingour\nconsolidatedfinancialstatements.Thisrequiresustoestimateouractualcurrenttaxexposuretogetherwith\nassessingtemporarydifferencesresultingfromdifferingtreatmentsofitemsfortaxandaccountingpurposes.These\ndifferencesresultindeferredtaxassetsandliabilities,whichareincludedwithinourconsolidatedbalancesheet.We\nmustthenassessthelikelihoodthatourdeferredtaxassetswillberecoveredfromfuturetaxableincomeand,tothe\nextentwebelievethatrecoveryisnotlikely,wemustestablishavaluationallowance.Wealsoestablishreservesto\nreducesomeorallofthetaxbenefitofanyofourtaxpositionsatthetimewedeterminethatthepositionsbecome\nuncertain.Weadjustthesereserves,includinganyimpactontherelatedinterestandpenalties,inlightofchanging\nfactsandcircumstances,suchastheprogressofataxaudit.Anumberofyearsmayelapsebeforeaparticular\nmatterforwhichwehaveestablishedareserveisauditedbyataxingauthorityandfinallyresolved.Thenumberof\nyearswithopentaxauditsvariesdependingonthetaxjurisdiction.Ataxbenefitthathasbeenpreviouslyreserved\nbecauseofafailuretomeetthe‘‘morelikelythannot’’recognitionthresholdwouldberecognizedinourincome\ntaxexpenseinthefirstinterimperiodwhentheuncertaintydisappears.Settlementofanyparticularissuewould\nusuallyrequiretheuseofcash.\nBroadridgeFinancialSolutions,Inc.•Tel:(631)254-7494 Operator:kaplowitzk Date:March 21, 2024Time:19:33:3\n@edipvwctxa217/PRODUCTION_Jobs/CLS_Funds/GRP_Steel_Dynamics/JOB_ny20020056x1_print/DIV_103-part2 Page15of15 Session:54\n49\nITEM 7A.

To achieve these objectives, we may use interest rate swaps to manage net\nexposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio of borrowings; however, we have not done so during\n2023, 2022, or 2021.\nThe following table represents the principal cash repayments and related weighted-average interest rates\nby maturity date for our long-term debt, as of December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nInterestRateRisk\nFixedRate VariableRate\nAverage Average\nPrincipal Rate Principal Rate\nExpected maturity date:\n2024 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 400,901 2.8% $ 59,794 7.2%\n2025 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 400,653 2.4 —\n2026 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 400,453 5.0 —\n2027 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 350,035 1.7 —\n2028 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . — — —\nThereafter . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,500,000 3.3 —\nTotal debt outstanding . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 3,052,042 3.2% $ 59,794 7.2%\nFair value . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 2,776,826 $ 59,794\nCommodity Risk\nIn the normal course of business, we are exposed to the market risk and price fluctuations related to the\nsale of our products and to the purchase of raw materials used in our operations, such as metallic raw\nmaterials, electricity, water, natural gas and its transportation services, fuel, air products, zinc, and electrodes.\nOur risk strategy associated with product sales has generally been to obtain competitive prices for our\nproducts and to allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand.\nOur risk strategy associated with the purchase of raw materials utilized within our operations has\ngenerally been to make some commitments with suppliers relating to future expected requirements for some\ncommodities such as electricity, water, natural gas and its transportation services, fuel, air products, zinc, and\nelectrodes. Refer to Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements\nelsewhere in this report for additional information.\nIn our metals recycling and steel operations, we have certain fixed price contracts with various customers\nand suppliers for future delivery of nonferrous and ferrous metals. Our risk strategy has been to enter into\nbase metal financial contracts with the goal to protect the profit margin, within certain parameters, that was\ncontemplated when we entered into the transaction with the customer or vendor.At December 31, 2023, we\nhad a cumulative unrealized loss associated with these financial contracts of $6.8 million, substantially all of\nwhich have settlement dates in 2024. We believe the customer contracts associated with the financial contracts\nwill be fully consummated. Refer to Note 7.

We maintain accounting and internal control systems which are\nintended to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or\ndisposition, transactions are executed in accordance with management’s authorization, and accounting records\nare reliable for preparing financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States. We are dedicated to ensuring that we maintain the high standards of financial accounting\nand reporting that we have established. Our culture demands integrity and an unyielding commitment to\nstrong internal control practices and policies.\nInternal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions\nof our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; and\nprovide reasonable assurance that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with\nauthorizations of our management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or\ntimely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect\non our financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not always prevent or\ndetect misstatements.Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the\nrisk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith policies and procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive\nofficer and our principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. The framework on which such evaluation was based upon is contained in the\nreport entitled ‘‘Internal Control—Integrated Framework’’issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (the ‘‘COSO criteria’’). Based on that\nevaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of\nDecember 31, 2023, the end of the period covered by this report.\n/s/ Mark D.

Description of the Business and Summary of SignificantAccounting Policies (continued)\nNoncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent the noncontrolling owners’ proportionate\nshare in the equity, income, or losses of the company’s majority-owned or controlled consolidated subsidiaries.\nUse of Estimates\nThese consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States, and accordingly, include amounts that require management to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and in the notes\nthereto. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying value of property,\nplant and equipment, intangible assets, and goodwill; allowances for credit losses for trade receivables,\ninventories and deferred income tax assets; unrecognized tax benefits; potential environmental liabilities; and\nlitigation claims and settlements.Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nIn the steel and metals recycling operations segments, revenue is recognized at the point in time the\nperformance obligation is satisfied, and control of the product is transferred to the customer upon shipment or\ndelivery, at the amount of consideration the company expects to receive, including any variable consideration.\nThe variable consideration included in the company’s steel operations segment contracts, which is not\nconstrained, include estimated product returns and customer claims based on historical experience, and may\ninclude volume rebates which are recorded on an expected value basis. Revenue recognized is limited to the\namount the company expects to receive. The company does not exercise significant judgments in determining\nthe timing of satisfaction of performance obligations or the transaction price. Shipment of products to\ncustomers is considered a fulfillment activity with amounts billed to customers included in sales and costs\nassociated with such activities included in cost of goods sold.\nThe company’s steel fabrication operations segment recognizes revenue over time at the amount of\nconsideration the company expects to receive. Revenue is measured on an output method representing\ncompleted fabricated tons to date as a percentage of total tons required for each contract. Revenue from\nfabrication of tons remaining on partially fabricated customer contracts as of a reporting date, and future\nrevenue from yet to be fabricated customer contracts, has not been disclosed under the practical expedient in\nAccounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606),\nparagraphASC 606-10-50-14 related to customer contracts with expected duration of one year or less.\nThe company does not exercise significant judgments in determining the timing of satisfaction of performance\nobligations or the transaction price. Shipment of products to customers, which occurs after control over the\nproduct has transferred to the customer and revenue is recognized, is considered a fulfillment activity with\namounts billed to customers included in sales and costs associated with such activities included in cost of\ngoods sold.\nPayments from customers are generally due within 30 days of invoicing, which generally occurs upon\nshipment of the products. Shipment for the steel fabrication operations segment generally occurs within\n30 days of satisfaction of the performance obligation and revenue recognition. The company does not have\nfinancing components. Payments from customers have historically been within these terms, however, payments\nfor non-U.S. sales may extend longer.\nRefer to Note 13. Segment Information for disaggregated revenue by segment to external, external\nnon-United States, and other segment customers.\nCredit Losses\nThe company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment of accounts receivable by customers.\nThe company mitigates its exposure to credit risk, which it generally extends on an unsecured basis, by\nperforming ongoing credit evaluations and taking further action if necessary, such as requiring letters of credit\nor other security interests to support the customer receivable. The allowance for credit losses for accounts\nreceivable is based on the company’s reasonable estimate of known credit risks and historical experience,\nadjusted for current and anticipated economic and other pertinent factors affecting the company’s customers,\n2023AnnualReport\nBroadridgeFinancialSolutions,Inc.•Tel:(631)254-7494 Operator:kaplowitzk Date:March 21, 2024Time:19:33:5\n@edipvwctxa217/PRODUCTION_Jobs/CLS_Funds/GRP_Steel_Dynamics/JOB_ny20020056x1_print/DIV_106-finnote01 Page3of23 Session:58\n62\nNote 1.

Impairment losses are recorded on\nlong-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash\nflows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets’carrying amounts. The impairment\nloss is measured by comparing the fair value of the assets to its carrying amount.

Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are generally one\nlevel below the company’s operating segments. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined by using an\nestimate of future cash flows utilizing a risk-adjusted discount rate to calculate the net present value of future\ncash flows (income approach), and for some years by using a market approach based upon an analysis of\nvaluation metrics of comparable peer companies, using Level 3 fair value inputs as provided for under\nASC 820, Fair Value Measurement. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit, there is\nno impairment. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the company recognizes an impairment loss in\nthe amount by which the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value\nof the reporting unit, with the impairment loss not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting\nunit. No impairment was identified during the company’s 2023, 2022 or 2021 annual goodwill impairment\nanalysis.\nEquity-Based Compensation\nThe company has several stock-based employee compensation plans which are more fully described in\nNote 6. Equity-Based Incentive Plans. Compensation expense for restricted stock units, deferred stock units,\nrestricted stock, stock appreciation awards, and performance awards is recorded over the vesting periods using\nthe fair value as determined by the closing fair market value of the company’s common stock on the grant\ndate, and with respect to performance awards, an estimate of probability of award achievement during the\nperformance period. The company recognizes forfeitures as they occur. Compensation expense for these\nstock-based employee compensation plans was $60.1 million, $69.2 million, and $80.2 million for the years\nended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nThe company accounts for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method. Deferred tax\nliabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of\nassets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences\nreverse.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share is based on the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding during\nthe period. Diluted earnings per share assumes the weighted average dilutive effect of common share\nequivalents outstanding during the period applied to the company’s basic earnings per share.

When advantageous, the company\nplaces its temporary cash with high credit quality financial institutions and companies and limits the amount\nof credit exposure from any one entity. The company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by\ncustomers. The company mitigates its exposure to credit risk, which it generally extends initially on an\nunsecured basis, by performing ongoing credit evaluations and taking further action if necessary, such as\nrequiring letters of credit or other security interests to support the customer receivable.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets\nand measures those instruments at fair value. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges must be adjusted\nto fair value through earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as hedges,\ndepending on the nature of the hedge, are recognized as either an offset against the change in fair value of the\nhedged balance sheet item in the case of fair value hedges or as other comprehensive income in the case of\ncash flow hedges, until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative’s\nchange in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings for fair value hedges. The company offsets fair\nvalue amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under master netting\nagreements.\nIn the normal course of business, the company has derivative financial instruments in the form of\nforward contracts in various metallic commodities, may have involvement with derivative financial\ninstruments related to managing fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, and in the past has had derivative\nfinancial instruments related to managing fluctuations in interest rates.At the time of acquiring these financial\ninstruments, the company designates and assigns these instruments as hedges of specific assets, liabilities or\nanticipated transactions. When hedged assets or liabilities are sold or extinguished, or the anticipated\ntransaction being hedged is no longer expected to occur, the company recognizes the gain or loss on the\ndesignated hedged financial instrument in earnings.\n2023AnnualReport\nBroadridgeFinancialSolutions,Inc.•Tel:(631)254-7494 Operator:kaplowitzk Date:March 21, 2024Time:19:33:5\n@edipvwctxa217/PRODUCTION_Jobs/CLS_Funds/GRP_Steel_Dynamics/JOB_ny20020056x1_print/DIV_106-finnote01 Page7of23 Session:58\n66\nNote 1. Description of the Business and Summary of SignificantAccounting Policies (continued)\nThe company routinely enters into forward exchange traded futures to manage price risk associated with\nnonferrous metal inventory, as well as purchases and sales of nonferrous (primarily aluminum and copper) and\nferrous metals, to reduce exposure to commodity related price fluctuations. The company does not enter into\nthese derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.\nRecently IssuedAccounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the FinancialAccounting Standards Board (FASB) issuedAccounting Standards\nUpdate (ASU) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,\nwhich is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced\ndisclosures about significant segment expenses. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early\nadoption is permitted. The guidance is to be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the\nfinancial statements. Upon transition, the segment expense categories and amounts disclosed in the prior\nperiods should be based on the significant segment expense categories identified and disclosed in the period of\nadoption. The company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this new guidance on the\nconsolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issuedASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income\nTax Disclosures, which modifies the rules on income tax disclosures to require entities to disclose specific\ncategories in the rate reconciliation, the income or loss from continuing operations before income tax expense\nor benefit (separated between domestic and foreign) and income tax expense or benefit from continuing\noperations (separated by federal, state and foreign).ASU 2023-09 also requires entities to disclose their\nincome tax payments to international, federal, state and local jurisdictions, among other changes. The guidance\nis effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual\nfinancial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance.ASU 2023-09 is to be\napplied on a prospective basis, but retrospective application is permitted. The company is currently evaluating\nthe potential impact of adopting this new guidance on the consolidated financial statements and related\ndisclosures.\nNote 2.

ROCAis\nheadquartered in Monterrey, Mexico, and operates ferrous and nonferrous scrap facilities strategically\npositioned near high-volume industrial scrap sources located throughout Central and Northern Mexico. The\ntransaction was funded with available cash. Post-acquisition operating results are reflected in the company’s\nfinancial statements in the metals recycling operations segment.\nAluminum Dynamics\nThe company attained a 94.4% equity interest in a joint venture concurrently formed with Unity\nAluminum, Inc. on July 29, 2022, for the construction and operation of a new state-of-the-art low-carbon\nrecycled aluminum flat rolled products mill. The transaction was funded with available cash. Operating results\nfrom and after July 29, 2022, are reflected in the company’s consolidated financial statements in the aluminum\noperations segment. Prior periods, when amounts were recorded in Other, have been recast to reflect this new\nsegment.\nUnited Steel Supply\nThe company purchased a 75% equity interest in United Steel Supply, LLC (USS) on March 1, 2019. On\nApril 1, 2022, the company purchased an additional 12.5% equity interest in USS.

The remaining noncontrolling members’option to require SDI to purchase\nthe remaining 10% equity interest of USS has been extended to on or after February 28, 2025. The\nUSS noncontrolling interest is therefore reflected in redeemable noncontrolling interest in the consolidated\nbalance sheets.\nInvestments in UnconsolidatedAffiliates\nThe company purchased a 45% minority equity interest in New Process Steel, L.P. (NPS) on January 31,\n2022. NPS is a metals solutions and distribution supply-chain management company headquartered in\nHouston, Texas, with a focus toward growing its value-added manufacturing applications. On February 28,\n2022, the company also purchased a minority equity interest inAymium, a producer of renewable biocarbon\nproducts.As the company does not have power to control these entities, the company accounts for these\ninvestments using the equity method of accounting, which are recorded in OtherAssets (noncurrent) in the\ncompany’s consolidated balance sheets with related activity recorded in Other (Income) Expense, net.

The\nnew CreditAgreement replaced the December 3, 2019 CreditAgreement. Subject to certain conditions, the\ncompany has the opportunity to increase the Facility size by $500.0 million. The unsecured Facility is\navailable to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes. The Facility\ncontains financial covenants and other covenants pertaining to the company’s ability to incur indebtedness and\npermit liens on certain assets. The company’s ability to borrow funds within the terms of the unsecured\nFacility is dependent upon its continued compliance with financial and other covenants.At December 31,\n2023, the company had $1.2 billion of availability on the Facility, $9.1 million of outstanding letters of credit\nand other obligations which reduce availability, and there were no borrowings outstanding.\nThe Facility pricing grid is adjusted quarterly and is based on either the company’s leverage of net debt\n(as defined in the Facility) to last-twelve-months (LTM) consolidatedAdjusted EBITDAas defined in the\nFacility (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and certain other non-cash items as\nallowed in the Facility), or the company’s credit ratings.

In completing this evaluation, the company considers all available positive and negative evidence\nin order to determine whether, based on the weight of the evidence, a valuation allowance for its deferred tax\nassets was necessary. Such evidence includes current operating results, historical results, future reversals of\nexisting taxable temporary differences and expectations for future taxable income (exclusive of the reversal of\ntemporary differences and carryforwards), as well as the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning\nstrategies. Based on the positive evidence, the company concluded that it was more likely than not that the net\ndeferred tax assets would be realized and a valuation allowance was not necessary. The company continues to\nmaintain a valuation allowance of $816,000 and $805,000 as of December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively,\nwith respect to certain state tax credits of the controlled subsidiary.\nAreconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows\n(in thousands):\n2023 2022 2021\nBalance at January 1 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $28,646 $20,466 $12,830\nIncreases related to current year tax positions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,500 9,600 8,250\nIncreases related to prior year tax positions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,798 364 2,095\nDecreases related to prior year tax positions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The company recognizes interest and penalties related to its tax contingencies on a net-of-tax basis in\nincome tax expense. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the company recognized expense\nfrom the increase of interest expense and penalties of $1,560,000 and $480,000, respectively, net of tax and\nduring the year ended December 31, 2021, the company recognized a benefit from the decrease of interest\nexpense and penalties of $205,000, net of tax. In addition to the unrecognized tax benefits in the table above,\nthe company had $3.2 million and $1.2 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIt is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could change in the next twelve\nmonths in an amount ranging from zero to $10.0 million, as a result of the expiration of the statute of\nlimitations and other federal and state income tax audits. The company files income tax returns in the U.S.\nfederal jurisdiction as well as income tax returns in various state jurisdictions. The tax years 2020 through\n2022 remain open to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and various state and local jurisdictions.\nNote 5.

Shareholders’Equity (continued)\nexhausted in November 2022. In November 2022, the board of directors authorized an additional share\nrepurchase program of up to $1.5 billion of the company’s common stock. This program was exhausted in\nNovember 2023. In November 2023, the board of directors authorized an additional share repurchase program\nof up to $1.5 billion of the company’s common stock. Under the above share repurchase programs, and\nsimilar prior programs, purchases take place as and when the company determines in open market or private\ntransactions made based upon the market price of the company’s common stock, the nature of other\ninvestment opportunities or growth projects, the company’s cash flows from operations, and general economic\nconditions. The share repurchase programs do not require the company to acquire any specific number of\nshares, and may be modified, suspended, extended or terminated by the company at any time. The share\nrepurchase programs do not have an expiration date. The company repurchased 13.4 million shares for\n$1.5 billion during 2023, 23.0 million shares for $1.8 billion during 2022, and 16.9 million shares for\n$1.1 billion during 2021 under the share repurchase programs.At December 31, 2023, the company had\nremaining authorization to repurchase $1.4 billion of additional shares under the November 2023 share\nrepurchase program.\nNote 6. Equity-Based Incentive Plans\n2023 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn May 2023, the company’s shareholders approved the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan (2023 Plan), which\nsupersedes the priorAmended and Restated 2015 Equity Incentive Plan. The 2023 Plan is designed to attract,\nmotivate and retain qualified persons that are able to make important contributions to the company’s success.\nTo accomplish these objectives, the 2023 Plan provides for awards of equity-based incentives through granting\nof restricted stock units (RSUs), deferred stock units (DSUs), restricted stock awards (of which none have\nbeen granted), stock options (of which none have been granted), unrestricted stock awards (of which none\nhave been granted), stock appreciation rights (SARs), and performance awards, such as long-term incentive\ncompensation program (LTIP). Under the 2023 Plan, 9.0 million shares of common stock were reserved for\ngrant through December 31, 2033. The 2023 Plan uses a fungible share concept under which any awards that\nare not a full-value award, such as stock options and stock-settled SARs, will be counted against the share\nreserve as one share for each share of common stock, and awards that are full-value awards, such as RSUs,\nDSUs, restricted and unrestricted stock awards, and performance awards, will be counted against the share\nreserve as 2.09 shares for each share of common stock. The SARs the company has granted to date can only\nbe settled in cash, and thus, do not count against the share reserve.At December 31, 2023, there were\n7.5 million shares still available for issuance.\nSubstantially all of the company’s full-time, non-union, U.S. team members receive RSUs, which are\ngranted annually in November at no cost to employees and vest 100% over the shorter of two years from\ngrant date or upon the recipient reaching retirement eligible age (59½ years). During 2023, 2022, and 2021,\ncertain senior leadership of the company received RSUs in February which vest over a period of 2 to 4 years.\nThe stock is issued to employees upon vesting. The company satisfies RSUs with newly issued shares, and\nsatisfies restricted and unrestricted stock awards, DSUs, and performance awards with treasury shares. In\naddition to the RSUs and LTIPawards granted during the three-year period ended December 31, 2023,\npresented below, the company awarded 18,000, 20,000 and 25,000 DSUs in 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively; and 171,200 SARs in 2021. No SARs awards were granted in 2023 and 2022. The 77,000\nSARs awards outstanding at December 31, 2023, for which no shares of common stock can be issued because\nthe awards must be cash-settled upon exercise, have a weighted-average exercise price of $38.74.\nBroadridgeFinancialSolutions,Inc.•Tel:(631)254-7494 Operator:kaplowitzk Date:March 21, 2024Time:19:33:5\n@edipvwctxa217/PRODUCTION_Jobs/CLS_Funds/GRP_Steel_Dynamics/JOB_ny20020056x1_print/DIV_106-finnote01 Page14of23 Session:58\n73\nNote 6.

Derivative Financial Instruments\nThe company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations. The company utilizes\nderivative instruments to mitigate commodity price risk, occasionally to mitigate foreign currency exchange\nrate risk, and has in the past to mitigate interest rate fluctuation risk. The company routinely enters into\nforward exchange traded futures to manage the price risk associated with nonferrous metals inventory, as well\nas purchases and sales of nonferrous (primarily aluminum and copper) and ferrous metals. The company\noffsets fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under\nmaster netting agreements.\nIf the company is ‘‘long’’on commodity futures contracts, it means the company has more futures\ncontracts purchased than futures contracts sold for the underlying commodity. If the company is ‘‘short’’on a\nfutures contract, it means the company has more futures contracts sold than futures contracts purchased for the\nunderlying commodity.

FairValue Measurements\nAccounting standards provide a comprehensive framework for measuring fair value, sets forth a\ndefinition of fair value and establishes a hierarchy prioritizing the inputs to valuation techniques, giving the\nhighest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and the lowest priority to\nunobservable value inputs. Levels within the hierarchy are defined as follows:\n• Level 1—Unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets;\n• Level 2—Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets (other than those included\nin Level 1) which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and\n• Level 3—Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or\nsignificant value drivers are unobservable.\nThe following table sets forth financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis in\nthe consolidated balance sheet and the respective levels to which the fair value measurements are classified\nwithin the fair value hierarchy as of December 31 (in thousands):\nQuotedPrices Significant\ninActive Other Significant\nMarketsfor Observable Unobservable\nIdenticalAssets Inputs Inputs\nTotal (Level1) (Level2) (Level3)\nDecember 31, 2023\nShort-term investments. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $721,210 $— $721,210 $—\nCommodity futures – financial assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,483 — 2,483 —\nCommodity futures – financial liabilities. . . . . . . . . . . 9,305 — 9,305 —\nDecember 31, 2022\nShort-term investments. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $628,215 $— $628,215 $—\nCommodity futures – financial assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4,271 — 4,271 —\nCommodity futures – financial liabilities. . . . . . . . . . . 7,388 — 7,388 —\nThe carrying amounts of financial instruments including cash and equivalents, and restricted cash\napproximate fair value (Level 1).

The fair value of long-term debt, including current\nmaturities, as determined by quoted market prices (Level 2), was approximately $2.8 billion and $2.7 billion\nat December 31, 2023 and 2022 (with a corresponding carrying amount in the consolidated balance sheet of\n$3.1 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022).\nNote 9.

Our steel is\nthen sold to consumers that both further process and\nmanufacture end products. We sell a meaningful amount of steel\nto our own manufacturing businesses that in turn sell finished\nproducts to consumers. Ultimately, when these products reach the\nend of their lives, they can be collected as scrap and used again in\nour steelmaking operations, creating our circular manufacturing\nmodel.\nThis model will continue with our new aluminum flat rolled platform.\nAs the largest nonferrous recycler in North America, our metals\nrecycling platform collects and processes aluminum scrap to sell to\nour recycled aluminum slab facilities and flat rolled products\naluminum mill.

Mr. Chevedden has provided evidence that he holds 200 shares\nrequired to submit a proposal.\nIf properly presented at the Annual Meeting, the Board unanimously recommends that you vote\n\"AGAINST” this proposal for reasons included in our response on the following page.\nWe have printed the text of Mr. Chevedden’s proposal, including the caption, graphic and supporting statement,\nexactly as it was submitted to us:\nProposal 5 — Adopt a Shareholder Right to Call a Special Shareholder Meeting\nShareholders ask our board to take the steps necessary to amend the appropriate company governing\ndocuments to give the owners of a combined 10% of our outstanding common stock the power to call a special\nshareholder meeting (or the lowest percentage according to state law) regardless of length of stock ownership\nalso in accordance with state law. And to enable street name shareholders and non street name shareholder to\nhave as much equal rights in calling for a special shareholder meeting as allowed by state law. This includes\nmaking the necessary changes in plain English.\nCalling for a special shareholder meeting is hardly ever used by shareholders but the main point of the right to\ncall for a special shareholder meeting is that it gives shareholders at least significant standing to engage\neffectively with management.\nManagement will have an incentive to genuinely engage with shareholders instead of stonewalling if\nshareholders have a realistic Plan B option of calling a special shareholder meeting. Often the management of a\ncompany will claim that shareholders have multiple means to communicate with management — but in most\ncases these are low impact means that are as effective as mailing a post card to the CEO. A reasonable\nshareholder right to call a special shareholder meeting is an important step for effective shareholder\nengagement with management.\nSince a special shareholder meeting can be called to replace a director, adoption of this proposal could foster\nbetter performance by our directors. For instance Mark Millett, Chairman & CEO, James Marcuccilli, Lead\nDirector and Bradley Seaman, Audit Committee Member each received 3-times the withheld votes as certain\nother Steel Dynamics directors.\nWith the widespread use of online shareholder meetings it is much easier for management to conduct a special\nshareholder meeting and our bylaws thus need to be updated accordingly.\nPlease vote yes:\nAdopt a Shareholder Right to Call a Special Shareholder Meeting — Proposal 5\nSteel Dynamics, Inc. | 2024 Proxy Statement 79\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBoard Response AGAINST the Proposal our business and maximize benefits for our\nAfter careful consideration, the Board recommends that shareholders.

We recognize that conserving biodiversity and the ecosystems that support it\nare fundamental to environmental sustainability. In our shared environment with increasing\npressures on indigenous plant and animal species, we are mindful of operating in a manner designed\nto lessen impacts to biodiversity.\nBy their very nature, EAF steelmaking operations help to preserve natural resources relative to\ntraditional integrated steelmaking by recycling steel scrap and other materials for reuse. EAF\nsteelmaking also lessens the need for raw materials to be sourced from land-disturbing mines. By\nconsuming fewer virgin raw materials, more undisturbed natural habitat is available for fostering\nbiodiversity. And because steelmaking within the United States is governed by numerous\nenvironmental laws protecting the environment, our operations present a significantly lower threat\nto biodiversity than operations would in many other parts of the world with fewer protections in\nplace.\nWhile new or expansion projects do normally involve some land-disturbing activities, those are\nprimarily during construction and are of relatively short duration in ecological terms. Our facilities are\ngenerally located in developed urban areas, or in suburban and rural settings where the prior\nproperty owners had already disturbed the land for agricultural, ranching, commercial, or similar\nuses. Thus, the potential impacts to biodiversity from constructing new facilities are believed to be\nlow. Completely natural sites without developed utilities, roadways, and other infrastructure are\ngenerally not suitable for our operations.\nOnce built, an operating industrial facility is not typically expected to provide habitat for sensitive\nspecies of plants or animals, thus lessening the possibility of biodiversity impacts, and our facilities\noperate within these developed properties without requiring significant on-site land disturbances for\ndaily operations. The lack of ongoing disturbances helps to preserve any biodiversity that is\nassociated with the properties.\n304-1 Operational sites The boundary for this disclosure is companywide.

These waterbodies range from a small, isolated wetland in a topographic\ndepression, to an intermittent stream draining a nearby farm field, to a major watercourse such as\nthe Ohio River. Some of these waterbodies are regulated under federal or state laws governing any\ndischarges of fill material, process water or stormwater.

Some of our facilities have undergone U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and State\noutside protected water quality certification reviews for the unavoidable filling of wetlands, and many of our facilities\nareas have wastewater discharge permits for process and stormwater associated with our industrial\nactivities.

We evaluate\nour GHG emissions by regularly reviewing furnace performance and efficiency. Routine testing of air\nemissions and frequent monitoring of our operations help to inform our compliance status with\npermits and the safe and sustainable production of our high-quality steel products. Our facilities\ntriggering the reporting requirements annually report GHG emissions to the United States\nEnvironmental Protection Agency. Additionally, reports on other air emissions are submitted\nregularly to state and federal regulators consistent with our permits.\nIn 2021, we set a goal for our EAF steel mill operations to be carbon neutral by 2050. To achieve this\ntarget, we also set interim emissions reductions and renewable electrical energy milestones to be\nachieved by 2025 and 2030.\nOn the path to carbon neutrality, we set targets for a 20% Scope 1 and Scope 2 combined GHG\nemissions intensity reduction across our EAF steel mills by 2025 and a 50% reduction by 2030,\ncompared to the 2018 baseline. Additionally, we set targets to increase the use of renewable electrical\nenergy for our EAF steel mills to 10% by 2025 and 30% by 2030.These goals expand on our existing\nsustainability focus, leading the steel industry for more than 25 years with our exclusive use of EAF\ntechnology, circular manufacturing models, and innovative teams creating solutions to increase\nefficiencies, reduce raw material usage, reuse secondary materials, and promote material conservation\nand recycling.\nSTEEL DYNAMICS, INC. 2023 SASB and GRI Indices 26\nGRI Standard Disclosure Steel Dynamics Disclosure Reference\n3-3 (continued) Management We have already made meaningful progress toward our current decarbonization goals.

Also, since 2018, we have increased\nour use of renewable electrical energy to 10% within our steel mill operations, already achieving our\n2025 renewable electrical energy goal. This is largely attributed to a decrease in Scope 2 emission rates\nfrom our electricity suppliers, RECs, and use of nuclear electricity at the Sinton, Texas steel mill. We\nhave not used carbon offsets.\nIn 2023, we began construction of a biocarbon production facility in Columbus, Mississippi.

The CSG's Guidance Team’s primary function is to guide the overall safety\nprogram toward the achievement of zero incidents. The CSG Field Visit Team’s primary function is\nto enhance employee engagement with our Take Control of Safety initiatives. To support this\ncompanywide effort in 2023, approximately 200 team members were selected, trained, and are\nengaging with other team members as Take Control of Safety Coaches.\nWe have implemented several management systems to manage occupational health and safety\nwithin all operations. Our Safety Calendar specifies occupational health and safety topics that\nrequire routine training, inspections and/or recordkeeping obligations to meet and/or exceed the\nUnited States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations, as well as our\nexpectations. The calendar has been specifically designed, and continues to be annually updated,\nto serve as a comprehensive safety and health management system. An Occupational Health\nManagement System is utilized by our nursing team to document all medical surveillance,\nwellness, first aid, prevention, and treatment. Integrated online programs are also used to manage\ncorporate safety programs, CSG expectations, injury and illness data, and all safety related\nincidents.\nAll of our divisions conduct and annually review Job Safety Analysis (JSA) as well as Personal\nProtective Equipment (PPE) evaluations to meet OSHA requirements and strive for a work\nenvironment without recognized hazardous exposures. In addition, all safety incidents are\nexpected to be reported and investigated within our Incident Management System (IMS) to\nidentify and manage recognized hazards in order to control employee exposure to such hazards.\nSafety and health systems are coordinated and managed by safety and health professionals with\nappropriate education, accreditations, certifications and/or experience in the field.
