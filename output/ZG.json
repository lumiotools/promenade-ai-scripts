We view our corporate governance practices and policies as important drivers of\nour culture. Highlights of our corporate governance practices and policies include:\n• Three standing Board committees: (1) audit; (2) compensation; and (3) nominating and\ngovernance. All members of each Board committee are independent.\n• Eight independent directors.\n• Executive chairperson separate from Chief Executive Officer role.\n• Independent directors meet periodically without management in executive sessions.\n• Board evaluations conducted on an ongoing basis in addition to formal Board evaluations. For\n2023, formal Board evaluations included interviews conducted by our Corporate Secretary and\nGeneral Counsel with each director.\n• Director orientation provided to all new Board members.\nBoard and Committee Meetings\nOur Board and its committees meet throughout the year on a set schedule and, from time to time, hold\nspecial meetings and act by unanimous written consent. During 2023 (including virtual and telephonic\nmeetings):\n• the Board held six meetings;\n• the audit committee held four meetings;\n• the compensation committee held four meetings; and\n• the nominating and governance committee held no meetings.\nDuring 2023, each incumbent member of Zillow Group’s Board attended 75% or more of the aggregate\nnumber of meetings of the Board and committees on which they served that were held during their\nterm of service. We encourage all of our directors and nominees for director to attend our Annual\nMeeting of Shareholders. Four of Zillow Group’s directors attended the 2023 Annual Meeting of\nShareholders.\nDirector Independence\nUnder the rules of Nasdaq, independent directors must comprise a majority of a listed company’s\nboard of directors, and subject to specified exceptions, all members of its audit, compensation, and\nnominating and governance committees must be independent. Our Board has undertaken a review of\nthe independence of each director. Based on information provided by each director concerning their\nbackground, employment, investments, and affiliations, and upon the review and recommendation of\nour nominating and governance committee, our Board has determined that Mr. Blachford, Ms.\nBohutinsky, Mr. Gurley, Mr. Hoag, Mr. Maffei, Mr. Stephenson, Ms. Thielke, and Ms. Underwood meet the\napplicable SEC and Nasdaq definitions of “independent” and do not have a relationship that would\ninterfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.\nIn making the independence determinations, our Board considered the current and prior relationships\nthat each non-employee director has with our Company and its subsidiaries and all other facts and\ncircumstances our Board deemed relevant in determining their independence, including the beneficial\nownership of our capital stock by each non-employee director. In evaluating the independence of our\ndirectors, the Board also considered the following transactions, relationships, and arrangements that\nare not required to be disclosed in this Proxy Statement as transactions with related persons:\n• Mr. Blachford and Mr. Barton are co-owners of a condominium.\n• Mr. Gurley is a General Partner of Benchmark Capital, and is a direct or indirect, limited partner, or\nmember of the general partners of various venture capital funds of Benchmark Capital that\nhave been invested in by Mr. Barton and Mr. Frink. Mr. Barton’s and Mr. Frink’s capital\ncommitments in these funds represents a de minimis share of the total committed capital of\nthe funds.\n• Mr. Hoag is the Founding General Partner of TCV, and is a direct or indirect director, limited\npartner, or member of the general partners of various private equity and venture capital funds\n9\nof TCV that have been invested in by Mr. Barton, Mr. Wacksman, Mr. Maffei, and Ms. Bohutinsky,\neach either in their individual capacity or through an entity that they own and control. In 2022, Mr.\nBlachford transferred all of his limited partnership interests to Mr. Barton. Each of Mr. Barton and\nMr. Wacksman’s capital commitments in these funds represent a de minimis share of the total\ncommitted capital of the funds. As a venture partner of TCV, Ms. Bohutinsky may also provide\ncertain consulting or other services to TCV from time to time, for which she may receive indirect\neconomic interests or value in certain investments by TCV's affiliated investment funds.\n• Mr. Hoag and Mr. Barton serve on the board of directors of Netflix, Inc.\n• Mr. Maffei is Chairman of the board of directors of TripAdvisor, Inc., where Mr. Hoag also serves as\na director. Mr. Maffei is also the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Liberty\nTripAdvisor Holdings, Inc., which, as of April 25, 2023, held approximately a 20.6% equity interest\nand 56.1% voting interest in TripAdvisor, Inc.\n• Mr. Maffei is Executive Chairman of the board of directors of Qurate Retail, Inc., where Mr. Barton\nalso serves as a director.\n• Real Property Associates, of which Mr. Stephenson is Principal and Designated Broker,\nparticipates in Zillow Group’s Premier Agent and Listing Showcase programs.\n• Ms. Underwood is Managing Director and Co-founder of Adverb Ventures, a venture capital firm,\nin which Mr. Barton and Mr. Hoag (through their family offices) are limited partners in various of\nthe limited partnership funds.\nBoard Leadership Structure\nAs reflected in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, a copy of which is posted on our website at\nhttps://investors.zillowgroup.com/investors/governance/governance-documents/default.aspx, our\nBoard does not have a policy as to whether the offices of chair of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\nshould be separate. Our Board believes that it should have the flexibility to make this determination as\ncircumstances require, and in a manner that it believes is best to provide appropriate leadership for our\nCompany. The Board believes that its current leadership structure, with Mr. Frink serving as Executive\nChairman and Mr. Barton serving as Chief Executive Officer, is appropriate because it enables the Board,\nas a whole, to engage in oversight of management, promote communication and collaboration\nbetween management and the Board, and oversee governance matters, while allowing our Chief\nExecutive Officer to focus on his primary responsibility, the operational leadership and strategic\ndirection of the Company. In addition, the Board benefits from the perspective and insights of Mr. Frink\nand Mr. Barton as a result of their extensive experience developing consumer-facing products and\nservices and leading innovative, technology-driven companies. The Board does not believe that its role\nin risk oversight has been affected by the Board’s leadership structure.\nRisk Oversight\nThe Board considers risk assessment and development of risk mitigation strategies to be a responsibility\nof the entire Board in consultation with the appropriate Board committees. The Board regularly engages\nin risk oversight on a broad range of matters, including challenges associated with strategic\nacquisitions, cybersecurity, regulatory and other legal and compliance matters. For more focused risk\noversight, our Board committees are tasked with specific risk management roles as outlined below.\nEach committee generally reports on its activities to the full Board to enable the Board and its\ncommittees to coordinate their risk oversight roles.\n• Audit Committee: Provides oversight concerning the Company's accounting and financial\nreporting processes; the independent auditor's qualifications, independence, and performance;\nthe Company's internal audit function and performance of internal accounting and controls;\nand the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Also oversees our\nmajor enterprise risks and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such\nexposure, including with respect to major financial risk exposures, including capital, regulatory\nand other requirements, and data privacy, cybersecurity and other topics related to information\ntechnology infrastructure.\n• Compensation Committee: Provides oversight of our compensation philosophy and the\nobjectives of our compensation programs, including the (a) oversight of the Company's\ncompensation plans, policies and programs for executive officers and non-employee directors\nof the Board, (b) evaluation of whether our compensation programs contain incentives for\n10\nexecutive officers and employees to take risks in performing their duties that are reasonably\nlikely to have a material adverse effect on the Company, and (c) oversight of the Company's\nemployee benefit plans, including its incentive compensation and equity compensation plans.\n• Nominating and Governance Committee: Oversees risks associated with corporate\ngovernance and the composition of our Board, including the independence of Board members\nand identification and recommendation of candidates to serve on the Board. Also oversees\nevaluations of the Board and its Committees and management succession planning. Develops,\nreviews, monitors, and recommends to the Board corporate governance principles and policies\napplicable to Company risks, including sustainability-related risks such as environmental targets\nand initiatives and political engagement activities.\nOur Enterprise Risk Management (\"ERM\") program, led by our head of enterprise risk, promotes visibility of\nour company-wide risks and their active and efficient management. The ERM program aims to create\nan ongoing, transparent, risk-aware culture that empowers management to make informed, data-\ndriven, strategic business decisions that consider material risks critical to our business success and\nmission. In addition, the ERM program supports management to monitor risk exposures and evaluate\nwhether efficient and effective risk management strategies, acceptance, and notification criteria are in\nplace. We have also established an executive risk forum to align risk management priorities and\nresources, and to serve as a steering function to identify, discuss, and assess the key risks associated\nwith our mission and objectives; monitor risk exposures; and oversee the implementation of risk\nmanagement strategies. The forum meets on a regular basis, and its activities are overseen by the\naudit committee.\nBoard Committees\nThe Board currently has the following standing committees: audit, compensation, and nominating and\ngovernance. The Board may, from time to time, form a new committee or disband a current committee\ndepending on the circumstances and needs of the Company. Each standing committee complies with\nthe independence and other requirements established by applicable laws, regulations, and rules,\nincluding those promulgated by the SEC and Nasdaq. Membership of the standing committees is\ndetermined annually by the Board, with consideration given to the recommendation of the nominating\nand governance committee. Adjustments to committee assignments may be made at any time.\nThe Board has adopted a written charter for each standing committee. Shareholders may access a\ncopy of each standing committee’s charter on the Investor Relations section of our website at https://\ninvestors.zillowgroup.com/investors/governance/committee-charters/default.aspx. A summary of the\nduties and responsibilities of each standing committee is set forth below.\nAudit Committee\nThe current members of our audit committee are Claire Cormier Thielke, Gordon Stephenson, and\nGregory B. Maffei, with Mr. Maffei serving as Chair. The primary responsibilities of the audit committee\nare to:\n• oversee the integrity of our corporate accounting and financial reporting process, including\ninternal accounting and financial controls, and audits of the financial statements;\n• evaluate the independent auditor’s qualifications, independence and performance; engage and\nprovide for the compensation of the independent auditor; and establish the policies and\nprocedures for the retention of the independent auditor to perform any proposed permissible\nnon-audit services;\n• review and discuss with management and the independent auditor, as appropriate, our annual\naudited and quarterly unaudited financial statements;\n• review and discuss with the independent auditor the responsibilities, functions and performance\nof the Company’s internal audit department, including internal audit plans, budget, staffing and\nthe scope and results of internal audits;\n• review our critical accounting policies, disclosure controls and procedures, and internal controls\nover financial reporting;\n• discuss policies and practices with respect to risk assessment and risk management, including\nthe Company’s major financial risks, data privacy, cybersecurity, and other topics related to\n11\ninformation technology infrastructure, and the steps management has taken to monitor and\ncontrol such exposure;\n• establish and oversee certain compliance procedures and ethics compliance, including\nprocedures for the confidential, anonymous submission by employees of concerns regarding\naccounting or auditing matters; and\n• review transactions with related persons that are disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K.\nOur Board has determined that each of our audit committee members meets the requirements for\nindependence and financial literacy under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq.\nOur Board has determined that each of Messrs. Maffei and Stephenson and Ms. Thielke is an audit\ncommittee financial expert as defined under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC.\nCompensation Committee\nThe current members of our compensation committee are Amy C. Bohutinsky, Jay C. Hoag, and April\nUnderwood, with Mr. Hoag serving as Chair. The primary responsibilities of our compensation committee\nare to:\n• review our overall compensation philosophy and policies relating to the compensation and\nbenefits of our executive officers and employees;\n• review and approve goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of our Chief Executive\nOfficer and other executive officers, evaluate the performance of these officers in light of those\ngoals and objectives, and set the compensation of these officers based on such evaluations;\n• evaluate whether our incentive programs contain incentives for executive officers and\nemployees to take risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany, and oversee and administer the Incentive Compensation Recoupment Policy (the\n“Clawback Policy”);\n• oversee the administration and issuance of stock options, restricted stock units, and other\nawards under our equity incentive plans, including the Zillow Group, Inc. 2020 Incentive Plan (the\n“2020 Plan”), Zillow Group, Inc. Amended and Restated 2011 Incentive Plan (the “2011 Plan”), and the\nZillow Group, Inc. 2019 Equity Inducement Plan (the“Inducement Plan”);\n• review and discuss with management disclosures related to executive compensation in our\nannual and quarterly financial statements and annual proxy statement, as applicable; and\n• oversee our compensation and benefit plans, policies and programs for our executive officers\nand non-employee directors.\nAs part of its process to determine the compensation level of each executive officer, the compensation\ncommittee evaluates, among other things, the assessments made by the Chief Executive Officer,\nExecutive Chairman, and Chief People Officer of the other executive officers and recommendations\nregarding their compensation in light of the goals and objectives of our executive compensation\nprogram.\nPursuant to its charter, the compensation committee has sole authority to engage outside\ncompensation consultants or other advisors to assist the committee in carrying out its duties. With\nrespect to 2022 and 2023 executive compensation, the compensation committee engaged\nCompensia, a compensation consulting firm, to recommend a peer group for the purpose of\nconducting a market analysis of the total compensation of certain executive officers, to provide a share\nutilization rate and overhang analysis for equity awards based on the peer group, and to provide\nequity-based compensation expense comparisons to our peer group. In 2022, Compensia also advised\nthe compensation committee on specific matters relating to a broad-based off-cycle retention award\nof restricted stock units and a stock option repricing for eligible executive and non-executive\nemployees. In addition, the compensation committee considered market information available through\nComptryx and Radford, each leading executive compensation data solutions companies, as well as\ndata from the proxy statements of peer companies, as reference points in making certain executive\ncompensation decisions for 2022 and 2023 consistent with the Company’s compensation philosophy.\nCompensia did not provide any other services to the compensation committee, management, or the\nCompany in 2023 and only received fees from the Company on behalf of our compensation\ncommittee.\n12\nThe compensation committee may form and delegate authority to subcommittees, and delegate\nauthority to one or more designated members of the committee, in accordance with its charter. The\ncharter also permits the compensation committee to delegate to one or more senior executive officers\nthe authority to make certain grants of equity-based compensation to non-executive officer\nemployees, subject to restrictions set forth in the charter and compliance with applicable laws. The\nBoard has delegated to Mr. Barton, so long as he is acting as Chief Executive Officer of Zillow Group;\nMr. Frink, so long as he is acting as Executive Chairman or President of Zillow Group; and Mr. Spaulding, so\nlong as he is acting as Chief People Officer of Zillow Group; the authority to grant equity awards to non-\nexecutive officer employees under the 2020 Plan, subject to certain limitations. Pursuant to such\nauthority, these individuals routinely act to grant equity awards to our non-executive officer employees.\nOur Board has determined that each member of our compensation committee meets the\nrequirements for independence under the applicable rules and regulations of Nasdaq and is a “non-\nemployee director” within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. For additional discussion\nof the processes and procedures the compensation committee has used to determine executive\nofficer and non-employee director compensation, please refer to the sections titled “Compensation\nDiscussion and Analysis - How We Set Executive Compensation” and “Director Compensation,”\nrespectively.\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\nNone of the members of Zillow Group’s compensation committee in 2023 was, at any time during 2023\nor at any other time in the past three years, an officer or employee of Zillow Group, and, except as\ndescribed in the section titled “Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions,” none had or has\nany relationships with Zillow Group that are required to be disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K.\nA compensation committee interlock can occur when an executive officer of one company: (1) serves\non the compensation committee of another company, one of whose executive officers serves on the\ncompensation committee or board of directors of the first company; or (2) serves as a director of\nanother company, one of whose executive officers serves on the compensation committee of the first\ncompany. During 2023, none of Zillow Group’s executive officers served as a member of the board of\ndirectors, or as a member of the compensation or similar committee, of another company such that a\ncompensation committee interlock arose.\nNominating and Governance Committee\nThe current members of our nominating and governance committee are Gordon Stephenson, Erik\nBlachford and Amy C. Bohutinsky, with Mr. Stephenson serving as Chair. The primary responsibilities of\nthe nominating and governance committee are to:\n• identify, approve, and recommend individuals qualified to become members of the Board in\naccordance with the director selection guidelines approved by the Board;\n• oversee evaluations of our Board and its committees;\n• develop procedures and recommend criteria for selection of the Board Chair and committee\nmembership; and\n• develop, periodically review, monitor, and recommend to the Board corporate governance\nprinciples and policies applicable to the Company, including sustainability-related matters.\nThe nominating and governance committee and the Board believe that having a board whose\nmembers represent diverse groups with a mix of skills and characteristics promotes innovation and\nlong-term success. Representation — which we broadly construe to include age, professional\nexperience, gender, race, ethnicity, and LGBTQ+ status, among other considerations — is one factor\nconsidered by the nominating and governance committee in determining the needs of the Board and\nevaluating director candidates to fill such needs. The director selection guidelines used by the\nnominating and governance committee to evaluate the Board’s composition and director candidates\nare included in the committee’s charter, which is available on the Investor Relations section of our\nwebsite at https://investors.zillowgroup.com/investors/governance/committee-charters/default.aspx.\nPursuant to the director selection guidelines, and to help ensure a well-balanced board, the nominating\nand governance committee considers the total mix of the Board’s composition and director\ncandidates’ qualifications, including factors such as relevant industry knowledge, expertise in\n13\noperations, financial acumen, and experience working with public companies. The nominating and\ngovernance committee does not have a formal policy with respect to diversity, but intends for the\noverall composition of the Board to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and exchange listing rules,\nand we currently meet both Nasdaq's Board Diversity Rule and the gender diversity requirements of the\nWashington Business Corporation Act. The nominating and governance committee has the authority to\nretain a search firm or other advisor to identify director candidates and to otherwise assist with the\nfulfillment of its duties.\nThe following table discloses diversity information concerning our directors as required by, and in\nsatisfaction of, Nasdaq listing rules. The information is provided in aggregate form based on voluntary\nself-identification by each director collected in advance of the date of this proxy statement.\nBoard Diversity Matrix (as of April 16, 2024)\nTotal Number of Directors 10\nFemale Male\nNumber of Directors Based on\nGender Identity 3 6\nDid not Disclose Gender\nIdentity 1\nNumber of Directors who identify in any of the categories below:\nAfrican American or Black 1 —\nAlaskan Native or Native\nAmerican — —\nAsian — —\nHispanic or Latinx — —\nNative Hawaiian or Pacific\nIslander — —\nWhite 2 6\nTwo or More Races or\nEthnicities — —\nLGBTQ+ —\nDid not Disclose Demographic\nBackground 1\nOur Board has determined that each member of the nominating and governance committee meets\nthe requirements for independence under the applicable rules and regulations of Nasdaq and the SEC.\nPursuant to its charter, the nominating and governance committee will also consider qualified director\ncandidates recommended by our shareholders. The nominating and governance committee evaluates\nthe qualifications of candidates properly submitted by shareholders in the same manner as it\nevaluates the qualifications of director candidates identified by the committee or the Board.\nShareholders can recommend director candidates by following the instructions outlined below in the\nsection titled “Additional Information - Submission of Shareholder Proposals for Inclusion in Next Year’s\nProxy Statement or Presentation at Next Year’s Annual Meeting.” No nominations for director were\nsubmitted to the nominating and governance committee for consideration by any of our shareholders\nin connection with this year’s Annual Meeting.\nBoard Evaluations\nOur Board and Board committees evaluate their effectiveness with respect to strategic planning, long-\nterm operational and financial planning, risk management, and other responsibilities, on both an\nongoing basis throughout each year and as part of formal evaluations directed by the nominating and\ngovernance committee. Ongoing engagement on Board effectiveness includes discussion led by our\nExecutive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on new practices or technologies that may enhance\n14\ndirector collaboration, progress against strategic priorities, and interactions with management, as well\nas input from directors on meeting agendas and format.\nFor the 2023 evaluation cycle, interviews were conducted with each Board member via video\nconference by our Corporate Secretary and General Counsel. Interview topics included:\n• the Board’s role in risk and strategic oversight of areas critical to the long-term success of the\nCompany;\n• management’s engagement, performance, and compensation;\n• Board and committee structure and director skills;\n• best practices to promote candor and rigorous decision making; and\n• various other topics.\nInterview results were then compiled by our Corporate Secretary and General Counsel and shared with\nthe chair of the nominating and governance committee and Executive Chairman, as appropriate. The\nchair of the nominating and governance committee provided an overview of interview results to the\nBoard at the June 2023 meeting for further consideration. Based on the results of the Board evaluation\nprocess, practices and approaches are modified by management, the Board, and Board committees,\nas appropriate, to further enhance the Board’s performance.\nDirector Orientation and Education\nAs set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, Zillow Group strongly encourages and supports\ncontinuing education for directors. Director education begins with orientation for newly appointed or\nelected Board members. Director orientation is tailored to the skills and experiences of the individual,\nand commonly includes:\n• meeting with the Company’s legal team to discuss director duties and expectations; Zillow\nGroup’s corporate governance practices, including with respect to Regulation FD; and corporate\ngovernance policies such as our Code of Conduct and Code of Ethics;\n• meeting with management, including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief People Officer, and other\nbusiness leaders, to discuss the Company’s strategic priorities, culture and core values,\noperations, compensation philosophy and practices, among other matters;\n• meetings with each Board member; and\n• extensive supplemental materials, such as organizational charts, annual operating plans,\ncorporate governance policies, sell-side analyst research and recent Board minutes and\nmaterials.\nDirector education is also provided throughout the year through presentations to, and discussions with,\nthe Board and Board committees led by members of management, third-party consultants, our\nindependent registered public accounting firm, and legal counsel, on topics such as information\nsecurity, legal, accounting, and regulatory concepts and developments, company culture, and\nemployee engagement.\nSustainability\nWe strive to lead transformative initiatives that have a positive social impact, promote equity, support\nenvironmental sustainability, and revolutionize our industry. Our sustainability strategy comprises five\nfocus areas that enable our long-term business success: social impact and innovation, equity and\nbelonging, employees and culture, environmental sustainability, and responsible business practices.\nThe nominating and governance committee of the Board is responsible for evaluating our\nsustainability-related risks and overseeing the Company’s sustainability strategy and initiatives in\ncoordination with other Board committees. We published our first political engagement report in 2023\nand recently published our annual sustainability report, which may be found on our Investor Relations\nwebsite.\nOur sustainability function, led by our Vice President of Corporate Social Responsibility, provides us with\nfocus and clarity regarding sustainability strategies, risks, and opportunities. Sustainability risks are\nintegrated into our enterprise risk management program, and our cross-divisional Executive\nSustainability Council provides oversight of company-wide initiatives. The committee is responsible for\nsetting and reviewing priorities and progress of the Company’s sustainability initiatives and promoting\n15\ncollaboration, implementation, coordination and alignment throughout the company. The executive-\nlevel committee meets quarterly, works closely with the Vice President of Corporate Social\nResponsibility, and reports to the nominating and governance committee of the Board.\nKey highlights from our work on sustainability in 2023 include:\nSocial Impact & Innovation\n• Racial Disparities in Housing dashboard: Launched online tool to illuminate the current\nlandscape of racial inequalities in housing, at the local level, and how those inequalities have\nevolved over time.\n• Helping renters better plan their budgets: Created Cost of Renting Summary to give renters\ninsight into the financial obligations of renting.\n• New social impact products for renters: Developed new solutions to help renters, including one\nthat enables renters to have their on-time Zillow Rental Payments reported to a major credit\nbureau, and another that expands affordable rental listings on our platform.\n• Engaging employees in giving back: Employees volunteered 4,030 hours in 2023; 2,094 of these\nvolunteer hours were through the Zillow for Good (Z4G) Hub Partner Program, directly in service\nof communities experiencing housing insecurity. Launched Z4G Community Grants, enabling\nemployees to nominate 10 nonprofits to each receive $10,000 grants.\n• Corporate and employee giving: Zillow gave $1,013,019 in cash and in-kind donations, and\nemployees donated $295,140. Corporate giving includes cash ($827,985), in-kind hours\n(equivalent to $168,885) and in-kind donations (equivalent to $16,148).\nEnvironmental Sustainability\n• Reduced Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 95% compared to a 2019\nbase year, mainly driven by a combination of office space optimization and renewable energy\ncredit purchases. This reduction excludes emissions associated with Zillow Offers, when that\nbusiness was active in 2019, and is based only on emissions from our corporate offices.\n• Purchased 13,913,300 kilowatt hours of renewable energy credits, equivalent to approximately\n100% of our North America corporate real estate and estimated work-from-home electricity\nconsumption.\n• Began the foundational work to update our climate targets — inclusive of Scope 1, Scope 2 and\nScope 3 emissions — and submitted these targets to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)\nfor validation.\n• Published our first Environmental Sustainability Policy, outlining Zillow’s ambition to reduce our\nenvironmental impact and drive sustainable practices across our business.\nCompany Culture\nThe Board and management believe that our long-term success depends upon attracting, developing,\nand retaining talented employees, and maintaining a culture that allows each employee to do their\nbest work. We value integrity, accountability, collaboration, creativity, respect, and transparency as\ncentral to our core values. With the oversight of our collective senior leadership team, and facilitated by\nour Chief People Officer, who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer, Zillow Group invests in a\nvariety of resources to attract and develop talent. These include, but are not limited to:\n• Zillow Group as a Flexible Workforce: In 2020, we announced a permanent move to a flexible\nworkforce. As we have transitioned to a flexible workforce, we are also using this opportunity to\ndiversify our workforce, as we are no longer bound by the geographic limits of our physical\nworkspaces. We believe our investments in recruiting, retaining, developing, listening to, and\nlearning from our diverse talent increase our applicant pool and lead to lower employee\nattrition. We offer most employees the choice to work from wherever they are most productive.\nWe continue to evolve our flexible work model to more effectively use our time together, provide\nmore opportunities to work asynchronously, and allow all employees to thrive regardless of\nlocation. Our base pay compensation frameworks seek to prioritize performance over\ngeographic location when making pay decisions, which we believe allows us to compete for\ntalent nationally.\n• Leadership Development: Zillow Group has a dedicated Talent Success team, which creates\neducational resources and conducts training on a wide range of topics, including effective\n16\ncommunication and collaboration, as well as a sophisticated leadership training program with\nfocused learning tracks for both new managers and experienced leaders. In 2023, we offered\nmore than 900 online learning opportunities through Zillow University, our internal online training\nplatform, and Zillow Group employees completed nearly 70,000 hours of training via Zillow\nUniversity and other platforms. We believe our people managers play a critical role in moving\nour business forward by coaching their teams, developing their talent, and providing strong\ncommunication to create team engagement. To help our people managers succeed, we utilize\nour Leadership Expectations, a leadership development guide that outlines our Leadership\nPhilosophy, provides the foundation of our leadership development programs, and sets forth our\nexpectations for leaders and the behaviors that are essential to create a consistent leadership\nexperience at Zillow Group. In 2023, we further enhanced the Leadership Expectations by defining\nspecific manager capabilities that bring clarity to managers on how to lead and manage\nteams in our flexible work environment. With this, we began the launch of our virtual manager\ncapability summits, designed for our director and below leaders to help develop their manager\ncapabilities. In 2024, we plan to launch semiannual summits for eligible people managers, while\noffering customized learning paths on asynchronous content between training sessions, along\nwith peer-to-peer mentoring.\n• Total Rewards: Talent Rewards includes the strategic oversight of compensation, benefits, and\nimmigration/mobility programs whose purpose is to reinforce talent attraction, retention and\ndevelopment in support of Zillow Group’s culture. Throughout 2023, we continued to refine our\nrewards program. We increased transparency and consistency in our candidate offers through\na redesign of our total compensation package. In addition, our robust benefits are reflected in\ninvestments in physical, family, mental and financial wellness programs to meet the needs of\nour diverse base of employees. These benefits include workplace-location flexibility, competitive\nhealth care coverage, fully paid parental leave, a sabbatical program, wellness reimbursements,\ntuition support and caregiver resources. We also updated our benefits program through\nenhanced offerings around mental health, LGBTQ+ provider navigation support, as well as\nfertility and family planning. Beginning in 2023, we enhanced our parental leave policy, which\nnow allows for up to 20 weeks of paid parental leave. These ongoing investments continue to\nreinforce Zillow’s commitment to an engaged and high-performing workforce.\n• Engagement & Belonging: In pursuit of our business goals, we prioritize and embed inclusive,\nequitable practices and systems in our values and how we work. We are committed to creating\na workplace where diversity of gender, gender identity, age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation,\nnational origin, disability, military status and religion are represented, embraced, and respected.\nOur engagement and belonging work seeks to empower Zillow Group employees to build a\nstrong community, amplify underrepresented voices, and foster a company culture where\neveryone can learn, grow and thrive. We maintain programs that include unconscious bias\ntraining, employee resource groups for community members and allies, and support for\ndiversity in our recruitment practices. In 2023, we launched an executive advisory council\ncomposed of senior leadership charged with setting the tone and vision for our commitments,\nincluding establishing goals and responsibilities and evaluating impact.\n• Pay Equity: To further our commitment to ensure all employees in similar roles with similar\nqualifications are paid equitably regardless of their identity, we conduct an annual pay equity\nanalysis consistent with federal and state pay equity laws, with the commitment to publicly\ndisclose results on our corporate website. Based on our assessment of compensation for the\n2023 calendar year, we found that U.S.-based employees with similar skills are paid within\napproximately 1% of each other when we control for certain neutral, job-related factors, including\nbut not limited to job function and qualifications. At Zillow Group, in 2023, Asian men had a pay\nequity of $1.01; White men, Asian women, and Latine women had controlled pay of $1.00; White\nwomen, Latine men, Black men, and men of two or more races at Zillow Group had controlled\npay of $0.99; and Black women and women of two or more races had controlled pay at $0.98.\nWe will continue our commitment to, and comprehensive reviews of, pay equity, and we will look\nto expand our data collection and analysis to include LGBTQ+ data in the future.\n17\nDIRECTOR COMPENSATION\n2023 Director Compensation Table\nZillow Group’s director compensation program is governed by the Equity Award Grant Program for Non-\nemployee Directors under the 2020 Plan (the “NED Equity Program”), which, effective February 13, 2024,\nreplaced the Stock Option Grant Program for Non-employee Directors under the 2020 Plan (the “NED\nStock Option Program”). In 2023, Zillow Group compensated its eligible non-employee directors solely\nwith stock option grants under the NED Stock Option Program.\nThe following table provides information regarding the compensation of our non-employee directors\nduring 2023, including the annual option grants made to our non-employee directors in March 2023. Our\nexecutive officers Mr. Barton and Mr. Frink did not receive compensation for their Board service in 2023.\nInformation about each of Mr. Barton and Mr. Frink’s 2023 compensation is discussed in the\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis section and presented in the related tables.\nOption Awards Total\nName ($)(1) ($)\nErik Blachford 250,000 250,000\nAmy C.

Assumptions used to calculate these\namounts are described in Note 14, “Share-Based Awards,” to our financial statements included in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. On March 1, 2023, and as described in greater\ndetail below, each eligible non-employee director of Zillow Group received an annual stock option grant to\npurchase 10,353 shares of Zillow Group’s Class C capital stock with a Black-Scholes-Merton grant date fair\nvalue of $250,000, with any fractional share rounded to the nearest whole share (0.5 to be rounded up). As of\nDecember 31, 2023, Zillow Group’s non-employee directors held stock options for the following number of\nshares of Zillow Group’s Class A common stock and Class C capital stock: Mr. Blachford, 57,304 shares of\nClass C capital stock; Ms. Bohutinsky, 31,250 shares of Class A common stock and 232,417 shares of Class C\ncapital stock; Mr. Hoag, 92,903 shares of Class C capital stock; Mr. Maffei, 92,903 shares of Class C capital\nstock; Mr. Stephenson, 92,903 shares of Class C capital stock; Ms. Thielke, 24,488 shares of Class C capital\nstock, and Ms. Underwood, 64,695 shares of Class C capital stock. With respect to Ms. Bohutinsky’s holdings,\nall of her stock options for Class A common stock and 148,168 of her stock options for Class C capital stock\nwere received pursuant to equity awards granted during her employment with the Company and prior to\nher appointment to the Board.\nTime and Manner of Compensation\nUnder the NED Stock Option Program, eligible directors were previously compensated for service on our\nBoard solely with stock options. The grants made in March 2023 pursuant to the NED Stock Option\nProgram were for that number of shares of Class C capital stock having a Black-Scholes-Merton value\nof $250,000 on the date of grant — with any fractional share rounded to the nearest whole share (0.5 to\nbe rounded up) — and with a per-share exercise price equal to the closing price of our Class C capital\nstock on the date of grant. One-fourth of the shares subject to annual stock options granted in 2023\nunder the NED Stock Option Program vest each quarter over one year, subject to continued service.\nStock options granted under the NED Stock Option Program in 2023 have ten-year terms from the date\nof grant, subject to earlier termination in the event of a director’s termination of service.\n18\nPursuant to its charter, the compensation committee reviews non-employee director compensation at\nleast annually and may recommend adjustments to the Board. Effective as of February 13, 2024, the\nBoard, upon the recommendation of the compensation committee, approved the NED Equity Program,\nwhich replaced the NED Stock Option Program and includes changes to the type and amount of equity\ncompensation that eligible non-employee directors may receive.\nUnder the NED Equity Program, beginning on March 1, 2024, and on each anniversary thereafter (each an\n“Annual Grant Date”), our non-employee directors are eligible to automatically receive an award for a\nnumber of restricted stock units equal to $315,000 divided by the average closing price of a share of the\nCompany’s Class C capital stock over the 20-trading-day period ending three trading days before the\nAnnual Grant Date, with any fractional restricted stock unit rounded to the nearest whole share (0.5 to\nbe rounded up) (the “Annual RSU Award”). In addition, each eligible director may elect to forgo receiving\nall or a portion of any Annual RSU Award and instead receive a nonqualified stock option; provided that\nany such election to forgo receiving less than all of the Annual RSU Award, and instead receive a\nnonqualified stock option, shall be made in 25% increments. Eligible directors will receive 3 nonqualified\nstock options for every restricted stock unit exchanged.\nEligible directors who are initially elected or appointed to the Board during the 12-month period\nfollowing an Annual Grant Date are eligible to receive a prorated annual equity award subject to the\nsame terms described above in connection with their initial election or appointment to the Board,\nbased on the number of full calendar months that elapse between the date of the director’s initial\nelection or appointment to the Board and the next Annual Grant Date, subject to review and approval\nby the Board or the compensation committee. Prorated equity awards under the NED Equity Program\nbecome fully vested as of the first Annual Grant Date following the Board’s or the compensation\ncommittee’s approval of the grant.\nNo director receives cash compensation for service as a director, though directors are reimbursed for\nreasonable expenses incurred in connection with attending Board and committee meetings. The\ncompensation committee and the Board administer the Program. The Company has designed its non-\nemployee director compensation program to attract and retain excellent directors and align their\ninterests with the long-term interests of our shareholders. The compensation committee considers\nthird-party director compensation surveys and director compensation analysis performed by\nCompensia, and the time commitment required of Zillow Group’s directors, among other factors, when\nevaluating non-employee director compensation.\n19\nEQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION\nThe following table provides certain information as of December 31, 2023, with respect to securities\nauthorized for issuance under our equity compensation plans.

Subject to adjustment from time to time as\nprovided in the Inducement Plan, 10,000,000 shares of Class C capital stock are available for issuance\nunder the Inducement Plan. Shares issued under the Inducement Plan will be drawn from authorized\nand unissued shares of Class C capital stock. The purpose of the Inducement Plan is to attract, retain\nand motivate certain new employees of the Company and its subsidiaries by providing them with the\nopportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in the Company and to align their interests and efforts to\nthe long-term interests of the Company’s shareholders. Each award under the Inducement Plan is\nintended to qualify as an employment inducement award pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c). In\n2023, no shares were awarded under the Inducement Plan. We intend to use the Inducement Plan only if\nthe share reserve under the 2020 Plan is insufficient for new hire employee grants.\nThe Inducement Plan is administered by the compensation committee of the Board. Under the terms of\nthe Inducement Plan, the compensation committee may grant equity awards, including nonqualified\nstock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units or restricted units to new employees of the\nCompany and its subsidiaries. The Inducement Plan provides that in the event of a stock dividend, stock\nsplit or similar event, the maximum number and kind of securities available for issuance under the plan\nwill be proportionally adjusted.\nOptions under the Inducement Plan are granted with an exercise price per share of not less than 100% of\nthe fair market value of our Class C capital stock on the grant date, with the exception of substituted\noption awards granted in connection with acquisitions. Options expire no later than ten years from the\ngrant date and typically vest over a period of four years. Restricted stock units granted under the\nInducement Plan typically vest over a period of four years. Any portion of an option or restricted stock\nunit that is not vested on the date of a participant’s termination of service expires on such date.\nEmployees generally forfeit their rights to exercise vested options 3 months following their termination\nof employment or 12 months following termination by reason of death, disability or retirement.\nAugust 2022 Equity Award Actions\nOn August 3, 2022, upon the recommendation of the compensation committee of the Board, the Board\napproved adjustments to the exercise price of certain outstanding vested and unvested option awards\nfor eligible employees, which excluded the Board, the CEO and the Executive Chairman. The exercise\nprice of eligible option awards, which accounted for approximately 25% of total options outstanding,\nwas reduced to $38.78, which was the closing market price of our Class C capital stock on August 8,\n2022. No other changes were made to the terms and conditions of the eligible option awards. In\naddition, the Board approved a supplemental grant of restricted stock units to eligible employees that\nwas granted on August 8, 2022, and vests quarterly over a two-year period beginning in August 2022.\n21\nPROPOSAL 2: Ratification of the Appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as Independent Registered\nPublic Accounting Firm\nThe audit committee, which consists entirely of independent directors, has selected Deloitte & Touche\nLLP (“Deloitte”) as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending\nDecember 31, 2024.\nShareholder ratification of the appointment of Deloitte as our independent registered public\naccounting firm is not required by our Amended and Restated Bylaws (“Bylaws”) or otherwise.

Barton, Co-founder, Chief Executive Officer and Director\n• Jeremy Hofmann, Chief Financial Officer\n• Allen W. Parker, Former Chief Financial Officer\n• Lloyd D. Frink, Co-founder, Executive Chairman and President\n• Susan Daimler, President of Zillow\n• David A. Beitel, Chief Technology Officer\nAllen W. Parker was our Chief Financial Officer through May 18, 2023. Jeremy Hofmann was appointed as\nour Chief Financial Officer on May 18, 2023.\nCompensation Philosophy and Objectives\nWe believe our success largely depends on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented\nemployees to operate our Company in a dynamic and changing market. We compete with many other\ncompanies to attract and retain a skilled senior leadership team. To meet this challenge, the objectives\nof our compensation program are to:\n• attract qualified and experienced executive officers who will enable us to achieve our business\nobjectives;\n• retain and motivate our executive officers to achieve superior performance;\n• reward performance; and\n• align the interests of our executive officers with those of our shareholders by motivating our\nexecutive officers to drive long-term shareholder value.\nCompany Performance Milestones\nSignificant performance milestones for 2023 include the following:\n• In January 2023, we launched a new AI-powered feature that enables shoppers to search for\nhomes in the same way they would talk to their friends and family using natural language\nsearch.\n• In May 2023, Jeremy Hofmann was promoted to the position of Chief Financial Officer.\n• In June 2023, ShowingTime+ introduced Listing ShowcaseSM, an immersive, AI-powered\nexperience only available on Zillow.\n• In July 2023, we acquired Aryeo, Inc. (\"Aryeo\"), a software company that serves real estate\nphotographers.\n• Prior to 2023, our Board authorized the repurchase of up to $1.8 billion of our Class A common\nstock, Class C capital stock, outstanding convertible senior notes or a combination thereof. On\nJuly 31, 2023, our Board authorized an additional $750 million in such repurchases, increasing the\nauthorization under the repurchase program to $2.5 billion. In 2023, we repurchased 2,212 shares\nof Class A common stock at a weighted average price of $46.45 per share for an aggregate\npurchase price of $103 million, 7,311 shares of Class C capital stock at a weighted average price of\n$43.94 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $321 million, and $58 million aggregate\nprincipal amount of convertible senior notes. As of December 31, 2023, $770 million remained\navailable under the repurchase program.\n• In August 2023, Zillow and Redfin announced a partnership to help buyers and home builders\nconnect. Zillow Group's new-construction listings are now automatically syndicated to Redfin,\nconnecting home builders with motivated buyers on both platforms.\n• In September 2023, we acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Spruce Holdings,\nInc. and certain affiliated entities (together, \"Spruce\"), a tech-enabled title and escrow platform.\n32\n• In December 2023, Zillow acquired Enchant, LLC, dba Follow Up Boss (\"Follow Up Boss\"), a\ncustomer relationship management system that gives real estate professionals a central hub to\norganize and engage customers, close deals, and build their teams. Follow Up Boss has been a\nkey integration partner of ours for several years, and the product is widely utilized by the broader\nreal estate industry and many of our Premier Agent partners.\n• In 2023, the average monthly unique users for Zillow Group’s mobile apps and websites were 214\nmillion, down 3% year over year, while visits during 2023 were 10 billion, down 5% from the previous\nyear. The decreases were primarily driven by macro housing market factors including low\nhousing inventory, fewer new for-sale listings, increases and volatility in mortgage interest rates,\nas well as home price fluctuations.\n• We ended 2023 with accelerating quarterly year-over-year revenue growth and delivered our\nsixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year Residential revenue growth, outperforming the\nresidential real estate industry during the same period.\nHow We Set Executive Compensation\nThe compensation committee of our Board is generally responsible for setting our overall executive\ncompensation strategy and for making decisions relating to executive compensation. This includes\nestablishing and annually reviewing the compensation of our executive officers and overseeing our\nequity plans to ensure that our total compensation program is reasonable and competitive. Our\nexecutive compensation program primarily comprises base salaries, equity compensation, and health\nand welfare benefits generally consistent with those provided to our other salaried employees. The\ncompensation committee adopted the Zillow Group, Inc. U.S. Executive Severance Plan and Summary\nPlan Description in 2020 (as amended, the \"Severance Plan\") to promote consistency of severance in\nthe event of certain qualifying terminations of employment of our executive officers. The Severance\nPlan is described below under \"Executive Severance Plan.\"\nIn setting 2023 executive compensation, our compensation committee generally relied on its collective\nexperience and knowledge, its past practices, our overall performance, market data and consultant\nrecommendations described below, and other considerations it deemed relevant. For 2023, Mr. Barton,\nMr. Frink, and Mr. Spaulding recommended to the compensation committee base salary adjustments\nand amounts of equity awards for our executive officers (other than for themselves), and advised the\ncompensation committee regarding our compensation program’s ability to attract, retain, and\nmotivate executive talent. Their recommendations reflected compensation levels that they believed\nwere commensurate with an executive officer’s individual qualifications, experience, level of\nresponsibility, knowledge, skills, and individual performance, as well as our resources and performance.\nThe compensation committee engaged Compensia to recommend a peer group for the purpose of\nconducting a market analysis of the total compensation of our executive officers and to provide\nrecommendations for the compensation committee’s consideration with respect to the salary and\nequity compensation of our executive officers for 2023. Compensia provided total direct compensation\nanalysis reports for our executive officers derived from publicly available information and survey data\ntaken from a number of selected peer companies. The peer companies selected were identified\namong companies operating in the real estate and technology sectors. The data provided included,\namong other items, 75th, 60th, 50th and 25th percentile base salary, long-term equity incentive levels,\nand target total direct compensation levels for executive officers of the peer group. Consistent with\nprior years, the compensation committee did not target the foregoing elements of compensation to\nany specific percentiles identified in the peer company data but rather used the data as a preliminary\ncomparison point for context and as one factor among many in determining 2023 base salary\nadjustments and equity awards. In addition to the Compensia report, the compensation committee\nconsidered market survey information available through Comptryx and Radford as reference points for\n2023 executive compensation decisions.\n33\nThe peer group for which Compensia provided data in 2022 that was reviewed by the compensation\ncommittee in connection with determining our executive officers’ 2023 base salaries and equity award\nsizes consisted of the following companies:\nCoStar Group, Inc. Robinhood Markets, Inc.\nDoorDash, Inc. SoFi Technologies, Inc.\nDropbox, Inc. Splunk Inc.\nEtsy, Inc. SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc.\nExpedia, Inc. Take Two interactive Software, Inc.\nFortinet, Inc. Tyler Technologies, Inc.\nIAC/InterActiveCorp Verisign, Inc.\nPinterest, Inc. Workday, Inc.\nRedfin Corporation X Corp\nTo help ensure continued appropriateness of the peer group, the compensation committee updated\nthe peer group in 2022 to use for 2023 compensation planning to reflect changes in our business and to\nreassess market cap and industry benchmarks in line with our evolving business model. Four\ncompanies (Invitation Homes Inc., Match Group, ServiceNow, Inc., and Zynga, Inc.) were removed from\nthe prior year's list and two new peer companies were added (Robinhood Markets, Inc. and SoFi\nTechnologies, Inc.) that more closely align with our industry and financial performance and position.\nConsideration of the Say-on-Pay Vote\nWe last held a non-binding, advisory vote to approve the compensation of our named executive\nofficers, commonly referred to as the \"say-on-pay\" vote, at our 2021 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, as\nrequired by Section 14A of the Exchange Act. Our advisory resolution to approve the compensation of\nour named executive officers received substantial majority support from shareholders with\napproximately 94% \"For\" votes. We take this result as support that our executive compensation program\nand practices are reasonable and well-aligned with shareholder expectations. Nevertheless, we review\nour overall approach to executive compensation periodically and we expect that the specific direction,\nemphasis, and components of our executive compensation program will continue to evolve as will our\nprocess for establishing executive compensation. We intend to continue to hold an advisory vote on the\ncompensation of our named executive officers every third year, including this year. We believe that\nholding this vote every three years provides us with appropriate feedback on our compensation\ndecisions for our named executive officers while also providing an appropriate time period to respond\nto the prior say-on-pay vote. We are conducting another say-on-pay advisory vote at this year's Annual\nMeeting. Proposal 3 contains information about the say-on-pay advisory vote being conducted at this\nyear's Annual Meeting.\nIn compliance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we will next hold a vote on the frequency of such\nadvisory vote regarding compensation of our named executive officers at our annual meeting to be\nheld in 2027. We are and will remain committed to being responsive to shareholder feedback, and the\nresults of our say-on-pay votes will help inform the compensation committee's discussions about the\nexecutive compensation program.\nElements of Executive Compensation\nFor 2023, our executive compensation program primarily included base salaries, and equity\ncompensation in the form of stock options, restricted stock units, and restricted units. Historically,\nincluding for 2023, compensation decisions for our executive officers have been individualized and\nbased on a variety of factors. In particular, we have emphasized the use of equity to incentivize our\nexecutive officers to focus on our growth and drive long-term shareholder value. To date, the\n34\ncompensation committee has not adopted any formal or informal policies for allocating compensation\nbetween long-term and short-term compensation or between cash and equity compensation.\nBase Salaries. Base salaries provide our executive officers with a fixed amount of consistent\ncompensation and, in conjunction with equity awards, are a significant motivating factor in attracting\nand retaining our executive officers. We have designed base salaries to be competitive while also being\nmindful of our cash resources.\nWhen an executive officer is first hired, base salary is generally established through individual\nnegotiations between the Company and the individual, taking into account subjective judgments as to\nthe executive officer’s qualifications, experience, job duties and responsibilities, prior salary, and internal\npay equity comparisons.\nThe compensation committee annually reviews the base salaries of our executive officers. Adjustments\nto salaries generally become effective following completion of our annual performance review process\nin the first quarter of each year. The annual review process generally includes a comprehensive self-\nperformance review by employees as well as manager, direct report, and peer feedback. In 2023,\nannual base salary adjustments approved by our compensation committee became effective as of\nFebruary 9, 2023.\nAdjustments to base salaries may also occur at other times during the year for promotions or\nperformance, including, for example, Mr. Hofmann's May 2023 base salary adjustment in connection\nwith his promotion to Chief Financial Officer. In 2023, salary adjustments were primarily based on a\nsubjective evaluation of each individual's performance, both historical and anticipated, review of\ncomparative market data, internal pay equity, and the other factors described above. Overall, salary\nincreases for 2023 reflected levels that the compensation committee believed were commensurate\nwith the comparative responsibilities, leadership roles, and performance of each named executive\nofficer.\nThe following table provides information about 2023 base salary adjustments for the named executive\nofficers.\nTotal 2023\nDecember 2022 Base Salary Total 2023 Base\nBase Salary Increase Salary % Increase over 2022\nName ($) ($) ($) Base Salary\nRichard N. Barton 706,855 70,685 777,540 10.00 %\nJeremy Hofmann 349,886 250,114 (1) 600,000 71.48 %\nAllen W. Parker 662,327 52,986 715,313 8.00 %\nLloyd D.

Beitel 656,019 59,042 715,061 9.00 %\n(1) Amount includes an annual base salary adjustment in the amount of $104,966 effective February 2023 and\n$145,148 effective May 2023 in connection with Mr. Hofmann's promotion to Chief Financial Officer of the Company.\nIncentive Cash Bonuses. We have not established a formal cash incentive program for our executive\nofficers. Instead we have relied primarily on the long-term incentive value of equity-based\ncompensation.\nEquity-Based Compensation. Since our inception, equity-based compensation has been an integral\ncomponent of our compensation program for most employees in order to retain and recognize their\nefforts on behalf of the Company. Since 2015, all equity awards granted under the Company's equity\ncompensation plans have been granted for Class C capital stock rather than Class A common stock.\nOur Board and our compensation committee believe that stock options and restricted stock units have\nplayed and continue to play a significant role in our ability to attract, motivate, and incentivize the\nexecutive talent necessary to accomplish our business objectives. We believe that stock options and\nrestricted stock units also provide our employees with a significant long-term interest in our success by\nrewarding the creation of shareholder value, as the value of stock options and restricted stock units are\n35\nboth positively impacted by appreciation in the price of the Company’s stock following their grant. We\nview equity-based compensation on a per-headcount basis and as a percentage of revenue, and\nbalance against the operating environment, competitive pay, shareholder value, and impact of dilution.\nWe take all of these factors into consideration as we decide on share-based compensation levels each\nyear. In future periods, we currently expect our share-based compensation expense to decrease as\nexisting awards continue to vest over their respective periods and we focus on mitigating dilution as we\nissue new awards.\nIn March 2016, the Company established an equity choice program pursuant to which employees,\nincluding our named executive officers, may choose whether to receive the value of equity awards in\nstock options, restricted stock units, or a combination of the two.\nIn August 2022, upon recommendation by the compensation committee to further incentivize eligible\nemployees, including our executive officers (other than Mr. Barton and Mr. Frink), and address retention\nefforts in light of heightened attrition following the announcement of the wind down of our Zillow Offers\noperations, the Board approved adjustments to the exercise prices of certain outstanding vested and\nunvested stock option awards previously issued between September 1, 2020, and March 31, 2022 (the\n\"Previously Granted Awards\"). The repricing excluded any stock option awards previously issued to the\nCompany's Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman, other Board members, and certain other distinctive\ncategories of employees as determined by management. In addition, the Board also approved the\nissuance of a supplemental grant of shares of Class C capital stock, denominated as restricted stock\nunits and not subject to the Company's equity choice program, with vesting to occur quarterly over a\ntwo-year period, to eligible recipients of the Previously Granted Awards (excluding Mr. Barton, Mr. Frink,\nand other Board members). Additional information about the option repricing and supplemental\nrestricted stock unit awards for certain of our named executive officers is discussed further below and\nin the 2023 Compensation Tables.\nFor all awards granted in 2023, individuals who elected stock options for any portion of their award\npursuant to the Company's equity choice program, were granted stock options at the customary\nconversion rate of three options for every restricted stock unit that would otherwise be granted.\nFor awards in which individuals elected stock options for any portion of their annual equity awards\ngranted in March 2021, the compensation committee approved an amendment to the equity choice\nprogram to provide an exception to the customary conversion rate to allow for five options for every\nrestricted stock unit that would otherwise be granted.\nWe do not apply a formula to determine the size of individual equity awards granted to our named\nexecutive officers. Instead, our compensation committee generally determines the size or value of\nindividual grants using its collective business judgment and experience, taking into account, among\nother factors, the role and responsibility of the individual executive officer, the competitive market for\nthe executive officer’s position, the size and value of existing equity awards, and a subjective evaluation\nof individual performance and prior contributions to us. Based upon these factors, the compensation\ncommittee sets the size of each equity award at a level it considers appropriate to create a meaningful\nincentive. No specific weight is given to any one of the foregoing factors, although larger awards are\ntypically granted to executive officers with duties and responsibilities that are more likely to have a\nlarger impact on the creation of long-term shareholder value.\nAs discussed above, the compensation committee considered compensation data from peer\ncompanies as a reference point and as one factor among many in connection with the equity grants\nto our executive officers in 2023. In the future, the compensation committee may continue to consider\ncompetitive market data as a tool to determine equity award grant amounts for our executive officers.\nOur executive officers generally receive an initial equity award in connection with their commencement\nof employment or upon election or appointment to an executive officer role. Following each annual\nperformance review, we typically grant additional equity awards to eligible employees, including our\nnamed executive officers, in the first quarter of the year. The compensation committee may grant\nadditional equity awards from time to time to retain executive officers and/or reward them for\n36\npromotions or performance and to stay competitive with our peer group and other competitive market\ndata.\nStock options granted to our executive officers generally have a ten-year term and vest over a four-\nyear period in accordance with the Company’s predetermined quarterly vesting schedule, subject to\nthe executive officer’s continued employment. We grant stock options with an exercise price equal to\nthe closing price of the Class C capital stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on the grant date.\nRestricted stock units also vest based on continued employment with us, generally over four years,\nthereby encouraging the retention of our executive officers. New hire equity grants typically vest 25%\nafter one year and thereafter in quarterly installments while annual and promotion grants typically vest\nquarterly over four years. In March 2023, following our annual performance review process, each of our\nnamed executive officers elected to receive either a stock option grant, a restricted stock unit grant, or\na combination of a stock option grant and restricted stock unit grant under our equity choice program\nfor the number of shares of Class C capital stock set forth below (the \"2023 Annual Awards\"). The 2023\nAnnual Awards received by each of Mr. Parker, Ms. Daimler and Mr. Beitel vest quarterly over a three-year\nperiod and the 2023 Annual Awards received by each of Mr. Barton and Mr. Frink vest quarterly over a\nfour-year period, as further described in the 2023 Grants of Plan Based Awards Table below. The number\nof shares subject to the options reported below for the 2023 Annual Awards, reflects a conversion rate\nof three options for every restricted stock unit that would otherwise be granted, based on each\nindividual's election, as described above for 2023 annual equity grants to employees.\nName Stock Option (# shares) Restricted Stock Units (# shares)\nRichard N. Barton 1,087,500 —\nAllen W. Parker — 95,000\nLloyd D. Frink 862,500 —\nSusan Daimler 142,500 47,500\nDavid A. Beitel 213,750 23,750\nIn March 2023, prior to his appointment as an executive officer of the Company and following our\nannual performance review, Mr. Hofmann received an annual equity award under our equity choice\nprogram for that number of shares of Class C capital stock set forth below (the \"2023 Hofmann Annual\nAward\"). In May 2023, the compensation committee granted Mr. Hofmann an additional equity award in\nconnection with his promotion to Chief Financial Officer of the Company, for that number of shares of\nClass C capital stock set forth below (the \"2023 Hofmann Promotion Award\"). The 2023 Hofmann Annual\nAward vests quarterly over a three-year period and the 2023 Hofmann Promotion Award vests quarterly\nover a four-year period, as further described in the 2023 Grants of Plan Based Awards Table below. The\nnumber of stock options and restricted stock units set forth below for the 2023 Hofmann Annual Award\nand the 2023 Hofmann Promotion Award, reflect Mr. Hofmann's election under our equity choice\nprogram, with the number of options subject to the 2023 Hofmann Promotion Award receiving a\nconversion rate of three options for every restricted stock unit that would otherwise be granted.\nAward Stock Options (# shares) Restricted Stock Units (# shares)\n2023 Hofmann Annual\n— 65,000\nAward\n2023 Hofmann Promotion\n187,500 62,500\nAward\nThe foregoing grant sizes reflected the compensation committee’s assessment of grant amounts it felt\nappropriate to recognize each executive officer's level of responsibilities and contributions during the\npast year and to retain and incentivize them for the future. Additional information about the grants to\nthe named executive officers is contained below in the “2023 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table.”\nOther Benefits. Our named executive officers receive health and welfare benefits under the same\nbroad-based benefit plans as our other salaried employees. These benefits include medical, dental,\n37\nand vision benefits, short-term and long-term disability insurance, accidental death and\ndismemberment insurance, basic life insurance, and eligibility to participate in our 401(k) Plan. In 2023,\nwe maintained our donation match program that matches any employee donation to a qualifying\nnon-profit organization up to $250, dollar-for-dollar per year. We do not view perquisites or other\npersonal benefits as a significant component of our executive compensation program.\nWe generally do not provide perquisites to our executive officers, except in situations where we believe\nit is appropriate to assist an individual in the performance of their duties, to make our executive officers\nmore efficient, effective, and available for Company business, for recruitment or retention purposes, or\nto be consistent with benefits provided to other full-time employees. During 2023, certain of our named\nexecutive officers received parking and related partial tax gross-ups, the aggregate value of which was\nless than $10,000 for each named executive officer. In addition, we maintain fractional ownership\ninterests in aircraft, which provide the Company with a certain number of yearly flight hours per\nairplane that are intended primarily for business travel. Beginning in 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic\nresulted in a significant decrease in business travel, the Company began permitting certain executive\nofficers to use excess aircraft hours for personal travel. In connection with any personal use, executive\nofficers are required to reimburse the Company for all aggregate incremental costs incurred in\nconnection with the flights. The aggregate incremental costs are based on the cost to us of the\nparticular flights, including the applicable hourly rate for the aircraft and any variable costs of the\nflights, such as fuel costs, catering, ground transportation, and related taxes. The amount reimbursed\nexcludes fixed costs that do not change based on actual usage, such as the monthly management fee.\nNo amounts are reported in the Summary Compensation Table for this aircraft use by any named\nexecutive officers since the amounts equal to the aggregate incremental cost were fully reimbursed to\nus by the named executive officers who used the aircraft.\nEmployment and Separation Agreements. We may enter into employment agreements or separation\nagreements with our executive officers from time to time. As a condition to receiving any severance\npayments or benefits, an executive officer must execute, and not revoke, a general release and waiver\nof claims against us in a form satisfactory to us. The executive officer also must continue to comply with\nthe terms of their Proprietary Rights Agreement or Confidential Information, Inventions, Nonsolicitation\nand Noncompetition Agreement or other applicable agreement (the \"Confidentiality Agreement\").\nWe currently have a Severance Plan that applies to U.S. employees at the level of Vice President and\nabove, pursuant to which certain benefits are payable in connection with a qualifying termination of\nemployment, described below. We do not provide any tax gross-ups to cover personal income taxes\nthat may apply to any severance or change of control benefits, other than in connection with COBRA\ncontinuation benefits.\nMr. Parker. We entered into an employment agreement, effective as of November 6, 2018, with Mr.\nParker. In connection with Mr. Parker stepping down as Chief Financial Officer of the Company, effective\nMay 18, 2023, we entered into an Executive Departure Agreement and Release with Mr. Parker (the \"Parker\nDeparture Agreement\"), which superseded his employment agreement. From May 18, 2023, through\nFebruary 15, 2024, Mr. Parker served as an advisor and continued to receive his existing base salary,\nremained eligible to participate in the Company’s health and welfare benefit plans, and his Company\nstock options and restricted stock units continued to vest under their existing terms and conditions.\nOn February 15, 2024, Mr. Parker became eligible to receive certain severance benefits under the Parker\nDeparture Agreement consistent with the severance benefits provided to other senior executive officers\nof the Company. Additional information about Mr. Parker's severance is contained below in the \"Potential\nPayments Upon Termination or Change of Control Table\".\nThe Parker Departure Agreement provides for customary general releases and waivers of claims by Mr.\nParker against the Company. Mr. Parker remains subject to his obligations under his Confidentiality\nAgreement and that certain Mutual Agreement to Arbitrate Claims, dated as of December 19, 2018.\nExecutive Severance Plan. The compensation committee of the Board of Zillow Group approved and\nadopted the Severance Plan for U.S. employees of Zillow Group and its wholly-owned subsidiaries at the\nlevel of Vice President and above, including Zillow Group’s executive officers.\n38\nThe Severance Plan provides for the payment of severance and other benefits to eligible employees in\nthe event of a termination of employment by Zillow Group or a wholly-owned subsidiary (other than for\ndeath, disability, or cause) or by the employee for good reason (each an “Involuntary Termination,” with\nthe terms “disability,” “cause,” and “good reason” defined in the Severance Plan). In the event of an\nInvoluntary Termination and subject to the employee’s execution and non-revocation of a separation\nand release of claims agreement, the Severance Plan provides the following payments and benefits to\nthe executive officers based on such executive officer's title and level with Tier 1 severance benefits\napplicable to executive officers serving in \"Executive 6\" level and with the title \"Chief Executive\nOfficer\" (\"Tier 1\") and Tier 2 severance benefits applicable to employees of the Company serving in\n“Executive 5” level and with a title that starts with “Chief” or “President” (\"Tier 2\"):\n• Continued payment of base salary for six months after the date of the employee’s Involuntary\nTermination for Tier 1 and Tier 2;\n• Payment for six months after the date of the employee's Involuntary Termination equal to the\nmonthly COBRA premium the employee would otherwise be required to pay for such coverage\nfor the employee and any spouse and dependents of the employee, regardless of whether the\nemployee elects such COBRA continuation coverage after termination for Tier 1 and Tier 2;\n• Accelerated vesting of equity awards that vest solely based on continued service by an\nadditional twelve months for Tier 1 and Tier 2, except that such equity awards will become fully\nvested in connection with an Involuntary Termination that occurs on or following a Company\nTransaction (as defined in the Severance Plan); and\n• An extension of time to exercise vested stock options until the earlier of (i) twenty-four months\nafter the date of an Involuntary Termination for Tier 1 and eighteen months for Tier 2 and (ii) the\nexpiration date of the original maximum term of the option.\nAs a condition to receiving the foregoing severance benefits, eligible employees are subject to a non-\ndisparagement covenant following separation from employment with the Company.\nIf an eligible employee is entitled to any severance, change of control or similar benefits outside the\nSeverance Plan by operation of applicable law or under another Company-sponsored plan, policy,\ncontract, or arrangement, benefits under the Severance Plan will be reduced by the corresponding\nvalue of such benefits in accordance with the terms of the Severance Plan. If an eligible employee is\nentitled to receive severance, change of control or similar benefits outside the Severance Plan that are\nmore advantageous to the employee than the terms of the Severance Plan, the employee will continue\nto be entitled to such benefits.\nThe Severance Plan does not provide for any gross-up payments to offset excise taxes that may be\nimposed by Code Section 4999 on excess parachute payments within the meaning of Code Section\n280G. If any payments or benefits payable under the Severance Plan or otherwise would be subject to\nan excise tax, Zillow Group will pay to the employee either (a) the full amount of such payments or\nbenefits or (b) the full amount reduced by the minimum amount necessary to prevent any portion from\nbeing an excess parachute payment, whichever results, on an after-tax basis, in the greater amount\npayable to the employee.\nIncentive Compensation Recoupment Policy\nThe Board of Directors has adopted, and delegated authority to the compensation committee to\nadminister, the Company's Incentive Compensation Recoupment Policy (the \"Clawback Policy\"), which\naligns with the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and\nrelated exchange listing standards. We are also subject to the clawback provisions for the Chief\nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which provide that\nthose executives must reimburse the Company for any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-\n39\nbased compensation received during the 12-month period following the preparation of an accounting\nrestatement as a result of misconduct.\nRisk Assessment of Compensation Programs\nThe compensation committee does not believe that our incentive compensation programs described\nabove contain incentives for our named executive officers or other employees to take risks in\nperforming their duties that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company,\nparticularly in light of the compensation committee’s historical emphasis on equity vehicles, such as\nstock options and restricted stock units, which it believes reward sustained long-term performance that\nis aligned with our shareholders’ interests.\nStock Ownership Guidelines\nAll of our executive officers hold either shares and/or stock-based equity awards, which we believe help\nalign their interests with those of our shareholders. As a result, at this time, our Board has not adopted\nformal stock ownership guidelines for the named executive officers, although it may consider doing so\nin the future.\nHedging and Pledging Policy\nWe have established an insider trading compliance policy that applies to all our directors, executive\nofficers, employees and consultants (the \"Insider Trading Policy\"). The Insider Trading Policy prohibits\nshort sales and strongly discourages and requires pre-approval from the General Counsel of, among\nother actions, any hedging of stock ownership positions or similar monetization transactions, such as\nzero cost collars, prepaid variable forward sale contracts, equity swaps and exchange funds. Any\nperson seeking such approval must provide a justification for the transaction. The Insider Trading Policy\nfurther prohibits holding Company securities in a margin account or pledging Company securities as\ncollateral for a loan. A limited exception applies if approved by the General Counsel for an individual\nseeking to pledge Company securities as collateral for a loan (not including margin debt) who can\nclearly demonstrate to the Company the financial capacity to repay the loan without resort to the\npledged securities.\n40\nCOMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT\nThe compensation committee of our Board of Directors has reviewed and discussed the Compensation\nDiscussion and Analysis with management, and based on such review and discussions, the\ncompensation committee recommended to our Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion\nand Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement.\nMembers of the compensation committee:\nJay C.

These arrangements are\ndescribed below.\n2020 and 2011 Plans. Our 2020 Plan and our 2011 Plan (the \"Plans\") provide that in the event of a change\nof control that qualifies as a company transaction (such as a merger and as further defined below),\noutstanding stock options and other equity awards that vest based on continued employment or\nservice will only become fully vested and immediately exercisable to the extent they are not converted,\nassumed, substituted for, or replaced by the surviving or successor company (including a parent\ncompany thereof). In the event of a change of control that is not a company transaction (such as a\nchange in a majority of our Board), all equity awards granted under the Plans will become fully vested\n48\nand immediately exercisable. The Plans generally define “change of control” as the occurrence of any of\nthe following events:\n• an acquisition by a person or entity of beneficial ownership of more than 50% of the combined\nvoting power of our outstanding voting securities (generally excluding any acquisition directly\nfrom Zillow Group, any acquisition by Zillow Group, any acquisition by an employee benefit plan\nof Zillow Group or a related company, any acquisition by holders of our Class B common stock\nas of July 19, 2011, provided such holder then beneficially owns no less than 25% of our\noutstanding voting securities, or an acquisition pursuant to certain related party transactions);\n• a change in the composition of the Board during any two-year period such that the individuals\nwho, as of the beginning of such two-year period, constitute the Board (the “Incumbent Board”)\ncease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board (excluding directors whose\nelection, or nomination for election, was approved by a majority of the Incumbent Board); or\n• the consummation of a company transaction, which is generally defined as a merger or\nconsolidation, a statutory share exchange or a sale, lease, exchange or other transfer in one\ntransaction or a series of related transactions of all or substantially all of our assets, unless\n(a) after such transaction the beneficial owners of outstanding voting securities immediately\nprior to the transaction retain at least 50% of the combined voting power of such securities of\nthe company resulting from the transaction, (b) no entity beneficially owns more than 50% of the\ncombined voting power of the company resulting from such transaction, and (c) the individuals\nwho were members of the Incumbent Board will immediately after the consummation of such\ntransaction constitute at least a majority of the members of the board of directors of the\ncompany resulting from such transaction.\nEmployment and Separation Agreements. Mr. Parker previously had an employment agreement with\nus that terminated in connection with the effectiveness of the Parker Departure Agreement.\nSeverance Plan. The Severance Plan provides for the payment of severance and other benefits to\neligible U.S. employees, including the named executive officers, in the event of a termination of\nemployment by Zillow Group or a wholly-owned subsidiary (other than for death, disability, or cause) or\nby the employee for good reason (each an “Involuntary Termination,” with the terms “disability,” “cause,”\nand “good reason” as defined in the Severance Plan). As a condition to receiving any severance\npayments or benefits, eligible employees must execute, and not revoke, a general release and waiver of\nclaims against us in a form satisfactory to us and must continue to comply with the terms of their\nConfidentiality Agreement.\nA description of the severance payments and benefits under the Severance Plan are described above\nin the section titled “Compensation Discussion and Analysis - Elements of Executive Compensation -\nExecutive Severance Plan.”\nFor purposes of the Severance Plan, “change of control” has the meaning set forth above for the Plans.\n“Cause” generally means one or more of the following by the executive officers:\n• willful misconduct, insubordination, or dishonesty in the performance of duties or a knowing and\nmaterial violation of our or, as applicable, a successor employer’s policies and procedures that\nresults in a material adverse effect on us or a successor employer (which includes a parent\nthereof);\n• continued failure to satisfactorily perform duties after receipt of written notice from us;\n• willful actions in bad faith or intentional failures to act in good faith that materially impair our or\na successor employer’s business, goodwill, or reputation;\n• conviction of a felony or misdemeanor, conduct that we reasonably believe violates any statute,\nrule, or regulation governing us, or conduct that we reasonably believe constitutes unethical\npractices, dishonesty, or disloyalty and that results in a material adverse effect on us or a\nsuccessor employer;\n• current use of illegal substances; or\n• any material violation of any employment agreement or our Confidentiality Agreement (or\nsimilar agreement to which the executive officer is a party).\n49\nThe Severance Plan generally defines “good reason” as one or more of the following conditions without\nthe executive officer’s express, written consent, provided that the executive officer provides timely\nnotice of such condition to us and we have the opportunity to cure such condition prior to the executive\nofficer’s termination of employment:\n• a material reduction in authority, duties, or responsibilities;\n• a material reduction in annual salary (except for a reduction in connection with a general\nreduction in annual salary for all executive officers by an average percentage that is not less\nthan the percentage reduction of the executive officer’s annual salary);\n• a material breach of any employment agreement (or offer letter) by us or a successor\nemployer; or\n• relocation of more than 50 miles from the executive officer’s then current place of residence in\norder to continue to perform the duties and responsibilities of the position (not including\ncustomary travel as may be required by the nature of the position).\nPotential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control Table\nThe following table shows the estimated value of payments and benefits upon termination of\nemployment or a change of control that would have accrued to the named executive officers, based\non the Severance Plan, if (i) their employment was terminated without cause or they terminated\nemployment for good reason, (ii) we completed a change of control or a company transaction, as\napplicable, in which outstanding equity awards were not assumed or substituted by the surviving or\nsuccessor company (or a parent company thereof), or (iii) their employment was terminated without\ncause or by the named executive officers for good reason in connection with or following a change of\ncontrol in which stock options were assumed or substituted.\nThe amounts in the table assume that the termination of employment, change of control, or company\ntransaction was effective as of December 31, 2023.

We determined our\nemployee population for purposes of calculating the pay ratio by excluding all non-U.S. employees, all\nof whom are located in Australia, Canada, Mexico, and Serbia, and those employed by companies that\nwe acquired in 2023. As of December 31, 2023, one employee was located in Australia, 50 employees\nwere located in Canada, 46 employees were located in Mexico, and 145 employees were located in\nSerbia, which together constituted approximately 3.9% of our total employee population. In addition, we\nexcluded the approximately 3% of our total employee population as of December, 31, 2023, that joined\nZillow Group in 2023 as a result of the acquisitions of Aryeo, Spruce, and Follow Up Boss, including 188\nemployees located in the United States and one employee located in Australia.\nAfter excluding these employees and our CEO, we determined the median employee for 2023 from an\nemployee population of 5,832, based on a comparison of (i) total cash compensation as reflected in\nour payroll records and as reported to the Internal Revenue Service on Form W-2 for 2023, (ii) aggregate\ngrant date fair value of option awards and restricted stock units granted in 2023, computed in\naccordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, and (iii) matching Company contributions under the Zillow Group\n401(k) Plan. We did not annualize compensation of employees who were hired during 2023 or make any\ncost-of-living adjustments in identifying the median employee.\nFor purposes of this pay ratio, both the CEO's and the median employee's annual total compensation\nwere calculated in accordance with the requirements of the Summary Compensation Table. As a result,\nfor 2023, the annual total compensation of our median employee was $182,082 and the annual total\ncompensation of our CEO, based on the methodology described above, was $26,362,827. Based on this\ninformation, for 2023, the estimated ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median of\nthe annual total compensation of all other employees was 145 to 1.\nOur pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules. The SEC’s rules\nfor identifying the median employee, calculating annual total compensation, and determining the pay\nratio allow companies to use different methodologies, exemptions, estimates, and assumptions.\nTherefore, our pay ratio disclosure may not be comparable to that reported by other companies, as\nother companies not only have different employee populations and compensation practices, but also\nmay utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates, and assumptions in calculating their own pay\nratios.\n57\nCERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS\nWe describe below transactions and series of similar transactions to which we were a party during our\nlast fiscal year or which are currently proposed, and in which:\n• the amounts involved exceeded or will exceed $120,000; and\n• any of our directors, executive officers, or beneficial owners of more than 5% of any class of our\nvoting securities, or any member of the immediate family of the foregoing persons, had or will\nhave a direct or indirect material interest.\nIndemnification of Officers and Directors\nWe entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and certain of our executive\nofficers which provide, among other things, that we will indemnify such director or officer, under the\ncircumstances and to the extent provided for therein, for expenses, damages, judgments, fines, and\nsettlements they may be required to pay in actions or proceedings to which they are or may be made\na party by reason of their position as a director, officer, or other agent of Zillow Group, and otherwise to\nthe fullest extent permitted under Washington law and our Bylaws.\nAircraft Charter Agreements\nOn April 3, 2019, the Company and Executive Jet Management, Inc. (“EJM”) entered into a Charter Service\nAgreement, as may be amended from time to time (“Charter Agreement #1”) for the occasional use by\nthe Company of an aircraft owned by an entity that is owned by Lloyd D. Frink. Under Charter\nAgreement #1, the Company may charter the aircraft through EJM for business travel at a pre-\ndetermined rate per flight hour, which is currently set at $14,650 per flight hour, plus certain additional\ncosts. The rate per flight hour increased from $6,400 to $14,650 per flight hour based on changes to\ncurrent market rates. As the aircraft owner, Mr. Frink receives substantially all of the charter fees we pay\nto EJM, net of any fees retained by EJM and related aircraft operating expenses. In addition, the\nCompany entered into an Aircraft Time Sharing Agreement with Mr. Frink on October 3, 2022, as may be\namended from time to time (\"Time Sharing Agreement #1\") for a similar purpose, pursuant to which the\nCompany may lease the aircraft for business travel and pay certain time-sharing costs. Charter\nAgreement #1 and Time Sharing Agreement #1 were each approved in accordance with our Related\nPerson Transaction Policy.

Barton. Under Charter Agreement #2, the\nCompany may charter the aircraft through EJM for business travel at a pre-determined rate per flight\nhour, which is currently set at $14,650 per flight hour, plus certain additional costs. The rate per flight hour\nincreased from $6,400 to $14,650 per flight hour based on changes to current market rates. As the\naircraft owner, Mr. Barton receives substantially all of the charter fees we pay to EJM, net of any fees\nretained by EJM and related aircraft operating expenses. In addition, the Company entered into an\nAircraft Time Sharing Agreement with Mr. Barton on December 14, 2022, as may be amended from time\nto time (\"Time Sharing Agreement #2\") for a similar purpose, pursuant to which the Company may lease\nthe aircraft for business travel and pay certain time-sharing costs. Charter Agreement #2 and Time\nSharing Agreement #2 were each approved in accordance with our Related Person Transaction Policy.\nWe recognized an aggregate amount of $132,269 in business travel expenses pursuant to Charter\nAgreement #2 and no business travel expenses pursuant to Time Sharing Agreement #2 for the year\nended December 31, 2023.\nEmployment of Executive Officer’s Family Members\nOn February 19, 2021, Susan Daimler became an executive officer of the Company in connection with her\nappointment as President of Zillow. Ms. Daimler’s spouse is a non-executive officer of the Company who\nserves as Senior Vice President, Product, reporting to Jeremy Wacksman, our Chief Operating Officer,\nand was employed by the Company during 2023.

Beginning January 17, 2023, Mr.\nParker's son is a non-executive officer of the Company who serves as a software development engineer\nwithin our engineering organization. In connection with his employment during 2023, Mr. Parker's son\nreceived $418,253, comprised of $121,875 in base salary, a portion of a sign-on bonus in the amount of\n$15,000 and $281,378 in aggregate grant date fair value of equity compensation (computed in\naccordance with FASB ASC Topic 718). Such equity compensation included a stock option award to\nacquire 10,887 shares of Class C capital stock.\nOther than as described above in this section, since the beginning of our last fiscal year, we have not\nentered into any transactions, nor are there any currently proposed transactions, between us and a\nrelated party where the amount involved exceeds, or would exceed, $120,000, and in which any related\nperson had or will have a direct or indirect material interest.\nPolicies and Procedures for the Review and Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related\nPersons\nOur Board has adopted a written policy that sets forth the policies and procedures for the review and\napproval or ratification of related person transactions. Under the policy, all of our directors and\nexecutive officers and all of our beneficial owners of more than 5% of our Class A common stock, Class B\ncommon stock, or other voting securities are expected to disclose to our General Counsel the material\nfacts of any transaction that could potentially be considered a related person transaction promptly on\ngaining knowledge that the transaction may occur or has occurred. The audit committee is authorized\nto administer the policy, and may amend, modify, and interpret the policy. A related person transaction\ngenerally is defined under the policy as any transaction required to be disclosed under the SEC’s related\nperson transaction disclosure requirement of Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.\nAny potential related person transaction reported to or otherwise made known to the General Counsel\nwill be reviewed under the policy according to the following procedures:\n• If the General Counsel determines that disclosure of the transaction in our annual proxy\nstatement or annual report on Form 10-K is not required under the SEC’s related person\ntransaction disclosure requirement, the transaction will be deemed approved and will be\nreported to the audit committee at its next scheduled meeting.\n• If disclosure of the transaction in our annual proxy statement or annual report on Form 10-K is\nrequired under the SEC’s related person transaction disclosure requirement, the General\nCounsel will submit the transaction to the chairperson of the audit committee, who will review\nand, if authorized, will determine whether to approve or ratify the transaction. The chairperson is\nauthorized to approve or ratify any related person transaction involving an aggregate amount\nof less than $250,000 or when it would not be practicable in the judgment of the chairperson\nand General Counsel to wait for the next audit committee meeting to review the transaction.\nThe chairperson is not authorized to review a related person transaction in which the\nchairperson is involved.\n• If the transaction is outside the chairperson’s authority, the chairperson will submit the\ntransaction to the audit committee for review and approval or ratification at its next regularly\nscheduled meeting or, if deemed necessary by the General Counsel or the chairperson, as\napplicable, at a special meeting of the audit committee called for this purpose or in a written\nconsent submitted to the committee in accordance with Zillow Group’s Amended and Restated\nBylaws.\n• If the transaction to be reviewed and acted upon by the audit committee involves a member of\nthe audit committee (including the chairperson), the involved member shall recuse themselves\nfrom deliberations related to the transaction and the other members of the audit committee\nshall take appropriate action.\n59\nWhen determining whether to approve or ratify a related person transaction, the chairperson of the\naudit committee or the audit committee, as applicable, will review relevant facts regarding the related\nperson transaction, including:\n• the extent of the related person’s interest in the transaction;\n• whether the terms are comparable to those generally available in arm’s-length transactions;\nand\n• whether the related person transaction is consistent with the best interests of the Company.\nIf any related person transaction is ongoing or is part of a series of transactions, the chairperson or the\naudit committee, as applicable, may establish guidelines as necessary to appropriately review the\nongoing transaction. After initial approval or ratification of the transaction, the chairperson or the audit\ncommittee, as applicable, will review the transaction on a regular basis (at least annually).\nIf any related person transaction is not approved or ratified, the audit committee may take such action\nas it may deem necessary or desirable in the best interests of the Company.\n60\nGeneral Information Concerning the Proxy Statement, Proxies, and Voting at the Annual Meeting\nQuestions About Materials\nWhat information is included in this Proxy Statement?\nThe information in this Proxy Statement relates to the management proposals expected to be voted on\nat our 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the \"Annual Meeting\"), the voting process, our Board and\nBoard committees, the compensation of Zillow Group directors and certain executive officers for 2023,\nand other information.\nWhy did I receive these proxy materials?\nWe are providing these proxy materials in connection with the solicitation by the Board of Directors of\nZillow Group of proxies to be voted at our Annual Meeting and at any adjournment or postponement of\nthe Annual Meeting. In accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the\n\"SEC\"), we sent a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials on or about April 16, 2024, and provided\naccess to our proxy materials online beginning on or before that date, to the holders of record and\nbeneficial owners of our Class A and Class B common stock as of the close of business on March 25,\n2024 (the “Record Date”). Our Class C capital stock is non-voting (except in limited circumstances as\nrequired by Washington law or our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation). Holders of our\nClass C capital stock are not entitled to vote their shares of Class C capital stock at or attend the\nAnnual Meeting. If you hold shares of our Class C capital stock in addition to shares of our Class A or\nClass B common stock, your voting power with respect to the proposals to be presented at the Annual\nMeeting is limited to your Class A and Class B common stock ownership.\nThe Annual Meeting will be held on June 3, 2024, at 2:00 p.m. (Pacific Time) in a virtual-only format at\nmeetnow.global/MSKHX4L.\nWhat does it mean if I receive more than one set of proxy materials?\nIf you receive more than one set of proxy materials, your shares are registered in more than one name\nor are registered in different accounts. In order to vote all the shares of Class A and Class B common\nstock you own, you must either sign and return all of the proxy cards or follow the instructions for any\nalternative voting procedures on each of the proxy cards or Notices of Internet Availability of Proxy\nMaterials you receive.\nWhy did I receive a one-page notice in the mail regarding the internet availability of proxy\nmaterials instead of a full set of proxy materials?\nPursuant to rules adopted by the SEC, we have elected to provide access to our proxy materials over\nthe internet. Accordingly, we are sending a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials to holders of\nour Class A and Class B common stock. All such shareholders will have the ability to access the proxy\nmaterials on the website referred to in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or request to\nreceive an electronic copy or printed set of the proxy materials. Instructions on how to access the proxy\nmaterials over the internet or to request an electronic copy or printed copy may be found in the Notice\nof Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. In addition, shareholders may request to receive proxy\nmaterials in printed form by mail or electronically by email on an ongoing basis. We encourage\nshareholders to take advantage of the availability of the proxy materials online to help reduce the\nenvironmental impact of the circulation of proxy materials.\nWho will pay for the cost of this proxy solicitation?\nZillow Group will bear the cost of the solicitation of proxies from our shareholders. In addition to\nsolicitation by mail, our directors, officers, and employees, without additional compensation, may solicit\nproxies from shareholders by telephone, by letter, by facsimile, in person, or otherwise. Following the\noriginal circulation of the proxies and other soliciting materials, we will request brokers, trusts, banks, or\nother nominees to forward copies of the proxy and other soliciting materials to persons for whom they\nhold shares of Zillow Group Class A or Class B common stock and to request authority for the exercise of\n61\nproxies. In such cases, Zillow Group, upon the request of the brokers, trusts, banks, and other shareholder\nnominees, may reimburse such holders for their reasonable expenses.\nQuestions About Voting\nWho is entitled to vote?\nHolders of our Class A and Class B common stock as of the close of business on the Record Date are\nentitled to receive the Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders and to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of\nthe close of business on the Record Date, there were 55,205,739 shares of Class A common stock and\n6,217,447 shares of Class B common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. Our Class C capital stock is\nnon-voting (except in limited circumstances as required by Washington law or our Amended and\nRestated Articles of Incorporation).\nHolders of our Class C capital stock are not entitled to notice of, to attend, or to vote at, the Annual\nMeeting with respect to their shares of Class C capital stock. If you hold shares of our Class C capital\nstock in addition to shares of our Class A or Class B common stock, your voting power with respect to\nthe proposals to be presented at the Annual Meeting is limited to your Class A and Class B common\nstock ownership.\nHow many votes do I have?\nOn any matter that is submitted to a vote of our shareholders, the holders of our Class A common stock\nare entitled to one vote per share of Class A common stock and the holders of our Class B common\nstock are entitled to 10 votes per share of Class B common stock. Holders of our Class A common stock\nand Class B common stock are not entitled to cumulative voting in the election of directors. Our Class C\ncapital stock is non-voting (except in limited circumstances as required by Washington law or our\nAmended and Restated Articles of Incorporation). If you hold shares of our Class C capital stock in\naddition to shares of our Class A or Class B common stock, your voting power with respect to the\nproposals to be presented at the Annual Meeting is limited to your Class A and Class B common stock\nownership.\nWhat is the difference between holding shares as a shareholder of record and as a beneficial\nowner?\nMost shareholders hold their shares through a broker, trust, bank, or other nominee rather than directly\nin their own names.\nIf on March 25, 2024, your shares of Class A or Class B common stock were registered directly in your\nname with our transfer agent, Computershare, then you are a shareholder of record. As a shareholder\nof record, you may vote online during or in advance of the Annual Meeting, as applicable, or vote by\nproxy. Whether or not you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we urge you to vote online, by telephone,\nor by filling out and returning a proxy card to ensure your vote is counted.\nIf on March 25, 2024, your shares of Class A or Class B common stock were held in an account at a\nbrokerage firm, bank, dealer, or other similar organization, then you are the beneficial owner of shares\nheld in “street name” and these proxy materials are being forwarded to you by that organization. The\norganization holding your account is considered the shareholder of record for purposes of voting at the\nAnnual Meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker or other agent on how to\nvote the shares of Class A and Class B common stock in your account. You are also invited to attend the\nAnnual Meeting. However, since you are not the shareholder of record, you may not attend the Annual\nMeeting or vote your shares online at the Annual Meeting, as applicable, unless you request and obtain\na valid proxy card from your broker or other agent and follow the other instructions included below.\nWhat am I voting on?\nWe are asking you to vote on the following matters in connection with the Annual Meeting:\n1. The election of four directors nominated by our Board to serve until the 2027 Annual\nMeeting of Shareholders;\n2. Ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered\npublic accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024; and\n62\n3. To approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers.\nWe will also consider any other business that may properly come before the Annual Meeting.\nHow do I vote?\nFor Proposal No. 1, you may either vote “For” all the nominees to the Board or you may “Withhold” your\nvote for any nominee to the Board that you specify. For Proposal No. 2 and Proposal No. 3, you may vote\n“For” or “Against” or abstain from voting.\n☑ Vote by Internet. Shareholders of record may submit proxies online by following the instructions on\nthe Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or, if printed copies of the proxy materials were\nrequested, the instructions on the printed proxy card. Most beneficial shareholders may vote by\naccessing the website specified on the voting instructions form provided by their brokers, trustees,\nbanks, or other nominees. Please check your voting instruction form for internet voting availability.\n☑ Vote by Telephone. Shareholders of record may submit proxies using any touch-tone telephone from\nwithin the United States, US territories, and Canada by calling toll free 1-800-652-VOTE (8683) and\nfollowing the instructions provided by the recorded message or, if printed copies of the proxy materials\nwere requested, by following the instructions on the printed proxy card. Most beneficial owners may\nvote using any touch-tone telephone from within the United States by calling the number specified on\nthe voting instruction forms provided by their brokers, trustees, banks, or other nominees.\n☑ Vote by Mail. Shareholders of record may submit proxies by mail by requesting printed proxy cards\nand completing, signing, and dating the printed proxy cards and mailing them in the pre-addressed\nenvelopes that will accompany printed proxy materials. Beneficial owners may vote by completing,\nsigning and dating the voting instruction forms provided and mailing them in the pre-addressed\nenvelopes accompanying the voting instruction forms.\nIf you are a shareholder of record and you return your signed proxy card but do not indicate your voting\npreferences, the persons named in the proxy card will vote the shares represented by that proxy as\nrecommended by the Board. If you are a beneficial owner and you return your signed voting instruction\nform but do not indicate your voting preferences, please see “What are ‘broker non-votes’ and how do\nabstentions and ‘broker non-votes’ affect the proposals?” for information regarding whether your\nbroker, bank or other holder of record may vote your uninstructed shares on a particular proposal.\n☑ Vote Online at the Annual Meeting. All shareholders of Class A or Class B common stock as of the\nclose of business on the Record Date can vote at the Annual Meeting. You can also be represented by\nanother person at the Annual Meeting by executing a proper proxy designating that person.\nShareholders of record may vote online during the Annual Meeting by visiting meetnow.global/MSKHX4L\nand following the instructions found on your proxy card. If you are a beneficial owner, and would like to\nattend the Annual Meeting online, we recommend that you register in advance with Computershare by\nfollowing the instructions below. Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we recommend that you\nalso vote in advance either by telephone, internet, or mail so your vote will be counted if you decide not\nto attend.\nWhat are the voting requirements to elect directors and approve the other proposals described in\nthis Proxy Statement?\nWith respect to Proposal No. 1, the four directors receiving the largest number of votes will be elected.\nWith respect to Proposal No. 2 and Proposal No. 3, the number of votes cast in favor of each proposal\nmust exceed the number of votes cast against such proposal in order for such proposal to be\napproved.\nWhat are “broker non-votes” and how do abstentions and “broker non-votes” affect the proposals?\nA broker non-vote occurs when a nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote the\nshares on a proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary voting power for a particular\nitem and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner regarding voting. Brokers and\nnominees can use their discretion to vote “uninstructed” shares with respect to matters that are\nconsidered to be “routine,” but not with respect to “non-routine” matters. We believe that Proposal No. 1\nand Proposal No. 3 will be considered “non-routine” and that Proposal No. 2 will be considered “routine.”\nAccordingly, if your shares are held by a broker on your behalf and you do not instruct the broker as to\n63\nhow to vote these shares on Proposal No. 1 or Proposal No. 3, we expect that the broker may not exercise\ndiscretion to vote on those proposals. With respect to Proposal No. 2, the ratification of the appointment\nof our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, we\nexpect that the broker may exercise its discretion to vote for or against that proposal in the absence of\nyour instruction.\nAbstentions and broker non-votes are not counted as votes in favor of or against any proposal.\nCan I change my vote or revoke my proxy?\nYes, if you are a shareholder of record, you may revoke your proxy at any time before it is exercised at\nthe Annual Meeting by (a) delivering written notice, bearing a date later than the proxy, stating that the\nproxy is revoked, (b) submitting a later-dated proxy relating to the same shares by mail, telephone, or\nthe internet prior to the vote at the Annual Meeting, and (c) by voting online during the Annual Meeting.\nShareholders of record may send a written notice or request for a new proxy card via regular mail to\nZillow Group, Inc., c/o Computershare, P.O. Box 43006, Providence, RI 02940-3006 or follow the instructions\nprovided on the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and proxy card to request to receive an\nelectronic copy or printed set of the proxy materials, including a new proxy card, or submit a new proxy\nby telephone or via the internet. Shareholders of record may also request a new proxy card by calling\n(866) 411-1103 or, if outside the United States, (201) 680-6578.\nIf you are a beneficial shareholder, you may revoke your proxy or change your vote only by following the\nseparate instructions provided by your broker, trust, bank, or other nominee.\nWhen will Zillow Group announce the results of the voting?\nVoting results will be announced by the filing of a Current Report on Form 8-K within four business days\nafter the Annual Meeting. If final voting results are unavailable at that time, we will file an amended\nCurrent Report on Form 8-K within four business days of the day the final results are available.\nQuestions About the Meeting\nWhat are the requirements for admission to the Annual Meeting?\nOnly holders of our Class A and Class B common stock and persons holding proxies from such\nshareholders may attend the Annual Meeting.\nTo be admitted to the Annual Meeting at meetnow.global/MSKHX4L, you must enter the control number\nfound on your proxy card, voting instruction form or notice. If you hold your shares through an\nintermediary, such as a broker, trust, bank, or other nominee, and do not have a control number, you\nmust register in advance to attend the Annual Meeting by submitting proof of your proxy power (legal\nproxy) reflecting your holdings in Zillow Group, Inc. along with your name and email address to\nComputershare.

Legal Proxy, P.O. Box 43001, Providence, RI 02940-3001\nYou may participate in and vote during the Annual Meeting by following the instructions available on\nthe meeting website during the meeting.\nWhat if I have trouble accessing the Annual Meeting virtually?\nThe virtual meeting platform is fully supported across browsers (MS Edge, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari)\nand devices (desktops, laptops, tablets, and cell phones) running the most up-to-date version of\napplicable software and plugins.

If a quorum is not\npresent, it is expected that the Annual Meeting will be adjourned or postponed in order to permit\nadditional time for soliciting and obtaining additional proxies or votes, and, at any subsequent\nreconvening of the Annual Meeting, all proxies will be voted in the same manner as such proxies would\nhave been voted at the original convening of the Annual Meeting, except for any proxies that have been\neffectively revoked or withdrawn.\nThe presence at the Annual Meeting, virtually or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the total voting\npower of Zillow Group’s Class A and Class B common stock constitutes a quorum. Abstentions and\n“broker non-votes” are counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum.\nAdditional Information\nCode of Conduct and Code of Ethics\nOur Board has adopted a Code of Ethics that applies to our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial\nOfficer, Chief Accounting Officer, and controller, and persons performing similar functions, and a Code\nof Conduct that applies to all of our directors, officers, and employees.

Accordingly, any such shareholder proposal must be\nreceived between February 3, 2025, and the close of business on March 5, 2025.

Since our founding, we have given customers the\ntools and insights they need to navigate one of the most important, emotional, and\ncomplicated transactions of their lives.\nOver the years, we’ve “turned on the lights” in real estate by building engaging and practical\nproducts and services designed to empower consumers with data and information,\ntransforming a previously opaque marketplace into the more transparent one we experience\ntoday. But “turning on the lights” only got Zillow and our large audience so far. To effect real\nchange for consumers and open up a much larger opportunity, we needed to focus on the\nmoving experience from start to finish and work to transform the transaction itself.\nIn February 2022, we published an Investor Strategy Deck1 that detailed the opportunity we saw\nto serve more mover-consumers in our funnel through the concept of the “housing super app”\n— an integrated digital experience that connects the fragmented pieces of the moving\nprocess and brings them together on one platform: Zillow. We see this strategy as a\ncontinuation of what we’ve been working on since we founded the company — a commitment\nto transform the way people buy, sell, finance, and rent homes.\n2022 was about defining our go-forward strategy, orienting our company and our business\naround our shared vision, and aligning our organizational structure to set us up for success on\nour growth strategy. 2023 was about making progress on our initiatives through product\nlaunches and market rollouts, setting us up to expand and scale in 2024 and 2025.\nIn February 2024, we published an updated Investor Strategy Deck2 (2024 Investor Strategy\nDeck) that details what we have accomplished to date as we empower consumers by\n1\nhttps://s24.q4cdn.com/723050407/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/Zillow-Investor-Strategy-Presentation-(February-\n2022)-ZG.pdf\n2\nhttps://investors.zillowgroup.com/investors/news-and-events/events-and-presentations/default.aspx\n1\ndelivering real estate data and education, a suite of Zillow-owned solutions, and a network of\nbest-in-class partners, at their fingertips. Zillow, the housing super app, is now the container\ninto which we will continually place new features and services that work together seamlessly\nto solve real customer and agent pain points in their moves.\nIn our 2024 Investor Strategy Deck, we also introduced a new, refined way to size our\nopportunity — an estimated $30 billion accessible total addressable market (TAM) of high-\nintent customers who we believe are already raising their hands in the Zillow funnel3. In 2023,\nwe captured only $1.5 billion of that $30 billion accessible TAM, which represents our full-year\n2023 Residential and Mortgages revenue as reported. Our opportunity is to take our current\nsmall slice of a large TAM and grow it into a much bigger piece of the pie.\nWe believe we have many years of growth ahead into that $30 billion revenue TAM, bolstered\nby our position as one of the largest internet brands in the United States. Based on survey\ndata, we estimate that 70% of all consumers who transact in residential real estate visit and\nuse Zillow. Additionally, our data indicates Zillow has more than 60%4 unaided brand\nawareness among buyers, which is rarefied air for a brand to achieve in any category. Our\nbrand strength is also evident in Zillow’s traffic composition, with about 80%5 being organic,\nand in our app usage, which is more than three times that of our nearest competitor6.\nGrowth Strategy\nWe’re investing across five for-sale growth pillars: touring, financing, seller solutions, enhancing\nour partner network, and integrating our services. We’ve also added rentals as an additional\ngrowth pillar. These growth pillars serve as a roadmap to achieve our goals to grow our\nrevenue as we aim to grow customer transaction share from 3% to 6% by the end of 20257.\nTouring — When a customer who’s been coveting a home on Zillow raises their hand to tour it\nin real life, we believe it’s a strong signal of serious intent to transact. Our real-time touring\nproduct, powered by ShowingTime, is meaningfully improving our ability to connect these\nhigher-intent customers to our Premier Agent partners. We ended 2023 with real-time tours\n3\nEstimate of buy- and sell-side transactors engaged in Zillow’s funnel multiplied by estimated revenue per\ntransaction for buyers and sellers, respectively. Please see our 2024 Investor Strategy Deck for additional information\nabout our estimated TAM.\n4\nBased on Zillow Group internal data.\n5\nBased on Zillow Group internal data.\n6\ndata.ai data for January 2023 – December 2023. Includes Zillow, Trulia, Hotpads, and StreetEasy apps.\n7\nPlease see the “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Use of Operating Metrics” sections below for additional\ninformation about these forward-looking targets.\n2\ndelivering approximately 10% of our total Premier Agent partner connections. This is driving a\nbetter customer and agent experience, with less friction, as we see increased successful\nconnections and more customers working with Premier Agent partners.\nFinancing — Our industry surveys indicate that approximately 40%8 of all homebuyers start\ntheir journey by shopping for a mortgage, and 80%9 of those buyers don’t yet have an agent.\nKnowing that almost all of these mortgage seekers use Zillow to shop for a home positions us\nwell as we build a substantial direct-to-consumer purchase mortgage origination business\nwithin Zillow Home Loans10 that is seamlessly integrated with our extensive Premier Agent\npartner network.\nOur integration efforts are driving purchase mortgage origination volume growth. In our\noriginal four enhanced markets (Atlanta, Phoenix, Raleigh, Denver), we saw our customer\nadoption rates climb from 6% to 15% over the course of 202311. Additionally, the percentage of\nZillow Home Loans purchase mortgages in which a customer works with a Premier Agent\npartner increased from 23% in Q1 2023 to 53% in Q4 2023.\nSeller Solutions — In 2023, we expanded our TAM by introducing new seller solutions, most\nnotably Listing Showcase12. This product elevates agents’ brand presence on Zillow and helps\nthem win more listings. Listing Showcase also improves the shopper experience with our\nhomegrown AI-powered rich media and floor plan technology. This is a unique differentiator\nin the marketplace and a considerable benefit to buyer engagement and experience.\nWe are in the early days of this product, having launched it in Q3 2023, and we are seeing\nsignificant demand from listing agents and significant engagement from consumers. Our\ndata indicates that Listing Showcase listings on Zillow receive 75% more page views, 68% more\nsaves, and 75% more shares13. We are actively rolling out Listing Showcase nationwide.\n8\nZillow Group internal estimates.\n9\nZillow Group internal estimates.\n10\nhttps://www.zillowhomeloans.com\n11\nAdoption rate measures the percentage of Zillow customers that use both a Premier Agent partner and Zillow\nHome Loans to purchase a home, as measured by Zillow Group’s internal data.\n12\nhttps://showingtimeplus.com/solutions/listing-showcase\n13\nThe data is from March 18, 2024, and is an average from the immediately preceding six-month period. The data\nexcludes the top 5% and bottom 5% lift of total page views, saves, and shares from each month and the immediately\npreceding six-month average.\n3\nEnhanced Partner Network — We help the best agents provide better service to more of our\nshared customers to grow their businesses and ours in several ways:\n● First, we’re increasing the number of our enhanced market partners as we plan to\nexpand from nine enhanced markets to 40 enhanced markets by the end of 2024.\n● Second, we’re working to deliver the integrated experience between Zillow Home Loans\nand our Premier Agent partners. We’re seeing strong progress already, with one in two\nPremier Agent partners in our enhanced markets introducing their customers to Zillow\nHome Loans at the end of 2023, up from one in five at the end of 2022.\n● Last, we are excited to accelerate improvements to Follow Up Boss, which we acquired\nin December 2023, and make it available to more agents to increase conversion.\nFollow Up Boss is an industry-leading CRM (customer relationship management)\nsystem that gives top-performing real estate professionals a central hub to organize\nand engage customers, close deals, and build their teams. With the power of Follow Up\nBoss, our Premier Agent partners will be better equipped to deliver the best possible\ncustomer experiences while growing their businesses.\nIntegrating our Services — This growth pillar involves pulling together consumer, agent, and\nloan officer technology, and integrating them into the housing super app. As evidenced by\nour performance in our two earliest enhanced markets, Phoenix and Atlanta, our integrated\nstrategy is working to drive customer transaction share gains. From the beginning of 2022 to\nthe end of 2023, our customer transaction share in these enhanced markets has nearly\ndoubled14. Additionally, across our entire set of nine enhanced markets at the end of 2023, we\nare seeing consistent outperformance in connections growth versus the industry15.\nRentals — Providing our customers with optionality is as important as ever in a challenging\nhousing market, especially considering that nearly every homebuyer starts out as a renter. We\nnow have the largest audience16 of renters in the market, with limited marketing spend to date.\nAs the traffic leader, we’ve been able to grow the number of multifamily properties on our\napps and sites, which has accelerated our multifamily revenue from 14% year-over-year\ngrowth in Q4 2022 to 52% in Q4 2023.\n14\nRepresents customer transaction share growth in the Phoenix and Atlanta enhanced markets in Q1 2022 compared\nto Q4 2023. Please see the “Use of Operating Metrics” section below for additional information about our calculation\nof customer transaction share.\n15\nRepresents monthly year-over-year growth in connections versus monthly year-over-year growth in existing home\nsales in 2023 for the nine enhanced markets.\n16\nComscore data as of February 2024.\n4\nIndustry\nWe are monitoring the impact of potential changes within the industry as a result of numerous\nlawsuits. Zillow is not a named party in the various lawsuits regarding agent compensation,\nand we remain confident in our ability to meaningfully grow our company over time.\nWe believe all roads lead to Zillow, and we’re well-positioned to thrive in any weather.\nWe continue to advocate for what we believe is best for consumers and the real estate\nindustry as a whole. In November 2023, we outlined the marketplace principles that underlie\nZillow’s position — access, representation, and compensation.\n● We believe in a real estate marketplace that is transparent and fair, in which\nconsumers and agents have easy and equitable access to listings and information.\n● We believe buyers and sellers deserve independent representation.\n● We believe agents should be compensated fairly and that consumers should be well-\ninformed of agent compensation as well as their right to negotiate.\nWe recently elaborated on these views on a new web page — advocacy.zillowgroup.com —\nthat outlines how we are working to elevate industry standards on consumers’ behalf.\nLooking Ahead\nIt has been a busy and exciting two years as we’ve been building and investing in these\ngrowth pillars, adding to our Zillow housing super app experience. We are looking forward to\ncontinued growth in the years ahead as we solve customer pain points to build a better,\nintegrated real estate transaction experience.\nThank you for your continued support.\nRich Barton\nCo-founder and Chief Executive Officer, Zillow Group, Inc.\n@Rich_Barton\n5\nA Note About Forward-Looking Statements: This letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of\nSection 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that involve risks and\nuncertainties, including, without limitation, statements regarding our future targets, the future performance and\noperation of our business, our business strategies and ability to translate such strategies into financial performance,\nthe current and future health and stability of the residential housing market and economy, increases and volatility of\nmortgage interest rates, and our expectations regarding future shifts in behavior by consumers and employees.\nStatements containing words such as “may,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “project,” “predict,” “will,”\n“projections,” “continue,” “estimate,” “outlook,” “opportunity,” “guidance,” “would,” “could,” “strive,” or similar expressions\nconstitute forward-looking statements. Unless otherwise noted in this letter, forward-looking statements are made\nbased on assumptions as of April 16, 2024, and although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking\nstatements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee these results.

This letter includes Customer\nTransaction Share as a percentage of total residential real estate transactions. Zillow Group uses these operating\nmetrics on a periodic basis to evaluate and provide investors with insight into the performance of Zillow Group’s\ntransaction-based lines of business, which currently include Premier Agent, Listing Showcase, seller solutions, Zillow\nHome Loans and Listing Showcase.\nCustomer Transactions: Unless otherwise indicated, Zillow Group calculates “Customer Transactions” as each unique\nhome purchase or sale transaction in which the buyer or seller uses Zillow Home Loans, Listing Showcase, and/or\ninvolves a Premier Agent or seller solutions partner with whom the buyer or seller connected through Zillow Group. In\nparticular: (1) For Premier Agent and seller solutions partners, Zillow Group uses an internal approximation of the\nnumber of buy- and/or sell-side transactions, as applicable, that involve a Premier Agent or seller solutions partner\nwith whom the buyer or seller connected through Zillow Group. Because of the challenges associated with measuring\nthe conversion of connections to transactions outside of our Premier Agent Flex and our seller solutions programs,\nincluding reliance on the availability and quality of public records and data, these estimates may be inaccurate. (2)\n6\nFor Zillow Home Loans, Zillow Group counts each unique purchase transaction in which the buyer uses Zillow Home\nLoans. (3) For Listing Showcase, Zillow Group counts each unique sale transaction in which the listing agent or seller\nuses Listing Showcase.\nCustomer Transaction Share: Unless otherwise indicated, “Customer Transaction Share” is Customer Transactions\ndivided by the number of total residential real estate transactions, for the period presented.\nThis letter contains estimates and other statistical data made by independent parties and by Zillow Group relating to\nmarket size, the housing market, connections, engagement, transactions, growth and other data about Zillow Group's\nindustry and performance. These data involve a number of assumptions and limitations, which may significantly\nimpact their accuracy, and you are cautioned not to give undue weight to such estimates. Projections, assumptions\nand estimates of future performance are necessarily subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk.\n7\nUNITED STATES\nSECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION\nWashington, D.C. 20549\n_____________________________________________________\nFORM 10-K\n_____________________________________________________\n(cid:1409) ANNUAL REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES\nEXCHANGE ACT OF 1934\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023\nOR\n(cid:1407) TRANSITION REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES\nEXCHANGE ACT OF 1934\nCommission File Number: 001-36853\n_____________________________________________________\nZILLOW GROUP, INC.\n(Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter)\n_____________________________________________________\n1301 Second Avenue, Floor 36,\nSeattle, Washington 98101\n(Address of principal executive offices) (Zip Code)\n(206) 470-7000\n(Registrant’s telephone number, including area code)\n_____________________________________________________\nSecurities registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Act:\nName of each exchange on which\nTitle of each class Trading Symbol(s) registered\nClass A Common Stock, par value $0.0001\nper share ZG The Nasdaq Global Select Market\nClass C Capital Stock, par value $0.0001\nper share Z The Nasdaq Global Select Market\nSecurities registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Act: None\nIndicate by check mark if the registrant is a well-known seasoned issuer, as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities\nAct.

Business.\nOverview\nWe are reimagining real estate to make home a reality for more and more people. As the most visited real estate website\nin the United States, Zillow and its affiliates help people find and get the home they want by connecting them with digital\nsolutions, dedicated partners and agents, and easier buying, selling, financing and renting experiences. Hundreds of millions of\npeople visit our mobile applications and websites every month to begin their journey.\nAt the core of Zillow is our living database of approximately 160 million U.S. homes and our differentiated content, most\nnotably the Zestimate, our patented proprietary automated valuation model through which we provide home value estimates.\nWith the launch of the Zestimate feature in 2006, we introduced important transparency to residential real estate in order to\nempower consumers to make better decisions. During 2023, our Zestimate feature had a median error rate of 2.3% for homes\nlisted for sale and 7.4% for off-market homes. We believe our data and content has helped the Zillow brand become\nsynonymous with residential real estate with Zillow being searched more than the term “real estate” in the United States.\nOur vision of a “housing super app” is to help customers across all their real estate needs serving as one ecosystem of\nconnected solutions for all the tasks and services related to moving. We are focused on continually improving our customer\nfunnel, capturing customer demand and connecting that demand to our partner network. We believe this focus allows us to build\ncloser relationships with our customers to help them find and move into the places they call home, which is at the core of our\nmission. We also believe the path to realizing our “housing super app” vision involves executing on product initiatives across\nsix growth pillars:\n• Touring – Make it easier for high-intent customers to take in-person tours and connect with our partner agents\n• Financing – Prepare customers to be transaction-ready with financing early in their home buying journey\n• Expanding seller services – Invest in tech-enabled solutions and services to make selling homes easier for sellers and\nlisting agents\n• Enhancing our partner network – Help the best agents to better serve more customers and grow their businesses\n• Rentals – Build a comprehensive rental marketplace for customers and property managers\n• Integrating our services – Bring our engagement, products and services together to drive more transactions and more\nrevenue per customer transaction\nWe continue to operate in a challenging macro housing environment where rising mortgage rates and low housing supply\nhave led to affordability challenges for many potential buyers. Many potential sellers have postponed or forgone opportunities\nto sell, choosing instead to hold onto their existing lower-rate mortgages, limiting for-sale housing supply as a result. However,\nwhile this shortfall of for-sale inventory has limited sales volume, prices have continued to rise as competition for the relatively\nfew available for-sale homes remains firm. These macroeconomic factors and their impact on the residential real estate market\nhave affected our business and influenced the resources we use to direct our operations.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, the Board of Directors of Zillow Group made the determination to wind down Zillow\nOffers, our iBuying business which purchased and sold homes directly in markets across the United States. The wind down was\ncompleted in the third quarter of 2022, which resulted in approximately a 25% reduction of Zillow Group’s workforce. The\nfinancial results of Zillow Offers have been presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as discontinued\noperations. For additional information, see Note 3 in our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBeginning in 2023, our chief executive officer, who acts as the chief operating decision maker, began to manage our\nbusiness, make operating decisions, and evaluate operating performance on the basis of the company as a whole, instead of on a\n3\nsegment basis as he did prior to 2023. Accordingly, this change led to revisions to the nature and substance of information\nregularly provided to and used by the chief operating decision maker, and served to align our reported results with our ongoing\ngrowth strategy and our intent to provide integrated customer solutions for all tasks and services related to facilitating real\nestate transactions. As a result, beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we began to report our financial results as a single\nreportable segment.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we closed the acquisition of Follow Up Boss, a customer relationship management system\nthat gives real estate professionals a central hub to organize and engage customers, close deals, and build their teams. Follow\nUp Boss has been a key integration partner of ours for several years, and the product is widely utilized by the broader real estate\nindustry and many of our Premier Agent partners. For additional information, see Note 7 in our Notes to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCustomer Offerings\nTo deliver on our mission, we strive to provide a seamless, integrated transaction experience for movers through Zillow,\nour network of trusted partners, our affiliated brands, and through a comprehensive suite of marketing software and technology\nsolutions for the real estate industry, including Spruce, Mortech, New Home Feed, ShowingTime+ and Follow Up Boss. We do\nthis through a range of services designed to help our customers in whatever stage of the housing journey they may be in. This\ntypically includes the need for multiple services simultaneously. Approximately 70% of sellers are also buying at the same time,\nand among renters with plans to move within the next year, 43% plan to buy their next home1.\nOur services are primarily designed for the following:\nFor Buyers, Sellers and Partners – When a buyer is ready to begin their home buying journey, we offer a variety of\noptions depending on where they choose to start. After searching for a home on our mobile applications and websites,\ncustomers can choose to meet with a local real estate professional by connecting with a Premier Agent partner, scheduling\nan in-person home tour powered by ShowingTime+, or obtaining financing through Zillow Home Loans. For customers\nwho are focused on buying new construction homes, we connect them with our home builder partners. Once buyers find\ntheir home, they can choose to work with our Premier Agent partners and affiliated integrated services, including\nfinancing through Zillow Home Loans, to facilitate a seamless transaction experience. For sellers, we are focused on\nproviding multiple offerings for customers to find ways to sell their homes. For instance, we have an exclusive multi-year\npartnership with Opendoor to provide our customers with the option to get a cash offer on their home, and we have\nexpanded this offering to 45 markets across the country. Additionally, we launched the Listing Showcase product under\nShowingTime+, which allows sellers and listing agents to differentiate themselves on Zillow through higher-quality\nlistings via an immersive premium experience featuring rich media, including scrolling hero images, room-by-room\nphoto organization and interactive floor plans. For partners, we are actively integrating Follow Up Boss, a customer\nrelationship management system for real estate professionals, into our suite of product offerings. This tech-enabled\nsolution gives real estate professionals a central hub to organize and engage customers, close deals and build out their\nteams.\nFor Renters – During 2023, we estimate that there were almost three times more households moving to a new rental than\npurchasing a home in the United States2. Our rentals marketplace assists our partners with listings, advertising, leasing\nand property management services through Zillow Rental Manager in the U.S. market of nearly 48 million rental units3.\nWe connect prospective renters with our property management and landlord partners through our rental websites which\n1 Source: Zillow Group’s 2023 Consumer Housing Trends Report\n2 Source: Estimate derived from Zillow internal estimates of more than 12 million rental households moving to a new rental in\n2023 as compared to 4.8 million new and existing homes sold in 2023 according to the National Association of REALTORS®\nEconomic Outlook as of December 2023\n3 Source: 2023 U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey dated October 31, 2023\n4\nprovide landlords access to the most visited online rental network4. We also provide renters with the ability to easily\nsubmit applications, sign leases and make rental payments through our platform. We are continuing to make\nenhancements to our rental products and services to make moving a transparent and seamless process. Such\nenhancements include the addition of room for rent listings, the ability to filter on income restricted listings, a universal\napplication feature which allows potential renters to pay once to access multiple listings and the reporting of timely rental\npayments to a major credit bureau, among others.\nFor Borrowers – Approximately 80% of all homes purchased in the U.S. are financed with a mortgage, 40% of all\nhomebuyers start their home buying process shopping for a mortgage, and 80% of those buyers don’t yet have an agent5.\nIn order to address this opportunity, we provide our customers with multiple ways to pursue mortgage financing for their\ntransaction. We provide customers with the option to finance directly with Zillow Home Loans or to connect with our\nmortgage partners through our mortgage marketplace for both purchase and refinance opportunities. Zillow Home Loans,\nwhich is currently available in 49 states and the District of Columbia, originates mortgage loans and then sells\nsubstantially all of the loans on the secondary market.\nCompetitive Advantages\nWe believe we have the following competitive advantages:\n• Large and trusted brand. The Zillow Group portfolio attracted an annual monthly high of 233 million unique users in\nJune 2023 and approximately 10.0 billion visits in 2023, primarily to our Zillow, Trulia and StreetEasy portals. Today,\nmore people search for “Zillow” than “real estate6,” and Zillow is the most visited7 and trusted8 brand in the online real\nestate industry.\n• Living database of homes and superior data science and technology advantages. Our living database of approximately\n160 million U.S. homes is the result of substantial investment, sophisticated economic and statistical analysis and\ncomplex data aggregation of multiple sources of property, transaction and listing data, including user generated\nupdates to more than 43 million property records.

Zillow Group has built an award-winning culture of collaboration and\ninnovation that is committed to employee equity and creating an environment where employees feel valued, supported\nand that they belong. We have been recognized for our commitment to these efforts, being named on JUST CapitalSM’s\n“America’s JUST 100 Companies” list. Additionally, in 2023, Zillow Group was named one of the Best Workplaces\nfor Real Estate, for Parents and for Women9. Zillow Group was also named one of PEOPLE®’s 2023 “Companies\nThat Care” list.\n• Strong financial position. Our cash position and operating cash flow give us the flexibility to continue to invest in our\ngrowth pillars despite recent economic uncertainty and a volatile interest rate environment. We are mindful of our\ncosts, while prioritizing our investments to drive our growth pillars and pursue the large opportunities we see ahead of\nus.\nTotal Addressable Market\nWe participate in large addressable markets of buying, selling, renting and financing residential real estate in the U.S. Our\nTotal Addressable Market (“TAM”) includes Zillow’s estimate of total industry transaction fees derived from residential real\nestate transactions. In recent years, we have invested in software services, including the acquisition of Follow Up Boss and the\nexpansion of offerings through our ShowingTime+ suite of services, to further enhance our ability to facilitate real estate\ntransactions with both buyers and sellers. In addition, we provide important adjacent services, such as mortgages through\nZillow Home Loans. Our TAM also includes our complementary rentals marketplace which includes rentals advertising and\nproperty management software spend.\nOur TAM has been affected in recent years by macroeconomic conditions that have proved unfavorable to the residential\nreal estate industry. These macroeconomic conditions have driven low housing inventory, fewer new for-sale listings, increases\nand volatility in mortgage interest rates, as well as home price fluctuations. These factors have negatively impacted the number\nof real estate transactions and demand for adjacent services. Despite these macroeconomic headwinds, we believe we are well\npositioned to address existing and future demand for real estate transactions. The amounts listed below represent the estimated\ntotal industry size associated with these opportunities for the year ended December 31, 2023 (in billions):\nResidential real estate industry transaction fees10 $ 100\nU.S. mortgage origination revenue 11 45\nTitle and escrow services transaction fees 12 17\nRentals advertising spend13 17\nProperty management software revenue14 8\nTAM $ 187\n9 Source: Great Place to Work®\n10 Sources: Estimate derived from total transaction value data from the December 2023 Economic Data published by the\nNational Association of REALTORS® and Zillow’s internal estimate for average industry commission rates.

We generally expect Residential and Rentals revenue to peak in the three months ended\nJune 30th or September 30th, consistent with the average number of visits and unique users which have historically peaked\nduring the same period. Within Mortgages revenue, we believe that seasonality would result in higher purchase origination\nvolumes in the spring and summer high seasons, and our Connect and Custom Quote mortgage marketing products have\ndisplayed similar seasonal fluctuations. In more recent years, our seasonality in revenue has been masked by macroeconomic\nfactors. These factors include customers’ responses to macroeconomic housing market factors, such as interest rate and home\nprice increases and volatility and tight housing inventory levels, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCompetition\nOur business depends on our ability to successfully attract, retain and provide customers with products and services that\nmake real estate transactions faster, easier and less stressful.\nThe residential real estate landscape is highly fragmented and competitive from the beginning of the search process\nthrough the closing of a transaction, typically with single point service providers. Approximately 4.8 million existing and new\nhomes were sold in the U.S. in 202319, with over 201,000 real estate brokerages20 and over 70,000 mortgage lenders21 providing\ntheir services across more than 500 different MLSs that span the country22. Zillow Home Loans currently makes up less than\n0.09% of the mortgages originated in the U.S.\nWe compete for customers with companies that provide technology, products and services for real estate focused\ncustomers. Factors that may influence customer decisions include the quality of the experience, value and utility of the services\noffered, the breadth, depth and accuracy of information available, and brand awareness and reputation. For example, our\nPremier Agent business competes for customers based on price, visibility, perceived and actual value and quality of service. For\ncustomers shopping for a mortgage, Zillow Home Loans competes with other mortgage originators based on a combination of\ninterest rates, origination fees, product selection, brand awareness and trust and the level of service we provide.\nIn addition, our business depends on our ability to attract and retain leading industry partners to advertise and provide\nservices to our customer base. We compete for real estate partners based on the perceived transaction readiness of customers,\nreturn on investment, price and product offerings and the effectiveness and relevance of our products and services. Based on\nthese and other factors, real estate partners could select other companies to work with to provide relevant and timely real estate,\n15 Source: September 2023 report published by IBISWorld which estimates the annual homeowners’ insurance market\nopportunity\n16 Source: 2022 Economy of Everything Home report published by Angi Inc. which estimates the annual home services market\nopportunity, inclusive of home improvements, home maintenance and home emergency repairs\n17 Source: October 2023 report published by IBISWorld which estimates the annual moving services market opportunity\n18 Source: February 2023 report published by IBIS World which estimates the annual real estate appraisal services market\nopportunity\n19 Source: National Association of REALTORS® Economic Outlook as of December 2023\n20 Source: National Association of REALTORS® 2023 Profile of Real Estate Firms report\n21 Source: Q2 2023 Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System Industry Report\n22 Source: Real Estate Standards Organization in 2023\n7\nrental, new construction and mortgage information and services. We also compete for a share of our partners’ overall marketing\nbudgets with traditional media as well as word-of-mouth referrals and leads from yard signs and other marketing.\nIntellectual Property\nWe regard our intellectual property as a key differentiator that is critical to our success and we rely on a combination of\nintellectual property laws, trade-secret protection, and contractual agreements to protect our proprietary technology and data.\nOur Zestimate feature, which we consider to be a significant competitive advantage with respect to customer engagement,\nleverages patented, proprietary, automated valuation models to provide real-time home value estimates. As of December 31,\n2023, we have 138 patents of varying lengths issued and 203 patent applications pending in the U.S. and internationally. These\npatents cover a variety of proprietary techniques relevant to our products and services, including determining a current value for\nreal estate property and the collection, storage and display of home attribute values and creating interactive floor plans.\nIn addition, awareness and loyalty to our brand enables us to effectively attract and retain our customers and employees.\nTo support our brand, we have registered, or applied for the registration of, trademarks, service marks and copyrights in the\nU.S. and several other jurisdictions, including “Zillow,” “Zestimate,” and the Z in a house logo. We are also the registered\nholder of a variety of domestic and international domain names. We have licensed in the past, and we may license in the future,\ncertain of our proprietary rights to third parties.\nTo further protect our proprietary rights, we enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our\nemployees, consultants, contractors and business partners. Our employees and contractors are also subject to invention\nassignment provisions. We control the use of our proprietary technology, data and intellectual property through provisions in\nboth our general and product-specific terms of use and other restrictions on our mobile applications and websites.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe operate in an increasingly complex legal and regulatory environment. Our business and the products and services that\nwe offer are affected by a continually expanding and evolving range of local, state, federal, and international laws and\nregulations. For additional information on government regulation refer to Part I, Item 1A (Risk Factors—Risks Related to\nRegulatory Compliance and Legal Matters) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nHuman Capital Resources\nAt Zillow, we believe that our long-term success is dependent upon attracting, developing and retaining talented\nemployees, and maintaining a culture that allows each employee to do their best work. We value integrity, accountability,\ncollaboration, creativity, respect and transparency as central to our core values.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 6,263 employees. Our internal data shows that approximately 55% of our workforce\nself-identified as men and approximately 45% self-identified as women, as well as certain employees that identified as\nnonbinary. Women currently represent 43% of our leadership team (defined as director level and above). The ethnicity of our\nworkforce was 58% White, 20% Asian, 9% LatinX, 8% Black and 5% for all other races. For leadership, the breakdown was\n72% White, 17% Asian, 5% Black, 4% LatinX and 2% for all other races. The diversity of our workforce and leadership team\ncontinues to be an area of focus as further described in the “Equity and Belonging” section below.\nZillow as a Flexible Workforce\nWe have redefined the employee experience and the future of flexible work, beginning with our announcement of a\npermanent move to a flexible workforce in late 2020. With this permanent move and our investments in recruiting, retaining,\ndeveloping, and listening to and learning from our diverse talent, Zillow is setting the standard for great employee experiences\nand a positive work culture. We believe these investments increase our applicant pool and lead to lower employee attrition. We\noffer employees the choice to work from wherever they are most productive. We continue to evolve our flexible work model to\nmore effectively use our time together, provide more opportunities to work asynchronously, and allow all employees to thrive\nregardless of location. Our base pay compensation frameworks seek to prioritize performance over geographic location when\nmaking pay decisions. This compensation philosophy allows us to compete for talent nationally. As we have transitioned to a\n8\nflexible workforce, we are also using this opportunity to diversify our workforce, as we are no longer bound by the geographic\nlimits of our physical workspaces.\nOur offices will continue to be a place for teams to come together to enable productivity and collaboration, though on a\nfar less frequent basis. Since our permanent move to a flexible workforce, we have redesigned our physical workspaces to\nprovide more space for collaboration and engagement, especially to support team gatherings, which we call zRetreats. In 2023,\nwe focused on balancing flexible work with impactful in-person connections, where cross-functional teams and organizations\ncame together periodically to build connections, trust and collaborate in person. In 2024, our focus will be continuing to refine\nour office footprint to align to how our local and traveling employee populations use our office spaces, as we continue to test\nzRetreat and collaboration spaces that best support our employees.\nEquity and Belonging\nIn pursuit of our business goals, we prioritize and embed inclusive, equitable practices and systems in our values and how\nwe work. We are committed to creating a workplace where diversity of gender, gender identity, age, race, ethnicity, sexual\norientation, national origin, disability, military status and religion are represented, embraced and respected. Our dedicated\nEquity and Belonging team empowers Zillow Group employees to build a strong community, amplify underrepresented voices,\nand foster a company culture where everyone can learn, grow and thrive. We maintain equity and belonging programs that\ninclude unconscious bias training, nine employee-led employee resource groups for community members and allies, and\nsupport diversity in our recruitment practices. In 2023, we launched a new Equity and Belonging Executive Advisory Council\ncomprising senior leadership charged with setting the tone and vision for our commitments, including establishing goals and\nresponsibilities and evaluating impact.\nPay Equity\nZillow Group is committed to ensuring all employees in similar roles with similar qualifications are paid equitably\nregardless of their identity. In support of this commitment, we complete a comprehensive bi-annual evaluation with the\ncommitment to disclose results publicly on our corporate website annually. Based on our assessment of compensation in 2023,\nwe have found that employees with similar skills are paid within approximately 1% of each other when we control for certain\njob-related pay factors, including but not limited to job title and function. At Zillow Group, in 2023, White men, Asian women\nand LatinX women had controlled pay of $1.00 and Black women and women of two or more races had controlled pay at $0.98.\nWhite women, LatinX men, Black men, and men of two or more races at Zillow Group had pay equity of $0.99 and Asian men\nhad a pay equity of $1.01. We will continue our commitment and comprehensive reviews of pay equity and will look to expand\nour data collection and analysis to include LGBTQ+ data in the future.\nCareer and Leadership Development\nAt Zillow Group, we believe each of our employees should have the tools and support they need to grow their careers\nthrough experiences, resources and connections. We have a dedicated Talent Success team, which creates educational resources\nand conducts training on a wide range of topics including job-specific onboarding, effective communication, collaboration, as\nwell as sophisticated leadership training programs and experiences with focused learning tracks for both new managers and\nexperienced leaders. In 2023, we offered over 900 online learning opportunities through Zillow University, our internal online\ntraining platform. Zillow Group employees have completed nearly 70,000 hours of content in 2023 on the Zillow University\nand LinkedIn Learning® platforms.\nA key piece in development is cultivating a learning culture where learning is a habit, and learning agility is at the\nforefront. This means creating the right learning resources for our employees for their current and future roles. We have\ndeveloped a robust Learning and Development portfolio that includes a number of key career development programs that\nsupport our employees to equip them with the knowledge and experience to grow their careers. Below is a summary of certain\nof these programs:\n• Leadership Entrance Experience Program (LEEP) is a self-paced curriculum designed for individual contributors who\nwant to explore people management and develop their leadership skills.\n9\n• Professional skills development through courses like Public Speaking, Insights Discovery® workshops, and access to\nvirtual coaching.\n• Access to development platforms that connect employees to mentors, professional coaches, and peers to aid in\nreaching career goals\nOur people managers play a critical role in moving our business forward by coaching their team, developing their talent\nand providing strong communication to create team engagement. To help achieve this goal, we utilize our Leadership\nExpectations, a leadership development guide that outlines our Leadership Philosophy, provides the foundation of our\nleadership development programs and sets forth our expectations for leaders and the behaviors that are essential to create a\nconsistent leadership experience at Zillow Group. In 2023, we further enhanced the Leadership Expectations by defining 14\nspecific manager capabilities that bring clarity to managers on how to lead and manage teams in our flexible work environment.\nWith this, we began the launch of our virtual manager capability summits, designed for our director and below leaders to help\ndevelop the manager capabilities. In 2024, we plan to launch bi-annual summits, for a total of 12 hours of training for each\ndirector and below people manager, while offering customized learning paths on async content between training sessions, along\nwith peer-to-peer mentoring.\nTalent Rewards\nTalent Rewards includes the strategic oversight of compensation, benefits, and immigration/mobility programs whose\npurpose is to reinforce talent attraction, retention and development in support of Zillow’s culture. Throughout 2023, we have\ncontinued to refine our rewards program. We have increased transparency and consistency in our candidate offers through a\nredesign of our total compensation package. We conduct ongoing reviews of employee compensation to ensure that our\nemployees are paid fairly and in alignment with market expectations.\nIn addition, our robust benefits are reflected in investments in physical, family, mental and financial wellness programs to\nmeet the needs of our diverse base of employees. These benefits include workplace-location flexibility, competitive health care\ncoverage, fully paid parental leave, a sabbatical program, wellness reimbursements, tuition support and caregiver resources. We\nhave also updated our benefits program through enhanced offerings around mental health, LGBTQ+ provider navigation\nsupport, as well as fertility and family planning. Beginning in 2023, we enhanced our parental leave policy, which now allows\nfor up to 20 weeks of paid parental leave. These ongoing investments continue to reinforce Zillow’s commitment to an\nequitable, healthy, focused and high-performing workforce.\nWhere You Can Find More Information\nOur filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly\nreports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, are available on the “Investors” section\nof our website at www.zillowgroup.com, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after the electronic filing of these\nreports with the SEC.

At the same time, compliance with laws and regulations may be expensive and operationally\nburdensome.\n• We are subject to stringent and evolving laws, regulations, rules, contractual obligations, policies and other obligations\nin the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations\ncould lead to regulatory investigations or actions, litigation (including class claims) and mass arbitration demands,\nfines and penalties, a disruption of our business operations, reputational harm, loss of revenue or profits, loss of\ncustomers and other adverse business consequences.\n• We are, from time to time, involved in proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position(cid:3)\n• Given current economic and residential housing market conditions and the significant changes to our business since\nNovember 2021, financial performance for prior and current periods may not be indicative of future performance.\n• We have incurred significant operating losses in the past and may not be profitable over the long term.\n• We may not be able to pay our debt, settle conversions of our convertible senior notes, or repurchase our convertible\nsenior notes upon a fundamental change.\n• Credit and debt facilities for Zillow Home Loans may subject us to interest rate risk and include provisions that may\nrestrict our operating activities and harm our liquidity.\n• We may not be able to raise additional capital or refinance on acceptable terms, or at all.\n• Real or perceived inaccuracies in assumptions, estimates and data used to calculate our business metrics may harm our\nbusiness or reputation.\n• We expect our results of operations to fluctuate quarterly and annually.\n• We could be subject to additional tax liabilities.\n• Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common and Capital Stock and Debt Instruments(cid:3)\n• Our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock prices may be volatile and their value may decline.\n• The structure of our capital stock concentrates voting control with our founders.\n• Future sales of our stock could cause our stock price to decline.\n• Securities, industry analyst or other third-party research and reports may affect our stock price and trading volume.\n• Any additional equity securities or convertible debt we issue may dilute shareholders’ investments.\n• Currently outstanding and future use of capped call transactions may affect the value of our outstanding convertible\nsenior notes and our Class C capital stock.\n• Anti-takeover provisions could prevent an acquisition of us, limit shareholders’ ability to affect management, and\naffect the price of our stock.\nOur business is subject to numerous risks. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as any of these risks\ncould harm our business, results of operations, and future financial performance. Recovery pursuant to our insurance policies\nmay not be available due to policy definitions of covered losses or other factors, and available insurance may be insufficient to\ncompensate for damages, expenses, fines, penalties, and other losses we may incur as a result of these and other risks. In\n12\naddition, risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may materially and\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. If any of these risks occur, the trading price of our\ncommon and capital stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur Business and Operating Results Have and May Continue to Be Impacted by the Health of the United States Residential\nReal Estate Industry and May Be Negatively Affected by Downturns or Significant Changes in This Industry and General\nEconomic Conditions.\nThe success of our business depends, directly and indirectly, on the health of the United States residential real estate\nmarket. The health of the United States residential real estate market is affected, in part, by general economic conditions beyond\nour control. Recent market factors, including low housing inventory, fewer new for-sale listings, volatility in mortgage interest\nrates and home price fluctuations, inflationary conditions and rental occupancy rate fluctuations have impacted demand for our\nproducts and services by consumers and advertisers, which in turn has negatively impacted our financial performance. The\nextent to which these and additional economic factors, such as those described below, impact our results and financial position\nwill depend on future developments, which are uncertain and difficult to predict:\n• fluctuations in the United States residential real estate market – both seasonal and cyclical – which may be due to one\nor more factors, whether included in this list or not;\n• changes in federal monetary policy or inflationary conditions;\n• changes in international, national, regional, or local economic, demographic, or real estate market conditions;\n• slow economic growth or recessionary conditions;\n• increased levels of unemployment or a decrease in labor availability, and/or slowly growing or declining wages;\n• declines in the value of residential real estate and/or the pace of home appreciation, or the lack thereof;\n• illiquidity in residential real estate;\n• overall conditions in the housing market, including macroeconomic shifts in demand, and increases in costs for\nhomeowners such as property taxes, homeowners association fees and availability and affordability of insurance;\n• low levels of customer confidence in the economy and/or the United States residential real estate industry;\n• low home and/or rental inventory levels or lack of affordably priced homes and rentals;\n• changes in interest rates, mortgage rates or down payment requirements and/or restrictions on mortgage financing\navailability;\n• changes to how real estate commissions are negotiated or paid, or changes to other industry standards and practices;\n• federal, state, or local legislative or regulatory changes that would negatively impact rental properties or the residential\nreal estate industry, such as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”), which limited deductions of certain\nmortgage interest expenses and property taxes;\n• volatility and general declines in the stock market; and/or\n• natural and man-made disasters and other catastrophic events, such as pandemics, hurricanes, earthquakes, wildfires,\nterrorist attacks and other events that disrupt local, regional, or national real estate markets.\nResidential real estate may be impacted by industry changes, including as the result of certain or future class action lawsuits\nor government investigations. (cid:3)\nThe residential real estate industry faces significant pressure from private lawsuits and investigations by the Department\nof Justice (the “DOJ”) with regards to antitrust issues, including with respect to lawsuits and investigations in which we are not\na named party. (cid:3)\nIn April 2019, the National Association of Realtors (“NAR”) and certain brokerages and franchisors (including Realogy\nHoldings Corp., HomeServices of America, Inc. RE/MAX and Keller Williams Realty, Inc.) were named as defendants in a\nclass action complaint alleging a conspiracy to violate federal antitrust laws by, among other things, requiring residential\nproperty sellers in Missouri to pay inflated commission fees to buyer brokers (the “NAR Class Action”). On October 31, 2023,\na jury found NAR and various of its co-defendants liable and awarded plaintiffs nearly $1.8 billion in damages (an award that is\nsubject to trebling), and additional equitable relief that may require changes to existing business models may be forthcoming.\n13\nClass action suits raising similar claims are already pending in other jurisdictions and the outcome of the NAR Class Action and\nother pending litigation may result in additional actions being filed. (cid:3)\nWhile the final outcomes of any pending or future lawsuits cannot be predicted with any certainty, court decisions,\nprivately negotiated settlements, and concerns about the future outcomes of such lawsuits could result in outcomes that impact\nthe industry as a whole. For example, such lawsuits could lead to changes in how real estate commissions are negotiated,\ncalculated, or paid, which may in turn meaningfully impact how home buyers and sellers engage with real estate professionals\nin the course of buying and selling a home. (cid:3)\nBeyond the NAR Class Action and various similar private actions already pending, beginning in 2018, the DOJ\ncommenced an investigation into NAR for violations of the federal antitrust laws. The DOJ and NAR appeared to reach a\nresolution in November 2020, resulting in the filing of a Complaint and Proposed Consent Judgment pursuant to which NAR\nagreed to adopt certain rule changes, such as increased disclosure of commission offers. The DOJ has since sought to continue\nits investigation of NAR, and the question of whether the earlier settlement forecloses further investigation is currently being\nlitigated. It is uncertain what effect, if any, the resumption of the DOJ’s investigation could have on the larger real estate\nindustry, including any further settlement that may result therefrom. Beyond monetary damages, the various class action suits\nseek to change real estate industry practices and, along with the DOJ investigation, have prompted state and local real estate\nboards or multiple listing services to discuss and consider changes to long-established rules and regulations. (cid:3)\nAlthough changes arising from these lawsuits and investigations are uncertain and challenging to predict, they could\nresult in outcomes that materially impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, if agent\ncommissions are meaningfully impacted, it could reduce the marketing budgets of real estate partners or reduce the number of\nreal estate partners participating in the industry, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. (cid:3)\nIf Real Estate, Rental and Mortgage Professionals, Home Builders, Property Managers or Other Real Estate Partners\nReduce or End Their Spending With Us or if We Are Unable to Effectively Manage Advertising and Product Inventory or\nPricing, Our Business Could Be Harmed.\nOur business depends in part on revenue generated through sales of advertising and other products and services to real\nestate agents and brokerages, rental professionals, mortgage professionals, home builders, property managers, and other real\nestate partners in categories relevant to real estate (collectively, “real estate partners”). Our ability to attract and retain real\nestate partners, and ultimately to generate advertising revenue, depends on a number of factors, including how successfully we\ncan:\n• increase the number of customers who use one or more of our products and services to effectuate transactions and the\nfrequency of their use, provide them with tools to promote engagement between real estate market participants, and\nenhance their user experience so we can retain them;\n• offer an attractive return on investment to our real estate partners for their spending with us;\n• continue to develop our products and services to increase adoption by and engagement with our real estate partners;\n• keep pace with and anticipate changes in technology to provide industry-leading products and services to real estate\npartners and customers; and\n• compete effectively for advertising dollars with other options.\nResidential revenue accounted for 75% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. This level of revenue\nconcentration suggests that even modest decreases in individual spending across the real estate partner population, caused by\nactual or perceived decreases to return on investment, preference for a competitive product or service, or other factors, could\nhave a significant negative impact on our ability to use proceeds generated from our Residential products and services to invest\nin our other products and services, which we view as a key competitive advantage. Any such decreases in spending could also\nadversely affect our results of operations. We do not have long-term contracts with many of our real estate partners. Our real\nestate partners could choose to modify or discontinue their relationships with us with little or no advance notice. For example,\nour auction-based account interface for Premier Agent partners allows agent partners to independently control the duration of\ntheir advertising commitments for varying terms.\n14\nWe may not succeed in retaining existing real estate partners’ spending or capturing a greater share of such spending if\nwe are unable to convince real estate partners of the effectiveness or superiority of our products as compared to alternatives. In\naddition, we continually evaluate and utilize various pricing and value delivery strategies in order to better align our revenue\nopportunities with the growth in usage of our mobile and web platforms and customer transactions. For example, we offer a pay\nfor performance pricing model called “Flex” for Premier Agents in certain markets. With the Flex model, Premier Agents are\nprovided with validated leads at no initial cost and pay a performance advertising fee only when a real estate transaction is\nclosed with one of the leads. With this pricing model, the transaction price represents variable consideration, as the amount to\nwhich we expect to be entitled varies based on the number of validated leads that convert into real estate transactions and the\nvalue of those transactions. To estimate variable consideration and revenue associated with the Flex model, we use a number of\nassumptions, including estimating the conversion rate of a lead to a real estate transaction, estimating the velocity of\nconversions and estimating the fee amounts likely to be received. We use similar performance based models for our rentals pay\nper lease and StreetEasy Experts products.\nOur estimates of variable consideration are primarily developed based on historical data and our future expectations\nbased on current market trends. Our estimation methodology may be inaccurate and some or all of the revenue we recognize\nwhen our performance obligations are satisfied may be reversed. Realization of performance-based revenue is also dependent\non accurate reporting and remittance by our partners.\nFuture changes to our pricing or lead delivery methodologies for advertising services or product offerings may cause real\nestate partners to reduce or end their spending with us or negatively impact our ability to manage revenue opportunities. If real\nestate partners reduce or end their spending with us, or if we are unable to effectively manage inventory and pricing, our\nadvertising revenue and business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed. In addition, we use revenue\ngenerated from our real estate partners, in part, to fund our operations and investments in our growth pillars. Significant\ndecreases in revenue generated from our real estate partners may negatively impact our ability to fund operations and invest in\nour growth.\nWe May Not Be Able to Maintain or Establish Relationships With Real Estate Brokerages, Real Estate Listing Aggregators,\nMultiple Listing Services, Property Management Companies, Home Builders and Other Third-Party Listing Providers,\nWhich Could Limit the Information We Have to Power Our Products and Services.\nOur ability to attract customers to our mobile applications, websites and other tools depends to some degree on providing\ntimely access to comprehensive and accurate real estate listings and information. To provide these listings and this information,\nwe maintain relationships with real estate brokerages, real estate listing aggregators, multiple listing services (“MLSs”),\nproperty management companies, home builders, other third-party listing providers and homeowners and their real estate agents\nto include listing data in our services (collectively, “real estate listing providers”). Many of our agreements with real estate\nlisting providers may be terminated with limited notice or cause. Many of our competitors and other real estate websites have\nsimilar access to MLSs and listing data and may be able to source certain real estate information faster or more efficiently than\nwe can. Another industry participant or group could create a new listings data service, which could impact the relative quality\nor quantity of information of our listing providers. The loss of existing relationships with real estate listing providers, whether\ndue to termination of agreements, loss of MLS memberships, or otherwise, changes to our rights to use or timely access listing\ndata or an inability to continue to add new listing providers or changes to the way real estate information is shared, may\nnegatively impact our listing data quality. This could markedly decrease the quantity and quality of the for sale and rental listing\ndata and other real estate information that we provide, reduce customer confidence in our products and services and cause\ncustomers to go elsewhere for real estate listings and information, which could severely harm our business, results of operations\nand financial condition.\nWe May Not Be Able to Maintain or Establish Relationships With Other Data Providers, Which Could Limit the Information\nWe Are Able to Provide to Our Customers and Impair Our Ability to Attract or Retain Customers.\nIn addition to the information that we receive from real estate listing providers, we obtain certain real estate data, such as\ntransaction history, property descriptions, tax-assessed value and property taxes paid, under licenses from other third-party data\nproviders, including state and local governments. We use this data to enable the development, maintenance and improvement of\nour marketplace and information services, including Zestimates, Rent Zestimates and our living database of homes. We have\n15\ninvested significant time and resources to develop proprietary algorithms, valuation models, software and practices to use and\nimprove on this specific data. We may be unable to access certain of this data from vendors or government agencies if changes\nin local laws or regulations or other prohibitions on data sharing are implemented or because the quality and quantity of data\navailable to these third parties changes, or because we violate (or are perceived to have violated) the agreements under which\nwe obtain such data. We may also be unable to renew our licenses with these data providers or enter into new data license\nagreements, or we may be able to do so only on terms that are less favorable to us, which could harm our ability to continue to\ndevelop, maintain and improve these information services and could harm our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nIf We Fail to Comply With the Rules and Compliance Requirements of MLSs, Our Access to and Use of Listings Data May\nBe Restricted or Terminated.\nOur subsidiaries that access and use listings data through MLS memberships (the “MLS Members”) must comply with\neach MLS’s rules, compliance requirements and data license agreements to maintain their access to listings data and remain a\nmember in good standing. Each MLS that the MLS Members belong to has adopted its own rules, policies, and agreement\nterms governing, among other things, how MLS data may be used and how listings data must be displayed on our websites and\nmobile applications. The MLS Members are also subject to compliance operations requirements and, as a result, must respond\nto and resolve complaints or notices of non-compliance from the MLS or other MLS participants on required timelines. The\nMLS rules and compliance requirements may not contemplate multi-jurisdictional licensed brokerage entities. MLS rules vary\namong markets and are in some cases inconsistent between MLSs, such that we are required to customize our websites, mobile\napplications, or services to accommodate differences between MLS rules and compliance requirements. Handling complaints\nreceived by the MLS Members across markets may create heightened operational or financial risks with short response and\nresolution deadlines. Complying with the rules and compliance requirements of each MLS requires significant investment,\nincluding personnel, technology and development resources, and the exercise of considerable judgment. Rules and compliance\nrequirements of MLSs may be changed across markets, including potential for targeted changes or interpretations in response to\nour operations. If any of the MLS Members are deemed to be noncompliant with an MLS’s rules or to have provided improper\nresponses to or resolution of complaints, they may face disciplinary sanctions by that MLS, which could include monetary\nfines, restricting, suspending or terminating our access to that MLS’s data, or other disciplinary measures. The loss or\ndegradation of this listings data could materially and adversely affect traffic to our mobile applications and websites, which\ncould severely harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf Our Data Integrity Suffers Real or Perceived Harm, Customers and Real Estate Partners May Decrease Use or\nCease Using Our Products and Services, and We May Be Subject to Legal Liability.\nBecause homes represent significant investments, and many customer decisions regarding homes are data-driven, our\nability to attract and retain customers and real estate partners to our products and services is dependent upon our ability to\npublish, and reputation for publishing, accurate and complete residential real estate information, including the output of\nproprietary models, through our mobile applications and websites. As discussed above, a significant amount of the data we\npublish on our mobile applications and websites is derived from third parties, and we have limited ability to control the quality\nof the information we receive from them. We also publish a significant amount of customer-generated content, and our tools\nand processes designed to ensure the accuracy, quality and legality of such content may not always be effective. Data we\ngenerate independently are subject to error, unauthorized modification by way of third-party viruses and other factors. As the\nvolume of data we publish increases, and potential threats to data quality become more complex, the risk of harm to our data\nintegrity also increases. If our data integrity suffers real or perceived harm, we may be subject to legal liability, reputational\ndamage and customers and real estate partners may decrease their use or cease using our products and services, which would\nharm our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf We Do Not Innovate or Provide High-Quality Products and Services That Deliver Efficient and Integrated Transaction\nExperiences to Our Customers and Real Estate Partners, Our Business Could Be Harmed.\nOur success depends on our continued innovation to provide new, and improve upon existing, products and services that\nmake real estate transactions faster, easier and less stressful for our customers and provide value to real estate, rental and\nmortgage professionals, home buyers and sellers and our other real estate partners. As a result, we must continually invest\n16\nsignificant resources in research and development to improve the attractiveness, competitiveness, and comprehensiveness of\nour products and services, enable smoother and more efficient real estate transactions, adapt to changes in technology and\nsupport new devices and operating systems. If we are unable to provide products and services that our customers want to use,\non the devices they prefer, then those customers may become dissatisfied and use competitors’ mobile applications, websites,\nproducts and services. If our customers begin to access more real estate information and services through other media and we\nfail to innovate, our business may be negatively impacted. If we are unable to continue offering high-quality, innovative\nproducts and services, we may be unable to attract additional customers and real estate partners or retain our current customers\nand real estate partners, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe Face Competition for Users in the Real Estate Category, Which Could Impair Our Ability to Attract Users of Our Mobile\nApplications, Websites and Other Products and Services, Which Could Harm Our Business, Results of Operations and\nFinancial Condition.\nOur business model depends on our ability to continue to attract users to our mobile applications, websites, real estate\nservices and other services and enhance their engagement with our products and services in a cost-effective manner. In addition,\nour ability to be successful depends, in part, on attracting users who have historically shopped for or bought, sold, rented, or\nfinanced their homes through more traditional channels. New entrants continue to join the real estate space at a rapid pace and\nthe tools and services for buying, selling, renting, or financing homes are significantly less developed than in other industries,\nsuch as books, music, travel and other consumer products. Our existing and potential competitors include companies that\noperate, or could develop, national and local real estate, rental, new construction, mortgage, and title and escrow businesses.\nSuch competitors range from companies offering traditional offline advertising media, like newspapers, to innovative\ntechnology companies and from real estate investors, like institutional investors and iBuyers, to mortgage lenders and title and\nsettlement service providers. These companies could devote greater financial, technical and other resources than we have\navailable to real estate services, sales, advertising or research and development, have a more accelerated time frame for\ndeployment or leverage their existing customer bases and proprietary technologies to provide products and services that users\nmight view as superior to our offerings. Any of our future or existing competitors may introduce different services or solutions\nthat attract users or provide services or solutions similar to our own but with better branding or marketing resources. Any of our\ncurrent or future competitors could merge with each other or a separate entity, which may enable them to compete with us even\nmore vigorously and acquire a greater share of customer transactions and engagement. In addition, search engines are always\nevolving and changes to their models or algorithms may negatively impact our placement or require greater investment of\nresources to optimize our placement and attract customers. If the use of online products and services for shopping, renting,\nbuying, selling, or financing residential real estate does not continue to develop and grow or we are not able to continue to\nattract users to our mobile applications, websites, real estate services and other services, our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition could be harmed.\nWe May Not Be Able to Compete Successfully Against Our Existing or Future Competitors in Attracting Customers for Our\nProducts and Services or Real Estate Partners, Which Could Harm Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial\nCondition.\nWe face intense competition in each of our lines of business. We compete with a variety of real estate transaction service\nproviders to attract customers engaging in real estate transactions and we also compete with traditional and online or mobile\nmedia sources to attract real estate partners. Please see “Competition” under Part 1, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor a general discussion of the competitive conditions in each of our businesses.\nCompetitors for our real estate transaction services include rental listing service providers, real estate brokers, real estate\ninvestors, mortgage lenders, mortgage brokers, financial institutions, and title and settlement service providers. Many of these\ncompetitors may have considerable competitive advantages, including longer operating histories, more extensive financial\nresources, stronger brand equity, more industry experience and greater knowledge and expertise. As a result, these competitors\nmay have an advantage in attracting customers, recruiting highly skilled personnel, and growing or maintaining their\nbusinesses. They may also provide customers with real estate transaction services and experiences superior to or more cost-\neffective than ours.\n17\nWe compete against mobile applications and websites dedicated to providing real estate, rental, new construction and\nmortgage information and services to real estate professionals and customers, major internet portals, general search engines, e-\ncommerce and social media sites as well as other technology and media companies. We also compete for a share of our real\nestate partners’ overall marketing budgets with traditional media such as television, magazines, newspapers and\nhome/apartment guide publications, particularly with respect to advertising dollars spent at the local level by real estate\nprofessionals to advertise their qualifications and listings. Large companies with significant brand recognition have large\nnumbers of direct sales personnel and substantial proprietary advertising inventory and mobile application and website traffic,\nwhich may provide a competitive advantage. To compete successfully for real estate transaction partners against future and\nexisting competitors, we must continue to invest resources in developing our advertising platform and proving the effectiveness\nand relevance of our advertising products and services. Pressure from competitors seeking to acquire a greater share of our real\nestate partners’ overall marketing budget could adversely affect our pricing and margins, lower our revenue and increase our\nresearch and development and marketing expenses.\nIf we are unable to compete successfully against our existing or future competitors, we could lose or fail to gain customer\ntransaction share and our business, results of operations or financial condition would be harmed.\nWe Compete in a Dynamic Industry, and We May Invest Significant Resources to Pursue Strategies, Develop New Products\nand Services and Expand Existing Products Into New Markets That Do Not Prove Effective.\nThe industry for residential real estate transaction services, technology, information marketplaces and advertising is\ndynamic, and the expectations and behaviors of customers and professionals shift constantly and rapidly. We continue to learn a\ngreat deal about the behaviors and objectives of residential real estate market participants as the industry evolves and invest\nsignificant resources to develop, test and launch products and services to address the needs of the market and improve the home\nbuying, selling, financing, building and renting experience. Changes or additions to our products and services, including\nexpansion of existing products and services into new markets, may not attract or engage our customers, may reduce confidence\nin our products and services, may negatively impact the quality of our brands, may upset our partners or other industry\nparticipants, may expose us to increased market or legal and regulatory risks, may subject us to new laws and regulations, and\nmay result in reduced investor confidence or otherwise harm our business. For example, if MLSs or other real estate market\nparticipants engage in exclusionary conduct that limits our ability to effectively compete, it may negatively impact our business.\nOn December 22, 2023, Zillow Group, Inc., and ShowingTime.com, LLC filed suit in the United States District Court of\nArizona against Arizona Regional Multiple Listing Service, Inc., Multiple Listing Service, Inc., and MLS Aligned, LLC under\nfederal antitrust laws to prevent the defendants from unlawfully attempting to monopolize the market for real estate showing\nmanagement services in the geographic regions they control and from unlawfully conspiring to exclude or severely limit\nShowingTime in those markets.\nFurther, if we do not realize the benefits we expect from the strategic relationships or we enter into or acquisitions we\ncomplete, our business could be harmed. Customers may prefer other service providers because they offer different or superior\nservices or those services are easier to use, faster or more cost effective than our services. We may not successfully anticipate or\nkeep pace with industry changes, and we may invest considerable financial, personnel and other resources to pursue strategies\nthat do not ultimately prove effective such that our results of operations and financial condition may be harmed.\nNatural Disasters, Geopolitical Events and Catastrophic Events May Disrupt Real Estate Markets, or Otherwise Harm Our\nBusiness.\nThe occurrence of a significant natural disaster or other catastrophic event such as a pandemic, health crisis, earthquake,\nhurricane, windstorm, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, cyber-attack, geopolitical instability, war, civil unrest,\nterrorist attack or other similar event, may disrupt our operations, impair local and regional real estate markets or economies\nand negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic,\nincluding the reactions of governments, markets, and the general public to the COVID-19 pandemic, caused adverse\nconsequences for our business and results of operations.\nZillow provides products and services to customers throughout the United States and to a lesser extent, in Canada. In\naddition, Zillow Home Loans originates loans in 49 states and the District of Columbia. The occurrence of a natural disaster or\n18\nother catastrophic event in any of these localities could have a significant negative impact on those real estate markets and the\nsuccess of our business in the affected regions.\nAlthough the majority of our workforce has shifted to a distributed work environment, we maintain large employee\npopulations, including those supporting our licensed operations, in Seattle, Washington; New York, New York; Atlanta,\nGeorgia; San Francisco, California; Irvine, California; Denver, Colorado; Mexico City, Mexico and Belgrade, Serbia. An\nearthquake or other natural disaster or catastrophic event in any of these cities could disrupt our engineering, sales, operations\nand/or mortgage origination teams and equipment critical to the operation of our business. Similarly, a significant natural\ndisaster or other catastrophic event in any major United States city could negatively impact a large number of our real estate\npartners and customers and cause a decrease in our revenue or traffic.\nBusiness continuity and disaster recovery planning is important, and if we are unable to develop adequate plans to ensure\nthat our business functions continue to operate during and after a disaster or catastrophic event, and successfully execute on\nthose plans in the event of a disaster, catastrophic event, or other emergency, our business and reputation may be harmed.\nOur Dedication to Making Decisions Based Primarily on the Best Interests of Customers May Cause Us to Forgo Short-\nTerm Gains.\nOur guiding principle is to build our business by making decisions based primarily on the best interests of our customers,\nwhich we believe has been essential to our success in increasing our customer growth rate and engagement and has served the\nlong-term interests of our company and our shareholders. In the past, we have forgone, and we will in the future forgo, certain\nexpansion or short-term revenue opportunities that we do not believe are in the best interests of customers, even if such\ndecisions negatively impact our short-term results of operations. In addition, our philosophy of putting customers first may\nnegatively impact our relationships with our existing or prospective real estate partners. This could result in a loss of real estate\npartners, which could harm our revenue and results of operations. For example, in November 2021, we announced plans to\nwind down Zillow Offers operations, in part, because it served too narrow a portion of our customers, instead opting to develop\nand offer other products and services primarily focused within our six growth pillars. In addition, we require our Premier Agent\npartners to maintain a minimum customer experience score and if they fail to do so after a probation period, we have canceled\nadvertising from those partners on our platforms. Our customer focus may also negatively impact our relationships with real\nestate brokerages, MLSs, and other industry participants on whom we rely for listings information. Zillow Home Loans and\nsome of our business-to-business products, for example, may be perceived as impinging upon the business models of real estate\nagents, brokerages and lenders, which may cause them to terminate or decrease the scope of their relationships with us. Such\nrisks could have a materially negative impact on our results of operations. Our principle of making decisions based primarily on\nthe best interests of customers may not result in the long-term benefits that we expect, in which case our user traffic and\nengagement, business and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe Are Subject to Disputes and Current or Proposed Rules and Regulations Regarding the Accuracy or Display of Our\nZestimates and Rent Zestimates.\nWe provide our customers with Zestimate and Rent Zestimate home and rental valuations. Zestimates are our estimated\ncurrent market values of a home based on our proprietary automated valuation models that apply advanced algorithms to\nanalyze our data; they are not appraisals. A Rent Zestimate is our estimated current monthly rental price of a home, using\nsimilar automated valuation models that we have designed to address the unique attributes of rental homes. We are, from time\nto time, involved in disputes with property owners and others who disagree with the accuracy or display of a Zestimate or Rent\nZestimate, and such disputes may result in costly litigation in the future. Further, revisions to our automated valuation models,\nor the algorithms that underlie them, poor data quality, or other factors may cause certain Zestimates or Rent Zestimates to vary\nfrom expectations for those Zestimates or Rent Zestimates. Any such dispute or variation in Zestimates or Rent Zestimates\ncould result in distraction from our business or potentially harm our reputation and financial condition. Among other things, we\nare also subject to proposed legislation that may impose liability or disclosure of our proprietary algorithms, which could\nimpact our competitive advantage and potentially harm our financial position or business results. This legislation could also\nresult in an increased occurrence of enforcement actions or legal disputes as discussed above.\n19\nWe Rely on the Performance of Highly Skilled Personnel, and if We Are Unable to Attract, Retain and Motivate Well-\nQualified Employees, Our Business Could Be Harmed.\nWe believe our success has depended, and continues to depend, on the efforts and talents of our management and our\nhighly skilled team of employees, including our software engineers, data scientists, shared services staff, loan officers,\nstatisticians, marketing professionals and advertising sales staff. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract,\ndevelop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. The loss of any of our senior management or key\nemployees could materially adversely affect our ability to build on the efforts they have undertaken and to execute our business\nplan, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements. The market for highly skilled personnel is very competitive. We\ncannot ensure that we will be able to retain the services of any members of our senior management or other key employees.\nFurthermore, we have in the past and may in the future take measures in order to slow attrition. For example, to support\nretention of employees, in August 2022, we issued certain equity grants and repriced certain outstanding unvested stock\noptions. If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees, retaining and motivating existing employees in a cost-\neffective manner, or engaging in succession planning, our business could be harmed.\nWe Have and May Continue to Make Acquisitions and Investments, Which Could Result in Operating Difficulties, Dilution\nand Other Harmful Consequences.\nWe continue to evaluate a wide array of potential strategic opportunities, including acquisitions and investments. For\nexample, we acquired ShowingTime.com, Inc. in September 2021, VRX Media Group LLC in December 2022, Aryeo, Inc. in\nJune 2023, Spruce Holdings, Inc. in September 2023, and Enchant, LLC, d/b/a Follow Up Boss, in December 2023. Any\ntransactions that we enter into could be material to our financial condition and results of operation. The transactions we pursue\nmay not result in the intended benefits to our business, and we may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired products,\ntechnology, or personnel, or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction. The process of closing a\ntransaction and integrating an acquired company, business or technology could create unforeseen operating difficulties and\nexpenditures. Potential risks include: diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition\nclosing and integration challenges; customer and industry acceptance of products and services offered by the acquired\ncompany; implementation or remediation of controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company; compliance with\ndiffering laws and regulations applicable to international jurisdictions, if applicable; coordination of product, engineering and\nsales and marketing functions; retention of employees from the acquired company; liability for activities of the acquired\ncompany before the acquisition; litigation or other claims arising in connection with the acquired company; and impairment\ncharges associated with goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. For example, we have recognized impairment charges\nrelated to certain acquired intangible assets in the past.\nOur failure to address these risks or problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and\ninvestments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated\nliabilities, and harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur Fraud Detection Processes and Information Security Systems May Not Successfully Detect All Fraudulent Activity by\nThird Parties Aimed at Our Employees or Customers, Which Could Adversely Affect Our Reputation and Business Results.\nThird-party actors have attempted in the past, and may attempt in the future, to conduct fraudulent activity by engaging\nwith our customers by, for example, posting fake real estate and rental listings on our sites and attempting to solicit personal\ninformation or money from customers, and by engaging with our employees by, for example, making fake requests for transfer\nof funds or sensitive information. We make a large number of wire transfers in connection with loan and real estate closings and\nprocess sensitive personal data in connection with these transactions. We also enable certain rental transactions through our\nZillow Rental Manager products, which may be separately subject to a risk of fraudulent activity. Though we have sophisticated\nfraud detection processes and have taken other measures to identify fraudulent activity on our mobile applications, websites and\ninternal systems, we may not be able to detect and prevent all such activity. Similarly, the third parties we use to effectuate\nthese transactions may fail to maintain adequate controls or systems to detect and prevent fraudulent activity. Persistent or\npervasive fraudulent activity may cause customers and real estate partners to lose trust in us and decrease or terminate their\nusage of our products and services, or could result in financial loss, thereby harming our business and results of operations.\n20\nWe Are Subject to Multiple Risks Related to the Credit Card and Debit Card Payments We Accept.\nWe accept payments through credit and debit card transactions. For credit and debit card payments, we pay interchange\nand other fees, which may increase over time. An increase in those fees may require us to increase the prices we charge and\nincrease our operating expenses, either of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on processing vendors to complete credit and debit card transactions, both for payments owed to Zillow\nGroup directly and for payments to other third parties, such as payments made between two third-party platform users such as\nrenters and landlords in our rental payments product. If we or our processing vendors fail to maintain adequate systems for the\nauthorization and processing of credit card transactions, it could cause one or more of the major credit card companies to\ndisallow our continued use of their payment products. If these systems fail to work properly and, as a result, we do not charge\nour customers’ credit cards on a timely basis or at all, our business, revenue, results of operations and financial condition could\nbe harmed. In addition, if we add, eliminate or change any of our processing vendors, we may experience processing\ndisruptions and increased operating expenses, either of which could harm our business, financial condition, or results of\noperations.\nThe payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by criminals, who are becoming\nincreasingly sophisticated, seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in the payment\nsystems. If we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept, or if payment-related\ndata are compromised due to a breach of data, we may be liable for significant costs incurred by payment card issuing banks\nand other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of\npayments may be impaired. In addition, our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which may result in a\nshift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs. If we fail to adequately\ncontrol fraudulent credit card transactions, we may face civil liability, diminished public perception of our security measures,\nand significantly higher credit card-related costs, each of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nWe are also subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic\nfunds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it more difficult for us to comply. We are required to comply\nwith payment card industry security standards. Failing to comply with those standards may violate payment card association\noperating rules, federal and state laws and regulations, and the terms of our contracts with payment processors. Any failure to\ncomply fully also may subject us to fines, penalties, damages and civil liability, reputational risk and may result in the loss or\nimpairment of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments. Further, there is no guarantee that such compliance will\nprevent illegal or improper use of our payment systems or the theft, loss, or misuse of data pertaining to credit and debit cards,\ncard holders and transactions.\nIf we are unable to maintain our chargeback rate or refund rates at acceptable levels, our processing vendors may increase\nour transaction fees or terminate their relationships with us. Any increases in our credit and debit card fees could harm our\nresults of operations, particularly if we elect not to raise our rates for our service to offset the increase. The termination of our\nability to process payments on any major credit or debit card could significantly impair our ability to operate our business.\nSome of Our Potential Losses May Not Be Covered by Insurance. We May Not Be Able to Obtain or Maintain Adequate\nInsurance Coverage.\nWe maintain insurance to cover costs and losses from certain risk exposures in the ordinary course of our operations, but\nour insurance may not cover 100% of the costs and losses from all events. We are responsible for certain retentions and\ndeductibles that vary by policy, and we may suffer losses that exceed our insurance coverage by a material amount. We may\nalso incur costs or suffer losses arising from events against which we have no insurance coverage. In addition, large scale\ninsurance market trends or the occurrence of adverse events in our business may raise our cost of procuring insurance or limit\nthe amount or type of insurance we are able to secure. We may not be able to maintain our current coverage, or obtain new\ncoverage in the future, on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\n21\nOur Business Subjects Us and Our Customers to Environmental Regulation, Which Creates Uncertainty Regarding Future\nLiabilities.\nUnder various federal, state and local environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may\nbe liable for the cost of removing or remediating hazardous or toxic substances on such property. Such laws often impose\nliability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic\nsubstances. Even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination, each person covered by applicable\nenvironmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean-up costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner\nor operator of a site for damages based on personal injury, natural resources or property damage or other costs, including\ninvestigation and clean-up costs, resulting from the environmental contamination. The presence of hazardous or toxic\nsubstances on one of our properties, including homes previously held in our inventory in connection with Zillow Offers\noperations, or the failure to properly remediate a contaminated property, could give rise to a lien in favor of the government for\ncosts it may incur to address the contamination. A property owner who violates environmental laws may be subject to sanctions\nwhich may be enforced by governmental agencies or, in certain circumstances, private parties. The cost of defending against\nenvironmental claims, of compliance with environmental regulatory requirements or of remediating any contaminated property\ncould materially and adversely affect us.\nCompliance with new or more stringent environmental and climate-related laws or regulations or stricter interpretation of\nexisting laws may require material expenditures by us. We cannot assure you that future laws, ordinances or regulations will not\nimpose any material environmental or other liability to us. In addition, we may be required to comply with various local, state\nand federal fire, health, life-safety and similar regulations. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result\nin fines and/or damages, suspension of personnel, civil liability or other sanctions.\nIf Our Security Measures or Technology Systems, or Those of Third Parties Upon Which We Rely, Are Compromised, We\nMay Be Subject to Legal Claims and Suffer Significant Losses, and Customers May Curtail Use of Our Products and\nServices and Our Real Estate Partners May Reduce or Eliminate Their Advertising on Our Mobile Applications and\nWebsites.\nOur products and services involve the transmission, processing, and/or storage of users’ information, some of which may\nbe private or include personally identifiable information such as social security numbers, financial account information, and\ncredit card information. For example, our dotloop real estate transaction management software stores sensitive personal and\nfinancial information, our Mortech mortgage product and pricing software for mortgage professionals processes social security\nnumbers, our rental applications product allows customers to obtain credit and background checks containing sensitive personal\nand financial information, and Zillow Home Loans, our mortgage origination business, and our real estate closings business,\nreceive, handle and transmit highly sensitive personal and financial information about its customers. Cyber-attacks, malicious\ninternet-based activity, online and offline fraud, administrative or technical failures and other similar activities threaten the\nconfidentiality, integrity and availability of our information technology systems, including those of the third parties upon which\nwe rely, and our sensitive data, including customer, employee and real estate partner data as well as intellectual property and\nother confidential business information, which could result in potential significant liability and litigation. Such threats are\nprevalent and continue to rise, are increasingly difficult to detect and come from a variety of sources, including traditional\ncomputer “hackers”, threat actors, “hacktivists”, organized criminal threat actors, personnel (such as through theft or misuse),\nsophisticated nation states and nation-state-supported actors.\nSome actors now engage and are expected to continue to engage in cyber-attacks, including without limitation nation-\nstate actors for geopolitical reasons and in conjunction with military conflicts and defense activities. During times of war and\nother major conflicts, we and the third parties upon which we rely may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of these attacks,\nincluding retaliatory cyber-attacks, that could materially disrupt our systems and operations, supply chain and ability to\nproduce, sell and distribute our services.\nWe and the third parties upon which we rely may be subject to a variety of evolving threats, including but not limited to\nsocial-engineering attacks (including through deep fakes, which may be increasingly more difficult to identify as fake, and\nphishing attacks), malicious code (such as viruses and worms), malware (including as a result of advanced persistent threat\nintrusions), denial-of-service attacks (such as credential stuffing), credential stuffing attacks, personnel misconduct or error,\n22\nransomware attacks, supply-chain attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or\nother information technology assets, adware, telecommunications failures, earthquakes, fires, or floods, attacks enhanced or\nfacilitated by AI, and other similar threats. In particular, severe ransomware attacks are becoming increasingly prevalent and\ncan lead to significant interruptions in our operations, impact our ability to provide our products or services, loss of sensitive\ndata and income, reputational harm and diversion of funds. Extortion payments may alleviate the negative impact of a\nransomware attack, but we may be unwilling or unable to make such payments due to, for example, applicable laws or\nregulations prohibiting such payments.\nRemote work has become more common and has increased risks to our information technology systems and data, as more\nof our employees utilize network connections, computers and devices outside our premises or network, including working at\nhome, while in transit and in public locations. Additionally, future or past business transactions (such as acquisitions or\nintegrations) could expose us to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities, as our systems could be negatively affected\nby vulnerabilities present in acquired or integrated entities’ systems and technologies. Outside parties may attempt to\nfraudulently induce employees, officers, directors, customers or real estate partners to disclose sensitive information in order to\ngain access to our information or our customers’ or real estate partners’ information, and our information technology and\ninfrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to user error, malfeasance or other disruptions. If we\nexperience compromises to our security that result in the loss or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, our\ncustomers and real estate partners may lose trust in us, customers may decrease the use of our mobile applications or websites\nor stop using our mobile applications, websites, or services in their entirety, real estate partners may decrease or stop\nadvertising on our mobile applications or websites, and we may be subject to legal claims and liability, government\ninvestigation and additional state and federal legal requirements. If we experience compromises to our security that result in the\nloss of availability of our data, our mobile applications, websites, or services may be unable to function at a level necessary to\nmeet our customers’ needs.\nOur reliance on vendors could introduce new cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities, including supply-chain attacks, and\nother threats to our business operations. We engage a variety of vendors to process and store sensitive data, including certain\ncustomer information, some of which may be private or include personally identifiable information. We also depend on vendors\nto host many of the systems and infrastructure used to provide our products and services. Our ability to monitor these vendors’\ninformation security practices is limited and these vendors may not have adequate information security measures in place. If our\nvendors experience a security incident or other interruption, we could experience adverse consequences, including harm to our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. Further, a security breach at our vendor could be perceived by customers\nor our real estate partners as a breach of our systems and could result in damage to our reputation and expose us to other losses.\nWhile we may be entitled to damages if our vendors fail to satisfy their privacy or security-related obligations to us, any award\nmay be insufficient to cover our damages, or we may be unable to recover such award. In addition, supply-chain attacks have\nincreased in frequency and severity, and we cannot guarantee that third parties’ infrastructure in our supply chain or our third-\nparty partners’ supply chains have not been compromised.\nAny of the previously identified or similar threats could cause a security incident or other interruption that could result in\nunauthorized, unlawful or accidental acquisition, modification, destruction, loss, alteration, encryption, disclosure of or access\nto our sensitive data of our information technology systems, or those of the third parties upon whom we rely. A security incident\nor other interruption could disrupt our ability (and that of third parties upon whom we rely) to provide our services.\nWhile we have security measures designed to protect against security incidents, there can be no assurance that these\nmeasures will be effective. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage\nsystems change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target, and may originate from less regulated and\nremote areas around the world, we may be unable to proactively address all these techniques or to implement adequate\npreventative measures. We take steps to detect and remediate vulnerabilities, but we may not be able to detect and remediate all\nvulnerabilities because the threats and techniques change frequently and are often sophisticated in nature. Therefore, such\nvulnerabilities could be exploited but may not be detected until after a security incident has occurred. Unremediated high risk or\ncritical vulnerabilities pose material risks to our business. Further, we may experience delays in developing and deploying\nremedial measures designed to address any such identified vulnerabilities.\n23\nApplicable data privacy and security obligations may require us to notify relevant stakeholders of security incidents. Such\ndisclosures are costly and the disclosure or the failure to comply with such requirements could lead to adverse consequences.\nIf we (or a third party upon whom we rely) experience a security incident or are perceived to have experienced a security\nincident, we may experience adverse consequences. These consequences may include: government enforcement actions (for\nexample, investigations, fines, penalties, audits and inspections); additional reporting requirements and/or oversight; restrictions\non processing sensitive data (including personal data); litigation (including class action claims); indemnification obligations;\nnegative publicity; reputational harm; monetary fund diversions; interruptions in our operations (including availability of data);\nfinancial loss and other similar harms. Any or all of these consequences could negatively impact our ability to attract new\ncustomers and increase engagement by existing customers, prevent or cause existing customers to stop using our products or\nservices or close their accounts, or cause existing real estate partners to cancel their contracts, thereby harming our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition to experiencing a security incident, third parties may gather, collect, or infer sensitive information about us\nfrom public sources, data brokers, or other means that reveals competitively sensitive details about our organization and could\nbe used to undermine our competitive advantage or market position. Additionally, sensitive information of the Company or our\ncustomers could be leaked, disclosed, or revealed as a result of or in connection with our employee’s’, personnel’s, or vendor’s\nuse of generative AI technologies.\nOur contracts may not contain limitations of liability, and even where they do, there can be no assurance that limitations\nof liability in our contracts are sufficient to protect us from liabilities, damages or claims related to our data privacy and\ninformation security obligations. We cannot be sure that our insurance coverage will be adequate or sufficient to protect us from\nor to mitigate liabilities arising out of our privacy and security practices, that such coverage will continue to be available on\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all or that such coverage will pay future claims.\nAny Significant Disruption in Service on Our Mobile Applications or Websites or in Our Network Could Damage Our\nReputation and Brands, and Result in a Loss of Customers of Our Products and Services and of Our Real Estate Partners,\nWhich Could Harm Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\nOur brand, reputation and ability to attract customers and real estate partners and deliver quality products and services\ndepend on the reliable performance of our network infrastructure and content delivery processes. Our mobile applications and\nwebsites are exposed to attempts to overload our servers with denial-of-service attacks or similar disruptions from unauthorized\nuse of our computer systems. We have experienced minor interruptions in these systems in the past, including server failures\nthat temporarily slowed the performance of our mobile applications and websites, and we may experience interruptions in the\nfuture. Interruptions in these systems, whether due to system failures, computer viruses, software errors or physical or\nelectronic break-ins, could affect the security or availability of our products and services on our mobile applications and\nwebsites and prevent or inhibit the ability of customers to access or effect transactions using our services. Since our customers\nmay rely on our products and services, including our real estate transaction services and customer relationship management\ntools, for important aspects of their personal lives and businesses, problems with the reliability, availability or security of our\nsystems could damage our customers’ businesses, harm our reputation, delay or inhibit a customer from completing a real estate\ntransaction, result in a loss of customers of our products and services and of real estate partners and result in additional costs,\nany of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nTo deliver mobile and web Zillow Group brand content while ensuring scalability and redundancy, as well as internal\nsupport for our enterprise, we utilize both third-party web services for cloud computing and storage and shared data centers in\nvarious locations across the United States.\nWe do not own or control the operation of certain of these facilities. Our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage\nor interruption from fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, acts of war, electronic and physical\nbreak-ins, computer viruses, earthquakes and similar events. The occurrence of any of the foregoing events could result in\ndamage to our systems and hardware or could cause them to fail completely, and our insurance may not cover such events or\nmay be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur.\n24\nA failure of our systems at one site could result in reduced functionality for our customers, and a total failure of our\nsystems could cause our mobile applications or websites to be inaccessible or for us to be unable to carry out day-to-day\noperations. Problems faced by our third-party web-hosting providers with the telecommunications network providers with\nwhich they contract or with the systems by which they allocate capacity among their customers, including us, could adversely\naffect the experience of our customers. Our third-party web-hosting providers could decide to close their facilities without\nadequate notice. Any financial difficulties, such as bankruptcy reorganization, faced by our third-party web-hosting providers or\nany of the service providers with whom they contract may have negative effects on our business, the nature and extent of which\nare difficult to predict. If our third-party web-hosting providers are unable to keep up with our growing needs for capacity, our\ncustomers, real estate partners and business could be harmed. In addition, if distribution channels for our mobile applications\nexperience disruptions, such disruptions could adversely affect the ability of users and potential users to access or update our\nmobile applications, which could harm our business.\nWe may not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses,\nincluding the potential harm to the future growth of our business, which may result from interruptions in our service as a result\nof system failures. Any errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems with our services could harm our reputation,\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe Rely Upon Certain Third-Party Services to Support Critical Functions of Our Business and Any Disruption of or\nInterference with our Use of those Third-Party Services Could Adversely Impact Our Operations and Our Business.\nA limited number of third-party services support essential functions of our business, including Amazon Web Services\n(“AWS”) and certain other cloud communications platform-as-a-service (“CPaaS”), Infrastructure-as-a-Service (“IaaS”) and\nSoftware-as-a-Service (“SaaS Services”) technologies hosted by third parties (together with CPaaS and IaaS, “Cloud\nServices”). AWS provides us with a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, which is commonly\nreferred to as a “cloud” computing service. Certain of our computer systems utilize data processing, storage capabilities and\nother services provided by AWS, and we currently run the vast majority of computing to power our mobile applications,\nwebsites, and other technology products and services on AWS, as our preferred cloud provider. In addition, we use Cloud\nServices to support important functions of our business, including enterprise resource planning, accounting, including revenue\nrecognition, real estate transaction services, customer communications, and customer relationship management. We store a\nsignificant amount of information about our customers, real estate partners, employees, and business on AWS and in the Cloud\nServices, and we rely on these third-party service providers to provide services on a timely and effective basis. Their failure to\nperform as expected or as required by contract could result in significant disruptions and costs to our operations. In light of our\nreliance on AWS and Cloud Services, coupled with the complexity of obtaining replacement services, any disruption of, or\ninterference with, or change in terms that impacts our use of or the cost to use these third-party services could adversely impact\nour operations and business.\nWe Have and May Continue to be Subject to Outstanding Claims Related to Zillow Offers and Zillow Closing Services\nFollowing the Wind Down of their Respective Operations.\nWe have and may in the future be subject to, claims, suits, government investigations, enforcement actions and\nproceedings arising from or related to Zillow Offers or Zillow Closing Services, including actions with respect to the purchase,\nrenovation and resale of properties; Zillow Offers operations; Zillow Closing Services operations; and the subsequent wind\ndown of operations, including those matters described in Part II, Item 8 in Note 16 under the subsection titled “Legal\nProceedings. Regardless of the outcome, any such legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs,\ndiversion of management and other personnel, and other factors. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such\nproceedings could result in reputational harm, liability, fines, penalties, or sanctions, as well as judgments, consent decrees, or\norders, which could in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\n25\nRisks Related to Our Mortgages Business\nIf Zillow Home Loans is Unable to Obtain and Maintain Sufficient Financing to Fund Its Origination of Mortgages or is\nUnable to Resell Mortgages on the Secondary Market, Our Mortgages Business and Financial Results May Suffer.\nZillow Home Loans funds substantially all of its lending operations using warehouse and loan repurchase facilities,\nintending to sell substantially all loans and corresponding servicing rights to third-party financial institutions, government-\nsponsored entities or mortgage servicing rights purchasers after a holding period. A substantial portion of the amounts available\nunder these warehouse and loan repurchase facilities are not committed, meaning the applicable lender is not obligated to, but\nmay in its discretion, advance loan funds beyond the committed amounts up to the maximum borrowing capacity. Zillow Home\nLoans’ borrowings are then generally repaid with the proceeds it receives from mortgage sales. To maintain and grow its\nbusiness, Zillow Home Loans depends, in part, on having sufficient borrowing capacity under its current facilities or obtaining\nadditional borrowing capacity under new facilities. If Zillow Home Loans is not able to negotiate with its lenders to advance\nloan funds beyond the committed amounts under its warehouse and repurchase facilities or to otherwise obtain and maintain\ndebt financing with sufficient capacity or flexibility on acceptable terms, and does not have sufficient available cash on hand,\nthen Zillow Home Loans may be unable to maintain or increase the volume of mortgage loans that it originates, may be limited\nin the type or quantity of loans it can fund, may lose customers to other mortgage lenders and its business may suffer. If Zillow\nHome Loans is unable to form or retain relationships with third-party financial institutions to purchase its loans or is unable to\ncomply with any covenant in its agreements with these institutions, or is unable to do so on acceptable terms, it may be unable\nto sell its loans on the secondary market on favorable terms or at all. If Zillow Home Loans is unable to sell its loans or is\nrequired to repurchase the loans from third parties, it may be required to hold the loans for investment or sell them at a discount.\nZillow Home Loans Product Offerings May Not Meet Customers’ Financing Needs, Which Could Cause Them to Use Other\nLenders.\nZillow Home Loans currently offers a number of mortgage products to customers including conventional conforming and\nnon-conforming programs and government loan guarantee programs. Such offerings are subject to change based on various\nfactors such as availability, business needs and customer demand. If these programs do not meet the financing needs of our\ncustomers, and we do not adapt to market changes and customer preferences, customers may opt to obtain financing from other\nlenders who offer different or more competitive rates or loan products. Similarly, if any of the government sponsored entities or\ngovernment loan guarantee programs amend the terms of an existing loan program, cease offering the program, limit our ability\nto use the program or revoke the authority of Zillow Home Loans to offer such programs, we may have to make changes to or\ndiscontinue the mortgage products that we offer, which may negatively affect our business.\nZillow Home Loans May Not Be Able to Continue to Grow its Mortgage Loan Origination Business, Which Could\nNegatively Affect Our Mortgages Business, Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe Zillow Home Loans mortgage loan origination business consists of providing purchase money loans to homebuyers\nand refinancing existing loans. The volume of originations of purchase money mortgage loans by Zillow Home Loans and\nfuture growth is impacted by, among other things, awareness of Zillow Home Loans and use of other Zillow products and\nservices during the home buying and selling process. Changes to the other products and services that Zillow or its real estate\npartners provide may negatively impact demand for Zillow Home Loans. In addition, our ability to secure relationships with\ntraditional business clients may influence our ability to grow our loan origination business. Our production and consumer direct\nlending operations are also subject to overall market factors that can impact our ability to grow our loan production volume. For\nexample, volatile interest rates, affordability challenges, increased competition from new and existing market participants,\nreductions in the overall level of refinancing activity or slow growth in the level of new home purchase activity can impact our\nability to continue to grow our loan production volumes, and we may be forced to accept lower margins in our respective\nbusinesses in order to continue to compete and keep our volume of activity consistent with past or projected levels. If we are\nunable to continue to grow our loan origination business, this could adversely affect our business.\n26\nZillow Home Loans Is Dependent on United States Government-Sponsored Entities and Government Agencies, and Any\nActions by These Entities or Changes in These Entities or Their Operations Could Adversely Affect Our Mortgage Business,\nLiquidity, Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe ability of Zillow Home Loans to generate revenue through loan sales depends, in part, on its participation in\nprograms administered by government agencies such as the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development’s\nFederal Housing Administration, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, the United States Department of\nAgriculture, or government-sponsored entities (“GSEs”) such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) or\nthe Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”). Presently, some of the loans Zillow Home Loans originates are\nsold on a direct basis to a GSE, while others are sold “whole loan” to individual investors on the secondary market. If any of\nthese government agencies or GSEs limit Zillow Home Loans’ ability to participate in any of these programs, or if the operation\nof any of these government agencies or GSEs or the programs they administer are eliminated or changed, our mortgages\nbusiness, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nA number of legislative proposals have been introduced in recent years that would wind down or phase out the GSEs,\nincluding proposals to end the conservatorship and privatize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It is not possible to predict the scope\nand nature of the actions that the United States government, including the current administration, will ultimately take with\nrespect to the GSEs. Any changes in laws and regulations affecting the relationship between Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and\ntheir regulators or the United States federal government, and any changes in leadership at any of these entities could adversely\naffect our mortgages business and prospects. Any discontinuation of, or significant reduction in, the operation of Fannie Mae or\nFreddie Mac or any significant adverse change in their capital structure, financial condition, activity levels in the primary or\nsecondary mortgage markets or underwriting criteria could materially and adversely affect our mortgages business, liquidity,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations. A discontinuation or reduction in the operations of the GSEs could also affect\n“whole loan” sales on the secondary market, as there is a potential that this could cause a sharp decline in investor appetite.\nZillow Home Loans Operates in a Highly Regulated Industry, and Federal, State, and Local Laws and Regulations,\nIncluding Many That Are Continually Changing, Could Materially and Adversely Affect Our Business, Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations.\nZillow Home Loans is required to comply with a wide array of federal, state and local laws and regulations that regulate,\namong other things, the manner in which it conducts its loan origination business. These regulations directly impact the Zillow\nHome Loans business and require constant compliance, monitoring and internal and external audits.\nZillow Home Loans’ failure to operate effectively and in compliance with these laws, regulations and rules could subject\nus to lawsuits or governmental actions and damage our reputation, which could materially and adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations. For example, Zillow Home Loans’ failure to comply with these laws, regulations\nand rules may result in increased costs of doing business, changes to the way we operate our business, reduced payments by\nborrowers, modification of the original terms of loans, permanent forgiveness of debt, delays in the foreclosure process,\nforfeiture or refunds on fees collected on loan originations, increased servicing advances, litigation, reputational damage,\nenforcement actions, and repurchase and indemnification obligations.\nIn addition, Zillow Homes Loans must ensure that our lending operations serve consumers in accordance with a variety of\nfederal and state fair lending laws and regulations, including without limitation the Fair Housing Act, the Equal Credit\nOpportunity Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and the prohibition against engaging in Unfair, Deceptive, or Abusive\nActs or Practices pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, Federal Trade Commission Act, and state corollaries. Our inability to conduct\nour lending operations in compliance with fair lending laws and regulations may expose Zillow Home Loans to regulatory\naction, litigation, and reputational damage, among other things.\nOur Mortgages Business is Impacted by Interest Rates. Changes in Prevailing Interest Rates May Have an Adverse Effect\non Our Financial Results.\nOur financial performance is directly affected by changes in prevailing interest rates and home prices, which in turn,\nimpact the affordability of a home. Our financial performance may be adversely affected or be subject to substantial volatility\n27\nbecause of changes in prevailing interest rates, which may be impacted by a number of factors. For example, in recent years,\ndue to inflationary pressures, there was an increased degree of uncertainty and unpredictability concerning current interest rates,\nfuture interest rates and potential negative interest rates, which had an adverse effect on the results of operations.\nConsumer demand for certain mortgage products and loan types are frequently driven by changes in market conditions,\ninterest rates, lender fees, and other transaction costs. If interest rates continue to rise or remain elevated, our business could be\nadversely affected if we are unable to increase our share of purchase mortgages or if affordability challenges contract the total\naddressable market. In either case, our mortgage origination business and our financial results could be harmed.\nZillow Home Loans uses derivatives and other instruments to reduce exposure to adverse changes in interest rates.\nHedging interest rate risk is a complex process, requiring sophisticated models and constant monitoring. Zillow Home Loans’\nhedging activity may fail to provide adequate coverage for interest rate exposure due to market volatility, hedging instruments\nthat do not directly correlate with the interest rate risk exposure being hedged or counterparty defaults on obligations. Certain of\nour hedges related to newly originated mortgages may be subject to margin calls, which, if made, could adversely impact our\nliquidity. There may be periods during which Zillow Home Loans elects not to hedge some or all of its interest rate risk.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe May Be Unable to Adequately Protect Our Intellectual Property, Which Could Harm the Value of Our Brands and Our\nBusiness.\nWe regard our intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright and patent law, trade\nsecret protection and contracts to protect our proprietary rights. If we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property,\nthe value of our brands and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nWhile we believe that our issued patents and pending patent applications help to protect our business, we cannot ensure\nthat our operations do not, or will not, infringe valid, enforceable patents of third parties or that competitors will not devise new\nmethods of competing with us that are not covered by our patents or patent applications. We cannot ensure that our patent\napplications will be approved, that any patents issued will adequately protect our intellectual property, that such patents will not\nbe challenged by third parties or found to be invalid or unenforceable, or that our patents will be effective in preventing third\nparties from utilizing a “copycat” business model to offer the same products or services. Aspects of the technology underlying\nour Zestimate home valuation model, for example, which we consider to be a trade secret affording us a key competitive\nadvantage with respect to customer engagement, is currently protected by patents, the loss of which could benefit comparable\nservices provided by our competitors and result in decreased user traffic and engagement with our mobile applications and\nwebsites, thereby harming our results of operations and financial condition. In addition to our patented technology, our\nZestimate home valuation model uses a significant amount of proprietary, trade secret methodology. Any accidental disclosure,\nor disclosure in response to litigation or regulatory inquiries that do not include confidential information protection could harm\nour competitive advantage.\nEffective trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which\nour products and services may be provided. The laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as\nthe laws of the United States and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect intellectual property and our\nproprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could harm our competitive position.\nWe have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or\ncopyrighted material, to third parties. These licensees may take actions that might diminish the value of our proprietary rights or\nharm our reputation, even if we have agreements prohibiting such activity. Though certain of these third parties are obligated to\nindemnify us for breaches of our intellectual property rights, they may be unable to meet these obligations. In addition, we rely\non intellectual property and technology developed or licensed by third parties, and we may not be able to obtain licenses and\ntechnologies from these third parties on reasonable terms or at all. Any of these events could harm our business, results of\noperations or financial condition.\nIn addition, we may actively pursue entities that infringe our intellectual property, including through legal action. Taking\nsuch action may be costly, and we cannot ensure that such actions will be successful. Any increase in the unauthorized use of\n28\nour intellectual property could make it more expensive for us to do business and harm our results of operations or financial\ncondition. Similarly, we may not be able to adequately protect innovations resulting from generative artificial intelligence\n(“AI”) due to existing copyright and patent laws.\nIntellectual Property Disputes Are Costly to Defend and Could Harm Our Business, Results of Operations, Financial\nCondition and Reputation.\nFrom time to time, we face allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual\nproperty rights of third parties. If we are not successful in defending ourselves against these claims, we may be required to pay\ndamages and may be subject to injunctions, each of which could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition\nand reputation. As we grow our business and expand our operations, we expect that we will continue to be subject to intellectual\nproperty claims and allegations. Patent and other intellectual property disputes or litigation may be protracted and expensive,\nand the results are difficult to predict and may require us to stop offering certain products, services or features, purchase\nlicenses that may be expensive to procure, or modify our products or services. In addition, patent or other intellectual property\ndisputes or litigation may result in significant settlement costs. Any of these events could harm our business, results of\noperations, financial condition and reputation.\nIn addition, we use open source software in our services and will continue to use open source software in the future. From\ntime to time, we may be subject to claims brought against companies that incorporate open source software into their products\nor services, claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the source code, the open source software and/or derivative works\nthat were developed using such software, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These\nclaims could also result in litigation, and we may be required to purchase a costly license or remove open source software,\ndevote additional research and development resources to changing our products or services, make generally available the source\ncode for our proprietary technology, or waive certain of our intellectual property rights, any of which would have a negative\neffect on our business and results of operations.\nEven if these matters do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, the\ntime and resources necessary to resolve them could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation.\nWe May Be Unable to Continue to Use the Domain Names That We Use in Our Business, or Prevent Third Parties From\nAcquiring and Using Domain Names That Infringe on, Are Similar to, or Otherwise Decrease the Value of Our Brand or\nOur Trademarks or Service Marks.\nWe have registered domain names for our websites that we use in our business. If we lose the ability to use a domain\nname, we may incur significant expenses to market our products and services under a new domain name, which could harm our\nbusiness. In addition, our competitors could attempt to capitalize on our brand recognition by using domain names similar to\nours. Domain names similar to ours have been registered in the United States and elsewhere. We may be unable to prevent third\nparties from acquiring and using domain names that infringe on, are similar to, or otherwise decrease the value of our brand or\nour trademarks or service marks. Protecting and enforcing our rights in our domain names and determining the rights of others\nmay require litigation, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of management’s attention.\nProprietary Rights Agreements With Employees and Others May Not Adequately Prevent Disclosure of Trade Secrets and\nOther Proprietary Information.\nIn order to protect our technologies and strategic business and operations information, we rely in part on proprietary\nrights agreements and other assignment provisions with our employees, independent contractors, vendors, licensees, and other\nthird parties. These agreements may not be enough to fully mitigate the possibility of inadvertent disclosure of confidential\ninformation, including trade secrets, and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of\nconfidential information. The loss of trade secret protection could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products\nby copying functionality. Others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information, and in such cases,\nwe could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties. Further, if our employees, contractors or other third parties with\nwhom we do business use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in\nrelated or resulting know-how and inventions. Any changes in, or unfavorable interpretations of, intellectual property laws may\n29\ncompromise our ability to enforce our trade secret and intellectual property rights. Costly and time-consuming litigation could\nbe necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain protection of our\ntrade secrets or other proprietary information could harm our business, results of operations, reputation and competitive\nposition.\nWe May Not Be Able to Halt the Operations of Websites That Aggregate or Misappropriate Our Data.\nFrom time to time, third parties have misappropriated our data through website scraping, robots or other means, and\naggregated this data on their websites with data from other companies. In addition, copycat websites have misappropriated data\non our network and attempted to imitate our brand or the functionality of our websites. When we have become aware of such\nwebsites, we have employed technological or legal measures in an attempt to halt their operations. We may not be able,\nhowever, to detect all such websites in a timely manner and, even if we could, technological and legal measures may be\ninsufficient to halt their operations. In some cases, particularly in the case of websites operating outside of the United States,\nour available remedies may not be adequate to protect us against the impact of the operation of such websites. In addition, if\nsuch activity creates confusion among customers or real estate partners, our brands and business could be harmed. This\nmisappropriation of data may also harm our relationships with any third party data providers who originally licensed the data to\nus, including potentially breaching our agreements with these third parties depending on the terms of each license agreement.\nRegardless of whether we can successfully enforce our rights against the operators of these websites, any measures that we may\ntake could require us to expend significant financial or other resources, which could harm our business, results of operations or\nfinancial condition.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Compliance and Legal Matters\nFailure to Comply with Federal, State and Local Laws, Rules and Regulations or to Obtain and Maintain Required Licenses\nor Authorizations, Could Materially and Adversely Affect our Business, Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nWe provide products and services to customers and real estate partners in heavily regulated industries through a number\nof different channels across the United States and to some extent, in Canada. As a result, we are currently subject to a variety of,\nand may in the future become subject to additional or newly enacted, international, federal, state and local laws and regulations\nin various jurisdictions, which are subject to change at any time, including laws regarding the real estate, rental, mortgage and\ninsurance industries, mobile and internet based businesses and other businesses that rely on advertising, as well as privacy, data\nsecurity, and consumer protection laws, and employment laws. These laws are complex and can be costly to comply with,\nrequire significant management time and effort, and subject us to claims, government enforcement actions, civil and criminal\nliability or other remedies, including suspension of business operations. These laws may conflict with each other, and if we\ncomply with the laws of one jurisdiction, it may require us to adjust our practices in other jurisdictions. Our distributed\nworkforce may subject us to employment laws, including employment taxes, in many states and localities in the United States\nand certain foreign jurisdictions, and may increase the costs and expenses we incur to comply with or seek compliance with\nthese laws. In addition, contingent workers engaged by the Company throughout the United States and other current and future\nglobal locations may subject us to laws and taxes in those jurisdictions and may increase the costs and expenses we incur to\ncomply with applicable laws and maintain adequate protection of our rights, including intellectual property rights.\nIn addition, by providing a medium through which users can post content and communicate with one another, we may\nalso be subject to laws governing intellectual property ownership, obscenity, libel, discrimination/hate speech, tenant screening,\nand privacy, among other issues. The real estate agents, mortgage professionals, banks, property managers, rental agents and\ncertain of our other customers and advertisers are subject to various state and federal laws and regulations, including, but not\nlimited to those relating to real estate, rentals and mortgages, which may impact their use of our mobile applications and\nwebsites. We cannot ensure that these entities will comply with applicable laws and regulations, including any future changes to\nthose laws and regulations, at all times. We endeavor to ensure that any content displayed by Zillow Group is consistent with\nsuch laws and regulations by obtaining assurances of compliance from our advertisers and customers for their activities\nthrough, and the content they provide on, our mobile applications and websites.\n30\nIn connection with the real estate transaction products and services that we provide, we maintain real estate brokerage,\ntitle and escrow, mortgage broker, insurance agent/producer and mortgage lender licenses in the markets in which we operate\nthose regulated products and services. Certain of our mortgage marketing products are operated by our wholly owned\nsubsidiary, Zillow Group Marketplace, Inc., a licensed mortgage broker, and we originate residential mortgages through Zillow\nHome Loans, a licensed mortgage lender. Zillow Group Marketplace, Inc. and Zillow Home Loans are subject to stringent state\nand federal laws and regulations and to the scrutiny of state and federal government agencies as a licensed mortgage broker and\nlicensed mortgage lender, respectively. Mortgage products are regulated at the state level by licensing authorities and\nadministrative agencies, and also by the CFPB and other federal agencies. These laws generally regulate the manner in which\nlending and lending-related activities are marketed or made available, including advertising and other consumer disclosures,\npayments for services and record keeping requirements; these laws include but are not limited to the Real Estate Settlement\nProcedures Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing\nAct, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and various federal, state and local laws. The CFPB and\nFTC also have broad authority to enforce prohibitions on practices that it deems to be unfair, deceptive or abusive.\nThe growing regulatory focus, in particular by the CFPB, on artificial intelligence/automated underwriting, digital\nmortgage comparison shopping platforms, dark patterns, property valuation and marketing models, coupled with rapidly\nchanging fair housing and fair lending enforcement priorities by the CFPB and other regulators may impact our ability to adapt\nour business and maintain compliance, which may affect our business operations, financial condition or results of operations.\nState laws may restrict the amount and nature of interest and fees that may be charged by a lender or mortgage broker, or\notherwise regulate the manner in which lenders or mortgage brokers operate or advertise.\nWe hold real estate brokerage licenses through multiple entities in multiple states and may apply for additional real estate\nbrokerage licenses as needed to support our business. To maintain these licenses, we must comply with the requirements\ngoverning licensed real estate activities and brokerage-related businesses in the markets where we operate. We may be subject\nto additional local, state and federal laws and regulations governing residential real estate transactions, including those\nadministered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”), and the states and municipalities in which we\ntransact. Further, due to the geographic scope of our operations and the nature of the services we provide, certain of our other\nsubsidiaries maintain title and escrow licenses in certain states in which we operate.\nA number of our personnel are required to maintain individual real estate agent or broker licenses, title and escrow agent\nlicenses, insurance agent/producer, mortgage broker, mortgage loan originator licenses and mortgage lender licenses. In\naddition, for certain company licenses that we hold, we are required to designate individual licensed brokers of record, qualified\nindividuals and control persons. We cannot assure you that we, or our licensed personnel, are and will remain at all times, in full\ncompliance with real estate, title and escrow, insurance and mortgage licensing and consumer protection laws and regulations\nand we may be subject to fines or penalties in the event of any non-compliance. If we, or our licensed personnel, apply for new\nlicenses, we may become subject to additional licensing requirements, which we may not be in compliance with at all times. If\nin the future a state agency were to determine that we, or our licensed personnel, are required to obtain additional licenses in\nthat state in order to operate our business, or if we or our licensed personnel lose or do not renew an existing license or are\notherwise found to be in violation of a law or regulation, we or our licensed personnel may be subject to fines or legal penalties,\nlawsuits, enforcement actions, void contracts, or our business operations in that state may be suspended or prohibited.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is complicated and costly and may inhibit our ability to innovate or grow.\nZillow Home Loans operates its Federal Housing Administration loan program under authority granted by HUD. In the\nevent that HUD determines that Zillow Home Loans has failed or refused to comply with all relevant terms and conditions\nnecessary to maintain its authority active and in good standing, then such authority could be suspended, revoked or materially\naltered, which would materially and adversely affect the ability of Zillow Home Loans to conduct its business.\nIf we are unable to comply with these laws or regulations in a cost-effective manner, we may modify impacted products\nand services, which could require a substantial investment and loss of revenue, or require that we cease providing the impacted\nproduct or service altogether. If we are found to have violated laws or regulations, we may be subject to significant fines,\npenalties, and other losses.\n31\nWe Are Subject to Stringent and Evolving Laws, Regulations, Rules, Contractual Obligations, Policies and Other\nObligations Related to Data Privacy and Security in the United States and Canada and May Be Subject to Similar Data\nPrivacy and Security Obligations in Other Jurisdictions Where We Have Operations and/or Vendors. Our Actual or\nPerceived Failure to Comply With Such Obligations Could Lead to Regulatory Investigations or Actions; Litigation\n(Including Class Claims) and Mass Arbitration Demands; Fines and Penalties; Disruptions of Our Business Operations;\nReputational Harm; Loss of Revenue or Profits; Loss of Customers and Other Adverse Business Consequences.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we collect, receive, store, process, generate, use, transfer, disclose, make accessible,\nprotect, secure, dispose of, transmit, and share (collectively, processing) personal data and other sensitive data, which may\ninclude proprietary and confidential business data, trade secrets, intellectual property, sensitive third-party data, business plans,\ntransactions, social security numbers, financial account information, and credit card information.\nOur data processing activities subject us to numerous data privacy and security obligations, such as various laws,\nregulations, guidance, industry standards, external and internal privacy and security policies, contractual requirements, and\nother obligations relating to data privacy and security.\nIn the United States, federal, state, and local governments have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws,\nincluding data breach notification laws, personal data privacy laws, consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal\nTrade Commission Act), and other similar laws (e.g., wiretapping laws). For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of\n2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”), (collectively, “CCPA”) applies to personal\ninformation of consumers, business representatives, and employees who are California residents, and requires businesses to\nprovide specific disclosures in privacy notices and honor requests of California residents to exercise certain privacy rights, such\nas those noted below. The CCPA provides for civil penalties of up to $7,500 per violation and allows private litigants affected\nby certain data breaches to recover significant statutory damages. In addition, the CPRA expanded the CCPA’s requirements,\nincluding by adding a new right for individuals to correct their personal information and establishing a new regulatory agency\nto implement and enforce the law.\nOther states, such as Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut and Utah, have also passed comprehensive privacy laws, and\nsimilar laws are being considered in several other states, as well as at the federal and local levels. These state laws and the\nCCPA provide individuals with certain rights concerning their personal information, including the right to access, correct, or\ndelete certain personal information, and opt-out of certain data processing activities, such as targeted advertising, profiling, and\nautomated decision-making. The exercise of these rights may impact our business and ability to provide our products and\nservices. We also have operations outside of the United States, including in Canada, and Canada’s Personal Information\nProtection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”) imposes strict requirements for processing personal data and there are\nalso various provincial and territorial privacy laws that govern the protection of personal data. These developments may further\ncomplicate compliance efforts and may increase legal risk and compliance costs for us and the third parties upon whom we rely.\nAdditionally, laws, regulations, and standards covering marketing and advertising activities conducted by telephone,\nemail, mobile devices, and the internet, may be applicable to our business, such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the\nTelemarketing Sales Rule, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, and similar state\nconsumer protection laws, as well as requirements imposed by private parties such as telecommunications carriers. We also\nassist with the processing of customer credit card transactions and consumer credit report requests, originate mortgage loans,\nperform real estate closings and provide other product offerings, which results in us receiving or facilitating transmission of\npersonally identifiable information. Processing of this type of information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulation in\nthe United States, including under the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. These laws and regulations\nare generally intended to protect the privacy and security of personal information, including credit card information that is\ncollected, processed and transmitted. We could be adversely affected if government regulations require us to significantly\nchange our business practices with respect to this type of information or if the third parties that we engage with to provide\nprocessing and screening services violate applicable laws and regulations. Further, restrictions implemented on the platforms\nthrough which our websites and applications are accessed, such as mobile operating systems, may impede the effectiveness of\nour marketing efforts and ability to measure the effectiveness of those efforts, reducing our ability to market our products and\nservices and grow our customer base. A number of states have in place laws regulating the interception of electronic\n32\ncommunications; if a court were to conclude that our monitoring of user activity violates such laws, our ability to understand\nour customers, and therefore the effectiveness of our product offerings and marketing efforts, could be reduced.\nOur employees and personnel use generative AI technologies to perform their work, and the disclosure and use of\npersonal information in generative AI technologies is subject to various privacy laws and other privacy obligations.\nGovernments have passed and are likely to pass additional laws regulating generative AI. Our use of this technology could\nresult in additional compliance costs, regulatory investigations and actions, copyright infringement claims, and consumer\nlawsuits. If we are unable to use generative AI, it could make our business less efficient and result in competitive disadvantages.\nIn addition to data privacy and security laws, we may be contractually subject to industry standards adopted by industry\ngroups and may become subject to such obligations in the future. We may also be bound by other contractual obligations related\nto data privacy and security, and our efforts to comply with such obligations may not be successful. For example, we may be\nsubject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI DSS”) requirements. The PCI DSS requires companies to\nadopt certain measures to ensure the security of cardholder information, including using and maintaining firewalls, adopting\nproper password protections for certain devices and software, and restricting data access. Noncompliance with PCI-DSS can\nresult in penalties ranging from $5,000 to $100,000 per month by credit card companies, litigation, damage to our reputation,\nand revenue losses. We may also rely on vendors to process payment card data; those vendors may be subject to PCI DSS, and\nour business may be negatively affected if our vendors are fined or suffer other consequences as a result of PCI DSS\nnoncompliance.\nWe may publish privacy notices, marketing materials, and other statements, such as compliance with certain certifications\nor self-regulatory principles, regarding data privacy and security. If these policies, materials or statements are found to be\ndeficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our practices, we may be subject to investigation,\nenforcement actions by regulators, or other adverse consequences.\nObligations related to data privacy and security (and consumers’ data privacy expectations) are quickly changing,\nbecoming increasingly stringent, and creating uncertainty. Additionally, these obligations may be subject to differing\napplications and interpretations, which may be inconsistent or conflict among jurisdictions. Preparing for and complying with\nthese obligations requires us to devote significant resources and may necessitate changes to our services, information\ntechnologies, systems, and practices and to those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf.\nWe may at times fail (or be perceived to have failed) in our efforts to comply with our data privacy and security\nobligations. Moreover, despite our efforts, our personnel or third parties on whom we rely may fail to comply with such\nobligations, which could negatively impact our business operations. If we or the third parties on which we rely fail, or are\nperceived to have failed, to address or comply with applicable data privacy and security obligations, we could face significant\nconsequences, including but not limited to: government enforcement actions (e.g., investigations, fines, penalties, audits,\ninspections, and similar); litigation (including class-action claims) and mass arbitration demands; additional reporting\nrequirements and/or oversight; bans on processing personal data; and orders to destroy or not use personal data. In particular,\nplaintiffs have become increasingly more active in bringing privacy-related claims against companies, including class claims\nand mass arbitration demands. Some of these claims allow for the recovery of statutory damages on a per violation basis, and, if\nviable, carry the potential for monumental statutory damages, depending on the volume of data and the number of violations.\nAny of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, or financial condition, including but not\nlimited to: loss of customers; inability to process personal data or to operate in certain jurisdictions; limited ability to develop or\ncommercialize our products and services; expenditure of time and resources to defend any claim or inquiry; adverse publicity;\nor substantial changes to our business model or operations.\nWe are From Time to Time Involved In, or May in the Future be Subject to, Claims, Suits, Government Investigations, and\nOther Proceedings That May Result in Adverse Outcomes.\nWe are from time to time involved in, or may in the future be subject to, claims, suits, government investigations,\nenforcement actions and proceedings arising from our business, including actions with respect to intellectual property, privacy,\nconsumer protection, information security, mortgage brokering, mortgage origination, real estate, real estate brokerage,\nenvironmental, data protection, antitrust, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (RESPA), fair housing or fair\n33\nlending, compliance with securities laws, or law enforcement matters, tax matters, labor and employment, and commercial\nclaims, as well as actions involving content generated by our customers, shareholder derivative actions, purported class action\nlawsuits, and other matters, including those matters described in Part II, Item 8 in Note 16 under the subsection titled “Legal\nProceedings” in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Such claims, suits,\ngovernment investigations, and proceedings are inherently uncertain, and their results cannot be predicted with certainty.\nRegardless of the outcome, any such legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of\nmanagement and other personnel, and other factors. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings\ncould result in reputational harm, liability, fines, penalties, or sanctions, as well as judgments, consent decrees, or orders\npreventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, or requiring a change in our business\npractices, products or technologies, which could in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and\nfinancial condition.\nIn some instances, third parties may have an obligation to indemnify us for liabilities related to litigation or governmental\ninvestigations, and they may be unable to, or fail to, fulfill such obligations. If such third parties failed to indemnify us, we may\nbe financially responsible, which could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position(cid:3)\nWe Incurred Significant Operating Losses in the Past and We May Not Be Able to Generate Sufficient Revenue to Be\nProfitable Over the Long Term.\nWe have incurred significant net operating losses in the past and, as of December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated\ndeficit of $1.8 billion. It is possible that our growth rate may decline in the future as the result of a variety of factors, including\nthe maturation of our business or if we are unable to successfully execute on our growth strategy. At the same time, we also\nexpect certain of our costs to increase in future periods as we continue to expend substantial financial resources to develop and\nexpand our business, which may include:\n• expansion of Zillow Home Loans;\n• product and services development;\n• sales and marketing;\n• technology infrastructure;\n• strategic opportunities, including commercial relationships and acquisitions; and\n• general and administrative expenses, including legal and accounting expenses related to being a public company.\nThese investments may not result in increased revenue or growth in our business. If we fail to continue to grow our\nrevenue and overall business and to manage our expenses, we may incur significant losses in the future and not be able to\nachieve or maintain profitability.\nA failure by Zillow Home Loans to operate at a profit could also place its Federal Housing Administration Title II lender\nauthorization in jeopardy, adversely impact our relationship with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, limit our ability to sell loans to\nthird party financial institutions and may adversely impact our ability to utilize our loan repurchase facilities and warehouse\nlines of credit. Any such adverse impacts could threaten Zillow Home Loans’ ability to continue operations.\nServicing Our Debt Requires a Significant Amount of Cash, and We May Not Have Sufficient Cash Flow From Our\nBusiness to Pay Our Substantial Debt, Settle Conversions of Our Convertible Senior Notes, or Repurchase Our Convertible\nSenior Notes Upon a Fundamental Change.\nWe utilize several forms of debt to provide capital for the continued growth and operation of our business, such as\ntranches of convertible senior notes and warehouse and repurchase facilities for Zillow Home Loans. Our indebtedness includes\n$608 million aggregate principal amount under our Convertible Senior Notes due in 2024 (the “2024 Notes”), $507 million\naggregate principal amount under our Convertible Senior Notes due in 2025 (the “2025 Notes”), $499 million aggregate\nprincipal amount under our Convertible Senior Notes due in 2026 (the “2026 Notes”), and mortgage credit facilities (aggregate\nmaximum borrowing capacity of $250 million as of December 31, 2023). Our ability to make payments on the principal of, to\n34\npay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance and, if applicable, the value of collateral,\nwhich is subject to economic, industry, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to\ngenerate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we\nare unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets,\nrestructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to extend or\nrefinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to\nengage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt\nobligations, including our convertible senior notes, credit facilities, or otherwise.\nHolders of our convertible senior notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of a\nfundamental change at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued\nand unpaid interest. Holders of our convertible senior notes may elect to convert their notes at various times and pursuant to\nspecific circumstances, as provided in the corresponding indenture. When such an election is made, we may opt to settle any\nsuch conversion by delivering solely shares of our Class C capital stock, solely cash payments, or a combination of Class C\ncapital stock and cash payments after consideration of various factors, including the price of our Class C capital stock, market\nfactors, liquidity, and the needs of our business. Upon conversion of our convertible senior notes, unless we elect to deliver\nsolely shares of our Class C capital stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional\nshares), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the notes being converted. We may not have enough available\ncash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of the notes surrendered therefore or at the\ntime the notes are being converted. Our failure to repurchase our convertible senior notes at a time when the repurchase is\nrequired by the indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the notes would constitute an event of default. If\nthe repayment of any indebtedness were to be accelerated because of such event of default (whether under the notes or\notherwise), we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the notes or make cash payments upon\nconversions thereof. An event of default under the indenture may lead to an acceleration of our convertible senior notes. Any\nsuch acceleration could result in our bankruptcy. In a bankruptcy, the holders of our convertible senior notes would have a claim\nto our assets that is senior to the claims of our equity holders.\nIn addition, our significant indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments,\ncould have other important consequences. For example, it could:\n• make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general United States and worldwide economic, industry and\ncompetitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation;\n• limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\n• place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt; and\n• limit our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including to\nfund possible acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, products, services and technologies.\nAny of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In\naddition, if we incur additional indebtedness, the risks related to our business and our ability to service or repay our\nindebtedness would increase.\nThe Credit and Debt Facilities that Provide Capital for Zillow Home Loans Include Covenants and Other Provisions that\nMay Restrict Our Operating Activities, and Have a Material Effect on Our Liquidity. They Also Incorporate Variable\nInterest Rates that May Subject Us to Interest Rate Risk, Which Could Cause Our Debt Service Obligations to Increase\nSignificantly.\nZillow Home Loans has entered into warehouse financing agreements, including repurchase agreements, to provide\ncapital for the growth and operation of our mortgage origination businesses. The terms of these warehouse financing\nagreements and related financing documents require Zillow Home Loans to comply with a number of customary financial and\nother covenants, such as maintaining certain levels of liquidity, tangible net worth, leverage ratios, net income and adequate\ninsurance coverage. These covenants may limit our operational flexibility and may restrict our ability to engage in transactions\nthat we believe would otherwise be in the best interests of our shareholders. Additionally, undrawn amounts are generally not\ncommitted, meaning the applicable lender may not be obligated to advance loan funds in excess of outstanding borrowings.\n35\nRefer to Note 11 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nadditional information on our Zillow Home Loans warehouse financing facilities. Upon the occurrence of any event of default\nunder these warehouse financing agreements, the lenders could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with\naccrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable, even in the absence of a payment default. A default\nunder one of our warehouse financing agreements could result in a cross-default under other warehouse financing agreements\nand our lenders could elect to declare outstanding amounts due and payable or terminate their commitments. If we fail to repay\nthe amounts due under our warehouse financing agreements, the lenders of such warehouse financing agreements may proceed\nagainst the collateral granted to secure the credit facilities. The majority of loans originated by Zillow Home Loans are pledged\nas collateral to secure such indebtedness. As a result, a default under applicable debt covenants could have an adverse effect on\nour financial condition or results of operations.\nCertain of our debt agreements are subject to margin calls based on the lender’s opinion of the value of the collateral\nsecuring such financing. A margin call would require the borrower to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings. A large,\nunanticipated margin call could have a material effect on our liquidity.\nAt December 31, 2023, $93 million of our borrowings under our warehouse financing agreements was at variable rates of\ninterest, thereby exposing us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate\nindebtedness would increase even if the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net loss would increase.\nWe May Need to Raise Additional Capital to Grow Our Business and We May Not Be Able to Raise Additional Capital on\nTerms Acceptable to Us, or At All.\nGrowing and operating our business, including through the development of new and enhanced products and services, may\nrequire significant cash outlays, liquidity reserves and capital expenditures. If cash on hand, cash generated from operations and\ncash equivalents and investment balances are not sufficient to meet our cash and liquidity needs or fund future growth and\ndevelopment, we may need to seek additional capital and we may not be able to raise the necessary cash on terms acceptable to\nus, or at all. Refer to Note 11 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information on our warehouse and loan repurchase facilities. In addition, in February 2021, we\nentered into an Equity Distribution Agreement pursuant to which we may offer and sell from time to time, through certain\nfinancial institutions, shares of our Class C capital stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $1 billion, and in July\n2023, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of our Class A common stock, Class C capital\nstock, outstanding convertible senior notes or a combination thereof to bring our total authorized repurchases to $2.5 billion as\nof December 31, 2023. We may decide to raise additional capital or repurchase outstanding stock or debt through these\narrangements at levels or under terms that prove to be unfavorable or at times and share prices that prove to be disadvantageous\nbased on changes in market conditions. Such decisions may negatively impact our financial position and/or future ability to\nraise capital. Financing arrangements we maintain, pursue or assume may require us to grant certain rights, take certain actions,\nor agree to certain restrictions, that could negatively impact our business. If additional capital is not available to us on terms\nacceptable to us or at all, we may need to modify our business plans, which would harm our ability to grow our operations.\nWe Rely on Assumptions, Estimates, and Business Data to Calculate our Key Performance Indicators and Other Business\nMetrics, and Real or Perceived Inaccuracies in These Metrics May Harm our Reputation and Negatively Affect our\nBusiness.\nCertain of our performance metrics are calculated using third party applications or internal company data that have not\nbeen independently verified. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable calculations for the applicable\nperiod of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring such information. For example, our measurement of visits\nand unique users may be affected by applications that automatically contact our servers to access our mobile applications and\nwebsites with no user action involved, and this activity can cause our system to count the user associated with such a device as\na unique user or as a visit on the day such contact occurs. In addition, our measurement of customer transactions may be\naffected by the availability and quality of public records and other data used to estimate the number of customer transactions\nattributable to our products and services.\n36\nWe regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our performance metrics to improve accuracy. Our\nmeasure of certain metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly-titled metrics of our\ncompetitors due to differences in methodology. If real estate professionals, our real estate partners or investors do not perceive\nour visits, unique users, or customer transactions to be an accurate representation of our user engagement and conversion to\ntransactions, or if we discover material inaccuracies in our visits, unique users, or customer transactions, our reputation may be\nharmed, and real estate professionals and advertisers may be less willing to allocate their resources to our products and services,\nwhich could negatively affect our business and operating results.\nWe Expect Our Results of Operations to Fluctuate on a Quarterly and Annual Basis.\nOur revenue and results of operations could vary significantly from period to period and may fail to match expectations\nas a result of a variety of factors, some of which are outside our control. The other risk factors discussed in this “Risk Factors”\nsection may contribute to the variability of our quarterly and annual results. In addition, our results may fluctuate as a result of\nseasonal variances of home sales, which historically peak in the spring and summer seasons, fluctuations in the quantity of\nhomes available, our remnant advertising, and the size and seasonal variability of our real estate partners’ marketing budgets.\nThe seasonal variance and cyclical nature of home sales may contribute to the variability of our revenue and results of\noperations for our Mortgages business, in particular, which seasonality may be masked by business growth. As a result of the\npotential variations in our revenue and results of operations, period-to-period comparisons may not be meaningful and the\nresults of any one period should not be relied on as an indication of future performance. In addition, our results of operations\nmay not meet the expectations of investors or public market analysts who follow us, which may adversely affect our stock\nprice.\nWe Could Be Subject to Additional Tax Liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States (federal and state) and certain foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws,\nregulations, and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice,\ndue to economic, political, and other conditions. New tax laws, regulations and administrative practices could be enacted or\nadopted at any time, and existing tax laws, regulations and administrative practices could be interpreted, modified or applied\nadversely to us, possibly with retroactive effect. These changes could require us to pay additional taxes, penalties, interest and\nother related costs, and also could increase our compliance, operating and other costs.\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating the taxes imposed under such tax laws. Our effective tax\nrates could be affected by numerous factors, such as entry into new businesses and geographies, changes to our existing\nbusiness and operations, acquisitions and investments and how they are financed, changes in our stock price, changes in our\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, and changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations,\nadministrative practices, principles, and interpretations. We are required to take positions regarding the interpretation of\ncomplex statutory and regulatory tax rules and on valuation matters that are subject to uncertainty, and the Internal Revenue\nService or other tax authorities may challenge the positions we take.\nOur Ability to Use Our Net Operating Loss Carryforwards and Certain Other Tax Attributes May Be Limited.\nWe have incurred losses during our history. To the extent that we continue to generate losses, unused losses will carry\nforward to offset future taxable income, if any, until such unused losses expire, if at all. Under the Tax Act, as modified by the\nCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, United States federal net operating loss carryforwards generated in\ntaxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such net\noperating loss carryforwards in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020 is limited to 80% of taxable income.\nIn addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), if a corporation\nundergoes an “ownership change”, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-\nchange tax attributes, such as research and development credits, to offset its post-change taxable income or income tax liability\nmay be limited. An “ownership change” occurs for these purposes if one or more shareholders (including certain groups of\nshareholders) that each owns at least 5% of the corporation’s stock by value increase their aggregate ownership by more than 50\npercentage points over their lowest ownership percentages within a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under\n37\nstate tax laws. We have undergone ownership changes in the past, and we may experience ownership changes in the future\nbecause of shifts in our stock ownership, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, if we achieve profitability, our\nability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset future United States federal taxable income\nor income tax liabilities may be, or may become, subject to limitations, which could result in increased future tax liability to us.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common and Capital Stock and Debt Instruments\nOur Class A Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock Prices May Be Volatile, and the Value of an Investment in Our Class\nA Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock May Decline.\nAn active, liquid and orderly market for our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock may not be sustained,\nwhich could depress the trading price of our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock. The trading price of our Class A\ncommon stock and Class C capital stock has at times experienced price volatility and may continue to be volatile. For example,\nduring the last three fiscal years ending December 31, 2023, the closing price of our Class A common stock has ranged from\n$27.02 per share to $203.79 per share. During the same time period, the closing price of our Class C capital stock has ranged\nfrom $26.97 per share to $199.90 per share. The market price of our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock could be\nsubject to wide fluctuations in response to many of the risk factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and others\nbeyond our control, including:\n• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and results of operations;\n• changes in projected operational and financial results;\n• addition or loss of significant customers;\n• actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to that of our competitors;\n• announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital-\nraising activities or commitments;\n• announcements of technological innovations or new offerings by us or our competitors;\n• additions or departures of key personnel;\n• changes in laws or regulations applicable to our services;\n• fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n• the inclusion, exclusion, or deletion of our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock from any trading indices,\nsuch as the S&P 500 Index;\n• issuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\n• sales of our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock by us or our shareholders;\n• repurchases of our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock by us or our shareholders;\n• issuances of our Class C capital stock upon conversion of our 2024 Notes, 2025 Notes or 2026 Notes;\n• stock price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares; and\n• general economic and market conditions.\nFurthermore, the stock markets in recent years have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected\nand continue to affect the market prices of the equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been\nunrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations,\nas well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, changes to federal monetary policy, interest\nrates or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our Class A common stock and Class C\ncapital stock. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to\nsecurities class action litigation. We have in the past been and are currently the target of this type of litigation, and we may\ncontinue to be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Past, current, and future securities litigation against us could\nresult in substantial costs and divert management’s attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business,\nresults of operations or financial condition.\n38\nThe Structure of Our Capital Stock as Contained in Our Charter Documents Has the Effect of Concentrating Voting\nControl With Our Founders, and Limits Your Ability to Influence Corporate Matters.\nSince Zillow Group’s inception, our capital structure has included authorized Class A common stock and authorized Class\nB common stock. Our Class A common stock entitles its holder to one vote per share, and our Class B common stock entitles its\nholder to 10 votes per share. All shares of Class B common stock have been and are held or controlled by our founders, Richard\nBarton and Lloyd Frink. As of December 31, 2023, Mr. Barton’s holdings and Mr. Frink’s holdings represented approximately\n32.2% and 20.9%, respectively, of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock.\nFor the foreseeable future, Mr. Barton and Mr. Frink will therefore have significant control over our management and\naffairs and will be able to control most matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election or removal (with or\nwithout cause) of directors and the approval of any significant corporate transaction, such as a merger or other sale of us or our\nassets. In addition, because our Class C capital stock carries no voting rights (except as required by applicable law or as\nexpressly provided in our amended and restated articles of incorporation), the issuance of Class C capital stock (instead of Class\nA common stock) could prolong the duration of Mr. Barton’s and Mr. Frink’s relative ownership of our voting power. This\nconcentrated control could delay, defer or prevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business\ncombination involving us that you, as a shareholder, may otherwise support. This concentrated control could also discourage a\npotential investor from acquiring our Class A common stock or Class C capital stock due to the limited voting power of such\nstock relative to the Class B common stock and might harm the market price of our Class A common stock and Class C capital\nstock.\nFuture Sales of Our Stock in the Public Market Could Cause Our Stock Price to Decline.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares or the availability of shares for sale will have on the\nprevailing trading price of our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock from time to time. There is currently no\ncontractual restriction on our ability to issue additional shares, and all of our outstanding shares are generally freely tradable,\nexcept for shares held by our “affiliates” as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which may be\nsold in compliance with the volume restrictions of Rule 144. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common\nstock and Class C capital stock could cause our stock price to decline. In addition, we may in the future issue shares of Class C\ncapital stock for financings, acquisitions, equity incentives, including under our Equity Distribution Agreement or to settle our\noutstanding convertible notes. If we issue shares of Class C capital stock in the future, such issuances would have a dilutive\neffect on the economic interest of our Class A common stock.\nWe Cannot Guarantee that Our Securities Repurchase Program Will Enhance Shareholder Value, and Repurchases Could\nAffect the Price of Our Class A Common Stock, Class C Capital Stock and Convertible Senior Notes.\nPrior to July 31, 2023, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.8 billion of our Class A common\nstock, Class C capital stock, outstanding convertible senior notes or a combination thereof. On July 31, 2023, our board\nauthorized an additional $750 million in such repurchases, increasing the authorization under the repurchase program to\n$2.5 billion. As of December 31, 2023, $770 million remained available under the securities repurchase program (collectively,\nthe “Repurchase Authorizations”).\nThere is no expiration date for the Repurchase Authorizations. The timing and actual number of shares or notes\nrepurchased, if any, depend on a variety of factors including the timing of open trading windows, price, corporate and\nregulatory requirements, and other market conditions. The program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior\nnotice. Repurchases pursuant to the Repurchase Authorizations could affect the price of our Class A common stock, Class C\ncapital stock and outstanding convertible notes and increase volatility in such securities.\n39\nIf Securities or Industry Analysts or Other Third Parties Do Not Publish Research or Publish Inaccurate or Unfavorable\nResearch About Our Business, Our Class A Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock Price and Trading Volume Could\nDecline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock depends in part on the research and reports\nthat securities or industry analysts or other third parties publish about our company. If few or no securities or industry analysts\nor other third parties cover our company, the market price of our publicly-traded stock could be negatively impacted. If\nsecurities or industry analysts or other third parties cover us and if one or more of such analysts downgrade our stock or publish\ninaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of the analysts\ncovering us fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decline, which could cause our stock price and\ntrading volume to decline.\nIf We Issue Additional Equity Securities or Convertible Debt to Raise Capital or Elect to Settle Conversions of Our\nConvertible Senior Notes in Stock, It May Have a Dilutive Effect on Shareholders’ Investment.\nIf we raise additional capital through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities or elect to settle\nconversions of our convertible senior notes in shares of our Class C capital stock, our existing shareholders could suffer\nsignificant dilution in their percentage ownership of us. Moreover, any new equity securities we issue could have rights,\npreferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock.\nThe Capped Call Transactions May Affect the Value of Our 2024 Notes, 2026 Notes and Our Class C Capital Stock.\nIn connection with the pricing of each of the 2024 Notes and 2026 Notes, we entered into capped call transactions with\ncertain financial institutions (the “option counterparties”). The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce\npotential dilution in connection with the conversion of the 2024 Notes or 2026 Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are\nrequired to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be. In connection with our Convertible\nSenior Notes due in 2023 (“2023 Notes”), the balance of which we redeemed in mid-2021, we exercised our right to keep the\nassociated capped call confirmations open through the expiration of the 2023 Notes, which caused short term dilution. We may\npursue similar options with the capped call confirmations associated with each of the 2024 Notes and 2026 Notes in the future.\nThe option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding\nvarious derivative transactions with respect to our Class C capital stock and/or purchasing or selling our Class C capital stock or\nother securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of each of the 2024 Notes and 2026 Notes (and\nare likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of 2024 Notes or 2026 Notes or in connection with any\nrepurchase or redemption of 2024 Notes or 2026 Notes by us). This activity could cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in\nthe market price of our Class C capital stock, the 2024 Notes or the 2026 Notes.\nAnti-Takeover Provisions in Our Charter Documents and Under Washington Law Could Make an Acquisition of Us More\nDifficult, Limit Attempts by Shareholders to Replace or Remove Our Management and Affect the Market Price of Our Stock.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws, as amended and restated, may have the effect of delaying or\npreventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated articles of incorporation or amended\nand restated bylaws include provisions, some of which will become effective only after the date, which we refer to as the\nthreshold date, on which the Class B common stock controlled by our founders represents less than 7% of the aggregate number\nof shares of our outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock, that:\n• set forth the structure of our capital stock, which concentrates voting control of matters submitted to a vote of our\nshareholders with the holders of our Class B common stock, which is held or controlled by our founders;\n• authorize our board of directors to issue, without further action by our shareholders, up to 30,000,000 shares of\nundesignated preferred stock, subject, prior to the threshold date, to the approval rights of the holders of our Class B\ncommon stock;\n• establish that our board of directors will be divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III, with each class\nserving three-year staggered terms;\n40\n• prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n• provide that, after the threshold date, our directors may be removed only for cause;\n• provide that, after the threshold date, vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by the affirmative vote of\na majority of directors then in office or by the sole remaining director;\n• provide that only our board of directors may change the board’s size;\n• specify that special meetings of our shareholders can be called only by the chair of our board of directors, our board of\ndirectors, our chief executive officer, our president or, prior to the threshold date, holders of at least 25% of all the\nvotes entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be considered at any such special meeting;\n• establish an advance notice procedure for shareholder proposals to be brought before a meeting of shareholders,\nincluding proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\n• require the approval of our board of directors or the holders of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast by\nshareholders generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single group, to amend or repeal our bylaws;\nand\n• require the approval of not less than two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on a proposed amendment, voting\ntogether as a single group, to amend certain provisions of our articles of incorporation.\nPrior to the threshold date, our directors can be removed with or without cause by holders of our Class A common stock\nand Class B common stock, voting together as a single group, and vacancies on the board of directors may be filled by such\nshareholders, voting together as a single group. Given the structure of our capital stock, our founders, Richard Barton and Lloyd\nFrink, who hold or control our Class B common stock, will have the ability for the foreseeable future to control these\nshareholder actions. See the risk factor above titled “The Structure of Our Capital Stock as Contained in Our Charter\nDocuments Has the Effect of Concentrating Voting Control With our Founders, and Limits Your Ability to Influence Corporate\nMatters.”\nThe provisions described above, after the threshold date, may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our shareholders to\nreplace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for shareholders to replace members of our board of\ndirectors, which board is responsible for appointing our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in the State of\nWashington, we are governed by the provisions of Chapter 23B.19 of the Washington Business Corporation Act, which\nprohibits certain business combinations between us and certain significant shareholders unless specified conditions are met.\nThese provisions may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company, even if this change of\ncontrol would benefit our shareholders.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNot applicable.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity.\nCyber-attacks, malicious internet-based activity, online and offline fraud, administrative or technical failures and other\ncybersecurity threats present risks to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information systems, including those of\nthe third parties upon which we rely, and our data residing in those systems. We take seriously our responsibility to protect\nsensitive consumer, customer and employee information.\nGiven the data-driven nature of our business and the prevalent use of technology in operating our business, we face\ncybersecurity risks that could materially affect our business strategy, results of operations and financial condition. For further\ndetails on the exposures related to these risks, see the section titled “Risk Factors” within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisk Management, Strategy and Management Oversight\nWe have an enterprise risk management function at Zillow Group responsible for the oversight and assessment of\nongoing and emerging risks to our business operations and the integrity of our data, including the impact of cybersecurity risks.\nOur enterprise risk management team maintains a steering committee that oversees and opines on our processes to identify,\nprioritize and assess key risks, including risks related to cybersecurity. The steering committee is composed of senior, cross-\n41\nfunctional business leaders with visibility into our key risks. Such members have expertise in the areas of risk management,\nbusiness strategy, information technology, cybersecurity, legal and compliance, finance, communications, and business\nproducts, among others. In partnership with risk owners, this steering committee monitors risk exposures and verifies that\nefficient and effective risk-management strategies or acceptance and notification criteria are in place. The steering committee\nmeets at least quarterly and its activities are overseen by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors (“Board”).\nWe also maintain an information security function that oversees the protection of our information assets through a\nprogram informed by standards promoted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology cybersecurity framework and\nthe Cyber Risk Institute’s Cyber Profile. These frameworks guide our information security function in designing programs to\nassess cybersecurity risks and prevent cybersecurity incidents. The information security team is led by our Chief Information\nSecurity Officer (“CISO”) who is responsible for leading enterprise-wide cybersecurity strategy, including assessing and\nmanaging risks from cybersecurity threats, and implementing technical security controls by maintaining policies, standards and\nprocesses. With more than 20 years of experience in the field of cybersecurity, our CISO has had extensive involvement with\nthe information security function and the maintenance of a robust cybersecurity program. Our CISO has held data privacy and\ninformation security roles with increasing responsibility in the financial services, technology and casino industries and is a\ncertified information systems security professional.\nThe information security team maintains incident response policies and procedures designed to help protect the integrity,\navailability and confidentiality of information and help prevent loss of service. Cybersecurity events and incidents may be\nreported or detected through a variety of means, including emails to centralized information security addresses, our online\ninformation technology ticketing system, automatic alerts and incident detection systems, direct discovery by our information\nsecurity team, or reports from a third party. Additionally, our incident response policies and procedures specify the process for\ninitial investigation and containment procedures, remediation tactics, retention of documentation and internal and external\ncommunications. Our incident response policies and procedures also specify processes for analyzing the severity of an\nidentified incident, which serve to dictate the escalation procedures to notify varying levels of our risk management team. In\nresponse to cybersecurity incidents, we may involve external advisors to assist with remediation efforts and communications\nand we may seek to mitigate associated liabilities through our insurance coverage. Such third parties may include external legal\ncounsel, forensic investigators and public relation firms, among others. These vendors serve to support our existing processes\nand procedures and operate as an extension of our enterprise risk management and information security functions.\nOur internal audit team conducts security controls testing and provides independent validation that such controls are\noperating effectively on systems in scope for various regulatory and compliance requirements. Our regulatory compliance team\nuses third-party external auditors to perform independent testing against all systems in scope for our regulatory and customer-\ndriven compliance obligations. The audit cadence aligns with regulatory and customer-driven needs. The scope of our audits\nincludes all systems that store, transmit or process data. We also perform periodic third-party risk assessments, vulnerability\ntesting, system and cloud security assessments against our information technology systems.\nWe engage a variety of third-party service providers to process and store data, including certain customer information,\nsome of which may include personally identifiable information. We also depend on third-party service providers to host many\nof the systems and infrastructure used to provide our products and services. A limited number of third-party services support\nessential functions of our business, including the use of cloud-based technology. We have a third-party service provider\nmanagement program to manage cybersecurity risks associated with our use of these third-party service providers. The program\nincludes the use of security questionnaires, review of statements of work and related information security addenda, procuring\nresults of audits and compliance reviews and obtaining overviews of network infrastructure, among others. Based upon the\nextent and type of services utilized, reviews of certain third-party engagements are coordinated through members of the\nfollowing management teams: procurement, legal, compliance, enterprise risk management and information security risk\nmanagement, among others, as applicable. Depending on the nature of the services provided, the sensitivity of the data at issue\nand the identity of the third-party, our third-party service provider management process may involve different levels of\nassessment designed to help identify cybersecurity risks associated with a provider and impose contractual obligations related\nto cybersecurity on the provider.\n42\nGovernance\nOur Board considers risk assessment and development of risk mitigation strategies to be a responsibility of the entire\nBoard in consultation with the appropriate Board committees. The Board regularly engages in risk oversight on a broad range\nof matters, including challenges associated with strategic acquisitions, cybersecurity, regulatory and other legal and compliance\nmatters. For more focused risk oversight, our Board committees are tasked with specific risk management roles.\nThe Audit Committee oversees major enterprise risks and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such\nexposure, including risks to our information technology infrastructure and security. Members of our legal, compliance,\nenterprise risk management and information security management teams provide information and updates on any significant\nissues related to these topics at the periodic Audit Committee meetings, which are typically held at least quarterly. The Audit\nCommittee is responsible for ensuring independent examination of management’s programs to identify, assess, respond to and\nmonitor risks, which include those performed by internal audit and third party consultants, among others.\nAudit Committee member education is provided throughout the year through presentations to and discussions with the\nAudit Committee led by members of management, third-party consultants, our independent registered public accounting firm\nand legal counsel, on topics including information security, among others. Members of our Audit Committee have expertise in\nthe technology industry as well as corporate risk management strategies.\nItem 2. Properties.\nWe have various operating leases for office space which are summarized as of December 31, 2023 in the table below. We\nbelieve our facilities are adequate for our current needs.\nApproximate Principal Lease\nLocation Purpose Square Feet(1) Expiration Dates\nSeattle, Washington(2) Corporate headquarters for Zillow Group 267,290 2032\nOverland Park, Kansas General office space 70,373 2024\nIrvine, California General office space 60,714 2027\nAtlanta, Georgia General office space 51,822 2025\nNew York, New York General office space 49,159 2030\nSan Francisco, California General office space 26,646 2032\n(1)Excludes square footage of subleased space.\n(2)During the year ended December 31, 2023, we amended our existing office space lease for our corporate headquarters in\nSeattle, Washington to provide the landlord the option to terminate a portion of our lease prior to the original lease termination\ndate. In December 2023, our landlord exercised their option to partially terminate our lease, effective June 30, 2024. We have\nceased use of all 151,275 square feet of terminated space, included in the table above, as of December 31, 2023.\nIn addition, we lease office space in several other locations, primarily in the United States. See Note 2 and Note 10 of\nPart II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about our lease commitments.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\nFor information regarding legal proceedings in which we are involved, see Note 16 under the subsection titled “Legal\nProceedings” in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nItem 4.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity\nSecurities.\nMarket Information and Holders\nOur Class A common stock has traded on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “ZG” since August 17,\n2015 and under the symbol “Z” from July 20, 2011 through August 14, 2015.\nOur Class B common stock is not listed and there is no established public trading market.\nOur Class C capital stock has traded on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “Z” since August 17, 2015.\nPrior to that time, there was no public market for our Class C capital stock.\nHolders of Record\nAs of February 7, 2024, there were 291, three, and 154 holders of record of our Class A common stock, our Class B\ncommon stock, and our Class C capital stock, respectively.\nDividends\nWe have never declared or paid a cash dividend on our common or capital stock and we intend to retain all available\nfunds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. We therefore do not anticipate paying any\ncash dividends on our common or capital stock in the foreseeable future. Any future determinations to pay dividends on our\ncommon or capital stock would depend on our results of operations, our financial condition and liquidity requirements,\nrestrictions that may be imposed by applicable law or our contracts and any other factors that our board of directors may\nconsider relevant.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities and Use of Proceeds from Registered Securities\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nThere were no sales of unregistered securities during the three months ended December 31, 2023.\nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer\nThe following table summarizes our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock repurchases during the three\nmonths ended December 31, 2023 (in millions, except share data which are presented in thousands, and per share amounts):\n44\nTotal Number Approximate\nof Shares Dollar Value of\nPurchased as Shares That\nTotal Number of Shares Part of May Yet Be\nPurchased Average Price Paid Per Share Publicly Purchased\nAnnounced Under the\nClass A Class C capital Class A Class C capital Plans or Plans or\nPeriod common stock stock common stock stock Programs (1) Programs (1)\nOctober 1 -\nOctober 31,\n2023 365 1,574 $ 37.59 $ 37.96 1,939 $ 840\nNovember 1 -\nNovember 30,\n2023 72 326 35.60 36.23 398 770\nDecember 1 -\nDecember 31,\n2023 — — — — — 770\nTotal 437 1,900 2,337\n(1)On December 2, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program granting the authority to repurchase\nup to $750 million of our Class A common stock, Class C capital stock or a combination thereof. On May 4, 2022, the Board\nof Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $1 billion of our Class A common stock, Class C capital stock or\na combination thereof. On November 1, 2022, the Board of Directors further expanded these authorizations to allow for the\nrepurchase of a portion of our outstanding convertible senior notes. On July 31, 2023, the Board authorized the repurchase of\nup to an additional $750 million of Class A common stock, Class C capital stock, outstanding convertible senior notes or a\ncombination thereof (together with the previous authorizations, “Repurchase Authorizations”). The Repurchase Authorizations\ndo not have an expiration date. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased $58 million aggregate\nprincipal amount of convertible senior notes for $56 million in cash, plus accrued interest, which reduced the remaining dollar\nvalue available under the Repurchase Authorizations.\nPerformance Graph\nThe following graph compares our cumulative total shareholder return on Zillow Group’s common and capital stock with\nthe Nasdaq Composite Index and the RDG Internet Composite Index.\nThe information contained in the graph is based on historical data and is not intended to forecast possible future\nperformance.\n45\nCOMPARISON OF 5 YEAR CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURN*\nAmong Zillow Group, Inc., the NASDAQ Composite Index\nand the RDG Internet Composite Index\n$500\n$450\n$400\n$350\n$300\n$250\n$200\n$150\n$100\n$50\n$0\n12/18 12/19 12/20 12/21 12/22 12/23\nZillow Group, Inc.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our\naudited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The\nfollowing discussion focuses on 2023 and 2022 financial condition and results of operations and year-to-year comparisons\nbetween 2023 and 2022. Similar discussion of our 2021 financial condition and results and year-to-year comparisons between\n2022 and 2021 can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in\nPart II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nIn addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect\nour plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results may differ materially from those described in or implied by any forward-\nlooking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in the sections titled “Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements” and “Risk\nFactors”.\nOverview of our Business\nZillow Group is reimagining real estate to make home a reality for more and more people. As the most visited real estate\nwebsite in the United States, Zillow and its affiliates help people find and get the home they want by connecting them with\ndigital solutions, dedicated partners and agents, and easier buying, selling, financing and renting experiences. (cid:3)\nOur portfolio of affiliates, subsidiaries and brands includes Zillow Premier Agent, Zillow Home Loans, our mortgage\noriginations business and affiliate lender, Zillow Rentals, Trulia, StreetEasy, HotPads and Out East. In addition, Zillow Group\nprovides a comprehensive suite of marketing software and technology solutions for the real estate industry, including\nShowingTime+, Spruce and Follow Up Boss.\nHealth of Housing Market\nOur financial performance is impacted by changes in the health of the housing market, which is impacted, in turn, by\ngeneral economic conditions. Current market factors have been driven by low housing inventory, fewer new for-sale listings,\nincreases and volatility in mortgage interest rates, as well as home price fluctuations and inflationary conditions. These factors\nmay have a negative impact on the number of transactions consumers complete using our products and services and on demand\nfor our advertising services. According to industry data from the National Association of REALTORS®, total transaction value\ndeclined 17% during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. Despite the\nindustry headwinds and total transaction value declines, we continue to invest in our growth pillars. We believe this continued\ninvestment has resulted in year over year total revenue results, described below, for the year ended December 31, 2023 as\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2022, that exceeded industry performance for the same period. The extent to which\nmarket factors impact our results and financial position will depend on future developments, which are uncertain and difficult to\npredict.\nAcquisitions\nOn December 8, 2023, we acquired Enchant, LLC, d/b/a Follow Up Boss (“Follow Up Boss”), a customer relationship\nmanagement system for real estate professionals, for $399 million in cash, net of cash acquired, and contingent consideration of\nup to $100 million in cash payable over a three-year period upon achievement of certain performance metrics. On September\n11, 2023, we acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Spruce Holdings, Inc. and certain affiliated entities\n(collectively referred to as “Spruce”), a tech-enabled title and escrow platform, in exchange for total consideration of\n$19 million, net of cash acquired. On July 31, 2023, we acquired Aryeo, Inc. (“Aryeo”), a software company that serves real\nestate photographers, in exchange for total consideration of $35 million, net of cash acquired. For additional information on\nacquisitions, see Note 7 in our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\nDiscontinued Operations\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Zillow Group made the determination to wind\n47\ndown the operations of Zillow Offers, our iBuying business which purchased and sold homes directly in certain markets across\nthe United States. The wind down was completed in the third quarter of 2022 and resulted in approximately a 25% reduction of\nZillow Group’s workforce. The financial results of Zillow Offers have been presented in the accompanying consolidated\nfinancial statements as discontinued operations and, therefore, are excluded from the following discussion of the results of our\ncontinuing operations. Given the wind down of Zillow Offers and corresponding shift in our strategic plans, financial\nperformance for prior and current periods may not be indicative of future performance. For additional information regarding\ndiscontinued operations, see Note 3 in our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\nAugust 2022 Equity Award Actions\nOn August 3, 2022, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee of the Board, the Board approved\nadjustments to the exercise price of certain outstanding vested and unvested option awards for eligible employees. The exercise\nprice of eligible option awards was reduced to $38.78, which was the closing market price of our Class C capital stock on\nAugust 8, 2022. No other changes were made to the terms and conditions of the eligible option awards. In addition, the Board\napproved a supplemental grant of restricted stock units to eligible employees that was granted on August 8, 2022 and vests\nquarterly over a two-year period beginning in August 2022. The repricing of eligible option awards and the issuance of\nsupplemental restricted stock units (collectively the “August 2022 Equity Award Actions”) has and is expected to continue to\nresult in incremental share-based compensation expense over the remaining requisite service period, which is largely through\nthe third quarter of 2024. For additional information regarding the August 2022 Equity Award Actions, see Note 14 in our Notes\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChange in Reportable Segments\nBeginning in 2023, our chief executive officer, who acts as the chief operating decision maker, began to manage our\nbusiness, make operating decisions, and evaluate operating performance on the basis of the company as a whole, instead of on a\nsegment basis as he did prior to 2023. Accordingly, this change led to revisions in the nature and substance of information\nregularly provided to and used by the chief operating decision maker and served to align our reported results with our ongoing\ngrowth strategy and our intent to provide integrated customer solutions for all tasks and services related to facilitating real\nestate transactions. As a result, beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we began to report our financial results as a single\nreportable segment.\nRevenue Overview\nOur revenue is classified into four categories: Residential, Rentals, Mortgages and Other. Certain prior period amounts\nhave been revised to reflect these changes.\nResidential. Residential revenue includes revenue generated by our Premier Agent and new construction marketplaces, as\nwell as revenue from the sale of advertising and business technology solutions for real estate professionals through StreetEasy\nfor-sale product offerings, ShowingTime+, including Listing Showcase, and upon acquisition on December 8, 2023, Follow Up\nBoss.\nPremier Agent revenue is generated by the sale of advertising services, as well as marketing and technology products and\nservices, to help real estate agents and brokers grow and manage their businesses and brands. We offer these products and\nservices through our Premier Agent program. Premier Agent products, which include the delivery of validated customer\nconnections, or leads, are offered on a share of voice (“market-based pricing”) and pay for performance basis. For our market-\nbased pricing offering, connections are distributed to Premier Agent partners in proportion to their share of voice, or a Premier\nAgent partner’s share of total advertising purchased in a particular zip code. Connections are delivered when customer contact\ninformation is provided to Premier Agent partners. Connections are provided as part of our suite of advertising services for\nPremier Agent partners; we do not charge a separate fee for these customer leads.\nOur pay for performance pricing model is called “Flex” and is available in certain markets to select partners. With the\nFlex model, Premier Agent partners are provided with validated leads at no initial cost and pay a performance advertising fee\n48\nonly when a real estate transaction is closed with one of the leads, generally within two years.\nNew construction revenue primarily includes advertising services sold to home builders on a cost per residential\ncommunity or cost per impression basis. StreetEasy for-sale revenue includes advertising services sold to real estate\nprofessionals serving the New York City for sale market primarily on a cost per property or performance fee basis.\nRevenue generated through ShowingTime+ includes ShowingTime revenue, which is primarily generated by\nAppointment Center, a software-as-a-service and call center solution allowing real estate agents, brokerages and multiple listing\nservices to efficiently schedule real estate viewing appointments on behalf of their customers. Appointment Center services also\ninclude call center specialists who provide scheduling support to customers. Appointment Center revenue is primarily billed in\nadvance on a monthly basis. ShowingTime+ revenue also includes our dotloop real estate transaction management software-as-\na-service solution. Dotloop is a monthly subscription service allowing real estate partners to efficiently manage their\ntransactions.\nRentals. Rentals revenue includes advertising and a suite of tools sold to property managers, landlords and other rental\nprofessionals on a cost per lead, lease, listing or impression basis or for a fixed fee for certain advertising packages through\nboth the Zillow and StreetEasy brands. Rentals revenue also includes revenue generated from our rental applications product,\nthrough which potential renters can submit applications to multiple properties for a flat service fee.\nMortgages. Mortgages revenue primarily includes revenue generated through mortgage originations and the related sale\nof mortgages on the secondary market through Zillow Home Loans and from advertising sold to mortgage lenders and other\nmortgage professionals on a cost per lead basis, including our Custom Quote and Connect services.\nOther. Other revenue includes revenue generated primarily by display advertising. Display revenue consists of graphical\nmobile and web advertising sold on a cost per thousand impressions or cost per click basis to advertisers promoting their brands\non our mobile applications and websites.\nFor additional information regarding our revenue recognition policies, see Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFinancial Overview\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we generated revenue of $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively,\nrepresenting a year-over-year decrease of 1%. The decrease in total revenue was primarily attributable to the following:\n• Residential revenue decreased by $70 million, or 5%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year\nended December 31, 2022. The decrease in Residential revenue was primarily driven by a 5% decrease in the number\nof visits for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was\nprimarily due to macro housing market factors including low housing inventory, fewer new for-sale listings, increases\nand volatility in mortgage interest rates, as well as home price fluctuations.\n• Mortgages revenue decreased by $23 million to $96 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $119\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily driven by a $28 million decrease in revenue from Custom\nQuote and Connect advertising services due to a 32% decrease in leads generated from marketing products sold to\nmortgage professionals. This decrease in leads was primarily driven by a decrease in demand for mortgages\nattributable to the higher interest rate environment as compared to the prior year period, as well as a shift in strategic\npriority as we focus on organic growth of our mortgage origination business.\n• The decreases noted above were partially offset by an $83 million increase to Rentals revenue to $357 million for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023 compared to $274 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in\nRentals revenue was primarily due to a 21% increase in quarterly revenue per average monthly rentals unique visitor\nto $3.19 for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to $2.63 for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily\ndriven by lower occupancy rates and the corresponding increase in advertising spend from multifamily property\nmanagers as well as growth in multifamily property listings. The increase in Rentals revenue was also driven by\n49\ngrowth in average monthly rentals unique visitors which increased 8% to 28 million during the year ended December\n31, 2023 from 26 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily driven by the increase in active rental\nlistings.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we generated total gross profit of $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion,\nrespectively, representing a year-over-year decrease of 4%, due to the combined factors discussed above.\nKey Metrics\nManagement has identified visits, unique users and the volume of loans originated through Zillow Home Loans as\nrelevant to investors’ and others’ assessment of our financial condition and results of operations.\nVisits\nThe number of visits is an important metric because it is an indicator of consumers’ level of engagement with our mobile\napplications, websites and other services. We believe highly engaged consumers are more likely to use our products and\nservices, including Zillow Homes Loans, or be transaction-ready real estate market participants and therefore are more sought-\nafter by our Premier Agent partners.\nWe define a visit as a group of interactions by users with the Zillow, Trulia and StreetEasy mobile applications and\nwebsites. A single visit can contain multiple page views and actions, and a single user can open multiple visits across domains,\nweb browsers, desktop or mobile devices. Visits can occur on the same day, or over several days, weeks or months.\nZillow and StreetEasy measure visits with Google Analytics, and Trulia measures visits with Adobe Analytics. Visits to\nTrulia end after thirty minutes of user inactivity. Visits to Zillow and StreetEasy end either: (i) after thirty minutes of user\ninactivity or at midnight; or (ii) through a campaign change. A visit ends through a campaign change if a visitor arrives via one\ncampaign or source (for example, via a search engine or referring link on a third-party website), leaves the mobile application\nor website, and then returns via another campaign or source.\nThe following table presents the number of visits to our mobile applications and websites for the periods presented (in\nmillions, except percentages):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 to 2023\n2023 2022 % Change\nVisits 9,977 10,470 (5) %\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, visits to our mobile applications and websites decreased by 5% compared to\nthe year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily driven by macro housing market factors including low housing\ninventory, fewer new for-sale listings, increases and volatility in mortgage interest rates as well as home price fluctuations.\nUnique Users\nMeasuring unique users is important to us because much of our revenue depends in part on our ability to connect home\nbuyers and sellers, renters and individuals with or looking for a mortgage to real estate, rental and mortgage professionals,\nproducts and services. Growth in consumer traffic to our mobile applications and websites increases the number of impressions,\nclicks, connections, leads and other events we can monetize to generate revenue. For example, our revenue depends in part, on\nusers accessing our mobile applications and websites to engage in the sale, purchase, renting and financing of homes, including\nwith Zillow Home Loans, and a significant portion of our Residential revenue, Rentals revenue and Other revenue depend on\nadvertisements being served to users of our mobile applications and websites.\nWe count a unique user the first time an individual accesses one of our mobile applications using a mobile device during\na calendar month and the first time an individual accesses one of our websites using a web browser during a calendar month. If\nan individual accesses our mobile applications using different mobile devices within a given month, the first instance of access\nby each such mobile device is counted as a separate unique user. If an individual accesses more than one of our mobile\n50\napplications within a given month, the first access to each mobile application is counted as a separate unique user. If an\nindividual accesses our websites using different web browsers within a given month, the first access by each such web browser\nis counted as a separate unique user. If an individual accesses more than one of our websites in a single month, the first access\nto each website is counted as a separate unique user since unique users are tracked separately for each domain. Zillow,\nStreetEasy and HotPads measure unique users with Google Analytics, and Trulia measures unique users with Adobe Analytics.\nDue to third-party technological limitations, user software settings, or user behavior, Google Analytics may assign a\nunique cookie to different instances of access by the same individual to our mobile applications and websites. In such instances,\nGoogle Analytics would count different instances of access by the same individual as separate unique users. Accordingly,\nreliance on the number of unique users counted by Google Analytics may overstate the actual number of unique users who\naccess our mobile applications and websites during the period.\nThe following table presents our average monthly unique users for the periods presented (in millions, except\npercentages):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 to 2023\n2023 2022 % Change\nAverage monthly unique users 214 220 (3) %\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, average monthly unique users to our mobile applications and websites\ndecreased by 3% compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily driven by macro housing market\nfactors including low housing inventory, fewer new for-sale listings, increases and volatility in mortgage interest rates as well as\nhome price fluctuations.\nLoan Origination Volume\nLoan origination volume is an important metric as it is a measure of how successful we are at the origination of mortgage\nloan products through our mortgage origination business, Zillow Home Loans, which directly impacts our Mortgages revenue.\nLoan origination volume represents the total value of mortgage loan originations closed through Zillow Home Loans during the\nperiod.\nThe following table presents loan origination volume by purpose and in total for Zillow Home Loans for the periods\npresented (in millions, except percentages):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 to 2023\n2023 2022 % Change\nPurchase loan origination volume $ 1,534 $ 794 93 %\nRefinance loan origination volume 16 750 (98) %\nTotal loan origination volume $ 1,550 $ 1,544 — %\nPurchase loan origination volume increased during the year ended December 31, 2023 due to continued growth in Zillow\nHome Loans purchase loan originations. This increase was offset by a decrease in refinance loan origination volume which was\ndriven by higher interest rates which decreased demand for refinance mortgages.\nResults of Operations\nGiven continued uncertainty surrounding the health of the housing market, interest rate environment and inflationary\nconditions, financial performance for current and prior periods may not be indicative of future performance.\n51\nRevenue\n% of Total Revenue\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 to 2023 Year Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 $ Change % Change 2023 2022\n(in millions, except percentages)\nResidential $ 1,452 $ 1,522 $ (70) (5) % 75 % 78 %\nRentals 357 274 83 30 18 14\nMortgages 96 119 (23) (19) 5 6\nOther 40 43 (3) (7) 2 2\nTotal revenue $ 1,945 $ 1,958 $ (13) (1) % 100 % 100 %\nTotal revenue decreased $13 million, or 1%, to $1.9 billion:\n• Residential revenue decreased $70 million, or 5%. This decrease was driven by a 5% decrease in the number of\nvisits for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was\nprimarily due to macro housing market factors including low housing inventory, fewer new for-sale listings,\nincreases and volatility in mortgage interest rates as well as home price fluctuations. These factors also resulted in a\n6% decrease in Premier Agent revenue during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. We expect Residential revenue to increase in absolute dollars during the three months ending\nMarch 31, 2024, primarily due to the stabilization of macro housing market factors described above as well as\nincremental revenue attributable to the Follow Up Boss acquisition, product expansion and seasonality.\n• Mortgages revenue decreased $23 million, or 19%. This decrease was driven by a $28 million decrease in our\nCustom Quote and Connect advertising services revenue, partially offset by an $8 million increase in mortgage\noriginations revenue. The decrease in our Custom Quote and Connect advertising revenue was primarily due to a\n32% decrease in leads generated from marketing products sold to mortgage professionals. This decrease in leads\nwas primarily driven by a decrease in demand for mortgages attributable to the higher interest rate environment as\ncompared to the prior year period, as well as a shift in strategic priority as we focus on organic growth of our\nmortgage origination business. The decrease in Custom Quote and Connect advertising services revenue was\npartially offset by an $8 million increase in mortgage originations revenue, primarily due to a 22% increase in gain\non sale margin driven by fewer interest rate increases in 2023 as compared to 2022, resulting in higher profitability\non the sale of mortgage loans in the secondary market. Gain on sale margin represents the net gain on sale of\nmortgage loans divided by total loan origination volume for the period. Net gain on sale of mortgage loans includes\nall components related to the origination and sale of mortgage loans, including the net gain on sale of loans into the\nsecondary market, loan origination fees, unrealized gains and losses associated with changes in fair value of interest\nrate lock commitments and mortgage loans held for sale, realized and unrealized gains or losses from derivative\nfinancial instruments and the provision for losses relating to representations and warranties.\n• Rentals revenue increased $83 million, or 30%. The increase in Rentals revenue was primarily due to a 21%\nincrease in quarterly revenue per average monthly rentals unique visitor to $3.19 for the year ended December 31,\n2023 as compared to $2.63 for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily driven by lower occupancy rates and\nthe corresponding increase in advertising spend from multifamily property managers as well as growth in\nmultifamily property listings. We calculate quarterly revenue per average monthly rentals unique visitor by dividing\ntotal Rentals revenue for the period by the average monthly rentals unique visitors for the period and then dividing\nby the number of quarters in the period. The increase in Rentals revenue was also driven by growth in average\nmonthly rentals unique visitors which increased 8% to 28 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 from\n26 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily driven by the increase in active rental listings.\nAverage monthly rentals unique visitors are measured with Comscore data, which includes average monthly unique\n52\nvisitors on rental listings on Zillow, Trulia and HotPads mobile apps and websites.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nThe following table summarizes net loss, which includes the impact of discontinued operations, and Adjusted EBITDA,\nwhich excludes the impact of discontinued operations (in millions, except percentages):\n% of Revenue\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 to 2023 Year Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 $ Change % Change 2023 2022\nNet loss $ (158) $ (101) $ (57) (56) % (8) % (5) %\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 391 $ 514 $ (123) (24) % 20 % 26 %\nTo provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have disclosed Adjusted EBITDA, a\nnon-GAAP financial measure, within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have provided a reconciliation below of Adjusted\nEBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) financial measure.\nWe have included Adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as it is a key metric used by our management\nand Board to measure operating performance and trends and to prepare and approve our annual budget. In particular, the\nexclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-\nperiod basis.\nOur use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider this measure in isolation\nor as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the results of discontinued operations;\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of share-based compensation;\n• Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have\nto be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such\nreplacements or for new capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect impairment and restructuring costs;\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect acquisition-related costs;\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the gain on extinguishment of debt;\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense or other income, net;\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income taxes; and\n• Other companies, including companies in our own industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently from the\nway we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures,\nincluding various cash flow metrics, net loss and our other GAAP results.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial\nmeasure, which is net loss for each of the periods presented (in millions):\n53\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Loss:\nNet loss $ (158) $ (101)\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes — 13\nIncome taxes 4 3\nOther income, net (151) (43)\nDepreciation and amortization 187 150\nShare-based compensation 451 433\nImpairment and restructuring costs 19 24\nAcquisition-related costs 4 —\nGain on extinguishment of debt (1) —\nInterest expense 36 35\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 391 $ 514\nCosts and Expenses, Gross Profit and Other Items\n% of Total Revenue\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 to 2023 Year Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 $ Change % Change 2023 2022\n(in millions, except percentages)\nCost of revenue $ 421 $ 367 $ 54 15 % 22 % 19 %\nGross profit 1,524 1,591 (67) (4) 78 81\nOperating expenses:\nSales and marketing 658 664 (6) (1) 34 34\nTechnology and development 560 498 62 12 29 25\nGeneral and administrative 553 498 55 11 28 25\nImpairment and restructuring\ncosts 19 24 (5) (21) 1 1\nAcquisition-related costs 4 — 4 N/A — —\nTotal operating expenses 1,794 1,684 110 7 92 86\nGain on extinguishment of debt 1 — 1 N/A — —\nOther income, net 151 43 108 251 8 2\nInterest expense (36) (35) (1) (3) (2) (2)\nIncome tax expense (4) (3) (1) (33) — —\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists of expenses related to operating our mobile applications and websites, including associated\nheadcount-related expenses, such as salaries, benefits, bonuses and share-based compensation expense, as well as revenue-\nsharing costs related to our commercial business relationships, depreciation expense, and costs associated with hosting our\nmobile applications and websites. Cost of revenue also includes amortization costs related to capitalized website and\ndevelopment activities, amortization of software, amortization of certain intangible assets and other costs to obtain data used to\n54\npopulate our mobile applications and websites, and amortization of certain intangible assets recorded in connection with\nacquisitions, including developed technology. Cost of revenue also includes credit card fees and ad serving costs paid to third\nparties, direct costs to provide our rental applications product, and direct costs to originate mortgage loans, including\nunderwriting and processing costs.\nCost of revenue increased $54 million, or 15%, primarily driven by increases of $38 million in depreciation and\namortization expense due to an increase in website development costs, $10 million in ad serving costs, $7 million in software\nand hardware costs and $7 million in mortgage loan processing costs due to increased purchase loan origination volume. These\nincreases were partially offset by a $7 million decrease in lead acquisition costs as we shift our strategic priorities to focus on\norganic growth of our mortgage origination business.\nGross Profit\nGross profit is calculated as revenue less cost of revenue. Gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of\nrevenue. Our gross profit has and will continue to be affected by a number of factors, including the mix of revenue from our\nvarious product offerings.\nGross profit decreased by $67 million, or 4%, primarily due to an increase in cost of revenue, discussed above. Total\ngross margin decreased from 81% to 78%.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist of advertising costs and other sales expenses related to promotional and marketing\nactivities, headcount-related expenses, including salaries, commissions, benefits, bonuses and share-based compensation\nexpense for sales, sales support, customer support, including the customer connections team and mortgage loan officers and\nspecialists, marketing and public relations employees, depreciation expense and amortization of certain intangible assets\nrecorded in connection with acquisitions, including trade names and trademarks and customer relationships.\nSales and marketing expenses decreased $6 million, or 1%, due to decreases of $7 million in marketing and advertising\ncosts and $4 million in third-party professional service fees, both driven by active cost management, a $2 million decrease in\ndepreciation and amortization expense and a $2 million decrease in trade shows and events. These decreases were partially\noffset by a $7 million increase in travel expenses and a $3 million increase in software and hardware costs.\nTechnology and Development\nTechnology and development expenses consist of headcount-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and\nshare-based compensation expense for individuals engaged in the design, development and testing of our products, mobile\napplications and websites and the tools and applications that support our products. Technology and development expenses also\ninclude equipment and software maintenance costs and depreciation expense.\nTechnology and development expenses increased $62 million, or 12%, primarily due to increases of $54 million in\nheadcount-related expenses, including share-based compensation expense, primarily driven by the August 2022 Equity Award\nActions, $6 million in travel expenses and $5 million in software and hardware costs. These increases were partially offset by a\ndecrease of $3 million in third-party professional service fees.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist of headcount-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and\nshare-based compensation expense for executive, finance, accounting, legal, human resources, recruiting, corporate information\ntechnology costs and other administrative support. General and administrative expenses also include legal settlement costs and\nestimated legal liabilities, legal, accounting and other third-party professional service fees, rent expense, depreciation expense\nand bad debt expense.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $55 million, or 11%, due to a $35 million increase in headcount-related\n55\nexpenses, including share-based compensation expense, primarily driven by an $18 million increase in share-based\ncompensation expense associated with the departures of certain personnel, as well as the impact of the August 2022 Equity\nAward Actions. The increase in general and administrative expenses was also driven by a $13 million increase in rent expense,\nprimarily due to $14 million of additional rent expense recognized in connection with the partial termination of our Seattle\nlease. For additional information on leases, see Note 10 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K. The increase in general and administrative expenses was also driven by increases of $4\nmillion in third-party professional service fees, $3 million in software and hardware costs and $2 million in travel expenses. We\nexpect general and administrative expenses to decrease in absolute dollars for the three months ending March 31, 2024 as a\nresult of the absence of additional rent expense associated with the partial termination of our Seattle lease that was recorded in\nthe three months ended December 31, 2023, as discussed above.\nImpairment and Restructuring Costs\nImpairment and restructuring costs were $19 million and $24 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. The year ended December 31, 2023 includes impairment costs of $16 million associated with changes in the use of\ncertain office spaces in our lease portfolio and employee termination costs of $3 million. For additional information regarding\nimpairment costs, see Note 10 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K.\nImpairment and restructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2022 do not qualify as discontinued operations and\nwere primarily attributable to employee termination costs associated with the wind down of Zillow Offers operations. For\nadditional information regarding these costs, see Note 3 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOther Income, net\nOther income, net consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and investments, and fair\nvalue adjustments on an outstanding warrant.\nOther income, net increased $108 million, for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the December 31, 2022.\nThe increase in other income, net was primarily driven by increases in returns on investments due to the higher interest rate\nenvironment as compared to the prior year period.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are primarily subject to income taxes in the United States (federal and state), as well as certain foreign jurisdictions.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we have provided a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets\nthat we believe, based on the weight of available evidence, are not more likely than not to be realized. There is a reasonable\npossibility that within the next several years, sufficient positive evidence will become available to demonstrate that a significant\nportion of the valuation allowance against our U.S. net deferred tax assets will no longer be required. We have accumulated\nfederal tax losses of approximately $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2023, which are available to reduce future taxable income.\nWe have accumulated state tax losses of approximately $56 million (tax effected) as of December 31, 2023.\nWe recorded income tax expense of $4 million and $3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, primarily driven by state taxes. Refer to Note 12 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item\n8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our income taxes.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from operations, debt financing and equity\nofferings. Our cash requirements consist principally of working capital, general corporate needs and mortgage loan originations.\nWe continue to invest in the development and expansion of our operations using available cash flows from operations. Ongoing\ninvestments include, but are not limited to, improvements in our technology platforms, investments in new products and\nservices, and continued investments in sales and marketing. We also use cash flows from operations to service our debt\n56\nobligations.\nSources of Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash of $2.8 billion and\n$3.4 billion, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents balances consist of operating cash on deposit with financial institutions\nand money market funds. Investments consist of fixed income securities, which include U.S. government treasury securities,\nU.S. government agency securities, investment grade corporate securities, and commercial paper. Restricted cash primarily\nconsists of amounts held in escrow related to indemnification holdbacks for certain of our acquisitions and amounts used to\nfund customer home purchases in our mortgage origination business. Amounts on deposit with third-party financial institutions\nexceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation insurance limits, as\napplicable. As of December 31, 2023, Zillow Group and its subsidiaries were in compliance with all debt covenants specified in\nthe facilities described below.\nWe believe that cash from operations and cash and cash equivalents and investment balances will be sufficient to meet\nour ongoing operating activities, working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and investments and other capital\nrequirements for at least the next 12 months. We believe we will meet longer-term expected future cash requirements and\nobligations through a combination of cash flows from operations, debt financing and equity offerings, as applicable.\nSummarized Cash Flow Information\nThe cash flows related to discontinued operations have not been separated. Accordingly, the consolidated statements of\ncash flows and the following discussions include the results of continuing and discontinued operations for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. There were no cash flows related to discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2023. See\nNote 3 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional\ninformation on discontinued operations, including supplemental cash flow information. The following table presents selected\ncash flow data for the periods presented (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nCash Flow Data:\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 354 $ 4,504\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities 25 (1,533)\nNet cash used in financing activities (352) (4,341)\nCash Flows Provided By Operating Activities\nOur operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from real estate professionals, rental professionals,\nmortgage professionals, builders and brand advertisers, as well as cash received from sales of mortgages originated by Zillow\nHome Loans and, prior to September 30, 2022, from customers for sales of homes through Zillow Offers. Our primary uses of\ncash from operating activities include marketing and advertising activities, mortgages funded through Zillow Home Loans and\nemployee compensation and benefits. Additionally, uses of cash from operating activities include costs associated with\noperating our mobile applications and websites and other general corporate expenditures. Prior to the wind down of Zillow\nOffers operations, our primary uses of cash from operating activities also included payments for homes purchased through\nZillow Offers.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was $354 million. This was primarily\ndriven by a net loss of $158 million, adjusted by share-based compensation expense of $451 million, depreciation and\namortization expense of $187 million, accretion of bond discount of $35 million, amortization of right of use assets of $35\nmillion, amortization of contract cost assets of $21 million, impairment costs of $16 million, and amortization of debt issuance\ncosts of $5 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased cash provided by operating activities by $165 million.\nThe changes in operating assets and liabilities are primarily related to a $59 million increase in mortgage loans held for sale due\nto an increase in purchase loan origination volume, a $30 million decrease in lease liabilities primarily due to contractual lease\n57\npayments, a $24 million increase in accounts receivable primarily due to an increase in revenue from products and services\nbilled in arrears, a $21 million increase in contract cost assets primarily due to capitalized sales commissions, an $18 million\ndecrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities driven by the timing of payments, a $17 million increase in prepaid\nexpenses and other current assets primarily due to an increase in revenue from products and services billed in arrears, and a $2\nmillion decrease in other long-term liabilities. These changes were partially offset by a $6 million increase in accounts payable\ndriven by the timing of payments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash provided by operating activities was $4.5 billion. This was primarily\ndriven by a net loss of $101 million, adjusted by share-based compensation expense of $451 million, depreciation and\namortization expense of $157 million, amortization of contract cost assets of $30 million, amortization of debt discount and\ndebt issuance costs of $26 million, amortization of right of use assets of $23 million, a loss on extinguishment of debt of $21\nmillion, other adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operating activities of $15 million, and an inventory\nvaluation adjustment of $9 million. This was partially offset by $18 million in accretion of bond discount. Changes in operating\nassets and liabilities increased cash provided by operating activities by $3.9 billion. The changes in operating assets and\nliabilities are primarily related to a $3.9 billion decrease in inventory and an $82 million decrease in accounts receivable as we\nwound down Zillow Offers operations, a $66 million decrease in mortgage loans held for sale driven by increased interest rates\nwhich decreased demand for mortgages, a $6 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets due to the timing of\npayments and a $7 million increase in other long-term liabilities primarily due to our outstanding warrant agreement. These\nchanges were partially offset by a $71 million decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and a $60 million\ndecrease in accrued compensation and benefits driven primarily by the wind down of Zillow Offers operations, a $21 million\ndecrease in lease liabilities primarily due to lease payments, an $18 million increase in contract cost assets and a $7 million\ndecrease in deferred revenue.\nCash Flows Provided By (Used In) Investing Activities\nOur primary investing activities include the purchase and sale or maturity of investments, the purchase of property and\nequipment and intangible assets, and cash paid in connection with acquisitions.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash provided by investing activities was $25 million. This was the result of\n$623 million of net proceeds from the maturity of investments, $433 million of cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired,\nand $165 million of purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in investing activities was $1.5 billion. This was primarily the\nresult of $1.4 billion of net purchases of investments and $140 million of purchases of property and equipment and intangible\nassets.\nCash Flows Used In Financing Activities\nOur primary financing activities have resulted from proceeds from the issuance of Class C capital stock, repurchases of\nClass A common stock and Class C capital stock, the exercise of employee option awards, repayments of borrowings on the\nwarehouse line of credit and master repurchase agreements related to Zillow Home Loans, settlement of long term debt\nincluding repurchases of the 2025 Notes, and, prior to September 30, 2022, our Zillow Offers securitization term loans,\nproceeds from our Zillow Offers securitization transaction, and proceeds from and repayments of borrowings on our credit\nfacilities related to Zillow Offers.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, cash used in financing activities was $352 million, which was primarily related to\n$424 million of cash paid for share repurchases and $56 million for the repurchases of the 2025 Notes. These cash outflows\nwere partially offset by $72 million of proceeds from the exercise of option awards and $56 million of net borrowings on our\nwarehouse line of credit and master repurchase agreements related to Zillow Home Loans.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, cash used in financing activities was $4.3 billion, which was primarily related to\n$2.2 billion of repayments on borrowings of our credit facilities and $1.2 billion for the repayment of the term loans associated\nwith the wind down of Zillow Offers operations, $947 million of cash paid for share repurchases and $76 million of net\n58\nrepayments on our warehouse line of credit and master repurchase agreements related to Zillow Home Loans. These cash\noutflows were partially offset by $46 million of proceeds from the exercise of option awards.\nCapital Resources\nConvertible Senior Notes\nAs of December 31, 2023, we have a total of $1.6 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes\noutstanding. The convertible notes are senior unsecured obligations, and interest on the convertible notes is paid semi-annually.\nThe following table summarizes our convertible senior notes as of the periods presented (in millions, except interest rates):\nCarrying Value\nAggregate Principal\nMaturity Date Amount Stated Interest Rate December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nSeptember 1, 2026 $ 499 1.375 % $ 496 $ 495\nMay 15, 2025 507 2.75 % 504 560\nSeptember 1, 2024 608 0.75 % 607 605\nTotal $ 1,614 $ 1,607 $ 1,660\nWe may from time to time seek to redeem, retire or purchase outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges\nfor cash, shares of stock or a combination of cash and stock, pursuant to the redemption terms of such debt securities, in open\nmarket purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. In particular, the 2024 Notes and 2026 Notes may be\nredeemed if the last reported sale price of our Class C capital stock exceeds $56.56 per share for a specified period of trading\ndays. To the extent our Class C capital stock price rises above those levels, we may redeem the 2024 Notes and/or 2026 Notes,\nin which case, we would expect to settle any conversions in cash up to the principal amount and shares of Class C capital stock\nfor any conversion obligation in excess of the principal amount. Such redemptions, repurchases or exchanges, if any, will\ndepend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts\ninvolved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. During the year ended December 31, 2023,\nwe repurchased a total of $58 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes through open market transactions for\n$57 million in cash, including accrued interest. There were no repurchases of convertible senior notes during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. Refer to Note 11 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report\non Form 10-K for additional information regarding our convertible senior notes, including conversion rates, conversion and\nredemption dates and the related capped call transactions.\nShare Repurchases\nPrior to the year ended December 31, 2023, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $1.8 billion our Class A\ncommon stock, Class C capital stock, outstanding convertible senior notes or a combination thereof. On July 31, 2023, the\nBoard authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of Class A common stock, Class C capital stock,\noutstanding convertible senior notes or a combination thereof. This additional authorization (together with the previous\nauthorizations, the “Repurchase Authorizations”) increased our total cumulative Repurchase Authorizations to $2.5 billion. The\nRepurchase Authorizations do not have an expiration date. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased 2.2\nmillion shares of Class A common stock and 7.3 million shares of Class C capital stock at an average price of $46.45 and\n$43.94 per share, respectively, for an aggregate purchase price of $103 million and $321 million, respectively. As of December\n31, 2023, after the effects of our cumulative share and convertible debt repurchases, $770 million remained available for future\nrepurchases pursuant to the Repurchase Authorizations, which repurchases decrease our liquidity and capital resources when\neffected. For additional information on repurchases made in accordance with the Repurchase Authorizations, see Note 11 and\nNote 13 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAcquisitions\nWe may enter into agreements to acquire businesses and may use available cash or proceeds from the issuance of debt or\n59\nequity securities to finance such transactions. On July 31, 2023, we acquired Aryeo for approximately $20 million of our Class\nC capital stock and $15 million in cash, net of cash acquired. On September 11, 2023, we acquired substantially all of the assets\nand liabilities of Spruce for approximately $19 million in cash, net of cash acquired. On December 8, 2023, we acquired Follow\nUp Boss for $399 million in cash, net of cash acquired, and up to $100 million in cash payable over a three-year period upon\nachievement of certain performance metrics contemplated by the purchase agreement. For additional information on these\nacquisitions, see Note 7 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-\nK.\nCredit Facilities\nZillow Home Loans operations impact our liquidity and capital resources as a cash intensive business that funds\nmortgage loans originated for resale in the secondary market. We primarily use debt financing to fund mortgage loan\noriginations. The following table summarizes our warehouse line of credit and master repurchase agreements as of the periods\npresented (in millions, except interest rates):\nOutstanding Outstanding\nMaximum Borrowings at Borrowings at\nBorrowing December 31, December 31, Weighted Average\nLender Maturity Date Capacity 2023 2022 Interest Rate\nUBS AG(1) October 9, 2024 $ 100 $ 45 $ — 7.08 %\nJPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A.(2) May 30, 2024 100 40 — 7.05 %\nAtlas Securitized\nProducts, L.P.(3) March 11, 2024 50 8 23 7.37 %\nNovember 28,\nComerica Bank(4) 2023 — — 11 — %\nCitibank, N.A.(5) June 9, 2023 — — 3 — %\nTotal $ 250 $ 93 $ 37\n(1)Agreement commenced on October 11, 2023.\n(2)Agreement commenced on June 1, 2023.\n(3)Agreement was reassigned from Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands on May 25, 2023.\n(4)Agreement was terminated on November 28, 2023.\n(5)Agreement expired on June 9, 2023 and was not renewed.\nRefer to Note 11 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor additional information on Zillow Group’s warehouse line of credit and master repurchase agreements.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nConvertible Senior Notes - Includes the aggregate principal amounts of the 2024 Notes, 2025 Notes and 2026 Notes due\non their contractual maturity dates, as well as the associated coupon interest. As of December 31, 2023, we have an outstanding\naggregate principal amount of $1.6 billion, $608 million of which is payable within 12 months. Future interest payments\nassociated with the convertible senior notes total $46 million, with $25 million payable within 12 months. Refer to Note 11 of\nour Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for maturity dates, stated\ninterest rates and additional information on our convertible senior notes.\nCredit Facilities - Includes principal amounts due for amounts borrowed under the master repurchase agreements to\nfinance mortgages originated through Zillow Home Loans. Principal amounts under the master repurchase agreements are due\nwhen the related mortgage loan is sold to an investor or directly to an agency. As of December 31, 2023, we have outstanding\nprincipal amounts of $93 million. Amounts exclude an immaterial amount of estimated interest payments.\nOperating Lease Obligations - Our lease portfolio primarily comprises operating leases for our office space. For\n60\nadditional information regarding our operating leases and associated obligations, see Note 10 to our Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, as of December 31, 2023, we had\noutstanding letters of credit of approximately $11 million, which secure our lease obligations in connection with certain of the\noperating leases of our office spaces.\nContingent Consideration - In connection with the acquisition of Follow Up Boss, we are obligated to pay contingent\nconsideration upon the achievement of certain performance metrics over a three-year period. For additional information\nregarding this contingent consideration, see Note 4 and Note 7 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II,\nItem 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPurchase Obligations - We have non-cancellable purchase obligations for content related to our mobile applications and\nwebsites and certain cloud computing costs. For additional information regarding our purchase obligations, see Note 16 to our\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated\nfinancial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions on an ongoing\nbasis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the\ncircumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates, and the health of the housing market and the broader\neconomy have introduced significant additional uncertainty with respect to estimates, judgments and assumptions, which may\nmaterially impact our estimates.\nWe believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions associated with accounting for certain revenue offerings,\nwebsite and software development costs, business combinations, including the initial and subsequent fair value measurements\nof assets (primarily intangible assets), liabilities and contingent consideration, recoverability of intangible assets with definite\nlives and other long-lived assets, recoverability of goodwill and share-based compensation have the greatest potential impact on\nour consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates.\nAccounting for Certain Revenue\nAccrued Revenue. We accrue revenue for certain of our products, primarily our Premier Agent Flex, rentals pay per lease\n(“Zillow Lease Connect”) and StreetEasy Experts offerings. With these pricing models, our customers are provided with leads\nat no initial cost and pay a performance advertising fee only when a real estate transaction is closed, generally within two years,\nor a lease is secured with one of the leads we have provided, generally within six months. With these pricing models, the\ntransaction price represents variable consideration, as the amount to which we expect to be entitled varies based on the number\nof leads that convert into closed real estate transactions or secured leases and the value of those transactions. As of December\n31, 2023, we accrued $90 million in revenue associated with these products.\nAlthough we do not believe that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will occur once\nthe uncertainty related to the number of real estate transactions to be closed and qualified leases to be secured is resolved,\njudgment is required to determine the quantity and value of transactions and leases that are expected to be realized in a future\nperiod based on the number of leads delivered during the current period. Our estimated revenue is based on a number of\nassumptions, which include estimating the conversion rate of a lead to a real estate transaction or qualified lease, estimating the\nvelocity of conversions and estimating the fee amounts likely to be received. Estimates are primarily developed based on\nhistorical data and our future expectations based on current market trends.\nMortgage Origination Revenue. Mortgage origination revenue generated by Zillow Home Loans reflects origination fees\non purchase or refinance mortgages and the corresponding sale, or expected future sale, of a loan. When an interest rate lock\ncommitment is made to a customer, we record the expected gain on sale of the mortgage, plus the estimated earnings from the\nexpected sale of the associated servicing rights, adjusted for a pull-through percentage (which represents the probability that an\ninterest rate lock commitment will ultimately result in a closed loan), as revenue. Judgment is required to determine the\n61\nappropriate pull-through rate, which is estimated based on expected changes in market conditions, loan stage and historical\nborrower behavior. Revenue from loan origination fees is recognized at the time the related purchase or refinance transactions\nare completed, usually upon the close of escrow and when we fund the purchase or refinance mortgage loans. (cid:3)\nWebsite and Software Development Costs\nThe costs incurred in the preliminary stages of website and software development are expensed as incurred. Once an\napplication has reached the development stage, internal and external costs, if direct and incremental and deemed by\nmanagement to be significant, are capitalized in property and equipment and amortized on a straight-line basis over their\nestimated useful lives. Maintenance and enhancement costs, including those costs in the post-implementation stages, are\ntypically expensed as incurred, unless such costs relate to substantial upgrades and enhancements to the website or software that\nresult in added functionality, in which case the costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated\nuseful lives.\nCapitalized development activities placed in service are amortized over the expected useful lives of those releases,\ncurrently estimated at one to five years. The estimated useful lives of website and software development activities are reviewed\nfrequently and adjusted as appropriate to reflect upcoming development activities that may include significant upgrades and/or\nenhancements to the existing functionality.\nWe exercise judgment in determining the point at which various projects may be capitalized, in assessing the ongoing\nvalue of the capitalized costs and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized. To the extent\nthat we change the manner in which we develop and test new features and functionalities related to our mobile applications and\nwebsites, assess the ongoing value of capitalized assets, or determine the estimated useful lives over which the costs are\namortized, the amount of website and software development costs we capitalize and amortize could change in future periods.\nRecoverability of Intangible Assets with Definite Lives and Other Long-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate intangible assets and other long-lived assets, including our lease right of use assets, for impairment whenever\nevents or circumstances indicate that they may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying\namount of an asset group to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated. We group assets for purposes of such\nreview at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows of the asset group are largely independent of the cash flows of the\nother groups of assets and liabilities.\nUnforeseen events, changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in estimates of future cash\nflows could adversely affect the fair value of our assets and could result in an impairment charge. Fair value can be estimated\nutilizing a number of techniques including quoted market prices, prices for comparable assets or other valuation processes\ninvolving estimates of cash flows, multiples of earnings or revenues, and we may make various assumptions and estimates\nwhen performing our impairment assessments, particularly as it relates to cash flow projections. Cash flow estimates are by\ntheir nature subjective and include assumptions regarding factors such as recent and forecasted operating performance, revenue\ntrends and operating margins. These estimates could also be adversely impacted by changes in federal, state, or local\nregulations, economic downturns or developments, or other market conditions affecting our industry.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe recognize identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the\nacquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed. We use assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed. Particularly, to estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets, we engage third-party valuation\nspecialists, and generally use valuation models that include variations of the income approach, specifically the excess earnings\nmethod and relief-from-royalty method. Under these valuation approaches, we are required to make estimates and assumptions\nwhich may include revenue growth rates, estimated earnings, royalty rates, obsolescence factors, customer attrition and\ndiscount rates. Changes in any of the inputs may result in a significantly different fair value. We may refine our estimates\nduring the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date. Upon the conclusion of the measurement\n62\nperiod, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations.\nThe acquisition of Follow Up Boss includes the potential for the future payment of consideration that is contingent upon\nthe achievement of certain performance metrics. The fair value of contingent consideration is recorded as a liability in our\nconsolidated balance sheets and is estimated at the acquisition date using a Monte Carlo simulation and unobservable inputs.\nThese inputs include the probabilities of the achievement of certain performance metrics and the related discount rates. We may\nrefine our acquisition date estimates during the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date.\nSubsequent to the acquisition date, at each reporting period until the contingencies are resolved, the contingent consideration is\nremeasured at current fair value with changes recorded in our consolidated statements of operations. Changes in any of the\ninputs may result in a significant fair value adjustment.\nRecoverability of Goodwill\nGoodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred for an acquired business over the net of the acquisition\ndate fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and is not amortized. We assess the impairment of goodwill at the\nreporting unit level on an annual basis, in our fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that\ngoodwill may be impaired. In our evaluation of goodwill, we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the\ncarrying value of our reporting unit is greater than its fair value. If it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the\nreporting unit is greater than its fair value, we perform a quantitative assessment and an impairment charge is recorded in our\nconsolidated statements of operations for the excess of carrying value of the reporting unit over its fair value.\nWe exercise judgment in determining whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of our reporting unit is\ngreater than its fair value. The following events and circumstances are considered when performing the qualitative assessment:\n• Macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, and entity-specific conditions, such as changes in cost\nfactors and financial performance;\n• The amount by which the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value as of the date of the most recent\nquantitative assessment;\n• Changes in interest rates since the most recent quantitative assessment;\n• Changes in our business or strategy since our most recent qualitative assessment;\n• Changes in our market capitalization and overall enterprise value.\nThe examples noted above are not all-inclusive, and we consider other relevant events and circumstances that affect\nthe fair value of the reporting unit in determining whether to perform a quantitative assessment.\nBeginning in 2023, our chief operating decision maker, who is our chief executive officer, manages our business, makes\noperating decisions and evaluates operating performance on the basis of the company as a whole, instead of on a segment basis\nas he did prior to 2023. This aligns to our ongoing growth strategy and our intent to provide integrated customer solutions for\nall tasks and services related to facilitating real estate transactions. This resulted in revisions to the nature and substance of\ninformation regularly provided to and used by the chief operating decision maker. Accordingly, we have realigned our operating\nstructure, resulting in a single operating and reportable segment. In line with this, the nature and substance of the information\nregularly provided to our segment manager similarly changed, and we determined that we have only one reporting unit.\nBecause the segment change impacted the structure of our reporting units, we performed a qualitative goodwill impairment\nassessment immediately before and immediately after the change in reporting units. Based on those assessments, we determined\nit was more likely than not that the fair value of our current and legacy reporting units exceeded their respective carrying\nvalues. Therefore, we concluded that it was not necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. At December 31, 2023, our\ntotal goodwill balance was $2.8 billion.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe measure compensation expense for all share-based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognize\ncompensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing\n63\nmodel to determine the fair value for option awards and recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the option\nawards’ vesting period.\nDetermining the fair value of option awards at the grant date requires judgment. In valuing our option awards, we make\nassumptions about risk-free interest rates, dividend yields, volatility, and weighted-average expected lives. If any of the\nassumptions changes significantly, share-based compensation expense for future option awards may differ materially compared\nwith the awards granted previously. When determining the grant date fair value of share-based awards, management also\nconsiders whether an adjustment is required to the observable market price or volatility of our Class C capital stock used in the\nvaluation as a result of material non-public information.\nRisk-free interest rate. Risk-free interest rates are derived from U.S. Treasury securities as of the option award’s grant\ndate.\nExpected dividend yields. Expected dividend yields are based on our historical dividend payments, which have been zero\nto date.\nVolatility. The expected volatility for our Class C capital stock is estimated using our historical volatility.\nExpected term. The weighted-average expected life of the option awards is estimated based on our historical exercise\ndata.\nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility and expected terms utilized for our share-based\ncompensation expense calculations on a prospective basis. We will also continue to use judgment when determining whether an\nadjustment is required to the observable market price or volatility as a result of material non-public information. Actual results,\nand future changes in estimates, may differ substantially from management’s current estimates. As we continue to accumulate\nadditional data related to our Class C capital stock, we may have refinements to the estimates of our expected volatility and\nexpected terms, which could materially impact our future share-based compensation expense. In future periods, we expect our\nshare-based compensation expense to decrease as existing awards continue to vest over their respective periods and we focus on\nmitigating dilution as we issue new awards.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards and Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nFor information about our recently adopted accounting standards and recently issued accounting standards not yet\nadopted, see Note 2 of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K.\n64\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily consist of fluctuations in\ninterest rates.\nInterest Rate Risk\nUnder our current investment policy, we invest our excess cash in money market funds, U.S. government treasury\nsecurities, U.S. government agency securities, investment grade corporate securities and commercial paper. Our current\ninvestment policy seeks first to preserve capital, second to provide sufficient liquidity for our operating and capital needs and\nthird to maximize yield without putting our principal at risk.\nOur short-term investments are exposed to market risk due to the fluctuation of prevailing interest rates that may reduce\nthe yield on our investments or their fair value. For our investment portfolio, we do not believe an immediate 10% increase in\ninterest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $1.6 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes\noutstanding with maturities ranging from September 2024 through September 2026. All outstanding convertible senior notes\nbear fixed rates of interest and, therefore, do not expose us to financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates.\nThe fair values of the convertible senior notes change primarily when the market price of our stock fluctuates or interest rates\nchange.\nWe are also subject to market risk which may impact our mortgage loan origination volume and associated revenue and\nthe net interest margin derived from borrowings under our master repurchase agreements that provide capital for Zillow Home\nLoans. Market risk occurs in periods where changes in short-term interest rates result in mortgage loans being originated with\nterms that provide a smaller interest rate spread above the financing terms of our master repurchase agreements, which can\nnegatively impact our results of operations. This risk is primarily mitigated through expedited sale of our loans. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, we had $93 million of outstanding borrowings on our master repurchase agreements. Borrowings on the\nmaster repurchase agreements bear interest at a floating rate based on Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus an\napplicable margin, as defined by the governing agreements. We manage the interest rate risk associated with our mortgage loan\norigination services through the use of forward sales of mortgage-backed securities. Assuming no change in the outstanding\nborrowings on the master repurchase agreements, we estimate that a one percentage point increase in SOFR would not have a\nmaterial effect on our annual interest expense associated with the master repurchase agreements as of December 31, 2023.\nFor additional details related to our credit facilities and convertible senior notes, see Note 11 to our Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInflation Risk\nThe macroeconomic environment in the United States has experienced and continues to experience inflationary pressures.\nWhile it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of these inflationary pressures on our business, we believe these effects\nhave been pervasive throughout our business beginning in 2022 and continuing during the year ended December 31, 2023. In\nresponse to ongoing inflationary pressures in the United States, the Federal Reserve has implemented a number of increases to\nthe federal funds rate during 2022 and 2023. Despite inflation stabilizing in the second half of 2023, these federal funds rate\nincreases have impacted other market rates derived from this benchmark rate, including mortgage interest rates. The persistently\nhigh mortgage interest rates across the industry relative to recent years has impacted the number of transactions consumers\ncomplete using our products and services and the demand for our advertising services and mortgage origination offerings and,\nin turn, had an adverse impact on our revenue during 2023.\nIf inflationary pressures persist, our costs, in particular labor, marketing and hosting costs, may increase and we may not\nbe able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. In addition, uncertain or changing economic and market\nconditions, including inflation or deflation, may continue to affect demand for our products and services and the housing\nmarkets in which we operate. Our inability or failure to quickly respond to inflation could harm our business, results of\noperations and financial condition. We cannot predict the duration or magnitude of these inflationary pressures, or how they\n65\nmay change over time, but we expect to see continued impacts on the residential real estate industry, our customers and our\ncompany. Despite these near-term effects, we do not expect these inflationary pressures to have a material impact on our ability\nto execute our long-term business strategy.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe do not believe that foreign currency exchange risk has had a material effect on our business, results of operations or\nfinancial condition. As we do not maintain a significant balance of foreign currency, we do not believe an immediate 10%\nincrease or decrease in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar would have a material effect on our business,\nresults of operations or financial condition.\n66\nItem 8.

(the “Company”) as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows, for\neach of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial\nstatements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the\nCompany as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in\nthe period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission and our report dated February 14, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to\nerror or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that\nwas communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that\nare material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The\ncommunication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and\nwe are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nResidential and Rentals Revenue – Processed and Recorded using Highly Automated Systems — Refer to Notes 2 and 18 to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company’s Residential and Rentals revenue transactions include a significant volume of data that are processed and\nrecorded using multiple highly automated systems. Residential revenue includes revenue generated from the Premier Agent and\nnew construction marketplaces, as well as revenue from the sale of advertising and business technology solutions for real estate\nprofessionals. Rentals revenue includes the sale of advertising and a suite of tools sold to property managers, landlords and\nother marketplace participants.\n68\nThe Company’s systems to process and record certain Residential and Rentals revenue transactions are highly automated, rely\non multiple internally developed systems, and involve interfacing significant volumes of data across the systems. Given the\ncomplexity of the information technology (IT) environment, the required involvement of professionals with expertise in IT to\nidentify, test, and evaluate the revenue data flows, systems, and automated controls, we considered the audit of certain\nResidential and Rentals revenue transactions processed and recorded using highly automated systems to be a critical audit\nmatter.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to certain Residential and Rentals revenue transactions that are processed and recorded using\nhighly automated systems included the following, among others:\n• With the assistance of our IT specialists, we:\n(cid:405) Identified the relevant systems used to calculate and record revenue transactions.\n(cid:405) Tested the general IT controls over the relevant systems, including testing of user access controls, change\nmanagement controls, and IT operations controls.\n(cid:405) Performed testing of system interface controls and automated controls within the relevant revenue streams.\n• We tested controls within the relevant business processes, including those in place to reconcile the transactional data\nfrom relevant systems to the Company’s general ledger.\n• We reconciled the transactional data from relevant systems to the Company’s general ledger.\n• For a sample of select revenue transactions, we performed detail testing of transactions by agreeing the amounts\nrecognized to source documents and testing the mathematical accuracy of the recorded revenue.\n• For select Premier Agent revenue transactions included within Residential revenue, we tested the amount of revenue\nrecorded by developing an expectation for the amount by applying the percentage change from an independent\nvariable to historical amounts recorded and comparing our expectation to the amount recorded by management.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSeattle, Washington\nFebruary 14, 2024\nWe have served as the Company’s

Organization and Description of Business\nZillow Group is reimagining real estate to make home a reality for more and more people. As the most visited real estate\nwebsite in the United States, Zillow and its affiliates help people find and get the home they want by connecting them with\ndigital solutions, dedicated partners and agents, and easier buying, selling, financing and renting experiences.(cid:3)\nOur portfolio of affiliates, subsidiaries and brands includes Zillow Premier Agent, Zillow Home Loans, our mortgage\noriginations business and affiliate lender, Zillow Rentals, Trulia, StreetEasy, HotPads and Out East. In addition, Zillow Group\nprovides a comprehensive suite of marketing software and technology solutions for the real estate industry, including\nShowingTime+, Spruce and Follow Up Boss.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, we began to wind down the operations of Zillow Offers, our iBuying business which\npurchased and sold homes directly in markets across the country. The wind down was completed in the third quarter of 2022,\nand we have presented the financial results of Zillow Offers as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of\noperations for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. See Note 3 for additional information.\nCertain Significant Risks and Uncertainties\nWe operate in a dynamic industry and, accordingly, can be affected by a variety of factors. For example, we believe that\nchanges in any of the following areas could have a significant negative effect on us in terms of our future financial position,\nresults of operations or cash flows: current and future health and stability of the economy and United States residential real\nestate industry, including changes in inflationary conditions, interest rates, housing availability and affordability, labor shortages\nand supply chain issues; our ability to manage industry changes, including as a result of certain or future class action lawsuits or\n77\ngovernment investigations; our ability to manage advertising inventory and pricing and maintain relationships with our real\nestate partners; our compliance with multiple listing service rules and requirements to access and use listing data, and to\nmaintain or establish relationships with listings and data providers; our investment of resources to pursue strategies and develop\nnew products and services that may not prove effective or that are not attractive for customers and real estate partners or that do\nnot allow us to compete successfully; our ability to operate and grow Zillow Home Loans, our mortgage origination business\nand affiliate lender, including the ability to obtain or maintain sufficient financing and resell originated mortgages on the\nsecondary market; the duration and impact of natural disasters and other catastrophic events (including public health crises) on\nour ability to operate, demand for our products or services or general economic conditions; outcomes of legal proceedings; our\nability to attract and retain a highly skilled workforce; protection of Zillow’s information and systems against security breaches\nor disruptions in operations; reliance on third-party services to support critical functions of our business; protection of our brand\nand intellectual property; and changes in laws or government regulation affecting our business, among other things.\nNote 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include Zillow Group, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All\nintercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. These consolidated financial statements have\nbeen prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We have presented the\nfinancial results of Zillow Offers as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented as\napplicable. See Note 3 for additional information. Certain reclassifications of prior period amounts have been made to conform\nto the current period presentation.(cid:3)\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates,\njudgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related disclosures at the date of the\nfinancial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. On an ongoing\nbasis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the accounting for certain revenue offerings, restructuring costs,\namortization period and recoverability of contract cost assets, website and software development costs, recoverability of long-\nlived assets and intangible assets, share-based compensation, income taxes, the presentation of discontinued and continuing\noperations, business combinations, including the initial and subsequent fair value measurements of assets (primarily intangible\nassets), liabilities and contingent consideration, and the recoverability of goodwill, among others. To the extent there are\nmaterial differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be\naffected. The health of the housing market and the broader economy have introduced significant additional uncertainty with\nrespect to estimates, judgments and assumptions, which may materially impact the estimates previously listed, among others.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments, which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash\nequivalents, investments, accounts receivable and mortgage loans held for sale. We place cash and cash equivalents and\ninvestments with major financial institutions, which management assesses to be of high credit quality, in order to limit exposure\nof our investments.\nCredit risk with respect to accounts receivable is dispersed due to the large number of customers. There were no\ncustomers that comprised 10% or more of our total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2023 or 2022. Further, our credit\nrisk on accounts receivable is mitigated by the relatively short payment terms that we offer. Collateral is not required for\naccounts receivable. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts such that receivables are stated at net realizable value.\nSimilarly, our credit risk on mortgage loans held for sale is dispersed due to a large number of customers and is mitigated\nby the fact that we typically sell mortgages on the secondary market within a relatively short period of time after the loan is\noriginated.\n78\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash includes demand deposits with banks or financial institutions. Cash equivalents include short-term, highly liquid\ninvestments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and so near their maturity that they present minimal\nrisk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Our cash equivalents include only investments with original\nmaturities of three months or less. We regularly maintain cash in excess of federally insured limits at financial institutions.\nShort-term Investments\nOur investments consist of fixed income securities, which include U.S. government treasury securities, investment grade\ncorporate securities, U.S. government agency securities and commercial paper. The investments are available to support current\noperations and are classified as short-term investments measured at fair value. Our investment policy only allows for purchases\nof investment-grade securities and provides guidelines on concentrations to ensure minimum risk of loss. We evaluate whether\nunrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities are the result of credit worthiness of the securities held or other non-credit\nrelated factors. If an unrealized loss is the result of credit quality factors, we recognize an allowance reflective of our current\nestimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial instrument on a specific identification basis upon\ninitial recognition and at each reporting period. If a reduction in value is a result of other factors, we continue to classify the\nlosses in comprehensive loss unless either we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell\nthe security. We did not identify any unrealized loss positions in our available-for-sale securities that were the result of credit\nlosses as of December 31, 2023 or 2022. Additionally, we have the ability to hold our investments to maturity and more likely\nthan not will not be required to sell the securities before a recovery of the amortized cost basis has occurred.(cid:3)\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash primarily consists of amounts held in escrow related to indemnification holdbacks for certain of our\nacquisitions and amounts used to fund customer home purchases in our mortgage origination business.\nMortgage Loans Held for Sale\nMortgage loans held for sale include residential mortgages originated for sale in the secondary market in connection with\nour mortgage origination business. We have elected the fair value option for all mortgage loans held for sale as election of this\noption allows for a better offset of the changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically\nhedge them without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. Mortgage loans held for sale are initially recorded at\nfair value based on either sale commitments or current market quotes and are adjusted for subsequent changes in fair value until\nthe loans are sold. Net origination costs and fees associated with mortgage loans are recognized as incurred. We sell\nsubstantially all of the mortgages we originate and the related servicing rights to third-party purchasers. Interest income is\nearned from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold and is classified within other income, net in the\nconsolidated statements of operations.\nSubstantially all of the mortgage loans originated are sold within a short period of time in the secondary mortgage market\non a servicing released, nonrecourse basis, which limits exposure to nonperformance by loan buyer counterparties. However,\nwe remain liable for certain limited representations and warranties related to loan sales, such as non-compliance with defined\nloan origination or documentation standards, including misstatement in the loan documents, early payoff or default on early\npayments. Mortgage investors could seek to have us buy back loans or compensate them for losses incurred on mortgages we\nhave sold based on claims that we breached our limited representations and warranties. We record a reserve for probable losses\nin connection with the sale of mortgage loans within accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance\nsheet.\nLoan Commitments and Related Derivatives\nWe are party to interest rate lock commitments (“IRLCs”), which are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan\nfunding and meet defined credit and underwriting criteria in connection with our Zillow Home Loans mortgage origination\nbusiness. IRLCs are accounted for as derivative instruments recorded at fair value with gains and losses recognized in revenue\nin the consolidated statements of operations. We manage our interest rate risk related to IRLCs and mortgage loans held for sale\n79\nthrough the use of derivative instruments, generally forward contracts on mortgage-backed securities (“MBSs”), which are\ncommitments to either purchase or sell a financial instrument at a future date for a specified price, and mandatory loan\ncommitments, which are an obligation by an investor to buy loans at a specified price within a specified time period. We do not\nenter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes, and our derivatives are not designated as hedging instruments.\nChanges in the fair value of our derivative financial instruments are recognized in revenue in our consolidated statements of\noperations, and the fair values are reflected in other current assets or other current liabilities, as applicable. Refer to Note 4 to\nour consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding IRLCs and related derivatives.\nThere are no credit-risk-related contingent features within our derivative agreements, and counterparty risk is considered\nminimal. Gains and losses on IRLCs are substantially offset by corresponding gains or losses on forward contracts on MBSs\nand mandatory loan commitments. We are generally not exposed to variability in cash flows of derivative instruments for more\nthan approximately 90 days.\nContract Balances\nAccounts receivable represent our unconditional right to consideration. Accounts receivable are generally due within 30\ndays and are recorded net of the allowance for doubtful accounts. We have an allowance for doubtful accounts for our accounts\nreceivable balances, which represents our estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual life of the accounts receivable.\nTo evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts each reporting period, we analyze the accounts receivable\nbalances with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis, considering factors such as the aging of receivable balances,\npayment terms, historical loss experience, current information and future expectations. Changes to the allowance for doubtful\naccounts are adjusted through credit loss expense, which is included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated\nstatements of operations.\nContract assets represent our right to consideration in exchange for goods and services that we have transferred to the\ncustomer when that right is conditional on something other than the passage of time. Contract assets are primarily related to our\nPremier Agent Flex, Zillow Lease Connect and StreetEasy Experts offerings, whereby we estimate variable consideration based\non the expected number of real estate transactions to be closed for Premier Agent Flex and StreetEasy Experts, and qualified\nleases to be secured for Zillow Lease Connect. We recognize revenue when we satisfy our performance obligations under the\ncorresponding contracts. The current portion of contract assets are recorded within prepaid expenses and other current assets\nand the long-term portion of contract assets are recorded within other assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nContract liabilities consist of deferred revenue, which relates to payments received in advance of performance under a\nrevenue contract. Deferred revenue is primarily related to prepaid advertising fees received or billed in advance of satisfying\nour performance obligations and prepaid but unrecognized subscription revenue. Deferred revenue is recognized when or as we\nsatisfy our obligations under contracts with customers.\nContract Cost Assets\nWe capitalize certain incremental costs of obtaining contracts with customers which we expect to recover. These costs\nrelate to commissions paid to sales personnel, primarily for our Premier Agent program. As a practical expedient, we recognize\nthe incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that we\notherwise would have recognized is one year or less. Capitalized commission costs are recorded as contract cost assets in our\nconsolidated balance sheets. Contract cost assets are amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over a period that is\nconsistent with the transfer to the customer of the products or services to which the asset relates, generally the estimated life of\nthe customer relationship. Amortization expense related to contract cost assets is included in sales and marketing expenses in\nour consolidated statements of operations. In determining the estimated life of our customer relationships, we consider\nquantitative and qualitative data, including, but not limited to, historical customer data, recent changes or expected changes in\nproduct or service offerings and changes in how we monetize our products and services. The amortization period for capitalized\ncontract costs related to our Premier Agent program is approximately three years.\nWe monitor our contract cost assets for impairment and recognize an impairment loss in the consolidated statements of\noperations to the extent the carrying amount of the asset recognized exceeds the amount of consideration that we expect to\n80\nreceive in the future and that we have received but have not recognized in revenue less the costs that relate directly to providing\nthose goods or services that have not yet been recognized as expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nwe did not record any material impairment losses to our contract cost assets.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives\nof the related assets. The useful lives are as follows:\nComputer equipment 3 years\nOffice equipment, furniture and fixtures 5 to 7 years\nLeasehold improvements Shorter of expected useful life or lease term\nMaintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred. Major improvements, which extend the useful life of the\nrelated asset, are capitalized. Upon disposal of a fixed asset, we record a gain or loss based on the difference between the\nproceeds received and the net book value of the disposed asset. We remove fully depreciated property and equipment from the\ncost and accumulated depreciation amounts disclosed.\nWebsite and Software Development Costs\nCosts incurred in the preliminary stages of website and software development are expensed as incurred. Once an\napplication has reached the development stage, internal and external costs, if direct and incremental and deemed by\nmanagement to be significant, are capitalized in property and equipment and amortized on a straight-line basis over their\nestimated useful lives. Maintenance and enhancement costs, including those costs in the post-implementation stages, are\ntypically expensed as incurred, unless such costs relate to substantial upgrades and enhancements to the website or software that\nresult in added functionality, in which case the costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated\nuseful lives. Amortization expense related to capitalized website and software development costs is included in cost of revenue\nin our consolidated statements of operations.\nCapitalized development activities placed in service are amortized over the expected useful lives of those releases,\ncurrently estimated at one to five years. The estimated useful lives of website and software development activities are reviewed\nfrequently and adjusted as appropriate to reflect upcoming development activities that may include significant upgrades and/or\nenhancements to the existing functionality. We remove fully amortized website and software development costs from the cost\nand accumulated amortization amounts disclosed.\nConstruction-in-progress primarily consists of website development costs that are capitalizable, but for which the\nassociated applications have not been placed in service.\nLeases\nOur lease portfolio is primarily composed of operating leases for our office space. We determine whether a contract is or\ncontains a lease at inception of the contract. Our operating leases are included in right of use assets and lease liabilities on our\nconsolidated balance sheets. We do not have any material financing leases.\nWe have lease agreements that include both lease components (e.g., fixed rent) and non-lease components (e.g., common\narea maintenance). For such leases, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single component. For leases with\nan initial term of 12 months or less, we recognize the associated lease payments in the consolidated statements of operations on\na straight-line basis over the lease term.\nRight of use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset during the lease term and lease liabilities represent our\nobligation to make lease payments. Right of use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date\nbased on the present value of the total lease payments contracted but not yet paid, including lease incentives not yet received,\nwith the right of use assets further adjusted for any prepaid or accrued lease payments, lease incentives received and/or initial\n81\ndirect costs incurred. Certain lease arrangements also include variable payments for costs such as common-area maintenance,\nutilities, taxes or other operating costs, which are based on a percentage of actual expenses incurred or a fluctuating rate which\nis unknown at the inception of the contract. These variable lease payments are excluded from the measurement of the right of\nuse assets and lease liabilities.\nOur leases have remaining lease terms ranging from less than one year to nine years, most of which include one or more\noptions to extend the lease term. The renewal options can generally extend the lease term for up to an additional five to ten\nyears. When determining if a renewal option is reasonably certain of being exercised at lease commencement, we consider\nseveral factors, including but not limited to, contract-based, asset-based and entity-based factors. We reassess the term of\nexisting leases if there is a significant event or change in circumstances within our control that affects whether we are\nreasonably certain to exercise an option to extend a lease. Examples of such events or changes include construction of\nsignificant leasehold improvements or other modifications or customizations to the underlying asset, relevant business decisions\nor subleases. As of December 31, 2023, we have concluded that our renewal options are not reasonably certain of being\nexercised, therefore, renewal options are not included in the right of use assets and lease liabilities.\nAs our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at\nthe lease commencement date in determining the present value of the lease payments. We apply a portfolio approach for\ndetermining the incremental borrowing rate based on the applicable lease terms and the current economic environment.\nWe recognize lease expense for operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease payments are\ngenerally recognized when incurred. These expenses are included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated\nstatements of operations.\nFrom time to time, we may enter into sublease agreements with third parties. Our subleases generally do not relieve us of\nour primary obligations under the corresponding head lease. As a result, we account for the head lease based on the original\nassessment at lease inception. We determine if the sublease arrangement is either a sales-type, direct financing, or operating\nlease at inception of the sublease. If the total remaining lease cost on the head lease for the term of the sublease is greater than\nthe anticipated sublease income, the right of use asset is assessed for impairment. Our subleases are generally operating leases\nand we recognize sublease income on a straight-line basis over the sublease term as a reduction to our operating lease cost\nwithin general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations.\nRecoverability of Goodwill\nGoodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred for an acquired business over the net of the acquisition\ndate fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, and is not amortized. We assess the impairment of goodwill at\nthe reporting unit level on an annual basis, in our fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that\ngoodwill may be impaired. In our evaluation of goodwill, we initially perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether\nthe existence of events or circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of each reporting unit is\ngreater than its fair value. If it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value, we\nperform a quantitative assessment and an impairment charge is recorded in our statements of operations if the carrying value of\nthe reporting unit exceeds its fair value.\nBeginning in 2023, our chief operating decision maker, who is our chief executive officer, manages our business, makes\noperating decisions and evaluates operating performance on the basis of the company as a whole, instead of on a segment basis\nas he did prior to 2023. This aligns to our ongoing growth strategy and our intent to provide integrated customer solutions for\nall tasks and services related to facilitating real estate transactions. This resulted in revisions to the nature and substance of\ninformation regularly provided to and used by the chief operating decision maker. Accordingly, we have realigned our operating\nstructure, resulting in a single operating and reportable segment. In line with this, the nature and substance of the information\nregularly provided to our segment manager similarly changed, and we determined that we have only one reporting unit.\nBecause the segment change impacted the structure of our reporting units, we performed a qualitative goodwill impairment\nassessment immediately before and immediately after the change in reporting units. Based on those assessments, we determined\nit was more likely than not that the fair value of our current and legacy reporting units exceeded their respective carrying\nvalues. Therefore, we concluded that it was not necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. During the years ended\n82\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we did not record any impairments related to goodwill.\nIntangible Assets\nWe purchase and license data content from multiple data providers. This data content consists of United States county\ndata about home details and other information relating to the purchase price of homes, both current and historical, as well as\nimagery, mapping and parcel data that is displayed on our mobile applications and websites. In some instances, we retain\nperpetual rights to this information after our contract with a vendor ends; in other instances, the information and data are\nlicensed only during the fixed term of the agreement. Additionally, certain data license agreements provide for uneven payment\namounts throughout the contract term.\nWe capitalize payments made to third parties for data licenses that we expect to recover through generation of revenue\nand margins. For data license contracts that include uneven payment amounts, we capitalize the payments as they are made as\nan intangible asset and the total contract value is typically amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract, which\nis equivalent to the estimated useful life of the asset. The amortization period for the capitalized purchased content is based on\nour best estimate of the useful life of the asset, which ranges from three to seven years.\nUnder certain other data agreements, the underlying data is obtained on a subscription basis with consistent monthly or\nquarterly recurring payment terms over the contractual period. Upon the expiration of such arrangements, we no longer have\nthe right to access the related data, and therefore, the costs incurred under such contracts are not capitalized and are expensed as\npayments are made.\nWe also capitalize costs related to the license of certain internal-use software from third parties, including certain licenses\nof software in cloud computing arrangements. Additionally, we capitalize costs incurred during the application development\nstage related to the development of internal-use software and enterprise cloud computing services. We expense costs as incurred\nrelated to the planning and post-implementation phases of development. Capitalized internal-use software costs are amortized\non a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset, which is currently one to five years.\nIntangibles-in-progress consist of purchased content and software that are capitalizable but have not been placed in\nservice.\nWe also have intangible assets for developed technology, customer relationships, and trade names and trademarks which\nwe recorded in connection with acquisitions. Purchased intangible assets with a determinable economic life are carried at cost\nless accumulated amortization. These intangible assets are amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset on a straight-line\nbasis.\nFor each of the intangible assets described above, we have removed fully amortized assets from the cost and accumulated\namortization amounts disclosed.\nRecoverability of Intangible Assets with Definite Lives and Other Long-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate intangible assets and other long-lived assets, including our lease right of use assets, for impairment whenever\nevents or circumstances indicate that they may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying\namount of an asset group to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated. We group assets for purposes of such\nreview at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows of the asset group are largely independent of the cash flows of the\nother groups of assets and liabilities. If this comparison indicates impairment, the amount of impairment to be recognized is\ncalculated as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset group.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe recognize identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the\nacquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the\nassets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions for the preliminary purchase price\nallocation process to value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain\n83\nand subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date,\nwe record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill to the extent that\nwe identify adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final\ndetermination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are\nrecorded to our consolidated statements of operations. We recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified\nduring the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.\nWe record contingent consideration at its preliminary estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. The current portion\nof contingent consideration is recorded within accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and the long-term portion is\nrecorded within other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of contingent consideration is\nremeasured each reporting period. Measurement period adjustments, if any, to the preliminary estimated fair value as of the\nacquisition date will be recorded to goodwill. Changes in fair value as a result of updated assumptions after the acquisition date\nwill be recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when or as we satisfy our performance obligations by transferring control of the promised products\nor services to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those\nproducts or services.\nAs a practical expedient, we do not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing\ncomponent, as the period between our transfer of a promised product or service to a customer and when the customer pays for\nthat product or service is generally one year or less, with the exception of certain of our pay for performance products,\nincluding Premier Agent Flex and StreetEasy Experts, whereby we may not receive payment for services provided for up to two\nyears after control of the promised products or services is transferred to our customers. In these cases, however, because a\nsubstantial portion of the consideration is variable, we have concluded the contracts do not include a significant financing\ncomponent.\nWe do not disclose the transaction price related to remaining performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original\nexpected duration of one year or less or (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right\nto invoice for performance completed to date. The remaining duration over which we satisfy our performance obligations is\ngenerally less than one year.\nWe disaggregate our revenue into the following categories: Residential, Rentals, Mortgages and Other, described below.\nResidential. Residential revenue includes revenue generated by our Premier Agent and new construction marketplaces, as\nwell as revenue from the sale of advertising and business technology solutions for real estate professionals through StreetEasy\nfor-sale product offerings, ShowingTime+, and upon acquisition on December 8, 2023, Follow Up Boss.\nOur Premier Agent program offers a suite of marketing and technology products and services to help real estate agents\nand brokers achieve their advertising goals while growing and managing their businesses and brands. All Premier Agent\npartners receive access to a dashboard portal on our mobile application and website that provides individualized program\nperformance analytics, our customer relationship management tool that captures detailed information about each contact made\nwith a Premier Agent partner through our mobile and web platforms and our account management tools. The marketing and\nbusiness technology products and services promised to Premier Agent partners are delivered over time, as the customer\nsimultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of the performance obligations.\nPremier Agent advertising products, which include the delivery of validated customer connections, or leads, are offered\non a share of voice (“market-based pricing”) and pay for performance basis. For our market-based pricing products and\nservices, payment is received prior to the delivery of connections. Connections are delivered when consumer contact\ninformation is provided to Premier Agent partners. We do not promise any minimum or maximum number of connections to\ncustomers, but instead control when and how many connections to deliver based on a customer’s share of voice. We determine\nthe number of connections to deliver to Premier Agent partners in each zip code using a market-based pricing method in\nconsideration of the total amount spent by Premier Agent partners to purchase connections in the zip code during the month.\n84\nThis results in the delivery of connections over time in proportion to each Premier Agent partners’ share of voice. A Premier\nAgent partners’ share of voice in a zip code is determined by their proportional monthly prepaid spend in that zip code as a\npercentage of the total monthly prepaid spend of all Premier Agent partners in that zip code, and determines the proportion of\nconsumer connections a Premier Agent partner receives. The number of connections delivered for a given spend level is\ndynamic; as demand for advertising in a zip code increases or decreases, the number of connections delivered to a Premier\nAgent partner in that zip code decreases or increases accordingly.\nWe recognize revenue related to Premier Agent market-based pricing products and services based on the monthly prepaid\nspend recognized on a straight-line basis during the monthly billing period over which the products and services are provided.\nThis methodology best depicts how we satisfy our performance obligations to customers, as we continuously transfer control of\nthe performance obligations to the customer over time. Given a Premier Agent partner typically prepays their monthly spend\nand the monthly spend is refunded on a pro-rata basis upon cancellation of the contract by a customer, we have determined that\nPremier Agent market-based pricing contracts are effectively daily contracts, and each performance obligation is satisfied over\ntime as each day lapses. We have not allocated the transaction price to each performance obligation within our Premier Agent\nmarket-based pricing arrangements, as the amounts recognized would be the same irrespective of any allocation.\nOur pay for performance pricing model is called “Flex” and is available in certain markets to select partners. With the\nFlex model, Premier Agent partners are provided with validated leads at no initial cost and pay a performance advertising fee\nonly when a real estate transaction is closed with one of the leads, generally within two years. With this pricing model, the\ntransaction price represents variable consideration, as the amount to which we expect to be entitled varies based on the number\nof validated leads that convert into real estate transactions and the value of those transactions. We estimate variable\nconsideration and record revenue as performance obligations, or validated leads, are transferred. We do not believe that a\nsignificant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will occur once the uncertainty related to the number of\ntransactions closed is subsequently resolved. We record a contract asset for our estimate of the consideration to which we will\nbe entitled when the right to the consideration is conditional. When the right to consideration becomes unconditional, upon the\nclose of a real estate transaction, we reclassify amounts to accounts receivable.\nOur new construction marketing solutions allow home builders to showcase their available inventory to home shoppers.\nNew construction revenue primarily includes revenue generated by advertising sold to builders on a cost per residential\ncommunity basis whereby we recognize revenue on a straight-line basis during the contractual period over which the\ncommunities are advertised on our mobile applications and websites. New construction revenue also includes revenue\ngenerated on a cost per impression basis whereby we recognize revenue as impressions are delivered to users interacting with\nour mobile applications and websites, which is the amount for which we have the right to invoice. Consideration for new\nconstruction products is billed in arrears.\nStreetEasy for-sale revenue primarily consists of our StreetEasy Experts and StreetEasy subscription offerings.\nStreetEasy Experts is our pay for performance pricing model available in the New York City market for which agents and\nbrokers are provided with leads at no initial cost and pay a performance referral fee only when a real estate purchase transaction\nis closed with one of the leads. Under the StreetEasy Experts pricing model, the transaction price represents variable\nconsideration, as the amount to which we expect to be entitled varies based on the number of leads that convert into real estate\ntransactions and the value of those transactions. We estimate variable consideration based on the expected number of closed\ntransactions during the period. We do not believe that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized\nwill occur once the uncertainty related to the number of transactions closed is subsequently resolved. We record a\ncorresponding contract asset for the estimate of variable consideration for StreetEasy Experts when the right to the\nconsideration is conditional. When the right to consideration becomes unconditional upon the close of a real estate transaction,\nwe reclassify amounts to accounts receivable.\nRevenue generated through StreetEasy subscription offerings includes the sale of advertising and a suite of tools to\ndevelopers, property managers, agents and other market professionals. Revenue from StreetEasy subscription offerings is\ngenerated on a cost per property basis, based on the property size and product tier, and we recognize revenue on a straight-line\nbasis over the contractual listing period which aligns to our satisfaction of performance obligations.\n85\nRevenue generated through ShowingTime+ includes ShowingTime revenue, which is primarily generated by\nAppointment Center, a software-as-a-service and call center solution allowing real estate agents, brokerages and multiple listing\nservices to efficiently schedule real estate viewing appointments on behalf of their customers. Appointment Center revenue is\nprimarily billed in advance on a monthly basis and recognized ratably over the contract period which aligns to our satisfaction\nof performance obligations. ShowingTime+ revenue also includes our dotloop real estate transaction management software-as-\na-service solution. Dotloop revenue is primarily billed in advance on a monthly basis and revenue is recognized ratably over the\ncontract period which aligns to our satisfaction of performance obligations.\nRentals. Rentals revenue includes the sale of advertising and a suite of tools to rental professionals, landlords and other\nmarket participants under the Zillow and StreetEasy brands. Rentals revenue includes revenue generated by advertising sold to\nproperty managers, landlords and other rental professionals on a cost per lead, lease, listing or impression basis or for a fixed\nfee for certain advertising packages. We recognize revenue as leads, clicks and impressions are provided to rental professionals,\nor as rental listings are published on our mobile applications and websites, which is the amount for which we have the right to\ninvoice. We recognize revenue related to our fixed fee rentals product on a straight-line basis over the contract term as the\nperformance obligations, rental listings on our mobile applications and websites, are satisfied over time. The number of leases\ngenerated through our rentals pay per lease product, Zillow Lease Connect, during the period is accounted for as variable\nconsideration, and we estimate the amount of variable consideration based on the expected number of qualified leases secured\nduring the period. We do not believe that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will occur once\nthe uncertainty related to the number of leases secured is subsequently resolved. We record a contract asset for the estimate of\nvariable consideration for Zillow Lease Connect when the right to the consideration is conditional. When the right to\nconsideration becomes unconditional upon the execution of a lease, we reclassify amounts to accounts receivable. Rentals\nrevenue also includes revenue generated from our rental applications product, through which potential renters can submit\napplications to multiple properties for a flat service fee. We recognize revenue for the rental applications product on a straight-\nline basis during the contractual period over which the customer has the right to access and submit the rental application.\nMortgages. Mortgages revenue primarily includes revenue generated by Zillow Home Loans, our affiliated mortgage\nlender, and marketing products sold to mortgage professionals on a cost per lead basis, including our Custom Quote and\nConnect services.\nMortgage origination revenue reflects origination fees on purchase or refinance mortgages and the corresponding sale, or\nexpected future sale, of a loan. When an IRLC is made to a customer, we record the expected gain on sale of the mortgage, plus\nthe estimated earnings from the expected sale of the associated servicing rights, adjusted for a pull-through percentage (which is\ndefined as the likelihood that an IRLC will be originated), as revenue. Revenue from loan origination fees is recognized at the\ntime the related purchase or refinance transactions are completed, usually upon the close of escrow and when we fund the\npurchase or refinance mortgage loans. Once funded, mortgage loans held for sale are recorded at fair value based on either sale\ncommitments or current market quotes and are adjusted for subsequent changes in fair value until the loan is sold. Origination\ncosts associated with originating mortgage loans are recognized as incurred. We sell substantially all of the mortgages we\noriginate and the related servicing rights to third-party purchasers.\nMortgage loans are sold with limited recourse provisions, which can result in repurchases of loans previously sold to\ninvestors or payments to reimburse investors for loan losses. Based on historical experience, discussions with our mortgage\npurchasers, analysis of the volume of mortgages we originated and current housing and credit market conditions, we estimate\nand record a loss reserve for mortgage loans held for sale, as well as known and projected mortgage loan repurchase requests.\nThese have historically not been significant to our financial statements.\nZillow Group operates Custom Quote and Connect through its wholly owned subsidiary, Zillow Group Marketplace, Inc.,\na licensed mortgage broker. For our Connect and Custom Quote cost per lead marketing products, participating qualified\nmortgage professionals typically make a prepayment to gain access to consumers interested in connecting with mortgage\nprofessionals. Mortgage professionals who exhaust their initial prepayment prepay additional funds to continue to participate in\nthe marketplace. In Zillow Group’s Connect platform, consumers answer a series of questions to find a local lender, and\nmortgage professionals receive consumer contact information, or leads, when the consumer chooses to share their information\nwith a lender. Consumers who request rates for mortgage loans in Custom Quotes are presented with customized quotes from\n86\nparticipating mortgage professionals. For our cost per lead mortgages products, we recognize revenue when a user contacts a\nmortgage professional through our mortgages platform, which is the amount for which we have the right to invoice.\nOther. Other revenue primarily includes revenue generated from display products, which consist of graphical mobile and\nweb advertising sold on a cost per thousand impressions or cost per click basis to advertisers promoting their brands on our\nmobile applications and websites. We recognize display revenue as clicks occur or as impressions are delivered to users\ninteracting with our mobile applications or websites, which is the amount for which we have the right to invoice.\nThere were no customers that generated 10% or more of our total revenue in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 or\n2021.\nCost of Revenue. Cost of revenue consists of expenses related to operating our mobile applications and websites,\nincluding associated headcount-related expenses, such as salaries, benefits, bonuses and share-based compensation expense, as\nwell as revenue-sharing costs related to our commercial business relationships, depreciation expense, and costs associated with\nhosting our mobile applications and websites. Cost of revenue also includes amortization costs related to capitalized website\nand development activities, amortization of software, amortization of certain intangible assets and other costs to obtain data\nused to populate our mobile applications and websites, and amortization of certain intangible assets recorded in connection with\nacquisitions, including developed technology. Cost of revenue also includes credit card fees and ad serving costs paid to third\nparties, direct costs to provide our rental applications product, and direct costs to originate loans, including underwriting and\nprocessing costs.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist of advertising costs and other sales expenses related to\npromotional and marketing activities, headcount-related expenses, including salaries, commissions, benefits, bonuses and share-\nbased compensation expense for sales, sales support, customer support, including the customer connections team and mortgage\nloan officers and specialists, marketing and public relations employees, depreciation expense and amortization of certain\nintangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions, including trade names and trademarks and customer relationships.\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, expenses\nattributable to advertising totaled $137 million, $144 million and $206 million, respectively.\nTechnology and Development. Technology and development expenses consist of headcount-related expenses, including\nsalaries, benefits, bonuses and share-based compensation expense for individuals engaged in the design, development and\ntesting of our products, mobile applications and websites and the tools and applications that support our products. Technology\nand development expenses also include equipment and software maintenance costs and depreciation expense.\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred and are recorded in technology and development expenses. For\nthe years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, expenses attributable to research and development for our business totaled\n$545 million, $495 million and $358 million, respectively.\nShare-Based Compensation. We measure compensation expense for all share-based awards at fair value on the date of\ngrant and recognize compensation expense over the service period on a straight-line basis for awards expected to vest.\nWe use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to determine the fair value for option awards. In valuing our\noption awards, we make assumptions about risk-free interest rates, dividend yields, volatility and weighted-average expected\nlives. We account for forfeitures as they occur. Risk-free interest rates are derived from U.S. Treasury securities as of the option\naward grant date. Expected dividend yield is based on our historical cash dividend payments, which have been zero to date. The\nexpected volatility for our Class C capital stock is estimated using our historical volatility. The weighted-average expected life\nof the option awards is estimated based on our historical exercise data.\nWhen determining the grant date fair value of share-based awards, management considers whether an adjustment is\nrequired to the observable market price or volatility of the Company’s Class C capital stock used in the valuation as a result of\nmaterial non-public information.\nFor issuances of restricted stock units, we determine the fair value of the award based on the market value of our Class C\n87\ncapital stock, as applicable, at the date of grant.\nImpairment and Restructuring Costs. From time to time, we record impairment costs within impairment and restructuring\ncosts in our consolidated statements of operations. See Note 10 for additional information on the impairment costs recorded\nduring the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe main components of our restructuring costs recorded within impairment and restructuring costs in our consolidated\nstatements of operations relate to employee termination costs, contract termination costs, and charges attributable to the wind\ndown of Zillow Offers operations and additional cost actions to streamline our operations and prioritize investments. One-time\nemployee termination benefits are recognized when the plan of termination has been communicated to employees and certain\nother criteria are met. Other severance and employee costs, primarily pertaining to ongoing employee benefit arrangements, are\nrecognized when it is probable that the employees are entitled to the severance benefits and the amounts can be reasonably\nestimated. Contract termination costs are recognized when a contract is terminated in accordance with its terms or at the cease-\nuse date. Asset write-offs are recognized upon their cease-use date. The cumulative effect of a change resulting from a revision\nto either the timing or the amount of estimated cash flows for restructuring is recognized as an adjustment to the liability in the\nperiod of the change.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability approach for accounting and reporting income taxes, which requires the recognition of\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial\nstatement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the applicable enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance against deferred tax\nassets would be established if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than\n50%) that some or all of the deferred tax assets are not expected to be realized.\nWe establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes\nwill be due. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, new tax\nlegislation or the change of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts\nrecorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. Interest\nand penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as income tax expense.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued guidance to improve existing measurement and disclosure requirements for equity\nsecurities that are subject to a contractual sale restriction. This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning\nafter December 15, 2023 on a prospective basis, with early adoption permitted. We expect to adopt this guidance on January 1,\n2024, and we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial position, results of\noperations or cash flows.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued guidance to improve existing disclosure requirements for segment reporting,\nprimarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses and new disclosures requirements applicable to\nentities with a single reportable segment. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and\ninterim periods beginning after December 15, 2024, on a retrospective basis. We expect to adopt this guidance for the annual\nperiod ending December 31, 2024 and have not yet determined the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued guidance to enhance the income tax rate reconciliation disclosure requirements and\nto provide clarity on disclosure requirements for income taxes. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024, and can be applied on a prospective or retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted. We expect to\nadopt this guidance for the annual period ending December 31, 2024 using the retrospective approach and have not yet\ndetermined the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.\n88\nNote 3. Discontinued Operations\nZillow Offers Wind Down\nIn November 2021, the Board of Directors of Zillow Group (the “Board”) made the determination to wind down Zillow\nOffers operations. This decision was made in light of home pricing unpredictability, capacity constraints and other operational\nchallenges faced by Zillow Offers that were exacerbated by an unprecedented housing market, a global pandemic and a difficult\nlabor and supply chain environment, all of which led us to conclude that, despite its initial promise in earlier quarters, Zillow\nOffers was unlikely to be a sufficiently stable line of business to meet our goals going forward.\nThe wind down of Zillow Offers was completed in the third quarter of 2022, at which time Zillow Offers met the criteria\nfor discontinued operations. Accordingly, we have presented the results of operations, excluding allocation of any general\ncorporate expenses, of Zillow Offers as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021. No assets or liabilities were classified as discontinued operations as of December 31, 2022.\nThe following table presents the major classes of line items of the discontinued operations included in the consolidated\nstatements of operations for the periods presented (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2021\nRevenue $ 4,249 $ 6,015\nCost of revenue 4,023 6,071\nGross profit (loss) 226 (56)\nOperating expenses:\nSales and marketing 153 361\nTechnology and development 6 53\nGeneral and administrative 10 35\nImpairment and restructuring costs 25 62\nTotal operating expenses 194 511\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations 32 (567)\nLoss on extinguishment of debt (21) —\nOther income, net 13 3\nInterest expense (36) (64)\nLoss from discontinued operations before income taxes (12) (628)\nIncome tax expense (1) (2)\nNet loss from discontinued operations $ (13) $ (630)\nNet loss from discontinued operations per share:\nBasic $ (0.05) $ (2.52)\nDiluted $ (0.05) $ (2.41)\nThe following table presents significant non-cash items and capital expenditures of the discontinued operations for the\nperiods presented (in millions):\n89\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2021\nAmortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs $ 21 $ 11\nLoss on debt extinguishment 21 —\nShare-based compensation 16 40\nInventory valuation adjustment 9 408\nDepreciation and amortization 7 10\nCapital expenditures 1 6\nIssuance (settlement) of beneficial interests in securitizations (79) 63\nRestructuring\nRestructuring costs totaled $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and were primarily related to the Zillow\nOffers wind down. Cumulative restructuring charges attributable to continuing operations as of December 31, 2022 totaled\n$33 million.\nNote 4. Fair Value Measurements\nWe apply fair value measurements on a recurring and, as otherwise required, on a nonrecurring basis. Accounting\nstandards define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the\nprincipal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The\nstandards also establish a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize\nthe use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair\nvalue:\n• Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n• Level 2 — Assets and liabilities valued based on observable market data for similar instruments, such as quoted prices\nfor similar assets or liabilities.\n• Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity; instruments valued based on the best\navailable data, some of which is internally developed, and considers risk premiums that a market participant would\nrequire.\nWe apply the following methods and assumptions in estimating our fair value measurements:\nCash equivalents — The fair value measurement of money market funds is based on quoted market prices in active\nmarkets (Level 1). The fair value measurement of other cash equivalents is based on observable market-based inputs principally\nderived from or corroborated by observable market data (Level 2).\nShort-term investments — The fair value measurement of our short-term investments is based on observable market-\nbased inputs or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means\n(Level 2).\nMortgage loans held for sale — The fair value of mortgage loans held for sale is generally calculated by reference to\nquoted prices in secondary markets for commitments to sell mortgage loans with similar characteristics (Level 2).\nForward contracts — The fair value of mandatory loan sales commitments and derivative instruments such as forward\nsales of mortgage-backed securities that are utilized as economic hedging instruments is calculated by reference to quoted\nprices for similar assets (Level 2).\n90\nContingent consideration — In December 2023, Zillow Group acquired Enchant, LLC (“Follow Up Boss”), a customer\nrelationship management system for real estate professionals, for $399 million in cash, net of cash acquired, and contingent\nconsideration of up to $100 million, payable over a three-year period upon achievement of certain performance metrics. The\nfair value of the contingent consideration is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation which considers the probabilities of the\nachievement of certain performance metrics (Level 3).\nAs of the acquisition date of Follow Up Boss, our preliminarily estimated fair value of the contingent consideration was\napproximately $81 million. There were no material changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration between the\nacquisition date and December 31, 2023. See Note 7 for additional details on our contingent consideration and measurement\nperiod adjustments.\nThe discount rates used in our valuation of contingent consideration are based on our estimated cost of debt and are\ndirectly related to the fair value of contingent consideration. An increase in the discount rate, in isolation, would result in a\ndecrease in the fair value measurement. Conversely, a decrease in the discount rate, in isolation, would result in an increase in\nthe fair value measurement. The probabilities of achieving the relevant performance metrics used in our valuation of contingent\nconsideration are directly related to the fair value of contingent consideration, as an increase in the probability, in isolation,\nwould result in an increase in the fair value measurement. Conversely, a decrease in the probability, in isolation, would result in\na decrease in the fair value measurement.\nThe following table presents the range and weighted average unobservable inputs used in determining the fair value of\ncontingent consideration as of December 31, 2023:\nProbability of Achieving Performance\nDiscount Rate Metrics\nRange 6.58% - 7.13% 88% - 97%\nWeighted average 6.88% 93%\nInterest rate lock commitments — The fair value of IRLCs is calculated by reference to quoted prices in secondary\nmarkets for commitments to sell mortgage loans with similar characteristics. Expired commitments are excluded from the fair\nvalue measurement. Since not all IRLCs will become closed loans, we adjust our fair value measurements for the estimated\namount of IRLCs that will not close. This adjustment is effected through the pull-through rate, which represents the probability\nthat an IRLC will ultimately result in a closed loan. For IRLCs that are cancelled or expire, any recorded gain or loss is reversed\nat the end of the commitment period (Level 3).\nThe pull-through rate is based on estimated changes in market conditions, loan stage and historical borrower behavior.\nPull-through rates are directly related to the fair value of IRLCs, as an increase in the pull-through rate, in isolation, would\nresult in an increase in the fair value measurement. Conversely, a decrease in the pull-through rate, in isolation, would result in\na decrease in the fair value measurement. Changes in the fair value of IRLCs are included within revenue in our consolidated\nstatements of operations. The following table presents the range and weighted average pull-through rates used in determining\nthe fair value of IRLCs as of the dates presented:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nRange 45% - 100% 47% - 100%\nWeighted average 85% 87%\nThe following tables present the balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, by level\nwithin the fair value hierarchy, as of the dates presented (in millions):\n91\nDecember 31, 2023\nTotal Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market funds $ 1,440 $ 1,440 $ — $ —\nU.S. government treasury securities 2 — 2 —\nShort-term investments:\nU.S. government treasury securities 1,143 — 1,143 —\nCorporate bonds 161 — 161 —\nU.S. government agency securities 14 — 14 —\nMortgage origination-related:\nMortgage loans held for sale 100 — 100 —\nIRLCs - other current assets 3 — 3\nTotal assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis $ 2,863 $ 1,440 $ 1,420 $ 3\nLiabilities\nMortgage origination-related:\nForward contracts - accrued expenses and other\ncurrent liabilities 1 1\nContingent consideration:\nContingent consideration - accrued expenses and\nother current liabilities 30 — — 30\nContingent consideration - other long-term liabilities 51 — — 51\nTotal liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis $ 82 $ — $ 1 $ 81\nDecember 31, 2022\nTotal Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market funds $ 1,338 $ 1,338 $ — $ —\nShort-term investments:\nU.S. government treasury securities 1,716 — 1,716 —\nCorporate bonds 161 — 161 —\nCommercial paper 10 — 10 —\nU.S. government agency securities 9 9\nMortgage origination-related:\nMortgage loans held for sale 41 — 41 —\nForward contracts - other current assets 1 — 1 —\nTotal assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis $ 3,276 $ 1,338 $ 1,938 $ —\nThe following table presents the notional amounts of the economic hedging instruments related to our mortgage loans\nheld for sale as of the dates presented (in millions):\n92\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nIRLCs $ 167 $ 62\nForward contracts(1) $ 218 $ 90\n(1) Represents net notional amounts.

Amortization expense for website development costs included in cost of\nrevenue was $110 million, $67 million and $36 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nNote 7. Acquisitions\nAcquisition of Follow Up Boss\nOn December 8, 2023, Zillow Group acquired Follow Up Boss, a customer relationship management system for real\nestate professionals, for $399 million in cash, net of cash acquired, and contingent consideration of up to $100 million in cash,\npayable over a three-year period upon achievement of certain performance metrics. See Note 4 for additional information\nregarding the preliminary fair value of contingent consideration. The acquisition is consistent with our strategy to invest in a\nmore integrated software experience for our customers. The acquisition of Follow Up Boss has been accounted for as a business\ncombination, and assets acquired and liabilities assumed were generally recorded at their preliminary estimated fair values, in\naccordance with the applicable accounting guidance. Goodwill represents the expected synergies from combining the acquired\nassets and the operations of the acquirer as well as intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. Goodwill\nrecorded in connection with the acquisition is deductible for tax purposes.\nThe total preliminary purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including\nidentifiable intangible assets, based on their preliminarily estimated fair values at the acquisition date, as follows (in millions):\n94\nPreliminary purchase price:\nCash $ 403\nContingent consideration 81\nTotal preliminary purchase price $ 484\nIdentifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 4\nGoodwill 401\nIntangible assets 86\nOther assets 1\nDeferred revenue (7)\nOther liabilities (1)\nTotal preliminary purchase price $ 484\nThe preliminary estimated fair value of the identifiable intangible assets acquired and associated useful lives consisted of\nthe following (in millions):\nEstimated Weighted-\nPreliminary Average Useful Life\nEstimated Fair Value (in years)\nDeveloped technology $ 50 4\nCustomer relationships 34 7\nTrade names and trademarks 2 7\nTotal $ 86\nEstimated fair values of the identifiable intangible assets acquired were determined by management, based in part on a\npreliminary valuation performed by an independent third-party valuation specialist. We used an income approach to measure\nthe fair value of the customer relationships intangible asset acquired based on the excess earnings method, whereby the fair\nvalue is estimated based upon the present value of cash flows that the applicable asset is expected to generate. We used an\nincome approach to measure the fair value of the developed technology and trade names and trademarks based on the relief-\nfrom-royalty method. These fair value measurements were based on Level 3 inputs under the fair value hierarchy.\nThe purchase price allocation for the Follow Up Boss acquisition is preliminary, primarily due to the limited amount of\ntime between the acquisition closing date and December 31, 2023. We made an initial allocation of the purchase price at the\ndate of the acquisition based upon information available and our understanding of the estimates used to determine the\npreliminary fair value of acquired assets, assumed liabilities and contingent consideration. We are in the process of specifically\nidentifying the amounts assigned to certain tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, identifiable intangible assets and\ncontingent consideration. As of December 31, 2023, the measurement period (not to extend beyond one year) is open for the\nFollow Up Boss acquisition; therefore, assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and contingent consideration may be subject to\nrevision as additional information is obtained which may result in adjustments to the preliminary estimated fair values until the\nend of the measurement period.\nAcquisition-related costs incurred, which primarily included legal, accounting and other external costs directly related to\nthe acquisition, are included within acquisition-related costs in our consolidated statements of operations and were expensed as\nincurred.\nUnaudited pro forma revenue and earnings information has not been presented as the effects were not material to our\nconsolidated financial statements.\n95\nAcquisitions of Aryeo and Spruce\nOn July 31, 2023, Zillow Group acquired Aryeo, Inc. (“Aryeo”), a software company that serves real estate\nphotographers, in exchange for approximately $15 million in cash, net of cash acquired, and 380,259 shares of our Class C\ncapital stock with a value of $20 million, for total consideration of $35 million, net of cash acquired. On September 11, 2023,\nZillow Group acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Spruce Holdings, Inc. and certain affiliated entities\n(collectively referred to as “Spruce”), a tech-enabled title and escrow platform, in exchange for approximately $19 million in\ncash, net of cash acquired.\nThe acquisitions of Aryeo and Spruce have been accounted for as business combinations, and assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed were recorded at their preliminary estimated fair values. Goodwill represents the expected synergies from\ncombining the acquired assets and the operations of the acquirer as well as intangible assets that do not qualify for separate\nrecognition. Goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of Aryeo is not deductible for tax purposes, and goodwill\nrecorded in connection with the acquisition of Spruce is deductible for tax purposes.\nThe total preliminary purchase prices have been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including\nidentifiable intangible assets, based on their respective fair values at the acquisition date, as follows (in millions):\nAryeo Spruce\nCash and cash equivalents $ 3 $ 5\nGoodwill 26 16\nIntangible assets 11 2\nOther assets — 2\nLiabilities (2) (1)\nTotal preliminary purchase price $ 38 $ 24\nThe preliminary estimated fair value of the identifiable intangible assets acquired and associated useful lives consisted of\nthe following (in millions):\nAryeo Spruce\nPreliminary Estimated Useful Preliminary Estimated Useful\nEstimated Fair Value Life (in years) Estimated Fair Value Life (in years)\nCustomer relationships $ 5 5 $ — —\nPurchased content 4 3 — —\nDeveloped technology 2 3 2 3\nTotal $ 11 $ 2\nWe used an income approach to measure the fair value of the customer relationships intangible asset acquired from Aryeo\nbased on the excess earnings method, whereby the fair value is estimated based upon the present value of cash flows that the\napplicable asset is expected to generate. We used a cost approach to measure the fair value of purchased content acquired from\nAryeo. We used an income approach to measure the fair value of the developed technology acquired from Aryeo and Spruce\nbased on the relief-from-royalty method. These fair value measurements were based on Level 3 inputs under the fair value\nhierarchy.\nThe purchase price allocation for the Aryeo and Spruce acquisitions is preliminary. We made an initial allocation of the\npurchase prices at the date of the acquisition based upon our understanding of the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed\nliabilities based on information currently available. As of December 31, 2023, the measurement period (not to extend one year)\nis open for the Aryeo and Spruce acquisition; therefore, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are subject to adjustment\nuntil the end of the measurement period.\n96\nAggregate acquisition-related costs for the acquisitions of Follow Up Boss, Aryeo, and Spruce were not material to our\nfinancial statements.\nUnaudited pro forma revenue and earnings information related to the acquisitions has not been presented as the aggregate\neffects of the acquisitions of Follow Up Boss, Aryeo and Spruce were not material to our consolidated financial statements.\nNote 8.

For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we\nrecognized $10 million, $10 million and $7 million, respectively, of sublease income. For the year ended December 31, 2023,\nwe recognized impairment costs of $16 million within impairments and restructuring costs in our consolidated statements of\noperations associated with changes in the use of certain office spaces, primarily related to subleases where anticipated sublease\nincome was less than the carrying value of the related asset group.\nTotal lease costs associated with short-term leases were not material for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and\n2021. Other information related to operating leases was as follows for the periods presented (in millions, except for years and\npercentages):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023(1) 2022 2021(2)\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating\nlease liabilities, net of lease incentives of $—, $9 and $— for the\nyears ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively $ 42 $ 34 $ 43\nRight of use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease\nobligations $ (8) $ 19 $ (36)\nWeighted average remaining lease term for operating leases 6 years 7 years 7 years\nWeighted average discount rate for operating leases 9.4 % 8.2 % 7.2 %\n(1) During the year ended December 31, 2023, we amended our existing office space lease for our corporate headquarters in\nSeattle, Washington, to provide the landlord the option to terminate a portion of our lease prior to the original lease\ntermination date. In December 2023, the landlord exercised the early termination option for the relevant floors effective June\n30, 2024. This modification to the lease term resulted in an immediate reduction in the right of use asset and lease liability of\n$8 million. We ceased use of the terminated space as of December 31, 2023, and as a result, we accelerated recognition of $14\nmillion of amortization for the related right of use asset during the year ended December 31, 2023.\n98\n(2) During the year ended December 31, 2021, we amended our existing office space lease for our corporate headquarters in\nSeattle, Washington, whereby the renewal options for certain existing office space which we had previously included in the\nmeasurement of the lease liability and right of use asset were removed and we partially terminated our lease early for certain\nexisting office space, resulting in a reduction of the related lease liability and right of use asset of approximately $44 million\nand $42 million, respectively.

The master repurchase agreements\nprovide short-term financing between the issuance of a mortgage loan and when Zillow Home Loans sells the loan to an\ninvestor or directly to an agency. The carrying amounts of our master repurchase agreements approximate their fair values\nbecause of their short-term nature.

No other material changes were made to the master repurchase\nagreement in connection with the reassignment.\nOn June 1, 2023, Zillow Home Loans entered into a master repurchase agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\n(“JPMC”). The master repurchase agreement provides a total maximum borrowing capacity of $100 million, $25 million of\nwhich is committed, until May 30, 2024.(cid:3)\nOn October 11, 2023, Zillow Home Loans entered into a master repurchase agreement with UBS AG. The master\nrepurchase agreement provides a total maximum borrowing capacity of $100 million through October 9, 2024.\nIn accordance with the master repurchase agreements, Atlas, JPMC, UBS AG, and prior to its expiration in June 2023,\nCitibank, N.A. (together the “Lenders”), have agreed to pay Zillow Home Loans a negotiated purchase price for eligible loans,\nand Zillow Home Loans has simultaneously agreed to repurchase such loans from the Lenders under a specified timeframe at\nan agreed upon price that includes interest. The master repurchase agreements contain margin call provisions that provide the\nLenders with certain rights in the event of a decline in the market value of the assets purchased under the master repurchase\nagreements. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, $99 million and $28 million, respectively, in mortgage loans held for sale were\npledged as collateral under the master repurchase agreements.\nBorrowings on the master repurchase agreements bear interest at a floating rate based on Secured Overnight Financing\nRate plus an applicable margin, as defined by the governing agreements. Borrowings on the warehouse line of credit, prior to its\ntermination on November 28, 2023, bore interest at a floating rate based on Bloomberg Short-Term Yield Index Rate plus an\napplicable margin, as defined by the governing agreement. The master repurchase agreements include customary\nrepresentations and warranties, covenants and provisions regarding events of default. As of December 31, 2023, Zillow Home\nLoans was in compliance with all financial covenants and no event of default had occurred. The repurchase agreements are\nrecourse to Zillow Home Loans, and have no recourse to Zillow Group or any of its other subsidiaries.(cid:3)\nConvertible Senior Notes\nPrior to the adoption of new accounting guidance on January 1, 2022, we accounted for the issuance of convertible senior\nnotes by separating them into their liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component for each of\nthe convertible senior notes was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated\nconvertible feature. The carrying amount of the equity component, representing the conversion option, was determined by\ndeducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the convertible senior notes. The difference between\nthe principal amounts and the liability components represented the respective debt discounts, which were recorded as a direct\ndeduction from the related debt liability in the consolidated balance sheets and amortized to interest expense using the effective\ninterest method over the term of the convertible senior notes. The equity components of the convertible senior notes, net of\nissuance costs, were included in additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheets and were not remeasured as long\nas they continued to meet the conditions for equity classification. Upon adoption of the new accounting guidance, we de-\nrecognized the equity components of the convertible senior notes and the respective debt discounts through a decrease to\nadditional paid-in capital, an increase to long-term debt and a cumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated deficit of\n$156 million.(cid:3)\n101\nThe following tables summarize certain details related to our outstanding convertible senior notes as of the dates\npresented or for the periods ended (in millions, except interest rates):\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nUnamortized\nSemi-Annual Debt Discount\nAggregate Interest Unamortized and Debt\nPrincipal Stated Effective First Interest Payment Debt Issuance Issuance\nMaturity Date Amount Interest Rate Interest Rate Payment Date Dates Costs Fair Value Costs Fair Value\nSeptember 1, March 1;\n2026 $ 499 1.375 % 1.57 % March 1, 2020 September 1 $ 3 $ 681 $ 4 $ 504\nNovember 15, May 15;\nMay 15, 2025 507 2.75 % 3.20 % 2020 November 15 3 560 5 531\nSeptember 1, March 1;\n2024 608 0.75 % 1.02 % March 1, 2020 September 1 1 825 3 629\nTotal $ 1,614 $ 7 $ 2,066 $ 12 $ 1,664\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 Year Ended December 31, 2022 Year Ended December 31, 2021\nAmortization Amortization\nContractual Amortization Contractual of Debt Contractual Amortization of Debt\nCoupon of Debt Interest Coupon Issuance Interest Coupon of Debt Issuance Interest\nMaturity Date Interest Issuance Costs Expense Interest Costs Expense Interest Discount Costs Expense\nSeptember 1, 2026 $ 7 $ 1 $ 8 $ 7 $ — $ 7 $ 7 $ 22 $ 1 $ 30\nMay 15, 2025 16 2 18 16 3 19 16 27 1 44\nSeptember 1, 2024 5 2 7 4 2 6 4 32 1 37\nJuly 1, 2023 — — — — — — 3 8 1 12\nTotal $ 28 $ 5 $ 33 $ 27 $ 5 $ 32 $ 30 $ 89 $ 4 $ 123\nThe convertible notes maturing in 2026 (“2026 Notes”), 2025 (“2025 Notes”) and 2024 (“2024 Notes”) (together, the\n“Notes”) are senior unsecured obligations. The 2026 Notes and 2025 Notes are classified as long-term debt and the 2024 Notes\nare classified as current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets based on their contractual maturity dates. Interest on the\nconvertible notes is paid semi-annually in arrears. The estimated fair value of the convertible senior notes is classified as Level\n2 and was determined through consideration of quoted market prices in markets that are not active.\nThe following table summarizes the conversion and redemption options with respect to the Notes:\nEarly Conversion Optional\nMaturity Date Date Conversion Rate Conversion Price Redemption Date\nSeptember 1, 2026 March 1, 2026 22.9830 $ 43.51 September 5, 2023\nMay 15, 2025 November 15, 2024 14.8810 67.20 May 22, 2023\nSeptember 1, 2024 March 1, 2024 22.9830 43.51 September 5, 2022\nPrior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the applicable Early Conversion Date, the Notes\nwill be convertible at the option of the holders only under certain conditions. On or after the applicable Early Conversion Date,\nuntil the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the applicable Maturity Date, holders\nmay convert the Notes at their option at the applicable Conversion Rate then in effect, irrespective of these conditions. We will\nsettle conversions of the Notes by paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of Class C capital stock, or a\ncombination of cash and shares of Class C capital stock, at its election. The applicable Conversion Rate for each series of Notes\nwill initially be the conversion rate of shares of Class C capital stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes (equivalent to an\ninitial Conversion Price per share of Class C capital stock). The applicable Conversion Rate and the corresponding initial\nConversion Price will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. We\nmay redeem for cash all or part of the respective series of Notes, at our option, on or after the applicable Optional Redemption\nDate, under certain circumstances, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed,\nplus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date (as defined in the indentures governing the Notes). We\nmay not redeem a series of Notes prior to the applicable Optional Redemption Date. We may redeem for cash all or any portion\n102\nof a series of Notes, at our option, in whole or in part on or after the applicable Optional Redemption Date if the last reported\nsale price per share of our Class C capital stock has been at least 130% of the Conversion Price then in effect for at least 20\ntrading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period. The conversion option does not meet\nthe criteria for separate accounting as a derivative as it is indexed to our own stock.\nThe last reported sale price of our Class C capital stock did not exceed 130% of the conversion price of each series of the\nNotes for more than 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended December 31, 2023. Accordingly, each series\nof the Notes is not redeemable or convertible at the option of the holders during the three months ending March 31, 2024.\nIf the we undergo a fundamental change (as defined in the indentures governing the Notes), holders may require us to\nrepurchase for cash all or part of a series of Notes, as applicable, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of\nthe notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date (as\ndefined in the indentures governing the Notes). In addition, if certain fundamental changes occur, we may be required, in\ncertain circumstances, to increase the conversion rate for any of the Notes converted in connection with such fundamental\nchanges by a specified number of shares of our Class C capital stock. Certain events are also considered “Events of Default,”\nwhich may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the Notes, as described in the indentures governing the Notes. There are\nno financial covenants associated with the Notes.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023 and in accordance with our repurchase authorizations, we repurchased\n$58 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes through open market transactions for $57 million in cash, including\naccrued interest, resulting in a gain on extinguishment of debt of $1 million recognized in our consolidated statements of\noperations. For additional information on the repurchase authorizations, see Note 13 under the subsection titled “Share\nRepurchase Authorizations.” There were no conversions or repurchases of convertible senior notes during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The following table summarizes the activity for our convertible senior notes for the period presented (in\nmillions, except for share amounts):\nYear Ended December 31, 2021\n2023 Notes 2024 Notes 2026 Notes Total\nAggregate principal amount settled $ 374 $ 65 $ 1 $ 440\nCash paid 1 — — 1\nShares of Class C capital stock issued 4,752 1,485 28 6,265\nTotal fair value of consideration transferred (1) $ 572 $ 200 $ 4 $ 776\n(Gain) loss on extinguishment of debt:\nConsideration allocated to the liability component (2) $ 349 $ 53 $ 1 $ 403\nCarrying value of the liability component, net of unamortized debt discount\nand debt issuance costs 334 51 1 386\n(Gain) loss on extinguishment of debt $ 15 $ 2 $ — $ 17\nConsideration allocated to the equity component $ 223 $ 147 $ 3 $ 373\n(1) For convertible senior notes converted by note holders, the total fair value of consideration transferred includes the value of shares\ntransferred to note holders using the daily volume weighted-average price of our Class C capital stock on the conversion date and an\nimmaterial amount of cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. For convertible senior notes redeemed, the total fair value of consideration\ntransferred comprises cash transferred to note holders to settle the related notes.\n(2) Consideration allocated to the liability component is based on the fair value of the liability component immediately prior to settlement,\nwhich was calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis with a market interest rate of a similar liability that does not have an associated\nconvertible feature.\n103\nThe following table summarizes certain details related to the capped call confirmations with respect to certain of the\nconvertible senior notes:\nMaturity Date Initial Cap Price Cap Price Premium\nSeptember 1, 2026 $ 80.5750 150 %\nSeptember 1, 2024 72.5175 125 %\nThe capped call confirmations are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution of our Class C capital stock in\nconnection with any conversion of the Notes and/or offset the cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the\nprincipal amount of such notes in the event that the market price of the Class C capital stock is greater than the strike price of\nthe capped call confirmations (which initially corresponds to the initial Conversion Price of such notes and is subject to certain\nadjustments under the terms of the capped call confirmations), with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap based on the\ncap price of the capped call confirmations. The capped call confirmations with respect to the 2026 Notes and the 2024 Notes\nhave an Initial Cap Price per share, which represents a premium (“Cap Price Premium”) over the relevant historical closing\nprice of the Company’s Class C capital stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, and is subject to certain adjustments under\nthe terms of the capped call confirmations. The capped call confirmations will cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments\nsubstantially similar to those applicable to the convertible senior notes, the number of shares of Class C capital stock that will\nunderlie such notes. The capped call confirmations do not meet the criteria for separate accounting as a derivative as they are\nindexed to our own stock. The capped call premiums paid have been included as a net reduction to additional paid-in capital\nwithin shareholders’ equity.\nNote 12. Income Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States (federal and state) and certain foreign jurisdictions. We recorded\nincome tax expense of $4 million and $3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively,\nprimarily due to state taxes. We recorded an income tax benefit of $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, comprised\nof a $3 million income tax benefit from a decrease in the valuation allowance associated with our September 2021 acquisition\nof ShowingTime, partially offset by $2 million of tax expense primarily due to state income taxes.\nThe following table presents the components of our income tax expense (benefit) for the periods presented (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nCurrent income tax expense\nState $ 4 $ 2 $ 2\nForeign — 1 —\nTotal current income tax expense 4 3 2\nDeferred income tax benefit:\nFederal — — (3)\nTotal deferred income tax benefit — — (3)\nTotal income tax expense (benefit) $ 4 $ 3 $ (1)\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate and our effective tax rate for the periods\npresented:\n104\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nTax expense at federal statutory rate (21.0) % (21.0) % (21.0) %\nState income taxes, net of federal tax benefit 2.6 6.2 8.7\nShare-based compensation 10.4 13.2 84.1\nNon-deductible executive compensation 10.8 14.3 (7.7)\nResearch and development credits (6.8) (25.7) 40.8\nOther (8.2) 8.2 (4.9)\nValuation allowance 15.0 7.4 (99.3)\nEffective tax rate 2.8 % 2.6 % 0.7 %\nDeferred federal, state and foreign income taxes reflect the net tax impact of temporary differences between the carrying\namounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts for tax purposes.

We have provided a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets as of December\n31, 2023 and 2022 because, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than\n50%) that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance increased by $22 million and\n105\n$97 million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nWe have accumulated federal net operating losses of approximately $1.4 billion and $1.8 billion, as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively, which are available to reduce future taxable income. We have accumulated state net operating\nlosses of approximately $56 million and $63 million (tax effected) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Federal net\noperating losses generated in taxable periods on or before December 31, 2017 have a twenty-year carryforward period and\nbegin to expire in 2036. Federal net operating loss carryforwards generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017\nmay be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such net operating loss carryforwards in taxable years beginning\nafter December 31, 2020 is limited to 80% of taxable income. State net operating loss carryforward periods for the various state\njurisdictions generally range from three years to indefinite-lived and begin to expire in 2024. Additionally, we have net research\nand development credit carryforwards of $166 million and $164 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which\nare available to reduce future tax liabilities. The research and development credit carryforwards begin to expire in 2025. Under\nSections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change”, the corporation’s ability\nto use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research and development\ncredits, to offset its post-change taxable income or income tax liability may be limited. In connection with our August 2013\npublic offering of our Class A common stock, we experienced an ownership change that triggered Sections 382 and 383, which\nmay limit our ability to utilize our net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards. In connection with our\nFebruary 2015 acquisition of Trulia, Trulia experienced an ownership change that triggered Section 382 and 383, which may\nlimit Zillow Group’s ability to utilize Trulia’s net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards.\nOur primary income tax jurisdiction is the United States (federal). With limited exceptions for state taxing authorities,\nwhich are not material to the financial statements, all tax years for which we have filed a tax return remain subject to\nexamination due to the existence of net operating loss carryforwards.\nChanges for unrecognized tax benefits for the periods presented are as follows (in millions):\nBalance at January 1, 2021 $ 49\nGross increases—current period tax positions 17\nGross increases—prior period tax positions 9\nBalance at December 31, 2021 $ 75\nGross increases—current period tax positions 17\nGross increases—prior period tax positions 4\nGross decreases—prior period tax positions (6)\nBalance at December 31, 2022 $ 90\nGross increases—current period tax positions 9\nGross increases—prior period tax positions 3\nGross decreases—prior period tax positions (7)\nBalance at December 31, 2023 $ 95\nAt December 31, 2023, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits of $95 million is recorded as a reduction to our\ndeferred tax asset when available. We do not anticipate that the amount of existing unrecognized tax benefits will significantly\nincrease or decrease within the next 12 months. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded\nas income tax expense and are not material.\nNote 13. Shareholders’ Equity\nPreferred Stock\nThe Board has the authority to fix and determine and to amend the number of shares of any series of preferred stock that\nis wholly unissued or to be established and to fix and determine and to amend the designation, preferences, voting powers and\n106\nlimitations and the relative, participating, optional or other rights, of any series of shares of preferred stock that is wholly\nunissued or to be established, subject in each case to certain approval rights of holders of our outstanding Class B common\nstock. There was no preferred stock issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022.\nCommon and Capital Stock\nOur Class A common stock has no preferences or privileges and is not redeemable. Holders of Class A common stock are\nentitled to one vote for each share.\nOur Class B common stock has no preferences or privileges and is not redeemable. At any time after the date of issuance,\neach share of Class B common stock, at the option of the holder, may be converted into one share of Class A common stock, or\nautomatically converted into Class A common stock upon the affirmative vote by or written consent of holders of a majority of\nthe shares of the Class B common stock. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, no shares of Class B\ncommon stock were converted into Class A common stock at the option of the holders. Holders of Class B common stock are\nentitled to 10 votes for each share.\nOur Class C capital stock has no preferences or privileges, is not redeemable and, except in limited circumstances, is non-\nvoting.\nEquity Distribution Agreement\nOn February 17, 2021, we entered into an equity distribution agreement with certain sales agents and/or principals (the\n“Managers”), pursuant to which we may offer and sell from time to time, through the Managers, shares of our Class C capital\nstock, having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $1.0 billion, in such share amounts as we may specify by notice to the\nManagers, in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the equity distribution agreement.\nThere were no shares issued under the equity distribution agreement during the years ended December 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022.\nShare Repurchase Authorizations\nPrior to the year ended December 31, 2023, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $1.8 billion of our Class A\ncommon stock, Class C capital stock, outstanding convertible senior notes or a combination thereof. On July 31, 2023, the\nBoard authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of our Class A common stock, Class C capital stock,\noutstanding convertible senior notes or a combination thereof. This additional authorization (together with the previous\nauthorizations, the “Repurchase Authorizations”) increased our total cumulative Repurchase Authorizations to $2.5 billion.\nRepurchases of stock under the Repurchase Authorizations may be made in open-market transactions or privately\nnegotiated transactions, or in such other manner as deemed appropriate by management, and may be made from time to time as\ndetermined by management depending on market conditions, share price, trading volume, cash needs and other business\nfactors, in each case as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. As of December 31, 2023, $770 million\nremained available for future repurchases pursuant to the Repurchase Authorizations.\nThe following table summarizes our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock repurchase activity under the\nRepurchase Authorizations for the periods presented (in millions, except share data which are presented in thousands, and per\nshare amounts):\n107\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nClass A common Class C capital Class A common Class C capital\nstock stock stock stock\nShares repurchased 2,212 7,311 4,052 18,161\nWeighted-average price per share $ 46.45 $ 43.94 $ 44.14 $ 42.30\nTotal purchase price $ 103 $ 321 $ 179 $ 768\nNote 14. Share-Based Awards\nZillow Group, Inc. 2020 Incentive Plan(cid:3)\nOn June 9, 2020, the Zillow Group, Inc. 2020 Incentive Plan (the “2020 Plan”) became effective, which replaces the\nZillow Group, Inc. Amended and Restated 2011 Incentive Plan (the “2011 Plan”), which became effective July 19, 2011.\nSubject to adjustment from time to time as provided in the 2020 Plan, a total of 12 million shares of Class C capital stock are\nauthorized for issuance under the 2020 Plan. In addition, shares previously available for new grants under the 2011 Plan as of\nJune 9, 2020 and shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2011 Plan as of June 9, 2020 that on or after that date cease to\nbe subject to such awards (other than by reason of exercise or settlement of the awards in vested or nonforfeitable shares) are\nalso available for issuance under the 2020 Plan. The number of shares authorized under the 2020 Plan will be increased on the\nfirst day of each calendar year, beginning January 1, 2021 and ending on and including January 1, 2030, by an amount equal to\nthe lesser of (a) 5% of our outstanding Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class C capital stock on a fully\ndiluted basis as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar year and (b) a number of shares determined by our Board.\nShares issued under the 2020 plan may be issued from authorized and unissued shares of Class C capital stock. The 2020 Plan\nis administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the “Compensation Committee”). Under the terms of the 2020\nPlan, the Compensation Committee may grant equity awards, including incentive or nonqualified stock options, restricted stock,\nrestricted stock units, restricted units, stock appreciation rights, performance shares or performance units to employees,\ndirectors and consultants of Zillow Group and its subsidiaries. The Board has also authorized certain senior executive officers\nto grant equity awards under the 2020 Plan, within limits prescribed by our Board.\nOptions under the 2020 Plan are granted with an exercise price per share not less than 100% of the fair market value of\nour Class C capital stock on the grant date, with the exception of substituted option awards granted in connection with\nacquisitions, and are exercisable at such times and under such conditions as determined by the Compensation Committee. Any\nportion of an option that is not vested and exercisable on the date of a participant’s termination of service expires on such date.\nEmployees generally forfeit their rights to exercise vested options three months following their termination of employment or\n12 months following termination by reason of death, disability or retirement. Options granted under the 2020 Plan expire no\nlater than ten years from the grant date and typically vest over a period of four years.\nRestricted stock units granted under the 2020 Plan typically vest over a period of four years. Generally, any portion of a\nrestricted stock unit that is not vested on the date of a participant’s termination of service expires on such date.\nIn addition to the option awards and restricted stock units typically granted under the Zillow Group, Inc. 2020 Incentive\nPlan (the “2020 Plan”) which vest quarterly over four years, during the first quarter of 2023, the Compensation Committee of\nthe Board approved option and restricted stock unit awards granted under the 2020 Plan in connection with the 2022 annual\nreview cycle that vest quarterly over three years. The exercisability terms of these equity awards are otherwise consistent with\nthe terms of the option awards and restricted stock units typically granted under the 2020 Plan.\nZillow Group, Inc. Amended and Restated 2011 Incentive Plan\nOptions and restricted stock units that remain outstanding under the 2011 Plan have vesting and exercisability terms\nconsistent with those described above for awards granted under the 2020 Plan.\n108\nZillow Group, Inc. 2019 Equity Inducement Plan\nOn August 8, 2019, the 2019 Equity Inducement Plan (“Inducement Plan”) became effective. Subject to adjustment from\ntime to time as provided in the Inducement Plan, 10 million shares of Class C capital stock are available for issuance under the\nInducement Plan. Shares issued under the Inducement Plan shall be drawn from authorized and unissued shares of Class C\ncapital stock. The purpose of the Inducement Plan is to attract, retain and motivate certain new employees of the Company and\nits subsidiaries by providing them the opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in the Company and to align their interests\nand efforts to the long-term interests of the Company’s shareholders. Each award under the Inducement Plan is intended to\nqualify as an employment inducement award pursuant to Listing Rule 5635(c) of the corporate governance rules of the\nNASDAQ Stock Market. The Inducement Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee. Under the terms of the\nInducement Plan, the Compensation Committee may grant equity awards, including nonqualified stock options, restricted stock\nor restricted stock units or restricted units to new employees of the Company and its subsidiaries.\nOptions under the Inducement Plan are granted with an exercise price per share not less than 100% of the fair market\nvalue of our Class C capital stock on the date of grant, with the exception of substituted option awards granted in connection\nwith acquisitions, and are exercisable at such times and under such conditions as determined by the Compensation Committee.\nAny portion of an option that is not vested and exercisable on the date of a participant’s termination of service generally expires\non such date. Employees generally forfeit their rights to exercise vested options three months following their termination of\nemployment or 12 months following termination by reason of death, disability or retirement. Options granted under the\nInducement Plan expire no later than ten years from the grant date and typically vest over a period of four years.\nRestricted stock units granted under the Inducement Plan typically vest over a period of four years. In general, any\nportion of a restricted stock unit that is not vested on the date of a participant’s termination of service expires on such date.\nOption Award Repricing\nOn August 3, 2022, upon recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board approved adjustments to the\nexercise price of certain outstanding vested and unvested option awards for eligible employees. The exercise price of eligible\noption awards was reduced to $38.78, which was the closing market price of our Class C capital stock on August 8, 2022. No\nother changes were made to the terms and conditions of the eligible option awards. We have accounted for the reprice of the\neligible option awards as an equity modification whereby the incremental fair value attributable to the repriced option awards,\nas measured on the date of reprice, will be recognized as additional share-based compensation expense. The reprice impacted\n7 million stock option awards, affected 3,348 employees and was expected to result in incremental share-based compensation\nexpense of $66 million in total over the remaining requisite service period of the original awards. The weighted-average total\nfair value of options repriced in August 2022 was $67.58.(cid:3)\nOption Awards\nThe following table summarizes option award activity for the year ended December 31, 2023:\nNumber\nof Shares Weighted- Weighted-\nSubject to Average Average Aggregate\nExisting Exercise Remaining Intrinsic\nOptions (in Price Per Contractual Value\nthousands) Share Life (Years) (in millions)\nOutstanding at January 1, 2023 28,598 $ 44.90 7.1 $ 15\nGranted 7,242 43.21\nExercised (1,829) 39.32\nForfeited or cancelled (1,487) 59.27\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023 32,524 44.18 6.9 495\nVested and exercisable at December 31, 2023 20,691 44.06 5.9 321\n109\nThe following assumptions were used to determine the fair value of option awards granted for the periods presented:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nExpected volatility 55% – 62% 55% – 61% 52% – 58%\nRisk-free interest rate 3.75% – 4.36% 1.94% – 3.95% 0.57% – 1.15%\nWeighted-average expected life 5.3 – 6.5 years 4.5 – 6.0 years 4.5 – 5.8 years\nWeighted-average fair value of options granted $24.43 $23.25 $54.55\nAs of December 31, 2023, there was a total of $335 million in unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested option\nawards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.3 years.(cid:3)\nThe total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $20 million,\n$13 million and $310 million, respectively. The fair value of options vested for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and\n2021 was $215 million, $226 million and $173 million, respectively.\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe following table summarizes activity for all restricted stock units for the year ended December 31, 2023:\nWeighted-\nRestricted Average Grant-\nStock Units (in Date Fair\nthousands) Value\nUnvested outstanding at January 1, 2023 10,930 $ 46.85\nGranted 8,693 43.88\nVested (6,400) 45.57\nForfeited (1,185) 46.42\nUnvested outstanding at December 31, 2023 12,038 45.42\nThe total fair value of restricted stock units that vested during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was\n$292 million, $247 million and $152 million, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023, there was $494 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock\nunits, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.4 years.\nShare-Based Compensation Expense\nThe following table presents the effects of share-based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of\noperations during the periods presented (in millions):\n110\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nCost of revenue $ 16 $ 16 $ 9\nSales and marketing 70 63 42\nTechnology and development 166 165 103\nGeneral and administrative 199 189 122\nImpairment and restructuring costs — 2 1\nShare-based compensation - continuing operations 451 435 277\nShare-based compensation - discontinued operations — 16 40\nTotal share-based compensation $ 451 $ 451 $ 317\nNote 15. Net Loss Per Share\nBasic net loss per share and basic income (loss) from continuing operations per share are computed by dividing net loss\nor income (loss) from continuing operations, as applicable, by the weighted-average number of shares (including Class A\ncommon stock, Class B common stock and Class C capital stock) outstanding during the period. In the calculation of basic net\nloss per share and basic income (loss) from continuing operations per share, undistributed earnings are allocated assuming all\nearnings during the period were distributed.\nDiluted net loss per share and diluted net income (loss) from continuing operations per share is computed by dividing net\nloss or net income (loss) from continuing operations, as applicable, by the weighted-average number of shares (including Class\nA common stock, Class B common stock and Class C capital stock) outstanding during the period, which is calculated based on\nnet income (loss) from continuing operations, and potentially dilutive Class C capital stock equivalents, except in cases where\nthe effect of the Class C capital stock equivalent would be antidilutive. Potentially dilutive Class C capital stock equivalents\nconsist of stock issuable upon exercise of stock options, stock underlying unvested restricted stock units, and stock issuable\nupon conversion of outstanding convertible senior notes.\nClass C capital stock issuable upon exercise of stock options and Class C capital stock underlying unvested restricted\nstock units are calculated using the treasury stock method.\nWe have applied the if-converted method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the conversion of the outstanding\nconvertible notes on diluted net loss per share and diluted net income (loss) from continuing operations per share, if applicable.\nThe following table presents the maximum number of shares and conversion price per share of Class C capital stock for each of\nthe Notes based on the aggregate principal amount outstanding as of December 31, 2023 (in thousands, except per share\namounts):\nConversion Price\nMaturity Date Shares per Share\nSeptember 1, 2026 11,464 $ 43.51\nMay 15, 2025 7,552 67.20\nSeptember 1, 2024 13,982 43.51\nFor the periods presented, the following table reconciles the denominators used in the basic and diluted net loss and net\nincome (loss) from continuing operations per share calculations (in thousands):\n111\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nDenominator for basic calculation 233,575 242,163 249,937\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nOption awards — — 9,304\nUnvested restricted stock units — — 2,585\nDenominator for dilutive calculation 233,575 242,163 261,826\nFor the periods presented, the following Class C capital stock equivalents were excluded from the calculations of diluted\nnet loss per share and diluted net income (loss) from continuing operations per share because their effect would have been\nantidilutive (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nWeighted-average Class C capital stock option awards outstanding 21,021 15,759 2,455\nWeighted-average Class C capital stock restricted stock units outstanding 13,581 9,015 1,173\nClass C capital stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes maturing in\n2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026 33,718 33,855 36,540\nTotal Class C capital stock equivalents 68,320 58,629 40,168\nIn the event of liquidation, dissolution, distribution of assets or winding-up of the Company, the holders of all classes of\ncommon and capital stock have equal rights to receive all the assets of the Company after the rights of the holders of preferred\nstock have been satisfied. We have not presented net loss per share under the two-class method for our Class A common stock,\nClass B common stock and Class C capital stock because it would be the same for each class due to equal dividend and\nliquidation rights for each class.\nNote 16. Commitments and Contingencies\nInterest Rate Lock Commitments\nWe have entered into IRLCs with prospective borrowers under our mortgage origination business whereby we commit to\nlend a certain loan amount under specific terms and at a specific interest rate to the borrower. These commitments are treated as\nderivatives and are carried at fair value. For additional information regarding our IRLCs, see Note 4 to our consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nLease Commitments\nWe have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for certain of our office space and equipment\nwith original lease periods expiring between 2024 and 2032. For additional information regarding our lease agreements, see\nNote 10 to our consolidated financial statements.\nPurchase Commitments\nPurchase commitments primarily include various non-cancelable agreements to purchase content related to our mobile\napplications and websites and certain cloud computing services. The amounts due for non-cancelable purchase commitments as\nof December 31, 2023 are as follows (in millions):\n112\nPurchase Obligations\n2024 $ 100\n2025 85\n2026 67\n2027 60\nTotal future purchase commitments $ 312\nEscrow Balances\nIn conducting our title and escrow operations, we routinely hold customers’ assets in escrow, pending completion of real\nestate transactions, and are responsible for the proper disposition of these balances for our customers. Certain of these amounts\nare maintained in segregated bank accounts and have not been included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nThese balances were not material as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nLetters of Credit\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we have outstanding letters of credit of approximately $11 million and $16 million,\nrespectively, which secure our lease obligations in connection with certain of our office space operating leases.\nSurety Bonds\nIn the course of business, we are required to provide financial commitments in the form of surety bonds to third parties as\na guarantee of our performance on and our compliance with certain obligations. If we were to fail to perform or comply with\nthese obligations, any draws upon surety bonds issued on our behalf would then trigger our payment obligation to the surety\nbond issuer. We have outstanding surety bonds issued for our benefit of approximately $15 million and $13 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nLegal Proceedings\nWe are involved in a number of legal proceedings concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of our\nbusiness activities, some of which are at preliminary stages and some of which seek an indeterminate amount of damages. We\nregularly evaluate the status of legal proceedings in which we are involved to assess whether a loss is probable or there is a\nreasonable possibility that a loss or additional loss may have been incurred to determine if accruals are appropriate. We further\nevaluate each legal proceeding to assess whether an estimate of possible loss or range of loss can be made if accruals are not\nappropriate. For certain cases described below, management is unable to provide a meaningful estimate of the possible loss or\nrange of possible loss because, among other reasons, (i) the proceedings are in preliminary stages; (ii) specific damages have\nnot been sought; (iii) damages sought are, in our view, unsupported and/or exaggerated; (iv) there is uncertainty as to the\noutcome of pending appeals or motions; (v) there are significant factual issues to be resolved; and/or (vi) there are novel legal\nissues or unsettled legal theories presented. For these cases, however, management does not believe, based on currently\navailable information, that the outcomes of these proceedings will have a material effect on our financial position, results of\noperations or cash flow. For the matters discussed below, we have not recorded any material accruals as of December 31, 2023\nor 2022.\nOn September 17, 2019, International Business Machines Corporation (“IBM”) filed a complaint against us in the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Central District of California, alleging, among other things, that the Company has infringed and continues\nto willfully infringe seven patents held by IBM and seeks unspecified damages, including a request that the amount of\ncompensatory damages be trebled, injunctive relief and costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees. On November 8, 2019, we filed a\nmotion to transfer venue and/or to dismiss the complaint. On December 2, 2019, IBM filed an amended complaint, and on\nDecember 16, 2019 we filed a renewed motion to transfer venue and/or to dismiss the complaint. The Company’s motion to\ntransfer venue to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington was granted on May 28, 2020. On August 12,\n2020, IBM filed its answer to our counterclaims. On September 18, 2020, we filed four Inter Partes Review (“IPR”) petitions\n113\nbefore the U.S. Patent and Trial Appeal Board (“PTAB”) seeking the Board’s review of the patentability with respect to three of\nthe patents asserted by IBM in the lawsuit. On March 15, 2021, the PTAB instituted IPR proceedings with respect to two of the\nthree patents for which we filed petitions. On March 22, 2021, the PTAB denied institution with respect to the last of the three\npatents. On January 22, 2021, the court partially stayed the action with respect to all patents for which we filed an IPR and set\nforth a motion schedule. On March 8, 2021, IBM filed its second amended complaint. On March 25, 2021, we filed an amended\nmotion for judgment on the pleadings. On July 15, 2021, the court rendered an order in connection with the motion for\njudgment on the pleadings finding in our favor on two of the four patents on which we filed our motion. On August 31, 2021,\nthe Court ruled that the parties will proceed with respect to the two patents for which it previously denied judgment, and\nvacated the stay with respect to one of the three patents for which Zillow filed an IPR, which stay was later reinstated by\nstipulation of the parties on May 18, 2022. On September 23, 2021, IBM filed a notice of appeal with the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Federal Circuit with respect to the August 31, 2021 judgment entered, which judgment was affirmed by the\nFederal Circuit on October 17, 2022. On March 3, 2022, the PTAB ruled on Zillow’s two remaining IPRs finding that Zillow\nwas able to prove certain claims unpatentable, and others it was not. On October 28, 2022, the court found one of the two\npatents upon which the parties were proceeding in this action as invalid, and dismissed IBM’s claim relating to that patent.\nFollowing the court’s ruling, on October 28, 2022, the parties filed a joint stipulation with the court seeking a stay of this action,\nwhich was granted by the court on November 1, 2022. On November 25, 2022, Zillow filed a motion to join an IPR petition\nwithin Ebates Performance Mktg., Inc. d/b/a Rakuten Rewards v. Int’l Bus. Machs. Corp., (“Rakuten IPR”), IPR2022-00646\nconcerning the final remaining patent in this action, which the court granted on April 20, 2023. On October 11, 2023, the PTAB\nruled on the Rakuten IPR finding the claims of the patent asserted against Zillow unpatentable. IBM appealed the PTAB’s\ndecision on November 21, 2023, and cross appeals were filed by Ebates Performance Marketing Inc. on November 21, 2023\nand by us on December 15, 2023. We deny the allegations of any wrongdoing and intend to vigorously defend the claims in the\nlawsuit. There is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred related to this matter; however, the possible loss or range\nof loss is not estimable.(cid:3)\nOn July 21, 2020, IBM filed a second action against us in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington,\nalleging, among other things, that the Company has infringed and continues to willfully infringe five patents held by IBM and\nseeks unspecified damages. On September 14, 2020, we filed a motion to dismiss the complaint filed in the action, to which\nIBM responded by the filing of an amended complaint on November 5, 2020. On December 18, 2020, we filed a motion to\ndismiss IBM’s first amended complaint. On December 23, 2020, the Court issued a written order staying this case in full. On\nJuly 23, 2021, we filed an IPR with the PTAB with respect to one patent included in the second lawsuit. On October 6, 2021,\nthe stay of this action was lifted, except for proceedings relating to the one patent for which we filed an IPR. On December 1,\n2021, the Court dismissed the fourth claim asserted by IBM in its amended complaint. On December 16, 2021 Zillow filed a\nmotion to dismiss the remaining claims alleged in IBM’s amended complaint. On March 9, 2022, the Court granted Zillow’s\nmotion to dismiss in full, dismissing IBM’s claims related to all the patents asserted by IBM in this action, except for the one\npatent for which an IPR was still pending. On March 10, 2022, the PTAB rendered its decision denying Zillow’s IPR on the one\nremaining patent, for which this case continues to remain stayed. On August 1, 2022, IBM filed an appeal of the Court’s ruling\nwith respect to two of the dismissed patents, which ruling was affirmed by the appeals court on January 9, 2024. We deny the\nallegations of any wrongdoing and intend to vigorously defend the claims in the lawsuit. There is a reasonable possibility that a\nloss may be incurred related to this matter; however, the possible loss or range of loss is not estimable.\nOn November 16, 2021, November 19, 2021 and January 6, 2022, three purported class action lawsuits were filed against\nus and certain of our executive officers, alleging, among other things, violations of federal securities laws on behalf of a class of\nthose who purchased our stock between August 7, 2020 and November 2, 2021. The three purported class action lawsuits,\ncaptioned Barua v. Zillow Group, Inc. et al., Silverberg v. Zillow Group, et al. and Hillier v. Zillow Group, Inc. et al. were\nbrought in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington and were consolidated on February 16, 2022. On May\n12, 2022, the plaintiffs filed their amended consolidated complaint which alleges, among other things, that we issued materially\nfalse and misleading statements regarding our Zillow Offers business. The complaints seek to recover, among other things,\nalleged damages sustained by the purported class members as a result of the alleged misconduct. We moved to dismiss the\namended consolidated complaint on July 11, 2022, plaintiffs filed their opposition to the motion to dismiss on September 2,\n2022, and we filed a reply in support of the motion to dismiss on October 11, 2022. On December 7, 2022, the court rendered\nits decision granting defendants’ motion to dismiss, in part, and denying the motion, in part. On January 23, 2023, the\ndefendants filed their answer to the consolidated complaint. We intend to deny the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to\n114\nvigorously defend the claims in this consolidated lawsuit. We do not believe that a loss related to this consolidated lawsuit is\nprobable.\nOn March 10, 2022, May 5, 2022 and July 20, 2022, shareholder derivative suits were filed in the U.S. District Court for\nthe Western District of Washington (“Federal Court”) and on July 25, 2022, a shareholder derivative suit was filed in the\nSuperior Court of the State of Washington, King County (the “2022 State Suit”), against us and certain of our executive officers\nand directors seeking unspecified damages on behalf of the Company and certain other relief, such as reform to corporate\ngovernance practices. The plaintiffs (including the Company as a nominal defendant) allege, among other things, that the\ndefendants breached their fiduciary duties by failing to maintain an effective system of internal controls, which purportedly\ncaused the losses the Company incurred when it decided to wind down Zillow Offers operations. Plaintiffs also allege, among\nother things, violations of Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, insider trading and waste of\ncorporate assets. On June 1, 2022 and September 14, 2022, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington\nissued orders consolidating the three federal derivative suits and staying the consolidated action until further order of the court,\nwhich stay was further continued by the Federal Court on September 6, 2023. On September 15, 2022, the Superior Court of the\nState of Washington entered a temporary stay in the 2022 State Suit. Upon the filing of the defendants’ answer in the related\nsecurities class action lawsuit on January 23, 2023, the stay in the 2022 State Suit was lifted. A partial stay was then reentered\nin the 2022 State Suit, which expired on February 1, 2024. On August 23, 2023 a second shareholder derivative suit was filed in\nthe Superior Court of the State of Washington, King County. The defendants intend to deny the allegations of wrongdoing and\nvigorously defend the claims in these lawsuits. We do not believe that a loss related to these lawsuits is probable.\nIn addition to the matters discussed above, from time to time, we are involved in litigation and claims that arise in the\nordinary course of business. Although we cannot be certain of the outcome of any such litigation or claims, nor the amount of\ndamages and exposure that we could incur, we currently believe that the final disposition of such matters will not have a\nmaterial effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flow. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can\nhave an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.\nIndemnifications\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements under which we agree to provide\nindemnification of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but\nnot limited to, losses arising out of the breach of such agreements and out of intellectual property infringement claims made by\nthird parties. In addition, we have agreements that indemnify certain issuers of surety bonds against losses that they may incur\nas a result of executing surety bonds on our behalf. For our indemnification arrangements, payment may be conditional on the\nother party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract. Further, our obligations under these\nagreements may be limited in terms of time and/or amount, and in some instances, we may have recourse against third parties\nfor certain payments. In addition, we have indemnification agreements with certain of our directors and executive officers that\nrequire us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as\ndirectors or officers. The terms of such obligations may vary.\nNote 17. Employee Benefit Plan\nWe have a defined contribution 401(k) retirement plan covering Zillow Group employees who have met certain eligibility\nrequirements (the “Zillow Group 401(k) Plan”). Eligible employees may contribute pre-tax compensation up to a maximum\namount allowable under the Internal Revenue Service limitations. Employee contributions and earnings thereon vest\nimmediately. We currently match up to 4% of employee contributions under the Zillow Group 401(k) Plan. The total expense\nrelated to the Zillow Group 401(k) Plan was $33 million, $29 million and $27 million, respectively, for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nNote 18. Revenue and Contract Balances\nWe recognize revenue when or as we satisfy our performance obligations by transferring control of the promised products\nor services to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those\nproducts or services. See Note 2 for additional information regarding our revenue recognition accounting policies.\n115\nBeginning in 2023, our chief executive officer, who acts as the chief operating decision maker, began to manage our\nbusiness, make operating decisions and evaluate operating performance on the basis of the company as a whole, instead of on a\nsegment basis as he did prior to 2023. Accordingly, this change resulted in revisions to the nature and substance of information\nregularly provided to and used by the chief operating decision maker. This serves to align our reported results with our ongoing\ngrowth strategy and our intent to provide integrated customer solutions for all tasks and services related to facilitating real\nestate transactions. As a result, we have determined that we have a single reportable segment. In addition, our revenue is\nclassified into four categories: Residential, Rentals, Mortgages and Other. Certain prior period amounts have been revised to\nreflect these changes.\nThe Residential revenue category primarily includes revenue for our Premier Agent and new construction marketplaces,\nas well as revenue from the sale of other advertising and business technology solutions for real estate professionals, including\nStreetEasy for-sale product offerings, ShowingTime+ and Follow Up Boss. Our Rentals and Mortgages revenue categories\nremain consistent with our historical presentation, and our Other revenue category primarily includes revenue generated from\ndisplay advertising.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following table presents our revenue disaggregated by category for the periods presented (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nResidential $ 1,452 $ 1,522 $ 1,572\nRentals 357 274 264\nMortgages 96 119 246\nOther 40 43 50\nTotal revenue $ 1,945 $ 1,958 $ 2,132\nContract Balances\nContract assets totaled $90 million and $71 million as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the opening balance of deferred revenue was $44 million, of which $43 million\nwas recognized as revenue during the period.

Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\nOfficer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2023.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as\nsuch term is defined under Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our\n116\nmanagement, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated\nFramework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on\nour evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31,\n2023.\nWe intend to regularly review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and\ninternal control over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and to improve these controls and procedures over time and to\ncorrect any deficiencies that we may discover in the future. While we believe the present design of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures and internal control over financial reporting are effective, future events affecting our business may cause us to\nmodify our controls and procedures.\nThe Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report regarding its assessment of\nthe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation\nrequired by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2023\nthat have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n117\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Zillow Group, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Zillow Group, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023,\nbased on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,\neffective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control —\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, of the Company and our\nreport dated February 14, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report\non Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all\nmaterial respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk\nthat a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the\nassessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit\nprovides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures\nthat (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the\ncompany; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSeattle, Washington\nFebruary 14, 2024\n118\nItem 9B.

We have provided a reconciliation below of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most\ndirectly comparable GAAP financial measure. We have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of forecasted GAAP net income\n(loss) to forecasted Adjusted EBITDA within this press release because we are unable, without making unreasonable efforts, to\ncalculate certain reconciling items with confidence. These items include but are not limited to: income taxes that are directly impacted\nby unpredictable fluctuations in the market price of the company’s capital stock; depreciation and amortization from new acquisitions;\nimpairments of assets; gains or losses on extinguishment of debt; and acquisition-related costs. These items, which could materially\naffect the computation of forward-looking GAAP net income (loss), are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of\nwhich are outside of our control. We have not provided a reconciliation of forecasted Adjusted EBITDA margin to net income (loss)\nmargin, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the same reasons.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a key metric used by our management and board of directors to measure operating performance and trends and to\nprepare and approve our annual budget. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates\noperating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis.\nOur use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider this measure in isolation or as a\nsubstitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of share-based compensation;\n• Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be\nreplaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements\nor for new capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect impairment and restructuring costs;\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect acquisition-related costs;\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect loss on extinguishment of debt;\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense or other income, net;\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income taxes; and\n• Other companies, including companies in our own industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently from the way we\ndo, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including\nvarious cash-flow metrics, net loss and our other GAAP results.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss for each of the periods presented (in millions,\nunaudited):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Loss:\nNet loss $ (20) $ (28) $ (60) $ (85)\nIncome taxes — — 4 1\nOther income, net (34) (34) (101) (108)\nDepreciation and amortization 63 49 178 134\nShare-based compensation 108 109 329 342\nImpairment and restructuring costs — 1 6 9\nAcquisition-related costs 1 1 1 2\nLoss on extinguishment of debt — — 1 —\nInterest expense 9 9 28 27\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 127 $ 107 $ 386 $ 322"

Statements\nThis communication contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the\nSecurities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that involve risks and\nuncertainties, including, without limitation, statements regarding our future targets; the future growth,\nperformance and operation of our business; our business strategies and ability to translate such\nstrategies into financial performance; and the growth of, and our impact on, the residential real estate\nindustry.

Differences in Zillow Group’s actual results from those described in these forward-looking\nstatements may result from actions taken by Zillow Group as well as from risks and uncertainties\nbeyond Zillow Group’s control.\nFactors that may contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to: the current and future\nhealth and stability of the economy and United States residential real estate industry, including\nchanges in inflationary conditions, interest rates, housing availability and affordability, homeowners\ninsurance rates, labor shortages and supply chain issues; our ability to manage advertising and\nproduct inventory and pricing and maintain relationships with our real estate partners; our ability to\nestablish or maintain relationships with listing and data providers, which affects traffic to our mobile\napplications and websites; our ability to comply with current and future rules and requirements\npromulgated by National Association of REALTORS®, multiple listing services, or other real estate industry\ngroups or governing bodies, or decisions to repeal, amend, or not enforce such rules and requirements;\nour ability to navigate industry changes, including as a result of past, pending or future class action\nlawsuits, settlements or government investigations, which may include lawsuits, settlements or\ninvestigations in which we are not a named party, such as the National Association of REALTORS®\nsettlement agreement entered into on March 15, 2024; uncertainties related to the November 2024\nelections in the United States; our ability to continue to innovate and compete to attract customers and\nreal estate partners; our ability to effectively invest resources to pursue new strategies, develop new\nproducts and services and expand existing products and services into new markets; our ability to\noperate and grow Zillow Home Loans, our mortgage origination business, including the ability to obtain\nor maintain sufficient financing to fund its origination of mortgages, meet customers’ financing needs\nwith its product offerings, continue to grow the origination business and resell originated mortgages on\nthe secondary market; the duration and impact of natural disasters, geopolitical events, and other\ncatastrophic events (including public health crises) on our ability to operate, demand for our products\nor services, or general economic conditions; our ability to maintain adequate security measures or\ntechnology systems, or those of third parties on which we rely, to protect data integrity and the\ninformation and privacy of our customers and other third parties; the impact of past, pending or future\nlitigation and other disputes or enforcement actions, which may include lawsuits or investigations to\nwhich we are not a party; our ability to attract, engage, and retain a highly skilled workforce;\nacquisitions, investments, strategic partnerships, capital-raising activities, or other corporate\ntransactions or commitments by us or our competitors; our ability to continue relying on third-party\nservices to support critical functions of our business; our ability to protect and continue using our\nintellectual property and prevent others from copying, infringing upon, or developing similar intellectual\nproperty, including as a result of generative artificial intelligence; our ability to comply with domestic\nand international laws, regulations, rules, contractual obligations, policies and other obligations, or to\nobtain or maintain required licenses to support our business and operations; our ability to pay our debt,\nsettle conversions of our convertible senior notes, or repurchase our convertible senior notes upon a\nfundamental change; our ability to raise additional capital or refinance our indebtedness on\nacceptable terms, or at all; actual or anticipated fluctuations in quarterly and annual results of\noperations and financial position; actual or perceived inaccuracies in the assumptions, estimates and\ninternal or third-party data that we use to calculate business, performance and operating metrics; and\nvolatility of our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock prices.\nThe foregoing list of risks and uncertainties is illustrative but not exhaustive. For more information about\npotential factors that could affect Zillow Group’s business and financial results, please review the “Risk\nFactors” described in Zillow Group’s publicly available filings with the United States Securities and\nExchange Commission (“SEC”). Except as may be required by law, Zillow Group does not intend and\nundertakes no duty to update this information to reflect future events or circumstances.\n14 | Q3 2024\nNo Incorporation by Reference\nThis communication includes website addresses and references to additional materials found on those\nwebsites, including Zillow Group’s websites. These websites and materials are not incorporated by\nreference herein or in our other filings with the SEC.\nUse of Estimates and Statistical Data\nThis communication includes estimates and other statistical data made by independent third parties\nand by Zillow Group relating to the housing market, the mortgage-rate environment, connections,\nconversion, engagement, growth, and other data about Zillow Group’s audience and performance and\nthe residential real estate industry and purchase loan origination industry. These data involve a number\nof assumptions and limitations, which may significantly impair their accuracy, and you are cautioned\nnot to give undue weight to such estimates. Projections, assumptions and estimates of future\nperformance are necessarily subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk.\nUse of Operating Metrics\nZillow Group reviews a number of operating metrics to evaluate its business, measure performance,\nidentify trends, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions. This communication includes\nTotal Transaction Value, Revenue Per Total Transaction Value, and Customer Transaction Share. Zillow\nGroup uses these operating metrics on a periodic basis to evaluate and provide investors with insight\ninto the performance of Zillow Group’s transaction-based product and service offerings, which currently\ninclude Premier Agent, seller solutions, Zillow Home Loans and Zillow Showcase.\nRevenue Per Total Transaction Value: Zillow Group calculates “Revenue Per Total Transaction Value” as\ntotal Residential and Mortgages revenue for the relevant period divided by the aggregate total\ntransaction value for the same period. “Total transaction value” is calculated based on data from\nNational Association of REALTORS® as the average sales price of existing residential homes sold during\nthe relevant period multiplied by the number of existing residential homes sold during the same period.\nCustomer Transaction Share: Unless otherwise indicated, “Customer Transaction Share” is Customer\nTransactions divided by the number of total residential real estate transactions, for the relevant period.\n• Customer Transactions: Zillow Group calculates “Customer Transactions” as each unique\npurchase or sale transaction in which the homebuyer or seller uses Zillow Home Loans, Zillow\nShowcase and/or involves an agent partner with whom the buyer or seller connected through\nZillow Group. In particular:\n• For agent partners, Zillow Group uses an internal approximation of the number of buy-\nand/or sell-side transactions, as applicable, that involve an agent partner with whom the\nbuyer or seller connected through Zillow Group. Because of the challenges associated\nwith measuring the conversion of connections to transactions outside of our Premier\nAgent Flex and seller solutions programs, including reliance on the availability and quality\nof public records and data, these estimates may be inaccurate.\n• For Zillow Home Loans, Zillow Group counts each unique purchase transaction in which\nthe buyer uses Zillow Home Loans.\n• For Zillow Showcase, Zillow Group counts each unique sale transaction in which the listing\nagent or seller uses Zillow Showcase.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, this communication\nincludes references to non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin\nand Adjusted EBITDA expenses.\n• Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\nWe have provided a reconciliation below of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly\ncomparable U.S. generally accepted accounting principle (“GAAP”) financial measure.\n15 | Q3 2024\n• Adjusted EBITDA Margin Calculation\nWe have provided a calculation below of Adjusted EBITDA margin, as well as net loss margin, the\nmost directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\n• Adjusted EBITDA Expenses Reconciliation and Calculation\nWe have provided a reconciliation above of Adjusted EBITDA expenses to total select operating\nexpenses and cost of revenue, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, and a\ncalculation below of Adjusted EBITDA expenses calculated as revenue less Adjusted EBITDA.\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted EBITDA expenses are key metrics used by our\nmanagement and board of directors to measure operating performance and trends and to prepare\nand approve our annual budget. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating these\nmeasures facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis.\nOur use of non-GAAP financial measures has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not\nconsider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under\nGAAP. Some of these limitations include, but are not limited to, the fact that such non-GAAP measures:\n• Do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n• Do not consider the potentially dilutive impact of share-based compensation;\n• Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated\nand amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA\nmargin and Adjusted EBITDA expenses do not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements\nfor such replacements or for new capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n• Do not reflect impairment and restructuring costs;\n• Do not reflect acquisition-related costs;\n• Do not reflect the loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt;\n• Do not reflect interest expense or other income, net;\n• Do not reflect income taxes; and\n• Other companies, including companies in our own industry, may calculate these non-GAAP\nmeasures differently from the way we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted\nEBITDA expenses alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash-flow metrics,\nnet loss, and our other GAAP results.\n16 | Q3 2024\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly\ncomparable GAAP financial measure, and a calculation of Adjusted EBITDA expenses for each of the\nperiods presented (in millions, unaudited):\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, September 30,\n2024 2024 2024 2023 2023\nReconciliation of Adjusted\nEBITDA to Net Loss:\nNet loss $ (20) $ (17) $ (23) $ (73) $ (28)\nIncome taxes — 2 2 3 —\nOther income, net (34) (34) (33) (43) (34)\nDepreciation and\namortization 63 59 56 53 49\nShare-based compensation 108 113 108 109 109\nImpairment and restructuring\ncosts — — 6 10 1\nAcquisition-related costs 1 — — 2 1\nLoss (gain) on extinguishment\nof debt — 1 — (1) —\nInterest expense 9 10 9 9 9\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 127 $ 134 $ 125 $ 69 $ 107\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nJune 30, 2024\n2024 2023\nCalculation of Adjusted EBITDA Expenses:\nRevenue $ 581 $ 572 $ 496\nLess: Adjusted EBITDA (127) (134) (107)\nAdjusted EBITDA expenses $ 454 $ 438 $ 389\n17 | Q3 2024\nThe following tables present the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA margin and associated year-over-year\npercentage changes and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, which is net loss\nmargin, and related year-over-year percentage changes, for each of the periods presented (in millions,\nexcept percentages and margin change basis points, unaudited):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 to September 30, 2023 to\n2024 2024\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\nRevenue:\nResidential $ 405 $ 362 12% $ 1,207 $ 1,103 9%\nRentals 123 99 24% 337 264 28%\nMortgages 39 24 63% 104 74 41%\nOther 14 11 27% 34 30 13%\nTotal revenue $ 581 $ 496 17% $ 1,682 $ 1,471 14%\nOther Financial Data:\nGross profit $ 441 $ 386 14% $ 1,289 $ 1,165 11%\nNet loss $ (20) $ (28) 29% $ (60) $ (85) 29%\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 127 $ 107 19% $ 386 $ 322 20%\n2023 to 2023 to\nThree Months Ended 2024 Nine Months Ended 2024\nSeptember 30, 2023 to Margin September 30, 2023 to Margin\n2024 Change 2024 Change\nPercentage of % Basis % Basis\nRevenue: 2024 2023 Change Points 2024 2023 Change Points\nGross profit 76 % 78 % (3)% (200) 77 % 79 % (3) % (200)\nNet loss (3) % (6) % 50% 300 (4) % (6) % 33 % 200\nAdjusted EBITDA 22 % 22 % —% — 23 % 22 % 5 % 100\n18 | Q3 2024\nhttps://investors.zillowgroup.com"

Organization and Description of Business\nZillow Group is reimagining real estate to make home a reality for more and more people. As the most visited real estate website in the United States,\nZillow and its affiliates help people find and get the home they want by connecting them with digital solutions, dedicated partners and agents, and easier\nbuying, selling, financing and renting experiences.\nOur portfolio of affiliates, subsidiaries and brands includes Zillow Premier Agent, Zillow Home Loans, our mortgage origination business and affiliate\nlender, Zillow Rentals, Trulia, StreetEasy, HotPads and Out East. In addition, Zillow Group provides a comprehensive suite of marketing software and\ntechnology solutions for the real estate industry, including ShowingTime+, Spruce and Follow Up Boss.\nCertain Significant Risks and Uncertainties\nWe operate in a dynamic industry and, accordingly, can be affected by a variety of factors, which are uncertain and difficult to predict. For example, we\nbelieve that potential changes in any of the following areas may have a significant impact on us in terms of our future financial position, results of operations or\ncash flows: the current and future health and stability of the economy and United States residential real estate industry, including changes in inflationary\nconditions, interest rates, housing availability and affordability, homeowners insurance rates, labor shortages and supply chain issues; our ability to navigate\nindustry changes, including as a result of certain or future class action lawsuits, settlements or government investigations; our ability to manage advertising and\nproduct inventory and pricing and maintain relationships with our real estate partners; our ability to comply with current and future rules and requirements\npromulgated by NAR, multiple listing services, or other real estate industry groups or governing bodies, and to maintain or establish relationships with listing\nand data providers; our investment of resources to pursue strategies and develop new products and services that may not prove effective or that are not\nattractive for customers and real estate partners or that do not allow us to compete successfully; our ability to operate and grow Zillow Home Loans, our\nmortgage origination business and affiliate lender, including the ability to obtain or maintain sufficient financing and resell originated mortgages on the\nsecondary market; the duration and impact of natural disasters, geopolitical events, and other catastrophic events (including public health crises) on our ability\nto operate, demand for our products or services or general economic conditions; outcomes of legal proceedings; our ability to attract, engage, and retain a\nhighly skilled workforce; protection of Zillow Group’s information and systems against security breaches or disruptions in operations; reliance on third-party\nservices to support critical functions of our business; protection of our brand and intellectual property; and changes in laws or government regulation affecting\nour business, among other things.\n10\nTable of Contents\nNote 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include Zillow Group, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances\nand transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and\napplicable rules and regulations of the SEC regarding interim financial reporting. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the financial\nstatements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. Accordingly, these interim condensed\nconsolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and accompanying notes included in Zillow Group, Inc.’s\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, included\nherein, was derived from the audited financial statements of Zillow Group, Inc. as of that date. Certain reclassifications of prior period amounts have been\nmade to conform to the current period presentation.\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal\nrecurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly our financial position as of September 30, 2024 and our results of operations, comprehensive loss, and\nshareholders’ equity for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and cash flows for the nine month periods ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023. The results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year\nending December 31, 2024, for any interim period, or for any other future year.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect\nthe reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related disclosures at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and\nexpenses during the periods presented. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the accounting for certain revenue offerings,\namortization period and recoverability of contract cost assets, website and software development costs, recoverability of long-lived assets and intangible assets,\nshare-based compensation, income taxes, business combinations, including the initial and subsequent fair value measurements of assets (primarily intangible\nassets), liabilities and contingent consideration, and the recoverability of goodwill, among others. To the extent there are material differences between these\nestimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The health of the housing market and broader economy have\nintroduced significant additional uncertainty with respect to estimates, judgments and assumptions, which may materially impact the estimates previously\nlisted, among others.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued guidance to improve existing disclosure requirements for segment reporting, primarily through enhanced disclosures\nabout significant segment expenses and new disclosure requirements applicable to entities with a single reportable segment. This guidance is effective for\nannual periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024, on a retrospective basis. We expect to adopt this\nguidance for the annual period ending December 31, 2024. We expect this guidance to result in additional disclosures primarily related to significant segment\nexpenses that are regularly provided to our chief operating decision maker.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued guidance to enhance the income tax rate reconciliation disclosure requirements and to provide clarity on disclosure\nrequirements for income taxes. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and can be applied on a prospective or\nretrospective basis, with early adoption permitted. We expect to adopt this guidance for the annual period ending December 31, 2025. While we anticipate this\nguidance will result in additional disclosures related to income taxes, we do not expect this new guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued guidance that will require disclosure of specified information about certain costs and expenses included within an\nentity’s consolidated financial statements. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2027, and can be applied on a prospective or retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted. We have not yet determined the impact the\nadoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.\n11\nTable of Contents\nNote 3. Financial Instruments\nWe apply the following methods and assumptions in estimating our fair value measurements:\nCash equivalents — The fair value measurement of money market funds is based on quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1). The fair value\nmeasurement of other cash equivalents is based on observable market-based inputs principally derived from or corroborated by observable market data (Level\n2).\nShort-term investments — The fair value measurement of our short-term investments is based on observable market-based inputs or inputs that are\nderived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (Level 2).\nRestricted cash — The carrying value of restricted cash approximates fair value due to the short period of time that amounts are held in escrow (Level 1).\nMortgage loans held for sale — The fair value of mortgage loans held for sale is generally calculated by reference to quoted prices in secondary markets\nfor commitments to sell mortgage loans with similar characteristics (Level 2).\nForward contracts — The fair value of mandatory loan sales commitments and derivative instruments such as forward sales of MBSs that are utilized as\neconomic hedging instruments is calculated by reference to quoted prices for similar assets (Level 2).\nContingent consideration — In December 2023, Zillow Group acquired Follow Up Boss for $399 million in cash, net of cash acquired, and contingent\nconsideration of up to $100 million, payable over a three-year period upon achievement of certain performance metrics. The fair value of the contingent\nconsideration is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation which considers the probabilities of the achievement of certain performance metrics (Level 3).\nThe discount rates used in our valuation of contingent consideration are based on our estimated cost of debt and are directly related to the fair value of\ncontingent consideration. An increase in the discount rate, in isolation, would result in a decrease in the fair value measurement. Conversely, a decrease in the\ndiscount rate, in isolation, would result in an increase in the fair value measurement. The probabilities of achieving the relevant performance metrics used in\nour valuation of contingent consideration are directly related to the fair value of contingent consideration, as an increase in the probability, in isolation, would\nresult in an increase in the fair value measurement. Conversely, a decrease in the probability, in isolation, would result in a decrease in the fair value\nmeasurement.\nDuring the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes in the unobservable inputs used in determining the\nfair value of contingent consideration included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\nIRLCs — The fair value of IRLCs is calculated by reference to quoted prices in secondary markets for commitments to sell mortgage loans with similar\ncharacteristics. Expired commitments are excluded from the fair value measurement. Since not all IRLCs will become closed loans, we adjust our fair value\nmeasurements for the estimated amount of IRLCs that will not close. This adjustment is effected through the pull-through rate, which represents the probability\nthat an IRLC will ultimately result in a closed loan. For IRLCs that are canceled or expired, any recorded gain or loss is reversed at the end of the commitment\nperiod (Level 3).\nThe pull-through rate is based on estimated changes in market conditions, loan stage and historical borrower behavior. Pull-through rates are directly\nrelated to the fair value of IRLCs as an increase in the pull-through rate, in isolation, would result in an increase in the fair value measurement. Conversely, a\ndecrease in the pull-through rate, in isolation, would result in a decrease in the fair value measurement. Changes in the fair value of IRLCs are included within\nrevenue in our condensed\n12\nTable of Contents\nconsolidated statements of operations. The following table presents the range and weighted-average pull-through rates used in determining the fair value of\nIRLCs as of the dates presented:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nRange 51% - 100% 45% - 100%\nWeighted-average 85% 85%\nWe manage our interest rate risk related to IRLCs and mortgage loans held for sale through the use of derivative instruments, generally forward contracts\non MBSs, which are commitments to either purchase or sell a financial instrument at a future date for a specified price, and mandatory loan commitments,\nwhich are an obligation by an investor to buy loans at a specified price within a specified time period. We do not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or\nspeculative purposes, and our derivatives are not designated as hedging instruments. Changes in the fair value of our derivative financial instruments are\nrecognized in revenue in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nThe following table presents the notional amounts of the economic hedging instruments related to our mortgage loans held for sale as of the dates\npresented (in millions):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nIRLCs $ 340 $ 167\nForward contracts(1) $ 410 $ 218\n(1) Represents net notional amounts.

Acquisitions\nAcquisition of Follow Up Boss\nOn December 8, 2023, Zillow Group acquired Follow Up Boss, a customer relationship management system for real estate professionals, for $399 million\nin cash, net of cash acquired, and contingent consideration of up to $100 million in cash, payable over a three-year period upon achievement of certain\nperformance metrics. See Note 3 for additional information regarding the preliminary fair value of contingent consideration. The acquisition is consistent with\nour strategy to invest in a more integrated software experience for our agent customers. The acquisition of Follow Up Boss has been accounted for as a\nbusiness combination, and assets acquired and liabilities assumed were generally recorded at their preliminary estimated fair values, in accordance with the\napplicable accounting guidance. Goodwill represents the expected synergies from combining the acquired assets and the operations of the acquirer as well as\nintangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. Goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition is deductible for tax purposes.\n15\nTable of Contents\nThe total preliminary purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including identifiable intangible assets, based on\ntheir preliminarily estimated fair values at the acquisition date, as follows (in millions):\nPreliminary purchase price:\nCash $ 403\nContingent consideration 81\nTotal preliminary purchase price $ 484\nIdentifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 4\nGoodwill 402\nIntangible assets 86\nDeferred revenue (7)\nOther liabilities (1)\nTotal preliminary purchase price $ 484\nThe preliminary estimated fair value of the identifiable intangible assets acquired and associated useful lives consisted of the following (in millions):\nEstimated Weighted-\nPreliminary Estimated Fair Average Useful Life (in\nValue years)\nDeveloped technology $ 50 4\nCustomer relationships 34 7\nTrade names and trademarks 2 7\nTotal $ 86\nEstimated fair values of the identifiable intangible assets acquired were determined by management, based in part on a preliminary valuation performed\nby an independent third-party valuation specialist. We used an income approach to measure the fair value of the customer relationships intangible asset\nacquired based on the excess earnings method, whereby the fair value is estimated based upon the present value of cash flows that the applicable asset is\nexpected to generate. We used an income approach to measure the fair value of the developed technology and trade names and trademarks based on the relief-\nfrom-royalty method. These fair value measurements were based on Level 3 inputs under the fair value hierarchy.\nThe purchase price allocation for the Follow Up Boss acquisition is preliminary and subject to change during the measurement period up to one year from\nthe acquisition date. We made an initial allocation of the purchase price at the date of the acquisition based upon information available and our understanding of\nthe estimates used to determine the preliminary fair value of acquired assets, assumed liabilities and contingent consideration. We are in the process of\nspecifically identifying the amounts assigned to certain tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and contingent consideration. As of September 30,\n2024, the measurement period (not to extend beyond one year) is open for the Follow Up Boss acquisition; therefore, assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and\ncontingent consideration are subject to adjustment until the end of the measurement period.\n16\nTable of Contents\nAcquisitions of Aryeo and Spruce\nOn July 31, 2023, Zillow Group acquired Aryeo, a software company that serves real estate photographers, in exchange for approximately $15 million in\ncash, net of cash acquired, and 380,259 shares of our Class C capital stock with a value of $20 million, for total consideration of $35 million, net of cash\nacquired. On September 11, 2023, Zillow Group acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Spruce, a tech-enabled title and escrow platform, in\nexchange for approximately $19 million in cash, net of cash acquired.\nThe acquisitions of Aryeo and Spruce have been accounted for as business combinations, and assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at\ntheir estimated fair values. Goodwill represents the expected synergies from combining the acquired assets and the operations of the acquirer as well as\nintangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. Goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of Aryeo is not deductible for tax purposes,\nand goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of Spruce is deductible for tax purposes.\nThe total purchase prices have been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including identifiable intangible assets, based on their\nrespective fair values at the acquisition date, as follows (in millions):\nAryeo Spruce\nCash and cash equivalents $ 3 $ 5\nGoodwill 26 16\nIntangible assets 11 2\nOther assets — 2\nLiabilities (2) (1)\nTotal purchase price $ 38 $ 24\nThe estimated fair value of the identifiable intangible assets acquired and associated useful lives consisted of the following (in millions):\nAryeo Spruce\nEstimated Useful Life (in Estimated Useful Life (in\nEstimated Fair Value years) Estimated Fair Value years)\nCustomer relationships $ 5 5 $ — —\nPurchased content 4 3 — —\nDeveloped technology 2 3 2 3\nTotal $ 11 $ 2\nWe used an income approach to measure the fair value of the customer relationships intangible asset acquired from Aryeo based on the excess earnings\nmethod, whereby the fair value is estimated based upon the present value of cash flows that the applicable asset is expected to generate. We used a cost\napproach to measure the fair value of purchased content acquired from Aryeo. We used an income approach to measure the fair value of the developed\ntechnology acquired from Aryeo and Spruce based on the relief-from-royalty method. These fair value measurements were based on Level 3 inputs under the\nfair value hierarchy.\nAcquisition-related costs incurred, which primarily included legal, accounting and other external costs directly related to the acquisitions, are included\nwithin acquisition-related costs in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and were expensed as incurred. Aggregate acquisition-related costs for\nthe acquisitions of Follow Up Boss, Aryeo, and Spruce were not material to our financial statements.\nUnaudited pro forma revenue and earnings information related to the acquisitions has not been presented as the aggregate effects of the acquisitions of\nFollow Up Boss, Aryeo and Spruce were not material to our condensed consolidated financial statements.\n17\nTable of Contents\nNote 6.

The master repurchase agreements contain margin call provisions that provide the Lenders with certain rights in the event of a decline in the market\nvalue of the assets purchased under the master repurchase agreements. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $155 million and $99 million,\nrespectively, in mortgage loans held for sale were pledged as collateral under the master repurchase agreements.\nBorrowings on the master repurchase agreements bear interest at a floating rate based on SOFR plus an applicable margin, as defined by the governing\nagreements. The master repurchase agreements include customary representations and warranties, covenants and provisions regarding events of default. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, Zillow Home Loans was in compliance with all financial covenants and no event of default had occurred.

Interest on the Notes is paid semi-annually in arrears. The estimated fair value\nof the Notes is classified as Level 2 and was determined through consideration of quoted market prices in markets that are not active.\nThe Notes are convertible into cash, shares of Class C capital stock or a combination thereof, at our election, and may be settled as described below. They\nwill mature on their respective maturity dates, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms.

During the period from March 1, 2024 through the close of business on August 29, 2024, holders of the\n2024 Notes elected to convert all outstanding 2024 Notes in accordance with the terms of the indenture. We settled these conversions with aggregate cash\npayments totaling $610 million, which included $608 million in principal repayments, $2 million for accrued interest and a nominal cash payment in lieu of\nfractional shares, and the issuance of 1.9 million shares of Class C capital stock.\nIn September 2024, we received 2.1 million shares of Class C capital stock from the settlement of the capped call transactions we entered into in\nconnection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes. Under applicable Washington State law, the acquisition of a corporation’s own shares is not disclosed\nseparately as treasury stock in the financial statements and such shares are treated as authorized but unissued shares. We record acquisitions of our shares of\ncapital stock as a reduction to capital stock at the par value of the shares reacquired, then to additional paid-in capital until it is depleted to a nominal amount,\nwith any further excess recorded to retained earnings. We recorded an offsetting increase to additional paid-in capital for the unwind of the capped call\ntransactions.\nThere were no repurchases of Notes during the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and in\naccordance with our Repurchase Authorizations, we repurchased $88 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes through open market transactions\nfor $89 million in cash, including accrued interest, resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1 million, recognized in our condensed consolidated\nstatements of operations. On or after November 15, 2024, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity\ndate for the 2025 Notes, holders may convert the 2025 Notes at their option at the applicable Conversion Rate then in effect. Any conversions of the 2025\nNotes will be settled on the maturity date.\nOn October 8, 2024, we submitted notice to the trustee to exercise our right to redeem the remaining $499 million in aggregate principal amount of the\n2026 Notes on December 18, 2024 (the “Redemption Date”). We have elected to settle any conversions through a combination of cash and shares of Class C\ncapital stock. The 2026 Notes may be converted by the holders at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on December 17, 2024. The conversion rate\nfor the 2026 Notes is 22.9830 shares of Class C capital stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2026 Notes converted (subject to adjustment under certain\ncircumstances as set forth in the indenture governing the 2026 Notes). For any holder of the 2026 Notes that does not elect to convert their 2026 Notes, we will\nbe required to redeem the 2026 Notes in cash at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and\nunpaid interest to, but excluding, the Redemption Date. These settlements will reduce our outstanding convertible senior notes, net of current portion in our\ncondensed consolidated balance sheet.\n20\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes certain details related to the capped call confirmations with respect to the 2026 Notes:\nMaturity Date Initial Cap Price Cap Price Premium\nSeptember 1, 2026 $ 80.5750 150 %\nFor additional details related to our Notes, see Note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\nNote 8. Income Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States (federal and state) and certain foreign jurisdictions. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, we have provided a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets that we believe, based on the weight of available evidence, are not more likely\nthan not to be realized. We have accumulated federal tax losses of approximately $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2023, which are available to reduce future\ntaxable income. We have accumulated state tax losses of approximately $56 million (tax effected) as of December 31, 2023.\nOur income tax expense or benefit for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any,\nthat are taken into account for the relevant period. We update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate on a quarterly basis and make year-to-date\nadjustments to the tax provision or benefit, as applicable. Income tax expense was not material for the three or nine month periods ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023.\nNote 9. Share Repurchase Authorizations\nThe Board has authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of our Class A common stock, Class C capital stock, outstanding Notes or a combination\nthereof. For additional information on these authorizations, see Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\nRepurchases of stock under the Repurchase Authorizations may be made in open-market transactions or privately negotiated transactions, or in such other\nmanner as deemed appropriate by management, and may be made from time to time as determined by management depending on market conditions, share\nprice, trading volume, cash needs and other business factors, in each case as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. As of September 30,\n2024, $381 million remained available for future repurchases pursuant to the Repurchase Authorizations.\nThere were no share repurchases during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

We regularly evaluate the status of legal proceedings in which we are\ninvolved to assess whether a loss is probable or there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or additional loss may have been incurred to determine if accruals\nare appropriate. We further evaluate each legal proceeding to assess whether an estimate of possible loss or range of loss can be made if accruals are not\nappropriate. For certain cases described below, management is unable to provide a meaningful estimate of the possible loss or range of possible loss because,\namong other reasons, (i) the proceedings are in preliminary stages; (ii) specific damages have not been sought; (iii) damages sought are, in our view,\nunsupported and/or exaggerated; (iv) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions; (v) there are significant factual issues to be resolved;\nand/or (vi) there are novel legal issues or unsettled legal theories presented. For these cases, however, management does not believe, based on currently\navailable information, that the outcomes of these proceedings will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow. For the\nmatters discussed below, we have not recorded any material accruals as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\n23\nTable of Contents\nOn September 17, 2019, International Business Machines Corporation (“IBM”) filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Central\nDistrict of California, alleging, among other things, that the Company has infringed and continues to willfully infringe seven patents held by IBM and seeks\nunspecified damages, including a request that the amount of compensatory damages be trebled, injunctive relief and costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees. On\nNovember 8, 2019, we filed a motion to transfer venue and/or to dismiss the complaint. On December 2, 2019, IBM filed an amended complaint, and on\nDecember 16, 2019 we filed a renewed motion to transfer venue and/or to dismiss the complaint. The Company’s motion to transfer venue to the U.S. District\nCourt for the Western District of Washington (the “Court”) was granted on May 28, 2020. On September 18, 2020, we filed four Inter Partes Review (“IPR”)\npetitions before the U.S. Patent and Trial Appeal Board (“PTAB”) seeking the PTAB’s review of the patentability with respect to three of the patents asserted\nby IBM in the lawsuit. On March 15, 2021, the PTAB instituted IPR proceedings with respect to two of the three patents for which we filed petitions. On\nMarch 22, 2021, the PTAB denied institution with respect to the last of the three patents. On January 22, 2021, the Court partially stayed the action with respect\nto all patents for which we filed an IPR and set forth a motion schedule. On March 8, 2021, IBM filed its second amended complaint. On March 25, 2021, we\nfiled an amended motion for judgment on the pleadings. On July 15, 2021, the Court rendered an order in connection with the motion for judgment on the\npleadings finding in our favor on two of the four patents on which we filed our motion. On August 31, 2021, the Court ruled that the parties will proceed with\nrespect to the two patents for which it previously denied judgment, and vacated the stay with respect to one of the three patents for which Zillow filed an IPR,\nwhich stay was later reinstated by stipulation of the parties on May 18, 2022. On September 23, 2021, IBM filed a notice of appeal with the United States Court\nof Appeals for the Federal Circuit with respect to the August 31, 2021 judgment entered, which judgment was affirmed by the Federal Circuit on October 17,\n2022. On March 3, 2022, the PTAB ruled on Zillow’s two remaining IPRs finding that Zillow was able to prove certain claims unpatentable, and others it was\nnot. On October 28, 2022, the Court found one of the two patents upon which the parties were proceeding in this action as invalid, and dismissed IBM’s claim\nrelating to that patent. Following the Court’s ruling, on October 28, 2022, the parties filed a joint stipulation with the Court seeking a stay of this action, which\nwas granted by the Court on November 1, 2022. On November 25, 2022, Zillow filed a motion to join an IPR petition within Ebates Performance Mktg., Inc.\nd/b/a Rakuten Rewards v. Int’l Bus. Machs. Corp. (“Rakuten IPR”), IPR2022-00646 concerning the final remaining patent in this action, which the Court\ngranted on April 20, 2023. On October 11, 2023, the PTAB ruled on the Rakuten IPR finding the claims of the patent asserted against Zillow unpatentable.\nIBM appealed the PTAB’s decision on November 21, 2023 (the “PTAB Appeal”), and cross appeals were filed by Ebates Performance Marketing Inc. on\nNovember 21, 2023 and by us on December 15, 2023. On March 20, 2024, IBM voluntarily dismissed all claims filed in this action against Zillow with\nprejudice, with the exception of those pertaining to the patent asserted within the pending PTAB Appeal. On June 21, 2024 we filed our response to the PTAB\nAppeal. On July 30, 2024, IBM filed its reply in further support of the PTAB Appeal. On September 3, 2024, we filed our reply in further support of our cross-\nappeal. There is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred related to this matter; however, the possible loss or range of loss is not estimable. We deny\nthe allegations of any wrongdoing and intend to vigorously defend the claims in the lawsuit.\nOn July 21, 2020, IBM filed a second action against us in Court, alleging, among other things, that the Company has infringed and continues to willfully\ninfringe five patents held by IBM and seeks unspecified damages. On September 14, 2020, we filed a motion to dismiss the complaint filed in the action, to\nwhich IBM responded by the filing of an amended complaint on November 5, 2020. On December 18, 2020, we filed a motion to dismiss IBM’s first amended\ncomplaint. On December 23, 2020, the Court issued a written order staying this case in full. On July 23, 2021, we filed an IPR with the PTAB with respect to\none patent included in the second lawsuit. On October 6, 2021, the stay of this action was lifted, except for proceedings relating to the one patent for which we\nfiled an IPR. On December 1, 2021, the Court dismissed the fourth claim asserted by IBM in its amended complaint. On December 16, 2021 Zillow filed a\nmotion to dismiss the remaining claims alleged in IBM’s amended complaint. On March 9, 2022, the Court granted Zillow’s motion to dismiss in full,\ndismissing IBM’s claims related to all the patents asserted by IBM in this action, except for the one patent for which an IPR was still pending. On March 10,\n2022, the PTAB rendered its decision denying Zillow’s IPR. On August 1, 2022, IBM filed an appeal of the Court’s ruling with respect to two of the dismissed\npatents, which ruling was affirmed by the appeals court on January 9, 2024. On March 20, 2024, IBM voluntarily dismissed all claims filed in this action\nagainst Zillow with prejudice and the Clerk of Court was directed to close the case.\n24\nTable of Contents\nOn November 16, 2021, November 19, 2021 and January 6, 2022, three purported class action lawsuits were filed against us and certain of our executive\nofficers, alleging, among other things, violations of federal securities laws on behalf of a class of those who purchased our stock between August 7, 2020 and\nNovember 2, 2021. The three purported class action lawsuits, captioned Barua v. Zillow Group, Inc. et al., Silverberg v. Zillow Group, et al. and Hillier v.\nZillow Group, Inc. et al. were brought in Court and were consolidated on February 16, 2022 (the “Federal Securities Suit”). On May 12, 2022, the plaintiffs\nfiled their amended consolidated complaint which alleges, among other things, that we issued materially false and misleading statements regarding our Zillow\nOffers business. The complaints seek to recover, among other things, alleged damages sustained by the purported class members as a result of the alleged\nmisconduct. We moved to dismiss the amended consolidated complaint on July 11, 2022, plaintiffs filed their opposition to the motion to dismiss on September\n2, 2022, and we filed a reply in support of the motion to dismiss on October 11, 2022. On December 7, 2022, the Court rendered its decision granting\ndefendants’ motion to dismiss, in part, and denying the motion, in part. On January 23, 2023, the defendants filed their answer to the consolidated complaint.\nOn March 14, 2024, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification, we filed our opposition on April 26, 2024 and plaintiffs filed their reply on June 7, 2024. On\nAugust 16, 2024, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, and on September 13, 2024, we filed our answer to the amended complaint. On August 23, 2024, the\nCourt issued an order granting class certification. On September 6, 2024, we filed a petition for permission to appeal the class certification order, on September\n16, 2024 plaintiffs filed their opposition to our petition, and on September 23, 2024, we filed our reply in further support of the petition. On October 24, 2024,\nthe Ninth Circuit issued an order granting Zillow permission to appeal. On November 1, 2024, the Court issued an order staying the Federal Securities Suit\npending the outcome of the appeal. There is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred related to this matter; however, the possible loss or range of\nloss is not estimable. We deny the allegations of any wrongdoing and intend to vigorously defend the claims in this consolidated lawsuit.\nOn March 10, 2022, May 5, 2022 and July 20, 2022, shareholder derivative suits were filed in Court and on July 25, 2022, a shareholder derivative suit\nwas filed in the Superior Court of the State of Washington, King County (the “2022 State Suit”), against us and certain of our executive officers and directors\nseeking unspecified damages on behalf of the Company and certain other relief, such as reform to corporate governance practices. The plaintiffs (including the\nCompany as a nominal defendant) allege, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by failing to maintain an effective system of\ninternal controls, which purportedly caused the losses the Company incurred when it decided to wind down Zillow Offers operations. Plaintiffs also allege,\namong other things, violations of Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, insider trading and waste of corporate assets. On\nJune 1, 2022 and September 14, 2022, the Court issued orders consolidating the three federal derivative suits and staying the consolidated action until further\norder of the Court, which stay was further continued by the Court on September 6, 2023. On September 15, 2022, the Superior Court of the State of\nWashington entered a temporary stay in the 2022 State Suit. Upon the filing of the defendants’ answer in the related securities class action lawsuit on January\n23, 2023, the stay in the 2022 State Suit was lifted. A partial stay was then reentered in the 2022 State Suit, which expired on February 1, 2024. On May 17,\n2024, the Superior Court issued an order staying the 2022 State Suit. On August 23, 2023, a second shareholder derivative suit was filed in the Superior Court\nof the State of Washington, King County (the “2023 State Suit”). On May 24, 2024, we filed a motion to dismiss and/or a motion to stay the 2023 State Suit.\nOn September 13, 2024, the Superior Court issued an order staying the 2023 State Suit. On October 31, 2024, a shareholder derivative suit was filed in the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Western District of Washington, which is substantially similar to the other shareholder derivative suits. There is a reasonable possibility\nthat a loss may be incurred related to this matter; however, the possible loss or range of loss is not estimable. The defendants deny the allegations of any\nwrongdoing and vigorously defend the claims in these lawsuits.\nIn addition to the matters discussed above, from time to time, we are involved in litigation and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business.\nAlthough we cannot be certain of the outcome of any such litigation or claims, nor the amount of damages and exposure that we could incur, we currently\nbelieve that the final disposition of such matters will not have a material effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flow. Regardless\nof the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.\nIndemnifications\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements under which we agree to provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to\nbusiness partners and other parties with respect to certain matters. For additional information regarding our indemnifications, see Note 16 in the Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\n25\nTable of Contents\nNote 13.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial\nstatements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition to historical financial information, the following\ndiscussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results may differ materially from those described in or\nimplied by any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including in the section titled “Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” and those factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A\n(Risk Factors) of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nOverview of our Business\nZillow Group is reimagining real estate to make home a reality for more and more people. As the most visited real estate website in the United States,\nZillow and its affiliates help people find and get the home they want by connecting them with digital solutions, dedicated partners and agents, and easier\nbuying, selling, financing and renting experiences.\nOur portfolio of affiliates, subsidiaries and brands includes Zillow Premier Agent, Zillow Home Loans, our mortgage origination business and affiliate\nlender, Zillow Rentals, Trulia, StreetEasy, HotPads and Out East. In addition, Zillow Group provides a comprehensive suite of marketing software and\ntechnology solutions for the real estate industry, including ShowingTime+, Spruce and Follow Up Boss.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had 6,835 employees, compared to 6,263 employees as of December 31, 2023.\nHealth of Housing Market\nOur financial performance is impacted by changes in the health of the housing market, which is impacted, in turn, by general economic conditions.\nCurrent market factors have been driven by low housing inventory, volatility in mortgage interest rates, volatility in rental occupancy rates, as well as home\nprice fluctuations and inflationary conditions. These factors may impact the number of transactions consumers complete using our products and services and\ndemand for our advertising services. According to industry data from NAR, total transaction value increased 2% during the three months ended September 30,\n2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 3% during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months\nended September 30, 2023. Despite the current market factors mentioned above, we continue to invest in the growth of our business. We believe this continued\ninvestment has resulted in year over year total revenue results, described below, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the\nsame periods in the prior year, that exceeded industry performance for the same periods. The extent to which market factors impact our results and financial\nposition will depend on future developments, which are uncertain and difficult to predict.\nRevenue Overview\nOur revenue is classified into four categories: Residential, Rentals, Mortgages and Other.\nResidential. Residential revenue includes revenue generated by our Premier Agent and new construction marketplaces, as well as revenue from the sale of\nadvertising and business technology solutions for real estate professionals through StreetEasy for-sale product offerings, ShowingTime+, including Listing\nShowcase, and upon acquisition on December 8, 2023, Follow Up Boss.\nPremier Agent revenue is generated by the sale of advertising services, as well as marketing and technology products and services, to help real estate\nagents and brokers grow and manage their businesses and brands. We offer these products and services through our Premier Agent program. Premier Agent\nproducts, which include the delivery of validated customer connections, or leads, are offered on a share of voice (“market-based pricing”) and pay for\nperformance (“Flex”) basis. For our market-based pricing offering, connections are distributed to Premier Agent partners in proportion to their share of voice,\nor a Premier Agent partner’s share of total advertising purchased in a particular zip code. With the Flex model, Premier Agent partners are provided with\nvalidated leads at no initial cost and pay a performance advertising fee only when a real estate transaction is closed with one of the leads, generally within two\nyears.\nNew construction revenue primarily includes advertising services sold to home builders on a cost per residential community or cost per impression basis.\nRevenue generated through ShowingTime+ includes ShowingTime revenue, which is primarily generated by Appointment Center, a software-as-a-service\nand call center solution allowing real estate agents, brokerages and multiple listing\n27\nTable of Contents\nservices to efficiently schedule real estate viewing appointments on behalf of their customers. Appointment Center services also include call center specialists\nwho provide scheduling support to customers. ShowingTime+ revenue also includes our dotloop real estate transaction management software-as-a-service\nsolution, as well as Zillow Showcase, a listing marketing package.\nRentals. Rentals revenue includes advertising and a suite of tools sold to property managers on a cost per lead, lease, listing or impression basis or for a\nfixed fee for certain advertising packages through both the Zillow and StreetEasy brands. Rentals revenue also includes revenue generated from our rental\napplications product, through which potential renters can submit applications to multiple properties for a flat service fee.\nMortgages. Mortgages revenue primarily includes revenue generated through mortgage originations and the related sale of mortgages on the secondary\nmarket through Zillow Home Loans and from advertising sold to mortgage lenders and other mortgage professionals on a cost per lead basis, including our\nCustom Quote and Connect services.\nOther. Other revenue includes revenue generated primarily by display advertising.\nFor additional information on our revenue categories, see Note 2 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\nFinancial Overview\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated total revenue of $581 million and $496 million, respectively, an increase of 17%.\nThe increase in total revenue was primarily attributable to the following:\n• Residential revenue increased by $43 million, or 12%, to $405 million, due to increases in residential revenue per visit and the number of visits.\n• Rentals revenue increased by $24 million, or 24%, to $123 million, due to increases in average monthly rentals unique visitors and quarterly\nrevenue per average monthly rentals unique visitor.\n• Mortgages revenue increased by $15 million, or 63%, to $39 million, driven by an increase in mortgage originations revenue.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated gross profit of $441 million and $386 million, respectively, an increase of\n14%.\nKey Metrics\nManagement has identified visits, unique users and the volume of loans originated through Zillow Home Loans as relevant to investors’ and others’\nassessment of our financial condition and results of operations.\nVisits\nThe number of visits is an important metric because it is an indicator of consumers’ level of engagement with our mobile applications, websites and other\nservices. We believe highly engaged consumers are more likely to use our products and services, including Zillow Homes Loans, or be transaction-ready real\nestate market participants and therefore more sought-after by our Premier Agent partners.\nWe define a visit as a group of interactions by users with our Zillow, Trulia and StreetEasy mobile applications and websites. A single visit can contain\nmultiple page views and actions, and a single user can open multiple visits across domains, web browsers, desktop or mobile devices. Visits can occur on the\nsame day, or over several days, weeks or months.\nPrior to January 1, 2024, we measured visits to Zillow and StreetEasy using the Universal Analytics version of Google Analytics’ traffic measurement\nplatform. Through Universal Analytics, visits to Zillow and StreetEasy ended either: (i) after thirty minutes of user inactivity or at midnight; or (ii) through a\ncampaign change. A visit ends through a campaign change if a visitor arrived via one campaign or source (for example, via a search engine or referring link on\na third-party website), left the mobile application or website, and then returned via another campaign or source.\n28\nTable of Contents\nUniversal Analytics is no longer offered by Google as of July 1, 2024 and has been replaced by Google Analytics 4. As a result of this change, from\nJanuary 1, 2024 through June 30, 2024, we measured visits to Zillow using an internal measurement tool, but continued to use Universal Analytics to measure\nvisits to StreetEasy. As of July 1, 2024, we measure visits to both Zillow and StreetEasy using an internal measurement tool, and visits to Zillow and StreetEasy\nend after thirty minutes of user inactivity or at midnight. Trulia continues to measure visits with Adobe Analytics, and visits to Trulia end after thirty minutes of\nuser inactivity.\nWe believe the use of an internal measurement tool to measure visits to Zillow and StreetEasy allows us to maintain control over and provide greater\ninsight into our end-to-end data as we enhance our broader long-term analytics strategy, while also becoming less reliant on third-party providers. We have\nrecast prior period visits to Zillow to conform with the current period measurement methodology. The change in our measurement platform for visits resulted in\nan approximately 10% decrease in reported visits for both the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by the methodology\nfor campaign changes.\nThe following table presents the number of visits to our mobile applications and websites for the periods presented (in millions, except percentages),\nrecast for prior periods, as described above:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2023 to 2024\nSeptember 30,\n2023 to 2024\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\nVisits 2,440 2,366 3 % 7,251 6,995 4 %\nUnique Users\nMeasuring unique users is important to us because much of our revenue depends in part on our ability to connect home buyers and sellers, renters and\nindividuals with or looking for a mortgage to real estate, rental and mortgage professionals, products and services. Growth in consumer traffic to our mobile\napplications and websites increases the number of impressions, clicks, connections, leads and other events we can monetize to generate revenue. For example,\nour revenue depends in part, on users accessing our mobile applications and websites to engage in the sale, purchase, renting and financing of homes, including\nwith Zillow Home Loans, and a significant portion of our Residential revenue, Rentals revenue and Other revenue depend on advertisements being served to\nusers of our mobile applications and websites.\nWe count a unique user the first time an individual accesses one of our mobile applications using a mobile device during a calendar month and the first\ntime an individual accesses one of our websites using a web browser during a calendar month. If an individual accesses our mobile applications using different\nmobile devices within a given month, the first instance of access by each such mobile device is counted as a separate unique user. If an individual accesses\nmore than one of our mobile applications within a given month, the first access to each mobile application is counted as a separate unique user. If an individual\naccesses our websites using different web browsers within a given month, the first access by each such web browser is counted as a separate unique user. If an\nindividual accesses more than one of our websites in a single month, the first access to each website is counted as a separate unique user since unique users are\ntracked separately for each domain.\nPrior to January 1, 2024, we measured unique users for Zillow, StreetEasy and HotPads using Universal Analytics. As discussed above, Universal\nAnalytics is no longer offered as of July 1, 2024 and has been replaced by Google Analytics 4. As a result of this change, from January 1, 2024 through June\n30, 2024, we measured unique users for Zillow using an internal measurement tool, but continued to use Universal Analytics to measure unique users for\nStreetEasy and HotPads. As of July 1, 2024, we measure visits to Zillow, StreetEasy and HotPads using an internal measurement tool. Trulia continues to\nmeasure unique users with Adobe Analytics.\nDue to technological limitations, user software settings, or user behavior, our internal measurement tool and Universal Analytics may assign a unique\ncookie to different instances of access by the same individual to our mobile applications and websites. In such instances, although these tools capture the\nnumber of unique users in accordance with the defined methodology, there are inherent limitations in measuring the number of unique individuals accessing\nour mobile applications and websites.\nWe believe the use of an internal measurement tool to measure unique users for Zillow, StreetEasy and HotPads allows us to maintain control over and\nprovide greater insight into our end-to-end data as we enhance our broader long-term analytics strategy, while also becoming less reliant on third-party\nproviders. We have recast prior period unique users for Zillow to conform to the current period measurement methodology. The change in our measurement\nplatform for unique users resulted in an approximately 2% increase in reported unique users for both the three and nine month periods ended September 30,\n2023.\n29\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents our average monthly unique users for the periods presented (in millions, except percentages), recast for prior periods, as\ndescribed above:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2023 to 2024\nSeptember 30,\n2023 to 2024\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\nAverage monthly unique users 233 230 1 % 227 226 — %\nLoan Origination Volume\nLoan origination volume is an important metric as it is a measure of how successful we are at the origination of mortgage loan products through our\nmortgage origination business, Zillow Home Loans, which directly impacts our Mortgages revenue. Loan origination volume represents the total value of\nmortgage loan originations closed through Zillow Home Loans during the period.\nThe following table presents loan origination volume by purpose and in total for Zillow Home Loans for the periods presented (in millions, except\npercentages):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2023 to 2024 2023 to 2024\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\nPurchase loan origination\nvolume $ 812 $ 452 80 % $ 2,169 $ 1,047 107 %\nRefinance loan origination\nvolume 7 5 40 % 14 12 17 %\nTotal loan origination\nvolume $ 819 $ 457 79 % $ 2,183 $ 1,059 106 %\nDuring the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, total loan origination volume increased 79% and 106%, respectively, compared to\nthe three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2023. These increases were primarily driven by the continued growth in Zillow Home Loans purchase\nloan originations as we prioritize growth in Zillow Home Loans purchase originations.\nResults of Operations\nGiven continued uncertainty surrounding the health of the housing market, interest rate environment and inflationary conditions, financial performance\nfor current and prior periods may not be indicative of future performance.\nRevenue\n% of Total Revenue\nThree Months Ended Three Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 to 2024 September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change 2024 2023\n(in millions, except percentages, unaudited)\nResidential $ 405 $ 362 $ 43 12 % 70 % 73 %\nRentals 123 99 24 24 21 20\nMortgages 39 24 15 63 7 5\nOther 14 11 3 27 2 2\nTotal revenue $ 581 $ 496 $ 85 17 % 100 % 100 %\n30\nTable of Contents\n% of Total Revenue\nNine Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 to 2024 September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change 2024 2023\n(in millions, except percentages, unaudited)\nResidential $ 1,207 $ 1,103 $ 104 9 % 72 % 75 %\nRentals 337 264 73 28 20 18\nMortgages 104 74 30 41 6 5\nOther 34 30 4 13 2 2\nTotal revenue $ 1,682 $ 1,471 $ 211 14 % 100 % 100 %\nThree months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023\nTotal revenue increased $85 million, or 17%, to $581 million:\n• Residential revenue increased $43 million, or 12%. The increase in Residential revenue was partially driven by an 8% increase in Residential\nrevenue per visit to $0.166 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $0.153 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily\ndue to the inclusion of revenue from Follow Up Boss, which we acquired in December 2023, growth in our Premier Agent revenue primarily due to\ncontinued improvement in our ability to convert connections into transactions, an increase in ShowingTime+ revenue as we expanded software\nservices available to sellers and listing agents, and growth in our new construction revenue. We calculate Residential revenue per visit by dividing\nthe revenue generated by our Residential offerings by the number of visits in the period. Residential revenue was also positively impacted by a 3%\nincrease in the number of visits for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from the three months ended September 30, 2023. We expect\nResidential revenue to decrease in absolute dollars during the three months ending December 31, 2024, primarily due to the impact of seasonality\non the residential real estate market.\n• Rentals revenue increased $24 million, or 24%. The increase in Rentals revenue was primarily due to growth in average monthly rentals unique\nvisitors, which increased 20% to 36 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 30 million during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. We have estimated average monthly rentals unique visitors using Comscore data as of September 2024, which measures\naverage monthly unique visitors on rental listings on Zillow, Trulia and HotPads mobile apps and websites. The increase in Rentals revenue was\nalso driven by a 4% increase in quarterly revenue per average monthly rentals unique visitor to $3.42 for the three months ended September 30,\n2024, from $3.30 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by growth in multifamily property listings, which drove a 38%\nincrease in multifamily rentals revenue. We calculate quarterly revenue per average monthly rentals unique visitor by dividing total Rentals revenue\nfor the period by the average monthly rentals unique visitors for the period and then dividing by the number of quarters in the period.\n• Mortgages revenue increased $15 million, or 63%. This increase was primarily driven by a $16 million increase in mortgage originations revenue.\nThe increase in mortgage originations revenue was primarily due to a 79% increase in total loan origination volume to $819 million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 from $457 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by continued growth in\nZillow Home Loans purchase loan origination volume. The increase in mortgage originations revenue was also attributable to a 21% increase in\ngain on sale margin. Gain on sale margin represents the net gain on sale of mortgage loans divided by total loan origination volume for the period.\nNet gain on sale of mortgage loans includes all components related to the origination and sale of mortgage loans, including the net gain on sale of\nloans into the secondary market, loan origination fees, unrealized gains and losses associated with changes in fair value of IRLCs and mortgage\nloans held for sale, realized and unrealized gains or losses from derivative financial instruments and the provision for losses relating to\nrepresentations and warranties.\n31\nTable of Contents\nNine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023\nTotal revenue increased $211 million, or 14%, to $1.7 billion:\n• Residential revenue increased $104 million, or 9%. The increase in Residential revenue was driven by a 6% increase in Residential revenue per\nvisit to $0.166 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $0.158 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the\ninclusion of revenue from Follow Up Boss, which we acquired in December 2023, growth in our Premier Agent revenue primarily due to continued\nimprovement in our ability to convert connections into transactions, an increase in ShowingTime+ revenue as we expanded software services\navailable to sellers and listing agents, and accelerating growth in our new construction revenue. The increase in Residential revenue was also\nattributable to a 4% increase in the number of visits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023.\n• Rentals revenue increased $73 million, or 28%. The increase in Rentals revenue was primarily due to a 24% increase in quarterly revenue per\naverage monthly rentals unique visitor to $3.62 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $2.93 for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, primarily driven by growth in multifamily property listings, which drove a 42% increase in multifamily rentals revenue. The\nincrease in rentals revenue was also due to growth in the number of average monthly rentals unique visitors, which increased 3% to 31 million\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 30 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n• Mortgages revenue increased $30 million, or 41%. This increase was driven by a $45 million increase in mortgage originations revenue, partially\noffset by a $12 million decrease in Custom Quote and Connect advertising services revenue. The increase in mortgage originations revenue was\nprimarily due to a 106% increase in total loan origination volume to $2.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $1.1 billion\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by continued growth in Zillow Home Loans purchase loan origination volume.\nThe increase in mortgage originations revenue was also attributable to a 20% increase in gain on sale margin. The increase in mortgage originations\nrevenue was partially offset by a $12 million decrease in Custom Quote and Connect advertising services revenue, which was primarily due to a\n20% decrease in leads generated from marketing products sold to mortgage professionals. This decrease in leads was primarily driven by our focus\non organic growth of our mortgage origination business.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nThe following table summarizes net loss and Adjusted EBITDA (in millions, except percentages):\n% of Revenue\nThree Months Ended Three Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 to 2024 September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change 2024 2023\nNet loss $ (20) $ (28) $ 8 29 % (3)% (6)%\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 127 $ 107 $ 20 19 % 22 % 22 %\n% of Revenue\nNine Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 to 2024 September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change 2024 2023\nNet loss $ (60) $ (85) $ 25 29 % (4)% (6)%\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 386 $ 322 $ 64 20 % 23 % 22 %\nTo provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have disclosed Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, in\nthis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We have provided a reconciliation below of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial\nmeasure.\nWe have included Adjusted EBITDA in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as it is a key metric used by our management and Board to measure\noperating performance and trends and to prepare and approve our annual budget. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted\nEBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis.\n32\nTable of Contents\nOur use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider this measure in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of\nour results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of share-based compensation;\n• Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditures or contractual\ncommitments;\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect impairment and restructuring costs;\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect acquisition-related costs;\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect loss on extinguishment of debt;\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense or other income, net;\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income taxes; and\n• Other companies, including companies in our own industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently from the way we do, limiting its\nusefulness as a comparative measure.\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash-flow\nmetrics, net loss and our other GAAP results.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss for each of the periods presented (in millions, unaudited):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Loss:\nNet loss $ (20) $ (28) $ (60) $ (85)\nIncome taxes — — 4 1\nOther income, net (34) (34) (101) (108)\nDepreciation and amortization 63 49 178 134\nShare-based compensation 108 109 329 342\nImpairment and restructuring costs — 1 6 9\nAcquisition-related costs 1 1 1 2\nLoss on extinguishment of debt — — 1 —\nInterest expense 9 9 28 27\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 127 $ 107 $ 386 $ 322\n33\nTable of Contents\nCosts and Expenses, Gross Profit and Other Items\n% of Total Revenue\nThree Months Ended Three Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 to 2024 September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change 2024 2023\n(in millions, except percentages, unaudited)\nCost of revenue $ 140 $ 110 $ 30 27 % 24 % 22 %\nGross profit 441 386 55 14 76 78\nOperating expenses:\nSales and marketing 217 164 53 32 37 33\nTechnology and development 145 142 3 2 25 29\nGeneral and administrative 123 131 (8) (6) 21 26\nImpairment and restructuring costs — 1 (1) (100) — —\nAcquisition-related costs 1 1 — — — —\nTotal operating expenses 486 439 47 11 84 89\nOther income, net 34 34 — — 6 7\nInterest expense 9 9 — — 2 2\nIncome tax expense — — — — — —\n% of Total Revenue\nNine Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 to 2024 September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change 2024 2023\n(in millions, except percentages, unaudited)\nCost of revenue $ 393 $ 306 $ 87 28 % 23 % 21 %\nGross profit 1,289 1,165 124 11 77 79\nOperating expenses:\nSales and marketing 588 493 95 19 35 34\nTechnology and development 436 419 17 4 26 28\nGeneral and administrative 386 407 (21) (5) 23 28\nImpairment and restructuring costs 6 9 (3) (33) — 1\nAcquisition-related costs 1 2 (1) (50) — —\nTotal operating expenses 1,417 1,330 87 7 84 90\nLoss on extinguishment of debt 1 — 1 — — —\nOther income, net 101 108 (7) (6) 6 7\nInterest expense 28 27 1 4 2 2\nIncome tax expense 4 1 3 300 — —\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists of expenses related to operating our mobile applications and websites, including associated headcount-related expenses, such as\nsalaries, benefits, bonuses and share-based compensation expense, as well as revenue-sharing costs related to our commercial business relationships,\ndepreciation expense, and costs associated with hosting our mobile applications and websites. Cost of revenue also includes amortization costs related to\ncapitalized website and development activities, amortization of software, amortization of certain intangible assets and other costs to obtain data used to\npopulate our mobile applications and websites, and amortization of certain intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions, including developed\ntechnology. Cost of revenue also includes credit card fees and ad serving costs paid to third parties, direct costs to provide our rental applications product, and\ndirect costs to originate mortgage loans, including underwriting and processing costs.\n34\nTable of Contents\nThree months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023\nCost of revenue increased $30 million, or 27%, primarily driven by increases of $14 million in depreciation and amortization expense primarily due to an\nincrease in amortization of website development costs, $4 million in mortgage loan processing costs due to increased purchase loan origination volume, $3\nmillion in lead acquisition costs related to partnerships, and $2 million in connectivity costs.\nNine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023\nCost of revenue increased $87 million, or 28%, primarily driven by increases of $47 million in depreciation and amortization expense primarily due to an\nincrease in amortization of website development costs, $12 million in mortgage loan processing costs due to increased purchase loan origination volume, $7\nmillion in lead acquisition costs related to partnerships, $5 million in connectivity costs, and $4 million in headcount-related expenses, including share-based\ncompensation expense.\nGross Profit\nGross profit is calculated as revenue less cost of revenue. Gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue. Our gross profit has and will\ncontinue to be affected by a number of factors, including the mix of revenue from our various product offerings.\nThree months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023\nGross profit increased by $55 million, or 14%, primarily due to an increase in revenue, discussed above. Total gross margin decreased from 78% to 76%.\nNine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023\nGross profit increased by $124 million, or 11%, primarily due to an increase in revenue, discussed above. Total gross margin decreased from 79% to 77%.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist of advertising costs and other sales expenses related to promotional and marketing activities, headcount-related\nexpenses, including salaries, commissions, benefits, bonuses and share-based compensation expense for sales, sales support, customer support, including the\ncustomer connections team and mortgage loan officers and specialists, marketing and public relations employees, depreciation expense and amortization of\ncertain intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions, including trade names and trademarks and customer relationships.\nThree months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023\nSales and marketing expenses increased $53 million, or 32%, due to increases of $25 million in marketing and advertising costs as we continue to invest\nin the growth of our rentals marketplace and $23 million in headcount-related expenses, including share-based compensation expense. We expect sales and\nmarketing expenses to decrease in absolute dollars during the three months ending December 31, 2024 as marketing and advertising costs decrease in line with\ntypical seasonal media spend.\nNine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023\nSales and marketing expenses increased $95 million, or 19%, due to increases of $52 million in headcount-related expenses, including share-based\ncompensation expense, $33 million in marketing and advertising costs as we continue to invest in the growth of our rentals marketplace, and $4 million in\ntravel expenses.\nTechnology and Development\nTechnology and development expenses consist of headcount-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and share-based compensation\nexpense for individuals engaged in the design, development and testing of our products, mobile applications and websites and the tools and applications that\nsupport our products. Technology and development expenses also include equipment and maintenance costs and depreciation expense.\n35\nTable of Contents\nThree months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023\nTechnology and development expenses increased $3 million, or 2%, due primarily to an increase of $3 million in headcount-related expenses, including\nshare-based compensation expense.\nNine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023\nTechnology and development expenses increased $17 million, or 4%, due to increases of $19 million in headcount-related expenses, including share-\nbased compensation expense, as we continue to invest in human capital to grow our businesses, $7 million in software and hardware costs, and $3 million in\ntravel expenses. These increases were partially offset by a $10 million decrease in third-party professional service fees driven by active cost management.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist of headcount-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and share-based compensation expense\nfor executive, finance, accounting, legal, human resources, recruiting, corporate information technology costs and other administrative support. General and\nadministrative expenses also include legal settlement costs and estimated legal liabilities, legal, accounting and other third-party professional service fees, rent\nexpense, depreciation expense and bad debt expense.\nThree months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $8 million, or 6%, primarily due to a $6 million decrease in third party professional service fees driven by\nactive cost management and a $5 million decrease in rent expense primarily driven by cost savings associated with changes in the use of certain office space in\nour lease portfolio. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $4 million due to the change in fair value of contingent consideration associated with\nour acquisition of Follow Up Boss.\nNine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $21 million, or 5%, primarily due to a decrease of $18 million in headcount-related expenses, including\nshare-based compensation expense. The decrease in headcount-related expenses was primarily driven by $18 million in share-based compensation expense\nassociated with the departures of certain executive personnel incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in general and\nadministrative expenses was also due to a $12 million decrease in rent expense primarily driven by cost savings associated with changes in the use of certain\noffice space in our lease portfolio. These decreases were partially offset by increases of $8 million due to the change in fair value of contingent consideration\nassociated with our acquisition of Follow Up Boss and $3 million in travel expenses.\nImpairment and Restructuring Costs\nImpairment and restructuring costs were not material for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Impairment and restructuring costs were\n$6 million and $9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and were primarily associated with changes in the use of\ncertain office space in our lease portfolio. Impairment and restructuring costs incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 also included $3\nmillion that pertained to employee termination costs.\nOther Income, net\nOther income, net consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and investments and fair value adjustments on an\noutstanding warrant.\nOther income, net decreased $7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and\nwas primarily driven by fair value adjustments on an outstanding warrant, partially offset by increases in returns on investments due to the higher interest rate\nenvironment as compared to the prior year period.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States (federal and state) and certain foreign jurisdictions. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, we have provided a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets that we believe, based on the weight of available evidence, are not more likely\nthan not to be realized. There is a reasonable possibility that within the next several years, sufficient positive evidence will become available to demonstrate\nthat a significant\n36\nTable of Contents\nportion of the valuation allowance against our U.S. net deferred tax assets will no longer be required. We have accumulated federal tax losses of approximately\n$1.4 billion as of December 31, 2023, which are available to reduce future taxable income. We have accumulated state tax losses of approximately $56 million\n(tax effected) as of December 31, 2023.\nIncome tax expense was not material for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nIn 2021, the OECD, a global policy forum, released Pillar Two, designed to ensure that multinational groups with consolidated financial statement\nrevenue in excess of €750 million annually pay a minimum 15% tax in each jurisdiction in which they operate. The OECD continues to release guidance and\ncountries are implementing legislation to adopt these rules, which are expected to be effective for accounting periods beginning on or after December 31, 2023.\nThe United States has not yet enacted legislation implementing Pillar Two. We have evaluated the impact of these rules and currently believe they will not have\na material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows due to certain transitional safe harbors. We will continue to monitor and refine\nour assessment as further guidance is made available.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from operations, debt financing and equity offerings. Our cash requirements consist\nprincipally of working capital, general corporate needs and mortgage loan originations. We continue to invest in the development and expansion of our\noperations using available cash flows from operations. Ongoing investments include, but are not limited to, improvements in our technology platforms,\ninvestments in new products and services, and continued investments in sales and marketing. We also use cash flows from operations to service our debt\nobligations and to repurchase Class A common stock, Class C capital stock, outstanding Notes or a combination thereof through our Repurchase Authorizations\nor otherwise.\nSources of Liquidity\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash of $2.2 billion and $2.8 billion,\nrespectively. Cash and cash equivalents balances consist of operating cash on deposit with financial institutions and money market funds. Investments consist\nof fixed income securities, which include U.S. government treasury securities, investment grade corporate securities, U.S. government agency securities, and\ncommercial paper. Restricted cash primarily consists of amounts used to fund customer home purchases in our mortgage origination business. Amounts on\ndeposit with third-party financial institutions exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation insurance\nlimits, as applicable. As of September 30, 2024, Zillow Group and its subsidiaries were in compliance with all debt covenants specified in the facilities\ndescribed below.\nWe believe that cash from operations and cash and cash equivalents and investment balances will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating activities,\nworking capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and investments and other capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. We believe we will\nmeet longer-term expected future cash requirements and obligations through a combination of cash flows from operations, debt financing and equity offerings,\nas applicable.\nSummarized Cash Flow Information\nThe following table presents selected cash flow data for the periods presented (in millions, unaudited):\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nCash Flow Data:\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 306 $ 268\nNet cash provided by investing activities 121 339\nNet cash used in financing activities (847) (226)\nCash Flows Provided By Operating Activities\nOur operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from real estate professionals, rental professionals, mortgage professionals, builders and\nbrand advertisers, as well as cash received from sales of mortgages originated by Zillow Home Loans. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities\ninclude marketing and advertising activities, mortgages funded through Zillow Home Loans and employee compensation and benefits. Additionally, uses of\ncash from operating activities include costs associated with operating our mobile applications and websites and other general corporate expenditures.\n37\nTable of Contents\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was $306 million. This was driven by a net loss of $60 million,\nadjusted by share-based compensation of $329 million, depreciation and amortization of $178 million, accretion of bond discount of $23 million, amortization\nof contract cost assets of $14 million, amortization of right of use assets of $8 million, impairment costs of $6 million, amortization of debt issuance costs of $4\nmillion, and $14 million in other adjustments to reconcile net loss to cash provided by operating activities. Changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased\ncash provided by operating activities by $164 million. The changes in operating assets and liabilities are primarily related to a $73 million increase in prepaid\nexpenses and other current assets primarily due to an increase in revenue from products and services billed in arrears, a $64 million increase in mortgage loans\nheld for sale due to an increase in purchase loan origination volume, a $31 million decrease in lease liabilities due to contractual lease payments, a $21 million\nincrease in accounts receivable primarily due to an increase in revenue from products and services billed in arrears, and a $15 million increase in contract cost\nassets primarily due to capitalized sales commissions. These changes were partially offset by a $25 million increase in accounts payable driven by the timing of\npayments, an $8 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities primarily driven by the timing of billings, and a $5 million increase in\ndeferred revenue consistent with an increase in revenue.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was $268 million. This was driven by a net loss of $85 million,\nadjusted by share-based compensation of $342 million, depreciation and amortization of $134 million, accretion of bond discount of $29 million, amortization\nof right of use assets of $18 million, amortization of contract cost assets of $16 million, impairment costs of $6 million, and amortization of debt issuance costs\nof $4 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased cash provided by operating activities by $135 million. The changes in operating assets and\nliabilities are primarily related to a $55 million increase in mortgage loans held for sale due to an increase in purchase loan origination volume, a $26 million\nincrease in accounts receivable primarily due to an increase in revenue from products and services billed in arrears, a $24 million decrease in lease liabilities\ndue to contractual lease payments, a $22 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to an increase in revenue from products\nand services billed in arrears, a $16 million increase in contract cost assets primarily due to capitalized sales commissions, a $4 million decrease in other long\nterm liabilities, and a $3 million decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. These changes were partially offset by a $7 million increase in\naccounts payable and a $4 million increase in accrued compensation and benefits both driven by the timing of payments, and a $4 million increase in deferred\nrevenue.\nCash Flows Provided By Investing Activities\nOur primary investing activities include the purchase and sale or maturity of investments, the purchase of property and equipment and intangible assets,\nand cash paid in connection with acquisitions.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by investing activities was $121 million. This was the result of $251 million of net\nproceeds from maturities and sales of investments and $130 million of purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by investing activities was $339 million. This was the result of $498 million of net\nproceeds from the maturity of investments, $125 million of purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets, and $34 million of cash paid for\nacquisitions, net of cash acquired.\nCash Flows Used In Financing Activities\nOur primary financing activities include repurchases of Class A common stock and Class C capital stock, the exercise of employee option awards,\nrepayments of borrowings on the warehouse line of credit and master repurchase agreements related to Zillow Home Loans and settlement of long-term debt\nincluding a portion of the Notes.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was $847 million, which primarily related to $697 million of cash\npaid for the settlement of the 2024 Notes and partial repurchase of the 2025 Notes, and $301 million of cash paid for share repurchases. The cash outflows were\npartially offset by $96 million of proceeds from the exercise of option awards and $55 million of net borrowings on our master repurchase agreements related\nto Zillow Home Loans.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in financing activities was $226 million, which primarily related to $336 million of cash\npaid for share repurchases, partially offset by $56 million of proceeds from the exercise of option awards and $54 million of net borrowings on our warehouse\nline of credit and master repurchase agreements related to Zillow Home Loans.\n38\nTable of Contents\nCapital Resources\nNotes\nAs of September 30, 2024, we have a total of $918 million aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations,\nand interest on the Notes is paid semi-annually. The following table summarizes our Notes as of the periods presented (in millions, except interest rates):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAggregate Principal\nMaturity Date Amount Stated Interest Rate Carrying Value Carrying Value\nSeptember 1, 2026 $ 499 1.375 % $ 497 $ 496\nMay 15, 2025 419 2.75 % 418 504\nSeptember 1, 2024 — 0.75 % — 607\nTotal $ 918 $ 915 $ 1,607\nSettlement of 2024 Notes. The 2024 Notes matured on September 1, 2024. During the period from March 1, 2024 through the close of business on\nAugust 29, 2024, holders of the 2024 Notes elected to convert all outstanding 2024 Notes in accordance with the terms of the indenture. We settled these\nconversions with aggregate cash payments totaling $610 million, which included $608 million in principal repayments, $2 million for accrued interest and a\nnominal cash payment in lieu of fractional shares, and the issuance of 1.9 million shares of Class C capital stock. In September 2024, we received 2.1 million\nshares of Class C capital stock from the settlement of the capped call transactions we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes.\n2025 Notes. We may from time to time seek to redeem, retire or purchase outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for cash, shares of\nstock or a combination of cash and stock, pursuant to the redemption terms of such debt securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions\nor otherwise. Such redemptions, repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual\nrestrictions and other factors. The amounts involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material.\nThere were no repurchases of Notes during the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we\nrepurchased $88 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes through open market transactions for $89 million in cash, including accrued interest.\nOn or after November 15, 2024, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date for the 2025\nNotes, holders may convert the 2025 Notes at their option at the applicable Conversion Rate then in effect. Any conversions of the 2025 Notes will be settled\non the maturity date. We expect to settle the principal amount of the 2025 Notes in cash and any conversion premium in shares of Class C capital stock. In\naddition, we may redeem the 2025 Notes if the last reported sale price of our Class C capital stock equals or exceeds $87.36 per share (130% of the conversion\nprice) for a specified period of trading days. If we elect to redeem the 2025 Notes, we would expect to settle any conversions in cash up to the principal amount\nand shares of Class C capital stock for any conversion obligation in excess of the principal amount.\nRedemption of 2026 Notes. On October 8, 2024, we submitted notice to the trustee to exercise our right to redeem the remaining $499 million in\naggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes on December 18, 2024 (the “Redemption Date”). The 2026 Notes may be converted by the holders at any time\nprior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on December 17, 2024. The conversion rate for the 2026 Notes is 22.9830 shares of Class C capital stock per $1,000\nprincipal amount of 2026 Notes converted (subject to adjustment under certain circumstances as set forth in the indenture governing the 2026 Notes). We\nexpect to settle the principal amount of the 2026 Notes in cash and any conversion premium in shares of Class C capital stock. For any holder of the 2026\nNotes that does not elect to convert their 2026 Notes, we will be required to redeem the 2026 Notes in cash at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal\namount of 2026 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Redemption Date.\nRefer to Note 7 of our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information\nregarding our Notes, including conversion rates, conversion and redemption dates and the related capped call transactions.\n39\nTable of Contents\nShare Repurchases\nThe Board has authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of our Class A common stock, Class C capital stock, outstanding Notes or a combination\nthereof. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of Class A common stock and 6 million shares of Class C capital\nstock at an average price of $42.26 and $42.45 per share, respectively, for an aggregate purchase price of $46 million and $255 million, respectively. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, $381 million remained available for future repurchases pursuant to the Repurchase Authorizations, which repurchases decrease our\nliquidity and capital resources when effected. For additional information on these authorizations, see Notes 11 and 13 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\nCredit Facilities\nZillow Home Loans operations impact our liquidity and capital resources as a cash intensive business that funds mortgage loans originated for resale in\nthe secondary market. We primarily use debt financing to fund mortgage loan originations. The following table summarizes our master repurchase agreements\nas of the periods presented (in millions, except interest rates):\nMaximum Outstanding Outstanding Borrowings Weighted Average\nBorrowing Borrowings at at Interest Rate at\nLender Maturity Date Capacity September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2024\nJPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A.(1) May 1, 2025 $ 150 $ 78 $ 40 6.56 %\nUBS AG(2) September 5, 2025 150 70 45 6.58 %\nAtlas Securitized\nProducts, L.P.(3) March 11, 2024 — — 8 — %\nTotal $ 300 $ 148 $ 93\n(1) Agreement was amended and renewed on May 2, 2024, increasing the total maximum borrowing capacity from $100 million to $150 million.\n(2) Agreement was amended and renewed on September 6, 2024, increasing the total maximum borrowing capacity from $100 million to $150 million.\n(3) Agreement expired on March 11, 2024 and was not renewed.\nRefer to Note 7 of our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on\nZillow Group’s master repurchase agreements.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nNotes - Includes the aggregate principal amounts of the Notes due on their contractual maturity dates, as well as the associated coupon interest. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, we have an outstanding aggregate principal amount of $918 million, $419 million of which is payable within 12 months. Future interest\npayments associated with the Notes total $25 million, with $18 million payable within 12 months. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we provided notice to\nthe trustee that we will redeem the remaining $499 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes on December 18, 2024. Refer to Note 7 of our\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for maturity dates, stated interest rates and additional\ninformation on our Notes.\nCredit Facilities - Includes principal amounts due for amounts borrowed under the master repurchase agreements to finance mortgages originated through\nZillow Home Loans. Principal amounts under the master repurchase agreements are due when the related mortgage loan is sold to an investor or directly to an\nagency. As of September 30, 2024, we have outstanding principal amounts of $148 million. Amounts exclude an immaterial amount of estimated interest\npayments.\nOperating Lease Obligations - Our lease portfolio primarily comprises operating leases for our office space. During the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, there were no material changes to our operating lease obligations disclosed in Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, we had\noutstanding letters of credit of approximately $11 million, which secure our lease obligations in connection with certain of the operating leases of our office\nspaces.\n40\nTable of Contents\nContingent Consideration - In connection with the acquisition of Follow Up Boss, we are obligated to pay contingent consideration upon the\nachievement of certain performance metrics over a three-year period. For additional information regarding this contingent consideration, see Note 3 and Note 5\nof our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nPurchase Obligations - We have non-cancelable purchase obligations for content related to our mobile applications and websites and certain cloud\ncomputing costs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to the purchase commitments disclosed in Note 16 of the\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial\nstatements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related\ndisclosures. We evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other\nassumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates, and the health of the housing market\nand the broader economy have introduced significant additional uncertainty with respect to estimates, judgments and assumptions, which may materially\nimpact our estimates. For information on our critical accounting policies and estimates, see Part II Item 7 (Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations) of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes\nto our critical accounting policies and estimates as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\n41\nTable of Contents\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily consist of fluctuations in interest rates.\nInterest Rate Risk\nUnder our current investment policy, we invest our excess cash in money market funds, U.S. government treasury securities, U.S. government agency\nsecurities, investment grade corporate securities and commercial paper. Our current investment policy seeks first to preserve capital, second to provide\nsufficient liquidity for our operating and capital needs and third to maximize yield.\nOur short-term investments are exposed to market risk due to the fluctuation of prevailing interest rates that may reduce the yield on our investments or\ntheir fair value. For our investment portfolio, we do not believe an immediate 10% increase in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market\nvalue of our portfolio.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had approximately $918 million aggregate principal amount of Notes. All outstanding Notes bear fixed rates of interest\nand, therefore, do not expose us to financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. The fair values of the Notes change primarily when the\nmarket price of our stock fluctuates or interest rates change.\nWe are also subject to market risk which may impact our mortgage loan origination volume and associated revenue and the net interest margin derived\nfrom borrowings under our master repurchase agreements that provide capital for Zillow Home Loans. Market risk occurs in periods where changes in short-\nterm interest rates result in mortgage loans being originated with terms that provide a smaller interest rate spread above the financing terms of our master\nrepurchase agreements, which can negatively impact our results of operations. This risk is primarily mitigated through the expedited sale of our loans. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had $148 million and $93 million, respectively, of outstanding borrowings on our master repurchase\nagreements which bear interest at a floating rate based on SOFR plus an applicable margin, as defined by the governing agreements. We manage the interest\nrate risk associated with our mortgage loan origination services through the use of forward sales of MBSs. Assuming no change in the outstanding borrowings\non the master repurchase agreements, we estimate that a one percentage point increase in SOFR would not have a material effect on our annual interest expense\nassociated with the master repurchase agreements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nFor additional details related to our credit facilities and Notes, see Note 7 to our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q.\nInflation Risk\nThe macroeconomic environment in the United States has experienced, and continues to experience, inflationary pressures. While it is difficult to\naccurately measure the impact of these inflationary pressures on our business, we believe these effects have been pervasive throughout our business during the\npast several quarters. In response to ongoing inflationary pressures in the United States, the Federal Reserve implemented a number of increases to the federal\nfunds rate during 2022 and 2023. Despite inflation stabilizing beginning in the second half of 2023 and the federal funds rate decreasing in the second half of\n2024, prior federal funds rate increases have impacted other market rates derived from this benchmark rate, including mortgage interest rates. The persistently\nhigh mortgage interest rates across the industry relative to recent years has impacted the number of transactions consumers complete using our products and\nservices and the demand for our advertising services and mortgage origination offerings and, in turn, had an adverse impact on our revenue.\nIf inflationary pressures persist, our costs, in particular labor, marketing and hosting costs, may increase and we may not be able to fully offset such\nhigher costs through price increases. In addition, uncertain or changing economic and market conditions, including inflation or deflation, may continue to affect\ndemand for our products and services and the housing markets in which we operate. Our inability or failure to quickly respond to inflation could harm our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. We cannot predict the duration or magnitude of these inflationary pressures, or how they may change\nover time, but we expect to see continued impacts on the residential real estate industry, our customers and our company. Despite these near-term effects, we do\nnot expect these inflationary pressures to have a material impact on our ability to execute our long-term business strategy.\n42\nTable of Contents\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe do not believe that foreign currency exchange risk has had a material effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. As we do not\nmaintain a significant balance of foreign currency, we do not believe an immediate 10% increase or decrease in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the\nU.S. dollar would have a material effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\n43\nTable of Contents\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended). Management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the\neffectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of September 30, 2024. Based on that\nevaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-\n15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or\nare reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n44\nTable of Contents\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1.

However, you should carefully consider the factors\ndiscussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. Additional risks and\nuncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or\noperating results.\n46\nTable of Contents\nItem 2.

Instead of wasting time on homes they can't afford, shoppers can now clearly and quickly identify homes on Zillow within their true budget.\n\n[ ![Simulated images](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2561313/BuyAbility_screenshot.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2561313/BuyAbility_screenshot.html)\n\nBuyAbility is the tool for this moment. Homeownership can feel out of reach for aspiring first-time buyers who are daunted by today's high prices and may not feel ready to share their personal financial details with a loan officer. Volatile mortgage rates have made it difficult to know how much home they can afford, and their ability to qualify for a loan can change from day to day. BuyAbility is powered by real-time mortgage rates from Zillow Home Loans, and makes updates whenever rates move up or down, or when a prospective buyer improves their credit score, their debt-to-income ratio or saves more for their down payment. \n\n\"Mortgage rates have been on a wild ride this year,\" said Orphe Divounguy, a senior economist for Zillow Home Loans. \"With improving inflation numbers and more balanced economic activity, mortgage rates could ease slightly heading into the new year. That will mean more affordability and more options for home shoppers. Buyers will be in a stronger position to act quickly when the right home enters their BuyAbility, bringing them one step closer to the American Dream of homeownership.\" \n\nShoppers can access BuyAbility from the Home Loans tab on the Zillow app. They enter their basic financial information, including their income, credit score, monthly debt payments, amount saved for a down payment and the amount they're comfortable spending each month. Within seconds, they get their BuyAbility: an estimate of the home price they are likely to qualify for, and a suggested budgeted maximum price based on their desired monthly payments. When they browse Zillow, listings will be clearly tagged when they are within that shopper's BuyAbility, providing instant clarity on whether they are likely to qualify for a loan on that home. \n\nBuyAbility accounts for the one major factor that basic mortgage calculators neglect: the interplay between mortgage rates and a buyer's personal financial situation. Shoppers with higher credit scores or a lower debt-to-income ratio will qualify for a lower mortgage rate, which has a huge impact on their buying power. Assuming a 20% down payment and a fixed-rate mortgage, a median-income household would be able to afford a $380,000 home with a 7% mortgage rate. That same household could afford the monthly payments on a $420,000 home with a 6% mortgage rate. \n\nA vast majority of home buyers today are prioritizing budget above all else. Zillow _[data](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4306352-1&h=2331442941&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zillow.com%2Fresearch%2Fbuyers-housing-trends-report-2024-34383%2F&a=data)_ finds nearly 80% of recent buyers say it is very or extremely important to find a home within their initial budget (79%). That became a bit easier when mortgage rates dropped this fall. New _[Zillow research](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4306352-1&h=1427592784&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zillow.com%2Fresearch%2Fmost-affordable-markets-34593&a=Zillow+research)_ finds the share of homes that a middle-income household could comfortably afford hit a nearly two-year high in September. A household making the median U.S. income could comfortably afford 27.3% of homes listed for sale across the country. Only 22.7% of all homes listed for sale were affordable to a middle-income household when mortgage rates peaked above 7% in May. \n\nThat significant shift shows how quickly homes can go from being unaffordable to affordable in today's market. BuyAbility gives shoppers a competitive edge by keeping them up to date on exactly what they can afford at any given time. \n\nBuyAbility is currently available in every state but New York on the Zillow app and will be coming soon to desktop computers on Zillow's website. \n\n**About Zillow Group:** Zillow Group, Inc.
