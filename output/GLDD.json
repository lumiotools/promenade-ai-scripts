Details\n\n## \n\nGreat Lakes Dredge & Dock’s Cape Hatteras and Cape Canaveral Multi Cat Vessels Win Prestigious WorkBoat’s Significant Boat of the Year Award\n\nNov 18, 2024 \n\n[PDF Version](/node/19251/pdf)\n\nHOUSTON, Nov. 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corporation (\"Great Lakes\" or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: GLDD), the largest provider of dredging services in the United States, announced that its newly launched Multi Cat dredge support vessels, _Cape Hatteras_ and _Cape Canaveral_ , have been awarded the prestigious 2024 Significant Boat of the Year title at the International WorkBoat Show. This award underscores the Company’s commitment to safety, innovation, and operational excellence in the dredging and maritime sectors.\n\nThe _Cape Hatteras_ and _Cape Canaveral_ , built by Conrad Shipyard in Morgan City, Louisiana, are 99-foot Damen 3013 Multi Cat vessels equipped with cutting-edge technology and features that elevate both safety and efficiency in dredging operations.\n\nChris Gunsten, Senior Vice President of Project Services and Fleet Engineering at Great Lakes commented, “These vessels represent a milestone for our Company and the dredging industry. The Multi Cat design introduces critical safety enhancements by enabling pipe handling and connection work to take place securely on deck, significantly reducing the risk of man overboard incidents. The vessels are a perfect fit with our Company’s strong safety culture and already have shown their ability to improve our dredging efficiency while supporting vital shoreline protection and waterway maintenance.”\n\nThe _Cape Hatteras_ and _Cape Canaveral_ vessels are not only the first Damen Multi Cats built in the U.S., but also represent a major step forward in supporting dredging operations with enhanced safety, reduced manual labor, and greater operational flexibility. Their design eliminates the need for additional floating support vessels, contributing to improved operational efficiency and reduced environmental impact. The vessels' cutting-edge equipment ensures safe and effective navigation and communication on complex dredging projects.\n\nLasse Petterson, Great Lakes’ President and Chief Executive Officer commented, “Great Lakes is committed to leveraging advanced technologies to maintain and improve U.S. shorelines and waterways. These Multi Cat vessels are integral to the Company's mission to lead the dredging industry with innovative, safe, and efficient solutions.”\n\n**_The Company_**\n\nGreat Lakes Dredge & Dock Corporation (“Great Lakes” or the “Company”) is the largest provider of dredging services in the United States.
