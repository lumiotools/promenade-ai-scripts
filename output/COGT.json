As we head into 2025, we are well positioned as we prepare to deliver top-line data from three registrational clinical trials.”\n\n**_Business Highlights & Milestones _**\n\n  * Completed enrollment in PEAK, a randomized, open-label, global Phase 3 trial evaluating bezuclastinib in combination with sunitinib vs sunitinib alone in patients with imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). Based on strong global patient interest, a total of 413 patients were enrolled in the trial. The primary endpoint is median progression free survival (mPFS). \n    * In addition, Cogent completed a pre-planned interim futility analysis and the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) recommended continuing the PEAK study without modification. This pre-specified analysis was based on an assessment of progression-free survival (PFS) as determined by independent central review and did not include the option for early stopping due to efficacy.\n\n\n  * Cogent will present updated clinical data from both SUMMIT and APEX clinical trials at the upcoming ASH annual meeting in December. There will be an investor webcast on December 9 at 8:00 a.m. ET to review the SUMMIT and APEX data. To register and listen please visit: [_https://investors.cogentbio.com/events_](https://investors.cogentbio.com/events)\n    * Poster presentation highlighting long term follow-up from patients who participated in the Open Label Extension (OLE) portion of SUMMIT at the ASH annual meeting on Monday, December 9, 2024. SUMMIT is a randomized, global, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-part Phase 2 trial evaluating bezuclastinib in patients with NonAdvSM.\n    * Oral presentation of long term follow-up from patients in Part 1 of the ongoing APEX study to be presented at the 2024 ASH annual meeting on Sunday, December 8, 2024. APEX is a global, multi-part Phase 2 trial evaluating bezuclastinib in patients with Advanced Systemic Mastocytosis (AdvSM).\n\n\n  * During the quarter, Cogent initiated a Phase 1 study of CGT4859, a reversible, selective FGFR2 inhibitor in patients with FGFR2 mutations, including advanced cholangiocarcinoma. The trial will explore the safety, tolerability and clinical activity of escalating doses of CGT4859 with a goal of selecting an active and well tolerated dose for further clinical investigation. Preliminary results from this trial are expected in 2025.\n\n\n  * Announced the addition of a potent and selective KRAS inhibitor to the pipeline. Preclinical data from this program as well as the Company’s H1047R mutant-selective PI3Kα clinical candidate were presented at the 2024 EORTC-NCI-AACR International Symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics. \n    * Mutations in KRAS are among the most prevalent mutations found in cancer, occurring most often in colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer. The first poster presented described Cogent’s internally-developed pan KRAS(ON) inhibitor with selectivity over HRAS and NRAS and picomolar (pM) activity across KRAS mutations without the potential liabilities of molecules in the class. Following oral administration, CGT6737 demonstrated robust PK/PD and tumor growth inhibition with 90% PD inhibition in mouse xenograft models. Lead optimization of CGT6737 is ongoing.\n    * The second poster highlighted Cogent’s clinical candidate CGT6297, a potent allosteric inhibitor of PI3K, with 25-fold selectivity over PI3Kα WT. CGT6297 has high oral bioavailability and low clearance across species, providing robust inhibition of downstream signaling and efficacy in animal models. Importantly, when compared to a clinically relevant dose of a currently approved therapy in a mouse tumor model, CGT6297 demonstrated superior efficacy with no increase in insulin. IND-enabling studies are expected to be initiated in 2025.\n\n\n\n**_Anticipated Upcoming Milestones_**\n\n  * Complete enrollment in SUMMIT Part 2 in the first quarter of 2025 and deliver top-line results in the second half of 2025.\n\n\n  * Deliver top-line results from APEX in mid-2025.\n\n\n  * Deliver top-line results from PEAK by the end of 2025.\n\n\n\n**_Upcoming Investor Conferences_** A live webcast of the following events can be accessed on the Investors & Media page of Cogent’s website at investors.cogentbio.com/events. A replay will be available approximately two hours after completion of the events and will be archived for up to 30 days.\n\n  * Guggenheim Healthcare Innovation Conference, today, Tuesday, November 12, 2024 at 10:30 a.m. ET.\n\n\n  * Jefferies London Healthcare Conference on Wednesday, November 20, 2024 at 12:30 p.m. GMT (7:30 a.m. ET).\n\n\n  * Piper Sandler 35th Annual Healthcare Conference on Tuesday, December 4, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. ET.\n\n\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results_**\n\n**Cash Position:** As of September 30, 2024, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $345.5 million, as compared to $389.9 million as of June 30, 2024. The company believes that its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements well past top-line results from SUMMIT, PEAK, and APEX registration-directed trials and into late 2026.\n\n**R &D Expenses****:** Research and development expenses were $63.6 million for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to $50.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. R&D expenses include non-cash stock compensation expense of $4.8 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $4.0 million for the third quarter of 2023. Increases resulted from costs associated with the acceleration of enrollment in PEAK, SUMMIT and the continued development of our research pipeline.\n\n**G &A Expenses: **General and administrative expenses were $11.8 million for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to $9.5 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to the growth of the organization. G&A expenses include non-cash stock compensation expense of $5.6 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $4.8 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Net Loss:** Net loss was $70.6 million for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to a net loss of $55.4 million for the same period of 2023.\n\n**_Inducement Grants Under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4)_** Cogent also announced today that, on November 6, 2024, the Compensation Committee of Cogent’s Board of Directors, made up entirely of independent directors, approved the grant of “inducement” equity awards to three new employees under the company’s 2020 Inducement Plan with grant dates of November 6, 2024 and November 11, 2024. The awards were approved in accordance with Listing Rule 5635(c)(4) of the corporate governance rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market. The employees received, in the aggregate, nonqualified options to purchase 132,350 shares of Cogent common stock. Each option has a 10-year term, an exercise price equal to the closing price of Cogent’s common stock on the grant date, and a 4-year vesting schedule with 25% vesting on the 1-year anniversary of the grant date and the remainder vesting in equal monthly installments over the subsequent 36 months, provided such employee remains employed through each such vesting date.\n\n**About Cogent Biosciences, Inc.** Cogent Biosciences is a biotechnology company focused on developing precision therapies for genetically defined diseases.

Preclinical data from this program as well as its newly announced H1047R mutant-selective PI3Kα clinical candidate will be presented in two poster presentations at the 2024 EORTC-NCI-AACR International Symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics taking place in Barcelona, Spain October 23-25, 2024.\n\n“Our Research team continues to make amazing progress, and we are excited to announce our third clinical candidate and fourth preclinical program today,” said Andrew Robbins, Cogent’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Building upon earlier data presentations and recent advancements in the field, our first poster describes the properties of CGT6297, which we believe has the potential to emerge as a best-in-class H1047R mutant-selective PI3Kα inhibitor. Separately, for the first time, we outline our progress toward developing a potential best-in-class KRAS(ON) inhibitor, which in addition to its mechanistic attributes, has pharmacological properties differentiated from existing compounds in the class. Each of these programs align with our long-term strategy of creating and developing best-in-class molecules with the potential to have a broad impact on patients with genetically defined diseases.”\n\n**_Poster Details_** The posters can be accessed in the ‘[Posters and Publications’](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Ejqcp1HZqEqRmAal6rQyDHeiT6b7Q8-PpiUP8q5cWWFVWjoxbWYpkpSQES7sEJ-yP6k5lnNTOSBQYWTyNf3dzZBsdwUklqryO5VH7WQfQvTXvg60vrI7wvs2zMKhqAap1fGv_7u5xNDyuHuOpN7fkA==) page of Cogent’s website.\n\n**Title:** Identification of a Pan KRAS(On) Inhibitor with Selectivity Over KRAS over H/NRAS and pM Activity Across Prevalent KRAS Mutations**Session Date and Time:** Wednesday, October 23, 2024 – 12.00 - 19.00 CEST**Location:** Exhibition Hall, Centre de convencions internacional Barcelona (CCIB), Barcelona, Spain**Poster Number:** PB108**Abstract Number:** 120\n\nMutations in KRAS are among the most prevalent mutations found in cancer, occurring most often in colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer. The poster presented today describes Cogent’s internally-developed pan KRAS(ON) inhibitor with selectivity over HRAS and NRAS and picomolar (pM) activity across KRAS mutations without the potential liabilities of molecules in the class. Following oral administration, CGT6737 demonstrated robust PK/PD and tumor growth inhibition with 90% PD inhibition in mouse xenograft models. Lead optimization of CGT6737 is ongoing.\n\n**Title:** Preclinical Characterization of a Novel PI3Kα H1047R Mutant Selective Inhibitor **Session Date and Time:** Wednesday, October 23, 2024 – 12.00 - 19.00 CEST**Location:** Exhibition Hall, Centre de convencions internacional Barcelona (CCIB) Barcelona, Spain**Poster Number:** PB133**Abstract Number:** 145\n\nCogent is also developing a potential best-in-class, wild-type-sparing, PI3Kα inhibitor that provides coverage for the H1047R mutation, which affects >55,000 cancer patients each year. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is a key cell cycle regulating pathway that has an established role in tumor growth and development. The approved agents for these patients often lead to dose limitations, resulting from activity against wild-type PI3Kα.\n\nThe poster presented today highlights Cogent’s clinical candidate CGT6297, a potent allosteric inhibitor of PI3K, with 25-fold selectivity over PI3Kα WT. CGT6297 has high oral bioavailability and low clearance across species, providing robust inhibition of downstream signaling and efficacy in animal models. Importantly, when compared to a clinically relevant dose of a currently approved therapy in a mouse tumor model, CGT6297 demonstrated superior efficacy with no increase in insulin. IND-enabling studies are expected to be initiated in 2025.\n\n**_Upcoming Investor Conference_** Cogent will participate in the following upcoming investor conference:\n\nGuggenheim Healthcare Innovation Conference - November 12, 2024 at 10:30 a.m. ET.\n\nA live webcast of the fireside discussion will be available in the Investors & Media section of Cogent’s website at investors.cogentbio.com/events.

Based on strong global patient interest, a total of 413 patients were enrolled in the study. In addition, Cogent recently completed a pre-planned interim futility analysis, and the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) recommended continuing the PEAK study without modification. This pre-specified analysis was based on an assessment of progression-free survival (PFS) as determined by independent central review and did not include the option for early stopping due to efficacy. \n\nSeparately, based on significant patient interest in the ongoing SUMMIT trial in nonadvanced systemic mastocytosis (NonAdvSM), Cogent also announced today that it expects to complete enrollment in this study during Q1 2025, approximately three months earlier than originally projected.\n\n“We are excited to announce these important updates to the PEAK and SUMMIT studies today,” said Andrew Robbins, Cogent’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Strong continued interest from patients around the world to participate in our bezuclastinib trials has allowed us to accelerate development and surpass our original enrollment timelines. Completing enrollment in our Phase 3 PEAK trial of bezuclastinib and sunitinib for second-line GIST patients several months ahead of schedule represents a significant milestone for the program and we are extremely grateful to the patients, families, caregivers, advocacy groups and clinical investigators for their participation in, and support of, the PEAK trial.” \n\nPEAK is a randomized, open-label, global Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating bezuclastinib in combination with sunitinib vs. sunitinib alone in GIST patients previously treated with imatinib. The primary endpoint of the trial is median progression free survival (mPFS). PEAK is a registration study intended to support a New Drug Application (NDA) in GIST. \n\nSUMMIT is a randomized, blinded, global, registration-directed clinical trial evaluating bezuclastinib vs. placebo in NonAdvSM patients. The primary endpoint of the trial is mean improvement in patient symptoms measured at 24 weeks. SUMMIT is intended to be a registrational study designed to support a New Drug Application (NDA) in NonAdvSM. \n\n**Appointment of Darara Dibabu****as Vice President of Marketing** In addition to the updates to PEAK and SUMMIT trials, Cogent announced today that Mr. Dibabu has joined Cogent as the VP of Marketing. Mr. Dibabu has 25 years of experience in the biopharmaceutical industry, most recently as the Global Brand Lead of TUKYSA at Pfizer and SeaGen, where he led the global launch and marketing strategy of the product for metastatic breast cancer patients. Previously, he served in various roles of increasing responsibility at Seagen, Bayer and Merck. Mr. Dibabu holds a bachelor's degree in Biology from the University of Southern California. In connection with Mr. Dibabu joining the company, he was granted an “inducement” equity award in accordance with Listing Rule 5635(c)(4) of the corporate governance rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market. The award was approved by the Compensation Committee of Cogent’s Board of Directors, made up entirely of independent directors, as an inducement material to Mr. Dibabu’s employment. The award consists of nonqualified options to purchase 100,000 shares of Cogent common stock with a 10-year term, at an exercise price of $10.74 per share, and a 4-year vesting schedule with 25% vesting on the 1-year anniversary of Mr. Dibabu’s employment and the remainder vesting in equal monthly installments over the subsequent 36 months, provided Mr. Dibabu’s remains employed through each such vesting date. \n\n**About Cogent Biosciences, Inc.** Cogent Biosciences is a biotechnology company focused on developing precision therapies for genetically defined diseases. The most advanced clinical program, bezuclastinib, is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is designed to potently inhibit the KIT D816V mutation as well as other mutations in KIT exon 17. KIT D816V is responsible for driving systemic mastocytosis, a serious disease caused by unchecked proliferation of mast cells. Exon 17 mutations are also found in patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), a type of cancer with strong dependence on oncogenic KIT signaling. In addition to bezuclastinib, the Cogent Research Team is developing a portfolio of novel targeted therapies to help patients fighting serious, genetically driven diseases initially targeting mutations in FGFR2, ErbB2 and PI3Kα. Cogent Biosciences is based in Waltham, MA and Boulder, CO. Visit our website for more information at www.cogentbio.com.
