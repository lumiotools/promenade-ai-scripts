(NASDAQ: AQB) (\"AquaBounty\" or the \"Company\"), a land-based aquaculture company utilizing technology to enhance productivity and sustainability, today announced the Company's financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights and Recent Developments**\n\n  * Net loss in the third quarter of 2024 was down significantly at $3.4 million as compared to $6.1 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to the sale of the Indiana farm.\n  * Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled $500 thousand as of September 30, 2024, as compared to $9.2 million as of December 31, 2023.\n  * The sale of the Indiana farm, which included certain equipment from the Ohio farm, was completed on July 26, 2024 for $9.2 million, net of expenses. A portion of the net proceeds was used to pay off the bridge loan for the transaction.\n  * On September 3, 2024, the Company announced that it had made the decision to sell its Rollo Bay farm operation on Prince Edward Island, Canada.\n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n\"We continue to focus our efforts on working with our investment banking partner to extend our cash runway, while reviewing a variety of financing initiatives to maintain liquidity,\" said Dave Melbourne, AquaBounty's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Included in this effort was our decision to market our Rollo Bay farm for sale. As I stated in our announcement, the Rollo Bay farm was purchased and developed to support an expansion plan for five large land-based grow-out farms. Since we will not require the egg output from the Rollo Bay farm in the near to mid-term timeframe, and since we will retain sufficient egg production capacity for our Ohio farm from our hatchery in Bay Fortune, we determined that the Rollo Bay farm could be sold at this time to address the Company's immediate cash requirements without impacting our long-term strategy.\"\n\n\"We have also been working to reduce costs where appropriate and our results for the quarter show a significant reduction in both our operating spend and our net loss.\"\n\n\"We are fully committed to securing the pathway forward for our Company and stockholders, and we will continue to work to stabilize the business in the short term and drive value creation in the long term. I look forward to sharing continued updates in the future,\" concluded Melbourne.\n\n**About AquaBounty**\n\nAt AquaBounty Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: AQB), we believe that we are a distinctive brand in land-based aquaculture. As a vertically integrated Company, we have decades of experience in farming Atlantic salmon from broodstock to grow out. We leverage our operational expertise and advances in fish breeding, genetics, and health and nutrition, to deliver innovative solutions that address food insecurity and climate change issues.

(NASDAQ: AQB) (“AquaBounty” or the “Company”), a land-based aquaculture company utilizing technology to enhance productivity and sustainability, today announced an update on the Company’s fundraising efforts.\n\nAs previously announced, AquaBounty has been exploring a wide range of funding and strategic alternatives to strengthen its balance sheet and increase its cash position. Today, the Company is announcing that it has made the decision to sell its Rollo Bay farm operation. The farm, located on Prince Edward Island in Canada, was purchased by the Company in 2016 and further developed into a broodstock and egg production operation. The Company’s investment banker is conducting the sale process, which is expected to be completed before year end.\n\nDavid Melbourne, Chief Executive Officer of AquaBounty, said, “We continue to be focused on securing funding for both our near and long-term needs, so that we can return to pursuing our growth strategy. The Rollo Bay farm was purchased and developed to support an expansion plan for five large land-based grow-out farms. Since we will not require the egg output from the Rollo Bay farm in the near to mid-term timeframe, and since we will retain sufficient egg production capacity for our Ohio farm from our hatchery in Bay Fortune, we have determined that the Rollo Bay farm can be sold at this time to resolve the Company’s immediate cash requirements, without impacting our long-term strategy. We are also continuing to pursue additional funding and strategic alternatives with the goal of securing our cash requirements in the coming months,” concluded Melbourne.\n\n**About AquaBounty**\n\nAt AquaBounty Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: AQB), we believe we are a leader in land-based aquaculture. As a vertically integrated Company from broodstock to grow out, we are leveraging decades of our technology advances in fish breeding, genetics, and health & nutrition, as well as our operational expertise, to deliver innovative solutions that address food insecurity and climate change issues.

(NASDAQ: AQB) (“AquaBounty” or the “Company”), a land-based aquaculture company utilizing technology to enhance productivity and sustainability, today announced the Company’s financial results for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Highlights and Recent Developments**\n\n  * Net loss in the second quarter of 2024 was up significantly at $50.5 million as compared to $6.5 million in the second quarter of 2023. The current period loss included a non-cash impairment charge of $44.5 million against the long-lived assets of the Indiana farm and certain equipment from the Ohio farm, which have been sold or made available for sale.\n  * Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled $0.7 million as of June 30, 2024, as compared to $9.2 million as of December 31, 2023.\n  * On April 18, 2024, the Company executed a bridge loan agreement for $10.0 million, secured by the assets of its Indiana and Ohio farms. The Company utilized $6.5 million from the facility, which was repaid on July 26, 2024.\n  * The sale of the Indiana farm, which included certain equipment from the Ohio farm, was completed on July 26, 2024 for $9.2 million, net of expenses.\n  * On June 7, 2024, David F. Melbourne Jr. was promoted to Chief Executive Officer, in conjunction with the Company's succession plan. Sylvia Wulf continues as the non-executive Chair of AquaBounty's Board of Directors.\n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n\"Our focus during the second quarter was securing a buyer for the Indiana farm and continuing to explore a variety of financing initiatives to maintain liquidity,\" said Dave Melbourne, AquaBounty's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"With the sale of the Indiana farm now complete, we will continue to work with our investment banking partner to extend our cash runway, including the sale of additional equipment assets from our Ohio farm.\n\n\"While our net loss in the second quarter was up significantly, driven in large part by the non-cash impairment charge taken against our farm assets, the team continues to identify opportunities to preserve cash and reduce operating expenses. We completed a sale of conventional Atlantic salmon eggs from our Prince Edward Island (\"PEI\") operations' winter spawn to a large net-pen salmon farmer at the beginning of the quarter. In addition, we have secured a large follow-up order from the same customer for additional conventional eggs from our summer spawn. Our Research and Development team made further progress in PEI on our breeding, fish health and nutrition, and gene editing initiatives. This work supports important advances that will be valuable for the future of our business, supporting both traditional net-pen and land-based farming operations,\" continued Melbourne.\n\n\"When I assumed the role as AquaBounty's CEO in June, I made it clear that I would be fully committed to working with our dedicated team to secure the future pathway forward for our Company and stockholders. I remain resolute to this commitment. Our leadership team, and broader organization, is working tirelessly to stabilize the business in the short term and drive value creation in the long-term. I look forward to sharing continued updates in the future,\" concluded Melbourne.\n\n**About AquaBounty**\n\nAt AquaBounty Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: AQB), we believe we are a leader in land-based aquaculture. As a vertically integrated Company from broodstock to grow out, we are leveraging decades of our technology advances in fish breeding, genetics, and health & nutrition, as well as our operational expertise, to deliver innovative solutions that address food insecurity and climate change issues. AquaBounty raises its fish in carefully monitored land-based fish farms through a safe, secure and sustainable process. We locate our land-based recirculating aquaculture system (\"RAS\") farms close to key consumption markets, which are designed to prevent disease and to include multiple levels of fish containment to protect wild fish populations. AquaBounty raises nutritious salmon that is free of antibiotics in a manner that results in a reduced carbon footprint and no risk of pollution to marine ecosystems as compared to traditional sea-cage farming.
