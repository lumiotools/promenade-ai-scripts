NATURE OF OPERATIONS\nReborn Coffee, Inc. (\"Reborn”) was incorporated in the State of Florida in January 2018. In July 2022, Reborn was migrated from Florida to Delaware, and filed a certificate\nof incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware having the same capitalization structure as the Florida predecessor entity. Reborn has the following\nsubsidiaries:\n● Reborn Global Holdings, Inc. (\"Reborn Holdings”), a California Corporation incorporated in November 2014 and wholly-owned by Reborn Coffee, Inc. Reborn\nHoldings is engaged in the operation of wholesale distribution and retail coffee stores in California to sell a variety of coffee, tea, Reborn brand name water and other\nbeverages along with bakery and dessert products.\n● Reborn Coffee Franchise, LLC (the \"Reborn Coffee Franchise”), a California limited liability corporation formed in December 2020 and wholly-owned by Reborn\nCoffee, Inc, is a franchisor providing premier roaster specialty coffee to franchisees or customers. Reborn Coffee Franchise continues to develop the Reborn Coffee\nsystem for the establishment and operation of Reborn Coffee stores using one or more Reborn Coffee marks. Reborn Coffee Franchise does not have any franchisee\nas of September 30, 2024.\n● Reborn Realty, LLC (the \"Reborn Realty”), a California limited liability corporation formed in March 2023 and wholly-owned by Reborn Coffee, Inc, is an entity which\nacquired a real property located at 596 Apollo Street, Brea, California.\n● Reborn Coffee Korea, Inc. (the \"Reborn Korea”) – a Korea corporation located in Daejon, South Korea formed in October 2023 and wholly-owned by Reborn Coffee,\nInc, with one retail coffee store under the brand name of Reborn Coffee.\n● Reborn Malaysia, Inc. (the \"Reborn Malaysia”) – a Malaysian corporation located in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia formed in October 2023, is majority owned by Reborn\nCoffee, Inc. (60% ownership), with one retail coffee store under the brand name of Reborn Coffee.\nReborn Coffee, Inc., Reborn Global Holdings, Inc., Reborn Coffee Franchise, LLC, Reborn Realty, LLC, Reborn Korea and Reborn Malaysia will be collectively referred as\nthe \"Company”.\nGoing Concern Matters\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America\n(\"GAAP”), which contemplates the Company’s continuation as a going concern. The Company incurred a net comprehensive loss of $3,026,904 during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, and has an accumulated deficit of $19,783,828 as of September 30, 2024. In addition, current liabilities exceed current assets by $1,953,000 as of\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nManagement intends to raise additional operating funds through equity and/or debt offerings. However, there can be no assurance management will be successful in its\nendeavors.\nThere are no assurances that the Company will be able to either (1) achieve a level of revenues adequate to generate sufficient cash flow from operations; or (2) obtain\nadditional financing through either private placement, public offerings, and/or bank financing necessary to support its working capital requirements. To the extent that\nfunds generated from operations and any private placements, public offerings, and/or bank financing are insufficient, the Company will have to raise additional working\ncapital. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available, or if available, will be on terms acceptable to the Company. If adequate working capital is not\navailable to the Company, it may be required to curtail or cease its operations.\nDue to uncertainties related to these matters, there exists substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The accompanying\nconsolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification of asset-carrying amounts or the amounts and\nclassification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\n5\nUnaudited Interim Financial Statements\nThe accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements (\"Interim Financial Statements”) of the Company and its 100%-owned subsidiaries\nhave been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP”) for interim financial information and are\npresented in accordance with the requirements of Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. Accordingly, these Interim Financial Statements do not include all of the information and\nnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. These Interim Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements\nand notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in the Company’s Form 10-K/A. In the opinion of management, the Interim Financial Statements included\nherein contain all adjustments, including normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position, the results of operations\nand cash flows for the periods presented.\nThe operating results and cash flows of the interim periods presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other interim period or the\nfull year.\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nReporting\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include Reborn Coffee, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023 and for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP”)\nas promulgated in the United States of America. The consolidated financial statements include Reborn Coffee, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary. All intercompany\naccounts, transactions, and profits have been eliminated upon consolidation.\nMinority Interest\nReborn owns 60% of Reborn Malaysia located in Kuala Lumpur with one retail coffee store under the brand name of Reborn Coffee. For the nine months ended September\n30, 2024, Reborn’s interest was not material as the store in Malaysia opened in November 2023 and operated in limited capacity and revenue.\nReverse Stock Split\nOn January 12, 2024, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment (the \"Certificate of Amendment”) to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse\nstock split of its issued Common Stock in the ratio of 1-for-8 (the \"Reverse Stock Split”). The Common Stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market on a Reverse\nStock Split-adjusted basis at the market open on Monday, January 22, 2024.\nSegment Reporting\nFASB ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, requires public companies to report financial and descriptive information about their reportable operating segments. The\nCompany’s management identifies operating segments based on how the Company’s management internally evaluate separate financial information, business activities\nand management responsibility. At the current time, the Company has only one reportable segment, consisting of both the wholesale and retail sales of coffee, water, and\nother beverages. The Company’s franchisor subsidiary was not material as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n6\nWe shall generate revenues from two geographic areas, consisting of North America and Asia. The following enterprise-wide disclosure is prepared on a basis consistent\nwith the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The following table contains certain financial information by geographic area:\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023\nNet Sales:\nNorth America $ 3,918,066 $ 4,155,503\nAsia 231,826 -\nTotal net sales $ 4,149,892 $ 4,155,503\nSeptember 30, December 31,\nAs of 2024 2023\nLong-lived asset, net:\nNorth America $ 823,250 $ 2,162,263\nAsia 3,127,305 1,331,787\nTotal long-lived asset, net $ 3,950,555 $ 3,494,050\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported\nin our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Such estimates include accounts receivables, accrued liabilities, income taxes, long-lived assets,\nand deferred tax valuation allowances. These estimates generally involve complex issues and require management to make judgments, involve analysis of historical and\nfuture trends that can require extended periods of time to resolve, and are subject to change from period to period. In all cases, actual results could differ materially from\nestimates.\nForeign Currency Translations\nReborn has controlling interests in subsidiaries in foreign countries, South Korea and Malaysia. Fluctuations in foreign currency impact the amount of total assets,\nliabilities, earnings and cash flows that the Company report for foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. Dollars for, and as of the end of, each\nreporting period. In particular, the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar generally will reduce the reported amount of our foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, total\nrevenues and total expense that we translate into U.S. Dollars and report in the Company’s consolidated financial statements for, and as of the end of, each reporting\nperiod. However, a majority of the Company’s consolidated revenue is denominated in U.S. Dollars, and therefore, the Company’s revenue is not directly subject to\nforeign currency risk.\nIn accordance with FASB ASC 830, \"Foreign Currency Matters”, when an operation has transactions denominated in a currency other than its functional currency, they\nare measured in the functional currency. Changes in the expected functional currency cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates are included in net income for the\nperiod.\n7\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company’s net\nrevenue primarily consists of revenues from its retail stores and wholesale and online store. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue as follows:\n● Retail Store Revenue\nRetail store revenues are recognized when payment is tendered at the point of sale. Retail store revenues are reported net of sales, use or other transaction taxes that\nare collected from customers and remitted to taxing authorities. Sales taxes that are payable are recorded as accrued as other current liabilities. Retail store revenue\nmakes up approximately 92% of the Company’s total revenue.\n● Wholesale and Online Revenue\nWholesale and online revenues are recognized when the products are delivered, and title passes to the customers or to the wholesale distributors. When customers\npick up products at the Company’s warehouse, or distributed to the wholesale distributors, the title passes, and revenue is recognized. Wholesale revenues make up\napproximately 8% of the Company’s total revenue.\n● Royalties and Other Fees\nFranchise revenues consist of royalty fees and other franchise fees. Royalty fees are based on a percentage of a franchisee’s weekly gross sales revenue at 5%. The\nCompany recognizes the fee as the underlying sales occur. The Company recorded revenue from royalties of $0 for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nOther fees are earned as incurred and the Company did not have any other fee revenue for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nCost of Sales\nProduct, food and drink costs – stores and cost of sales – wholesale and online primarily include the costs of ingredients of food and beverage sold and related supplies\nused in customer service. The wholesale and online sales also include costs of packaging and shipping.\nShipping and Handling Costs\nThe Company incurred freight out costs, which are primarily included in the Company’s cost of sales – wholesale and online. Freight in costs, when attached to a specific\npurchase, are included as a component of the cost of the purchased goods and materials items and allocated to accounts in accordance with the nature of the goods.\nWhen the freight in costs are not allocable to an individual purchase or are more significant, they are recorded to a freight and shipping account within cost of sales.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense includes store-related expense as well as the Company’s corporate headquarters’ expenses.\nAdvertising Expense\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses amounted to $110,050 and $49,531 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, and are recorded under general and administrative expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n8\nPre-opening Costs\nPre-opening costs for new stores, consist primarily of store and leasehold improvements, and are capitalized and depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the\nimprovement or the lease term, including renewal periods that are reasonably assured.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivables are stated net of allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined primarily on the basis of past collection\nexperience and general economic conditions. The Company determines terms and conditions for its customers based on volume transacted by the customer, customer\ncreditworthiness and past transaction history. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, allowance for doubtful accounts were zero, respectively. The Company does\nnot have any off-balance sheet exposure related to its customers.\nInventories\nInventories consisted primarily of coffee beans, drink products, and supplies which are recorded at cost or at net realizable value.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are provided using both the\nstraight-line and declining balance methods over the following estimated useful lives:\nFurniture and fixtures 5-7 Years\nStore construction Lesser of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements, generally 6 years\nLeasehold improvement Lesser of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements, generally 6 years\nWhen assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation thereon are removed, and any resulting gains or losses are included in the consolidated\nstatements of operations. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated life of the asset, not to exceed the length of the lease.\nRepair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\nOperating Leases\nThe Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC”), Topic 842, Leases (\"ASC 842”) which requires the\nrecognition of the right-of-use assets and relating operating and finance lease liabilities on the balance sheet. Under ASC 842, all leases are required to be recorded on the\nbalance sheet and are classified as either operating leases or finance leases. The lease classification affects the expense recognition in the income statement. Operating\nlease charges are recorded entirely in operating expenses. Finance lease charges are split, where amortization of the right-of-use asset is recorded in operating expenses\nand an implied interest component is recorded in interest expense.\nEarnings Per Share\nFASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share, requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share computations.\nBasic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding\nduring the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of\nadditional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. In\nperiods where losses are reported, the weighted-average number of common stock outstanding excludes common stock equivalents, because their inclusion would be\nanti-dilutive.\nThe Company did not have any dilutive, or potentially dilutive, shares outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n9\nLong-lived Assets\nIn accordance with FASB ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, the Company reviews for impairment of long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles\nwhenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. The Company considers the carrying value of assets may not be\nrecoverable based upon our review of the following events or changes in circumstances: the asset’s ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive\ncash flow in future periods; loss of legal ownership or title to the assets; significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset; or significant\nnegative industry or economic trends. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset are less than\nits carrying amount. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company was not aware of any events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the\nlong-lived assets are impaired.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company records its financial assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined under the applicable accounting standards as the exchange price that would be\nreceived for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between\nmarket participants on the measure date. The Company uses valuation techniques to measure fair value, maximizing the use of observable outputs and minimizing the use\nof unobservable inputs. The standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last\nunobservable, that may be used to measure fair value which are the following:\nLevel 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 – Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are\nnot active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 – Inputs include management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. The inputs are\nunobservable in the market and significant to the instrument’s valuation.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company believes that the carrying value of accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other\ncurrent assets and liabilities approximate fair value due to the short maturity of theses financial instruments. The financial statements do not include any financial\ninstruments at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis.\n10\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consisted of taxes currently due and deferred taxes. Deferred taxes are\nrecognized for the differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes.\nThe Company follows FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences\nof events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future\nyears of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax\nrates, applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax\nassets to the amount expected to be realized. ASC 740-10-25 provides criteria for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax position. The\nCompany must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing\nauthorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on\nthe largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The Company did not recognize additional liabilities for uncertain tax\npositions pursuant to ASC 740-10-25 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are accounts receivable arising from its normal business activities. The\nCompany performs ongoing credit evaluations to its customers and establishes allowances when appropriate.\nCompany purchases from various vendors for its operations. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no purchases from any vendors\naccounted for a significant amount of the Company’s coffee bean purchases.\nRelated Parties\nRelated parties are any entities or individuals that, through employment, ownership, or other means, possess the ability to direct or cause the direction of management and\npolicies of the Company.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncement\nThe Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements\nmay be expected to cause a material impact on our financial statements.\n11\n3. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nProperty and equipment consisted of the following:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nFurniture and equipment $ 2,271,089 $ 2,552,021\nLeasehold improvement 632,516 1,037,277\nStore 1,876,479 663,651\nStore construction 475,500 361,575\nVehicle 103,645 103,645\nTotal property and equipment 5,359,229 4,718,169\nLess accumulated depreciation (1,408,674) (1,224,119)\nTotal property and equipment, net $ 3,950,555 $ 3,494,050\nDepreciation expense on property and equipment amounted to approximately $184,555 and $135,398 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 $11,845 and\n$56,097 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n4.

Interest accrues at the rate of 3.75% per annum and will accrue only on funds actually advanced from the\ndate of each advance. Installment payments, including principal and interest, are due monthly beginning May 16, 2021 (twelve months from the date of the SBA Loan\nAgreement) in the amount of $731. The balance of principal and interest is payable thirty years from the date of the SBA Loan Agreement.

INCOME TAX\nTotal income tax (benefit) expense consists of the following:\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023\nCurrent provision (benefit):\nFederal $ - $ -\nState - -\nTotal current provision (benefit) - -\nDeferred provision (benefit):\nFederal - -\nState - -\nTotal deferred provision (benefit) - -\nTotal tax provision (benefit) $ - $ -\n15\nA reconciliation of the Company’s effective tax rate to the statutory federal rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nDescription 2024 2023\nStatutory federal rate 21.00% 21.00%\nState income taxes net of federal income tax benefit and others 6.98% 6.98%\nPermanent differences for tax purposes and others 0.00% 0.00%\nChange in valuation allowance -27.98% -27.98%\nEffective tax rate 0% 0%\nThe income tax benefit differs from the amount computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% due to California state income taxes of 8.84% and changes\nin the valuation allowance.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for\nincome tax purposes. The components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\nDeferred tax assets 2024 2023\nDeferred tax assets:\nNet operating loss $ 4,298,276 $ 3,507,307\nOther temporary differences - -\nTotal deferred tax assets 4,298,276 3,507,307\nLess - valuation allowance (4,298,276) (3,507,307)\nTotal deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance $ - $ -\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had available net operating loss carryovers of approximately $3,507,000. Per the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) implemented in\n2018, the two-year carryback provision was removed and now allows for an indefinite carryforward period. The carryforwards are limited to 80% of each subsequent year’s\nnet income. As a result, net operating loss may be applied against future taxable income and expires at various dates subject to certain limitations. The Company has a\ndeferred tax asset arising substantially from the benefits of such net operating loss deduction and has recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of this deferred\ntax asset since it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset may not be realized.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and California and is subject to income tax examinations by federal tax authorities for tax year ended\n2018 and later and subject to California authorities for tax year ended 2017 and later.

ROU\nassets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.\nGenerally, the implicit rate of interest in arrangements is not readily determinable and the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value\nof lease payments. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate is a hypothetical rate based on its understanding of what its credit rating would be. The operating lease\nROU asset includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our variable lease payments primarily consist of maintenance and other operating expenses\nfrom our real estate leases. Variable lease payments are excluded from the ROU assets and lease liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for\nthose payments is incurred.

Lease\nexpense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. The Company has elected to account for these lease and non-lease components as a single\nlease component.\nIn accordance with ASC 842, the components of lease expense were as follows:\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023\nOperating lease expense $ 1,161,127 $ 444,800\nTotal lease expense $ 1,161,127 $ 444,800\nIn accordance with ASC 842, other information related to leases was as follows:\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023\nOperating cash flows from operating leases $ 1,169,606 $ 470,381\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities $ 1,169,606 $ 470,381\nWeighted-average remaining lease term—operating leases 5.4 Years\nWeighted-average discount rate—operating leases 10.8%\nIn accordance with ASC 842, maturities of operating lease liabilities as of September 30, 2024 were as follows:\nOperating\nYear ending: Lease\n2024 (remaining three months) $ 360,339\n2025 1,401,371\n2026 1,211,859\n2027 734,407\n2028 410,673\nThereafter 1,553,692\nTotal undiscounted cash flows $ 5,672,340\nReconciliation of lease liabilities:\nWeighted-average remaing lease terms 5.4\nWeighted-average discount rate 10.8%\nPresent values $ 4,165,637\nLease liabilities—current 1,006,603\nLease liabilities—long-term 3,159,034\nLease liabilities—total $ 4,165,637\nDifference between undiscounted and discounted cash flows $ 1,506,703\n18\nContingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings from time to time as part of its business.

STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nCommon Stock\nThe Company has authorization to issue and have outstanding at any one time 40,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share. The shareholders\nof common stock shall be entitled to one vote per share and dividends declared by the Company’s Board of Directors.\nPreferred Stock\nThe Company has authorization to issue and have outstanding at any one time 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share, in one or more\nclasses or series within a class as may be determined by our board of directors, who establish, from time to time, the number of shares to be included in each class or\nseries, fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such class or series and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof. Any\npreferred stock so issued is senior to other existing classes of common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or amounts upon liquidation or dissolution. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2022, no shares of our preferred stock had been designated any rights and we had no shares of preferred stock issued and\noutstanding.\nIssuance of Common Stock in Settlement of Antidilution Provisions\nIn May 2018, the Company had entered into a share exchange agreement wherein Capax, Inc., the predecessor entity of Reborn Coffee, Inc. (\"Capax”) effectively merged\nwith Reborn Global Holdings, Inc. to form the Company. In this share exchange agreement, the preexisting shareholders of Capax were provided covenants that for a\nperiod of one year following the date upon which the Company is approved for quotation or trading on a public exchange, the percentage of ownership of the prior\nshareholders of Capax would not be less than the 5% of the total number of shares of voting common stock outstanding of the Company that they owned following the\nshare exchange. In the event the ownership of the pre-merger shareholders of Capax fell below 5%, the Company was obligated to issue that number of shares of common\nstock to those shareholders which would increase the ownership of all of the Pre-Merger Shareholders to five percent (5%) of the total outstanding voting common shares\nof the Company. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company issued 325,495 shares of common stock under these provisions.\nOn January 25, 2022, the Company modified this agreement with the preexisting shareholders to effectively end the antidilution protection at the time of a successful\npublic offering, eliminating the one-year period following an the public offering as provided under the original agreement. The shareholders would be entitled to additional\nprotection through the IPO date should the Company issue any additional shares between December 31, 2021 and the IPO date. The Company has not issued any\nadditional shares subsequent to December 31, 2021 and the shareholders do not have such antidilution protection rights since the Company’s IPO date.\nDividend policy\nDividends are paid at the discretion of the Board of Directors. There were no dividends declared for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n19\n11. EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe Company calculates earnings per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260, Earnings Per Share, which requires a dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per\nshare. Basic earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the fiscal year. Potentially dilutive common shares consist\nof stock options outstanding (using the treasury method).\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per common share:\nNine Months\nEnded September 30,\n2024 2023\nNet Loss $ (3,026,904) $ (3,006,708)\nWeighted Average Shares of Common Stock Outstanding\nBasic 2,165,841 1,652,034\nDiluted 2,165,841 1,652,034\nEarnings Per Share - Basic\nNet Loss Per Share (1.40) (1.82)\nEarnings Per Share - Diluted\nNet Loss Per Share (1.40) (1.82)\nThree Months\nEnded September 30,\n2024 2023\nNet Loss $ (719,748) $ (748,902)\nWeighted Average Shares of Common Stock Outstanding\nBasic 2,420,628 1,654,698\nDiluted 2,420,628 1,654,698\nEarnings Per Share - Basic\nNet Loss Per Share (0.30) (0.45)\nEarnings Per Share - Diluted\nNet Loss Per Share (0.30) (0.45)\n12. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nThe Company evaluated all events or transactions that occurred after September 30, 2024 up through the date the consolidated financial statements were available to be\nissued. Based upon the evaluation, except as disclosed below or within the footnotes, the Company did not identify any recognized or non-recognized subsequent events\nthat would have required adjustment or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements as of and for the period ended September 30, 2024.\n20\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the\nrelated notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ending December 31, 2023. As discussed in the section titled \"Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” the following discussion\nand analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that, if they never materialize or prove incorrect, could cause our\nresults to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not\nlimited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled \"Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ending December 31, 2023.\nBusiness\nReborn is focused on serving high quality, specialty-roasted coffee at retail locations, kiosks and cafes. We are an innovative company that strives for constant improvement in\nthe coffee experience through exploration of new technology and premier service, guided by traditional brewing techniques. We believe Reborn differentiates itself from other\ncoffee roasters through its innovative techniques, including sourcing, washing, roasting, and brewing our coffee beans with a balance of precision and craft.\nFounded in 2015 by Jay Kim, our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Kim and his team launched Reborn with the vision of using the finest pure ingredients and pristine water. We\ncurrently serve customers through our retail store locations in California: Brea, La Crescenta, Corona Del Mar, Laguna Woods, Manhattan Beach, Huntington Beach, Riverside,\nSan Francisco, Irvine, Diamond Bar and Anaheim.\nReborn continues to elevate the high-end coffee experience and we received first place traditional still in \"America’s Best Cold Brew” competition by Coffee Fest in 2017 in\nPortland and 2018 in Los Angeles.\nThe Experience, Reborn\nWe believe that we are the leading pioneers of the emerging \"Fourth Wave” movement and that our business is redefining specialty coffee as an experience that demands much\nmore than premium quality. We consider ourselves leaders of the \"fourth wave” coffee movement because we are constantly developing our bean processing methods,\nresearching design concepts, and reinventing new ways of drinking coffee. For instance, the current transition from the K-Cup trend to the pour over drip concept allowed us to\nreinvent the way people consume coffee, by merging convenience and quality. We took the pour over drip concept and made it available and affordable to the public through our\nReborn Coffee Pour Over packs. Our Pour Over Packs allow our consumers to consume our specialty coffee outdoors and on-the-go.\nOur success in innovating within the \"Fourth Wave” coffee movement is measured by our success in B2B sales with our introduction of Reborn Coffee Pour Over Packs to hotels.\nWith the introduction of our Pour Over Packs to major hotels (including one hotel company with 7 locations), our B2B sales increased as these companies recognized the\nconvenience and functionality our Pour Over Packs serve to their customers.\nOur continuous Research and Development is essential to developing new parameters in the production of new blends. Our first place position in \"America’s Best Cold Brew”\ncompetition by Coffee Fest in 2017 in Portland and 2018 in Los Angeles is a testament to the way we believe we lead the \"Fourth Wave” movement by example.\nCentered around its core values of service, trust, and well-being, Reborn Coffee delivers an appreciation of coffee as both a science and an art. Developing innovative processes\nsuch as washing green coffee beans with magnetized water, we challenge traditional preparation methods by focusing on the relationship between water chemistry, health, and\nflavor profile. Reborn Coffee proactively distinguishes exceptional quality from good quality by starting at the foundation and paying attention to the details. Our mission places\nan equal emphasis on humanizing the coffee experience, delivering a fresh take on \"farm-to-table” by sourcing internationally. In this way, Reborn Coffee creates opportunities to\ndevelop transparency by paying homage to origin stories and sparking new conversations by building cross-cultural communities united by a passion for the finest coffee.\n21\nThrough a broad product offering, Reborn Coffee provides customers with a wide variety of beverages and coffee options. As a result, we believe we can capture share of any\nexperience where customers seek to consume great beverages whether in our inviting store atmospheres which are designed for comfort, or on the go through our Pour Over\nPacks, or at home with our whole bean ground coffee bags. We believe that the retail coffee market in the US is large and growing. According to IBIS, in 2021, the retail market for\ncoffee in the United States is expected to be $46.2 billion. This is expected to grow due to a shift in consumer preferences to premium coffee, including specialized blends, espresso-\nbased beverages, and cold brew options. Reborn aims to capture a growing portion of the market as we expand and increase consumer awareness of our brand.\nPlan of Operation\nWe have a production and distribution center at our headquarters that we use to process and roast coffee for wholesale and retail distribution.\nCurrently, we have the following twelve retail coffee locations:\n● La Floresta Shopping Village in Brea, California;\n● La Crescenta, California;\n● Corona Del Mar, California;\n● Home Depot Center in Laguna Woods, California;\n● Manhattan Village at Manhattan Beach, California.\n● Huntington Beach, California;\n● Galleria at Tyler in Riverside, California;\n● Intersect in Irvine, California;\n● Diamond Bar, California;\n● Anaheim, California;\n● Daejeon, Korea; and\n● Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nRevenue\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company’s net revenue primarily consists of revenues from its retail\nlocations and wholesale and online store. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue as follows:\n● Retail Store Revenue\nRetail store revenues are recognized when payment is tendered at the point of sale. Retail store revenues are reported net of sales, use or other transaction taxes that are\ncollected from customers and remitted to taxing authorities. Sales taxes that are payable are recorded as accrued as other current liabilities. Retail store revenue makes up\napproximately 92% of the Company’s total revenue.\n● Wholesale and Online Revenue\nWholesale and online revenues are recognized when the products are delivered, and title passes to the customers or to the wholesale distributors. When customers pick\nup products at the Company’s warehouse, or distributed to the wholesale distributors, the title passes, and revenue is recognized.\nWholesale revenues make up approximately 8% of the Company’s total revenue.\n22\n● Royalties and Other Fees\nFranchise revenues consist of royalty fees and other franchise fees. Royalty fees are based on a percentage of a franchisee’s weekly gross sales revenue at 5%. The\nCompany recognizes the fee as the underlying sales occur. The Company did not have any revenue from royalties or other fees for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023.\nLong-lived Assets\nIn accordance with FASB ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, the Company reviews for impairment of long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles whenever\nevents or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. The Company considers the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable based\nupon our review of the following events or changes in circumstances: the asset’s ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods;\nloss of legal ownership or title to the assets; significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset; or significant negative industry or economic\ntrends. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset are less than its carrying amount. As of September\n30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company was not aware of any events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the long-lived assets are impaired.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales includes costs associated with generating revenue within our company-owned retail locations, and franchising operations (of which, as of September 30, 2024, we had\nnone).\nShipping and Handling Costs\nThe Company incurred freight out cost and is included in the Company’s cost of sale.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense includes store-related expense as well as the Company’s corporate headquarters’ expenses.\nAdvertising Expense\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses amounted to $110,050 and $49,531 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are\nrecorded under general and administrative expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nPre-opening Costs\nPre-opening costs for new stores, which are not material, consist primarily of payroll and recruiting expense, training, marketing, rent, travel, and supplies, and are expensed as\nincurred depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the lease term, including renewal periods that are reasonably assured.\n23\nResults of Operations\nThree and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nThe following table presents selected comparative results of operations from our unaudited financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared\nto three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our financial results for these periods are not necessarily indicative of the financial results that we will achieve in future\nperiods.

Revenues were approximately $1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $1.5 million for the comparable period in 2023,\nrepresenting a decrease of approximately $255,000, or 16.9%.\nProduct, food and drink costs\nProduct, food and drink costs were approximately $1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $1.3 million for the comparable period in 2023,\nrepresenting a decrease of approximately $253,000 or 19.1%, and were approximately $441,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $442,000 for the\ncomparable period in the prior year.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were approximately $5.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $5.7 million for the comparable period in the prior\nyear, representing an increase of approximately $157,000, or 2.8%, and were approximately $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $1.8 million for\nthe comparable period in 2023, representing a decrease of approximately $257,000, or 14.3%.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have a history of operating losses and negative cash flow in operating activities. We have incurred recurring net losses, including net losses from operations before income\ntaxes of $3.0 million and $3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We used $3.3 million and $3.0 million of cash for operating activities for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOur cash needs will depend on numerous factors, including our revenues, completion of our product development activities, customer and market acceptance of our product, and\nour ability to reduce and control costs. We expect to devote substantial capital resources to, among other things, fund operations and continue development plans.\nTo support our existing and planned business model, the Company needs to raise additional capital to fund our future operations. The Company has not experienced any difficulty\nin raising funds through loans, and has not experienced any liquidity problems in settling payables in the normal course of business and repaying loans when they fall due.\nSuccessful renewal of our loans, however, is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. In addition, the increasingly competitive industry conditions under which we operate\nmay negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows. Additional debt financing is anticipated to fund the Company’s operations in the near future. However, there are\nno current agreements or understandings with regard to the form, time or amount of such financing and there is no assurance that any of this financing can be obtained or that the\nCompany can continue as a going concern.\n25\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nStatement of Cash Flow Data:\nNet cash used in operating activities 3,319,670 2,990,792\nNet cash used in investing activities 641,059 746,416\nNet cash provided by financing activities 3,902,291 1,082,134\nCash Flows used in Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately $3.3 million, which resulted from net loss of $3.0 million and from the\nchanges in operating assets and liabilities.\nCash Flows used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $641,059 and $746,416, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities for\nthe third quarter of 2024 was primarily related to the purchase of equipment.\nCash Flows provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $3.9 million and $1.1 million, respectively. Net cash flows provided by\nfinancing activities for the third quarter of 2024 was primarily proceeds from the issuance of common stock.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had total assets of approximately $10.6 million. Our cash balance as of September 30, 2024 was approximately $106,000.\nCredit Facilities\nEconomic Injury Disaster Loan\nOn May 16, 2020, we executed the EIDL Loan from the SBA under its EIDL assistance program in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. As of September\n30, 2024, the loan payable, EIDL Loan noted above is not in default.\nPursuant to the SBA Loan Agreement, we borrowed an aggregate principal amount of the EIDL Loan of $500,000, with proceeds to be used for working capital purposes. Interest\naccrues at the rate of 3.75% per annum and will accrue only on funds actually advanced from the date of each advance. Installment payments, including principal and interest, are\ndue monthly beginning May 16, 2021 (twelve months from the date of the SBA Loan Agreement) in the amount of $731. The balance of principal and interest is payable thirty years\nfrom the date of the SBA Loan Agreement. In connection therewith, we also received a $10,000 grant, which does not have to be repaid. During the year ended December 31, 2020,\n$10,000 was recorded in Economy injury disaster loan (EIDL) grant income in the Statements of Operations. The schedule of payments on this loan was later deferred to commence\n24 months from the date of loan and we has paid all payments owed since May 2022.\nIn connection therewith, we executed (i) a loan for the benefit of the SBA, which contains customary events of default and (ii) a Security Agreement, granting the SBA a security\ninterest in all of our tangible and intangible personal property, which also contains customary events of default (the \"SBA Security Agreement”).\n26\nPaycheck Protection Program Loan\nIn May 2020, we secured a loan under the PPP administered by the SBA in the amount of $115,000. In February 2021, we secured a second loan under this program in the amount of\napproximately $167,000. The interest rate of the loan is 1.00% per annum and accrues on the unpaid principal balance computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed\nin a year of 360 days. Commencing seven months after the effective date of each PPP Loan, we are required to pay the Lender equal monthly payments of principal and interest as\nrequired to fully amortize any unforgiven principal balance of the loan by the two-year anniversary of the effective date of the loan. The PPP Loan contains customary events of\ndefault relating to, among other things, payment defaults, making materially false or misleading representations to the SBA or the Lender, or breaching the terms of the PPP Loan.\nThe occurrence of an event of default may result in the repayment of all amounts outstanding under the PPP Loan, collection of all amounts owing, or filing suit and obtaining\njudgment against us. Under the terms of the CARES Act, PPP loan recipients can apply for and be granted forgiveness for all or a portion of the loan granted under the PPP. Such\nforgiveness will be determined, subject to limitations, based on the use of loan proceeds for payment of payroll costs and any payments of mortgage interest, rent, and utilities.\nRecent modifications to the PPP by the U.S. Treasury and Congress have extended the time period for loan forgiveness beyond the original eight-week period, making it possible\nfor the Company to apply for forgiveness of its PPP loan. We were granted forgiveness for the initial PPP Loan prior to December 31, 2021 and expects to be granted forgiveness on\nthe remainder subsequently.\nLeases\nOperating Leases\nWe currently lease all company-owned retail locations. Operating leases typically contain escalating rentals over the lease term, as well as optional renewal periods. Rent expense\nfor operating leases is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term and begins when Reborn has the right to use the property. The difference between rent expense and\ncash payment is recorded as deferred rent on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Pre-opening rent is included in selling, general and administrative expenses on the\naccompanying consolidated statements of income. Tenant incentives used to fund leasehold improvements are recorded in deferred rent and amortized as reductions to rent\nexpense over the term of the lease.\nIncome Taxes\nReborn files income tax returns in the U.S. federal and California state jurisdictions.\nWe are taxed at the prevailing corporate tax rates for U.S. federal, state and local income taxes. Accordingly, a provision is recorded for the anticipated tax consequences of our\nreported results of operations for U.S. federal, state and foreign income taxes.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that we are required to disclose pursuant to these regulations. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into operating\nlease commitments, purchase commitments and other contractual obligations. These transactions are recognized in our financial statements in accordance with GAAP.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to utilize estimates and make judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses\nand related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be\nreasonable under the circumstances. The estimates are evaluated by management on an ongoing basis, and the results of these evaluations form a basis for making decisions\nabout the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Although actual results may differ from these estimates under different\nassumptions or conditions, management believes that the estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements are reasonable. The critical accounting policies affecting our\nfinancial reporting are summarized in Note 2 to the financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nWe have determined that all other issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements are inapplicable or insignificant to us and once adopted are not expected to have a\nmaterial impact on our financial position.\n27\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by 17 C.F.R. 229 (10)(f)(1)(i) and are not required to provide information under this item.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\nas amended (the \"Exchange Act”)), as of September 30, 2024. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we\nfile or submit under the Exchange Act (a) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC”) rules\nand forms and (b) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions\nregarding any required disclosure.\nManagement has identified control deficiencies regarding inadequate accounting resources, the lack of segregation of duties and the need for a stronger internal control\nenvironment. Our management believes that these material weaknesses are due to the small size of our accounting staff. The small size of our accounting outsourced staff may\nprevent adequate controls in the future due to the cost/benefit of such remediation.\nTo mitigate the current limited resources and limited employees, we rely heavily on direct management oversight of transactions, along with the use of external legal and\naccounting professionals. As we grow, we expect to increase our number of employees, which will enable us to implement adequate segregation of duties within the internal\ncontrol framework.\nThese control deficiencies could result in a misstatement of account balances that would result in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to our financial statements\nmay not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In light of this material weakness, we performed additional analyses and procedures in order to conclude that our financial\nstatements for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q were fairly stated in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly,\nmanagement believes that despite our material weaknesses, our financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, are fairly stated, in all material respects, in\naccordance with GAAP.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n28\nPART II—OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings.\nIn the future, the Company may be subject to various legal proceedings from time to time as part of its business. We are currently not involved in litigation that we believe will have\na materially adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. As of September 30, 2024, there is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by\nany court, public board, government agency, self- regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of our company or any of our subsidiaries\nthreatened against or affecting our company, our common stock, any of our subsidiaries or of our company’s or our company’s subsidiaries’ officers or directors in their capacities\nas such, in which an adverse decision is expected to have a material adverse effect.\nItem 1A.

Each pre-funded warrant will be exercisable for one share of common stock at an exercise price of $0.0001 per share. For\neach pre-funded warrant we sell, the number of shares of common stock we are offering will be decreased on a one-for-one basis. The assumed public offering price for each such\npre-funded warrant is $[ ] which is equal to the closing price per share of our common stock on Nasdaq on [ ], 2024 less the $0.0001 per share exercise price of each such pre-\nfunded warrant. Each pre-funded warrant will be immediately exercisable and will expire when exercised in full.\nWe have engaged Dawson James Securities, Inc., or the “placement agent,” to act as our exclusive placement agent in connection with this offering. The placement agent has\nagreed to use its reasonable best efforts to arrange for the sale of the securities offered by this prospectus. The placement agent is not purchasing or selling any of the securities\nwe are offering and the placement agent is not required to arrange the purchase or sale of any specific number or dollar amount of securities. We have agreed to pay to the\nplacement agent the placement agent fees set forth in the table below, which assumes that we sell all of the securities offered by this prospectus. There is no arrangement for funds\nto be received in escrow, trust, or similar arrangement. There is no minimum number of shares of common stock or pre-funded warrants or minimum aggregate amount of proceeds\nthat is a condition for this offering to close. We may sell fewer than all of the shares of common stock and pre-funded warrants offered hereby, which may significantly reduce the\namount of proceeds received by us, and investors in this offering will not receive a refund if we do not sell all of the securities offered hereby. We will bear all costs associated with\nthe offering. (See “Plan of Distribution.”)\nOur common stock is listed on Nasdaq under the symbol “REBN.” On [ ], 2024, the closing price of our common stock as reported on Nasdaq was $[ ]. All share and pre-funded\nwarrant numbers are based on an assumed public offering price of $[ ] per share (or $[ ] per pre-funded warrant).\nThere is no established public trading market for the pre-funded warrants, and we do not expect such markets to develop. We do not intend to apply for listing of the pre-funded\nwarrants on any securities exchange or other nationally recognized trading system. Without an active trading market, the liquidity of the pre-funded warrants is limited.\nThe final public offering price for the securities offered by this prospectus will be determined between us and the investors in this offering at the time of pricing and may be at a\ndiscount to the current market price. Therefore, the assumed public offering price per share of common stock or pre-funded warrant used throughout this prospectus may not be\nindicative of the final public offering price for our common stock or pre-funded warrants, as applicable.\nThis offering will terminate on [ ], unless we decide to terminate the offering (which we may do at any time in our discretion) prior to that date. We will have one closing for all of\nthe securities purchased in this offering. The public offering price per share of common stock (or pre-funded warrant) will be fixed for the duration of this offering.\nWe are a “smaller reporting company” as defined under the federal securities laws and, under applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rules, we have elected to comply\nwith certain reduced public company reporting and disclosure requirements.\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 7 of this prospectus to read about factors you should consider before investing\nin our securities.\nPer Share of Per Pre-\nCommon Funded\nStock Warrant Total\nPublic offering price\nPlacement agent fees (1)\nProceeds to us, before expenses (2)\n(1) We have agreed to (i) pay the placement agent a cash fee up to 8.0% of the aggregate gross proceeds raised in this offering; provided however, that such commissions shall\nbe reduced to 3.5% if and to the extent any gross proceeds are raised from retail investors introduced to the offering by any officer or director of the Company. We have also\nagreed to reimburse the placement agent for certain expenses and closing costs. (See “Plan of Distribution” for additional information and a description of the compensation\npayable to the placement agent.)\n(2) Because there is no minimum number of securities or amount of proceeds required as a condition to closing in this offering, the actual public offering amount, placement agent\nfees, and proceeds to us, if any, are not presently determinable and may be substantially less than the total maximum offering amounts set forth above. (See “Plan of\nDistribution” for more information.)\nNeither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of these securities or passed upon the accuracy or adequacy\nof the disclosures in the prospectus. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.\nThe delivery of the shares of common stock and any pre-funded warrants to purchasers in this offering is expected to be made on or about [ ], 2024.\nDAWSON JAMES SECURITIES, INC.\nThe date of this prospectus is [ ], 2024\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPage\nAbout This Prospectus ii\nProspectus Summary 1\nThe Offering 6\nRisk Factors 7\nSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 11\nUse of Proceeds 12\nMarket for Common Stock and Dividend Policy 13\nCapitalization 14\nSecurity Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management 15\nDescription of Securities 16\nPlan of Distribution 19\nManagement 22\nLegal Matters 29\nExperts 29\nIncorporation of Certain Information by Reference 30\nWhere You Can Find More Information 31\ni\nABOUT THIS PROSPECTUS\nUnless the context otherwise requires, the terms “Reborn,” “Reborn Coffee,” “the Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Reborn Coffee, Inc.\nThe registration statement on Form S-1 of which this prospectus forms a part and that we have filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), includes\nexhibits that provide more detail of the matters discussed in this prospectus.

We are an innovative company that strives for constant improvement in\nthe coffee experience through exploration of new technology and premier service, guided by traditional brewing techniques. We believe Reborn differentiates itself from other\ncoffee roasters through its innovative techniques, including sourcing, washing, roasting, and brewing our coffee beans with a balance of precision and craft.\nFounded in 2015 by Jay Kim, our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Kim and his team launched Reborn with the vision of using the finest pure ingredients and pristine water. We\ncurrently serve customers through our retail store locations in California, Korea, and Malaysia.\nReborn continues to elevate the high-end coffee experience and we received first place traditional still in “America’s Best Cold Brew” competition by Coffee Fest in 2017 in\nPortland and 2018 in Los Angeles.\nThe source of coffee is the pinnacle of specialty coffee. The coffee industry has gone through various phases including the first, second, third, and fourth wave. In the first and\nsecond waves of coffee, the single-origin source and type of the coffee is not necessarily in the forefront during the sourcing process. As such, much of the coffee may be a\nblend with various sources and a mix of Robusta and Arabica coffee beans. The third wave of coffee focuses on a single-origin source and one variety of coffee bean\n(specifically Arabica beans). Single-origin beans can focus on specific countries and can also be hyper-focused on specific regions in the third wave of coffee, such as Coban in\nGuatemala. Arabia beans are considered premier due to the specific requirements for growth and the high-quality flavor they produce. Arabica coffee is required to be grown in\nhigher, cooler elevations.\nDifferentiated from other coffee companies, the Reborn Wash Process is the key to creating the clean flavor of our coffee. Our Wash Process is distinguished by the use of\nmagnetized water to wash our green coffee beans when they arrive at the Reborn facility, in order to extract impurities and enhance hydration before the roasting process.\nMagnetizing water is a process that converts the particles of water, which can naturally appear in various sizes, into evenly sized particles. As a result of this process, we\nbelieve that the water increases its hydration and ability to absorb into organic material. Our water is created through a water magnetizing device in which water flows through\nthe device and magnetizes the water on-site immediately prior to use.\nAfter the wash, we roast our washed-green beans based on the profile of each single-origin. After the coffee beans are roasted, they are then packaged into various products\nsuch as whole bean coffee, pour over packs, and cold brew packs. Additionally, whole bean inventory is also supplied to the kiosks and cafes. A portion of the roasted coffee is\nalso allotted to create our award-winning cold brew concentrate. Our cold brew production is created using a proprietary percolation technique, also using magnetized water at\neach step to enhance the flavor of the cold brew.\nWe continually innovate the way we serve coffee. At our cafes, we serve customers our award-winning coffee through cold brew taps in addition to freshly ground coffee\nbeans in espresso-made drinks. Other brew methods, such as an in-house pour over and drip coffee, are also available.\n1\nThe Experience, Reborn\nWe believe that we are the leading pioneers of the emerging “Fourth Wave” movement and that our business is redefining specialty coffee as an experience that demands much\nmore than premium quality. We consider ourselves leaders of the “Fourth Wave” coffee movement because we are constantly developing our bean processing methods,\nresearching design concepts, and reinventing new ways of drinking coffee. For instance, the current transition from the K-Cup trend to the pour over drip concept allowed us to\nreinvent the way people consume coffee, by merging convenience and quality. We took the pour over drip concept and made it available and affordable to the public through\nour Reborn Coffee pour over packs. Our pour over packs allow our consumers to consume our specialty coffee outdoors and on-the-go.\nOur success in innovating within the “Fourth Wave” coffee movement is measured by our success in business to business (“B2B”) sales with our introduction of pour over\npacks to hotels. With the introduction of our pour over packs to major hotels (including one hotel company with seven locations), our B2B sales increased as these companies\nrecognized the convenience and functionality our pour over packs serve to their customers.\nCentered around our core values of service, trust, and well-being, we deliver an appreciation of coffee as both a science and an art. Developing innovative processes such as\nwashing green coffee beans with magnetized water, we challenge traditional preparation methods by focusing on the relationship between water chemistry, health, and flavor\nprofile. Leading research studies, testing brewing equipment, and refining roasting/brewing methods to a specific, we proactively distinguish exceptional quality from good\nquality by starting at the foundation and paying attention to the details. Our mission places an equal emphasis on humanizing the coffee experience, delivering a fresh take on\n“farm-to-table” by sourcing internationally. In this way, we create opportunities to develop transparency by paying homage to origin stories and spark new conversations by\nbuilding cross-cultural communities united by a passion for the finest coffee.\nThrough a broad product offering, Reborn provides customers with a wide variety of beverages and coffee options. As a result, we believe we can capture share of any\nexperience where customers seek to consume great beverages whether in our inviting store atmospheres which are designed for comfort, or on the go through our pour over\npacks, or at home with our whole bean ground coffee bags. We believe that the retail coffee market in the United States is large and growing. According to IBIS, in 2023, the\nretail market for coffee in the United States was $72.1 billion. This is expected to grow due to a shift in consumer preferences to premium coffee, including specialized blends,\nespresso-based beverages, and cold brew options. Reborn aims to capture a growing portion of the market as we expand and increase consumer awareness of our brand.\nBranding\nReborn Coffee focuses on two key features in our branding, including “Introducing the Fourth Wave” and “America’s Best Cold Brew.” These phrases encapsulate the quality\nof the Reborn Process of sourcing, washing, roasting, and brewing coffee and the quality of the product that we create.\nThe Reborn brand is essential to our marketing strategy, as it allows us to stand out compared to our competitors. The products aim to make customers feel “reborn” after\ndrinking a cup of coffee.\nOur Menu and Products\nWe purchase and roast high-quality coffees that we sell, along with handcrafted coffee, tea and other beverages and a variety of high-quality food items. We believe in offering\ncustomers the same great taste and quality whether served in store or on the go. We also partner with third-party importers and exporters to purchase and import our green\ncoffee beans. Through these relationships, we source high-quality coffee beans from across the globe, including Mexico, Ethiopia, Colombia, Guatemala, Brazil, and Honduras.\nFranchise Operations\nIn January 2021, we formed Reborn Coffee Franchise LLC in the State of California with the intention of franchising Reborn Coffee retail stores and kiosks. We expect to begin\nfranchise sales in 2025. We plan to charge future franchisees a non-refundable franchise fee and certain marketing and royalty fees based on gross sales, however we presently\nhave no contractual commitments or other agreements to do so. We believe that our team’s prior experience building a large, global foodservice business will allow us to rapidly\nscale our future franchise effort. In addition, we have formed a franchise council consisting of a team of franchise experts to advise us. We plan to eventually expand beyond\nCalifornia to additional states to create a national and global presence.\n2\nExpanding Sales Channels\nToday, we sell a variety of our coffee and tea products through the enterprise, or commercial, channel, which we refer to as “B2B,” as well as direct-to-consumer via our website.\nWe expect to increase our channel presence by increasing the availability of Reborn Coffee in businesses and enterprises, and expand upon the partnerships we have in place\nwith hotel operators to increase the use and brand awareness in hospitality. We also expect to grow our online sales through new partnerships with third-party retailers. Our\nproducts are available in various form factors, such as whole bean roasted coffee bags, single-serve drip bags, and our Pour Over Packs. We are exploring partnerships with\ngrocery operators and foodservice providers to expand the Reborn Coffee brand.\nExperienced Leadership Team\nOur relentless commitment to excellence is driven by our passionate management team under the leadership of our Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Jay Kim. Mr. Kim\nlaunched Reborn with the vision to provide the best coffee using the purest ingredients. He is focused on the expansion of Reborn and has surrounded himself with leaders that\nhave direct experience in beverage and retail. Stephan Kim, our Chief Financial Officer, has 20 years of experience in public accounting and consulting. Other members of our\nexecutive leadership team bring high growth, franchise, and sector expertise.\nOur Commitment to Our Team\nWe also believe in mentoring the developing the next generation of premium coffee baristas. Through our in-depth training, we aim to train dedicated employees who\nunderstand the science and art behind every cup of coffee. We also expect to form a training school specializing in creating passionate baristas and coffee connoisseurs, by\neducating our students about coffee processes and preparation methods. The efforts for the training school are underway and we expect to launch the program in 2025.\nOur Highly Engaged Customers\nOur customers are loyal to our brand due to our intense focus on premium coffee and customer service. Community engagement is another essential element of our in-person\nmarketing strategy. We host on-site engagements, such as event sponsorships, and engage with local Chambers of Commerce. We previously worked with Lululemon to host\nyoga sessions outside of our retail locations, creatively engaging the community while simultaneously promoting Reborn as an active lifestyle. We have also hosted pop-up\nlocations on the Facebook campus, further expanding our outreach and introducing our brand name to different communities. We further engage with the community by\norganizing our own latte art competitions, in which baristas can compete for prizes and customers in the audience can witness our competitive passion.\nDigital Channels\nWe focus on many digital channels in our marketing strategy. Social media is an important leg that creates engagement and education of the Reborn brand. Customers primarily\nengage the brand on Instagram, where we host giveaways, share new store openings, and promote seasonal menus. Through our unique, modern aesthetic and intense focus\non high-quality coffee, we are able to share the quality and essence of Reborn on display inside of our retail locations with existing and future customers on social media\nplatforms.\nFor both the in-store café channel and the e-commerce channel, SMS & email marketing are used for reengagement and communication of new products and offerings.\nDigital advertising channels are also used, primarily to engage the online market audience. Google and Facebook are the primary paid ad channels that we currently utilize. Yelp\nadvertising is also used to engage local customers and tourists who visit specific areas where our retail locations are located.\n3\nIn-Person Marketing Engagement\nEngaging customers in-store with a marketing plan is essential for customer retention and new customer generation. Our customer loyalty program provides free drinks for every\nten drinks purchased. Additionally, store customers may participate in promotional deals, especially during the holidays and new item releases, to try new innovative items\ncreated in-house. We also offer coffee samples of our Pour Over Packs as well as new beans to our retail location customers. The distribution of coffee samples has expanded\ncustomers’ knowledge of our products and led to increased whole bean sales.\nOur locations are located in heavily trafficked areas as well as popular malls. As such, the potential for marketing and branding is very high in these locations. Signage and\npromotional deals with giveaways are essential to attracting new customers.\nGrowth Strategies\nCorporate and Franchise Expansion\nWe also plan to expand across the Unites States with company operated locations and franchise locations. We aim to accelerate our growth through our franchise program. We\nplan to continue to innovate in the coffee industry by making the industry more personal to the consumers, prospective franchisees, and employees. We plan to achieve our\ngoal through the continued innovation in our products, sourcing directly from farms, and giving customers choices in how their coffee is served to them. As we expand, we\nhope to show the world that expanding in volume and size does not diminish the quality and personal element that is instilled in the coffee industry.\nWe have started to scale our logistics and supply chain to provide support for our rapid growth, including for our future franchisees. We have increased roasting capacity and\nour paper goods supplies, including an emphasis on eco-friendly products.\nB2B Strategy\nWe believe our products are unique given their potential to engage with business partners for large wholesale orders. We have built strong relationships with hotel\nmanagement companies within California and out-of-state. We currently work with several hotels, providing our Pour Over Packs and cold brew packs to cater to their customer\nneeds. We plan to continue growing our B2B marketing and sales strategy through active outreach and advertising to potential partners. We believe that access to large-scale\ndistribution channels such as hotels increases consumer awareness of our brand while providing us access to large enterprise customers. Gift giving comprises a large\npercentage of our winter B2B sales. During the holidays, our B2B marketing strategy focuses on targeting companies, and specific teams within companies, that are seeking to\nprovide end of the year gifts to their clients and customers. We provide customized gift sets to each customer’s needs. Word-of-mouth marketing has grown our B2B holiday\ngift giving accounts greatly, forging opportunities to have worked with companies like Google to provide gift sets for their clients. We plan to expand not only by growing our\nretail location footprint, but also through the development of more hotel partnerships, expansion into grocery stores and markets, and expansion of our e-commerce and\nwholesale.\nWe believe the grocery market is another major channel through which we hope to access in the future. Through both bulk sales of roasted beans and in-store kiosks, as well\nsales of pre-packaged products, we may be able to access customers who purchase both in volume and for those customers looking for a handcrafted beverage during their in-\nstore shopping experience. We are exploring discussions with a variety of retailers and expect to access these additional sales channels in 2025.\nLegal Proceedings\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings from time to time as part of its business. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, if determined adversely to us,\nwe believe would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. However, legal\nproceedings are inherently uncertain. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter or a combination of matters may be material to our results of operations for a particular\nperiod, depending upon the size of the loss or our income for that particular period.\nEmployees and Human Capital\nAs of the date of this prospectus, we had 19 full-time employees and 89 part-time employees.\n4\nProperties\nWe have a production and distribution center at our headquarters that we use to process and roast coffee for wholesale and retail distribution at 580 N.

Without a trading market, the liquidity of the pre-funded warrants will be\nextremely limited.\nThe outstanding share information in the table above is based on 3,672,564 shares of our common stock outstanding as of October 31, 2024 and assumes no sale of any pre-\nfunded warrants and no exercise of such pre-funded warrants.\n6\nRISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Before deciding whether to invest in our securities, you should carefully consider the risks described below and\nthose discussed under the Section captioned “Risk Factors” contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023, as revised or\nsupplemented by our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or our current reports on Form 8-K, each as filed with the SEC and which are incorporated by reference in\nthis prospectus, together with other information in this prospectus, the information and documents incorporated by reference herein, and in any free writing prospectus that we\nhave authorized for use in connection with this offering. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be\nseriously harmed. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, resulting in a loss of all or part of your investment. Please also read carefully the section\nbelow entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”\nRisks Related to This Offering\nAn investment in our securities is speculative and could result in a loss of your entire investment.\nAn investment in our securities is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. There is no assurance that investors will obtain any return on their investment. You should not\npurchase the securities if you cannot afford the loss of your entire investment.\nThis is a best efforts offering, no minimum amount of securities is required to be sold, and we may not raise the amount of capital we believe is required for our business\nplans, including our near-term business plans.\nThe placement agent has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to solicit offers to purchase the securities in this offering. The placement agent has no obligation to buy any of\nthe securities from us or to arrange for the purchase or sale of any specific number or dollar amount of the securities. There is no required minimum number of securities that must\nbe sold as a condition to completion of this offering. Because there is no minimum offering amount required as a condition to the closing of this offering, the actual offering\namount, placement agent fees, and proceeds to us are not presently determinable and may be substantially less than the maximum amounts set forth above. We may sell fewer than\nall of the securities offered hereby, which may significantly reduce the amount of proceeds received by us, and investors in this offering will not receive a refund in the event that\nwe do not sell an amount of securities sufficient to support our continued operations, including our near-term continued operations. Thus, we may not raise the amount of capital\nwe believe is required for our operations in the short-term and may need to raise additional funds, which may not be available or available on terms acceptable to us.\nThere is no public market for the pre-funded warrants being offered by us in this offering.\nThere is no established public trading market for the pre-funded warrants and we do not expect a market to develop. In addition, we do not intend to apply to list the pre-funded\nwarrants on any national securities exchange or other nationally recognized trading system. Without an active market, the liquidity of the pre-funded warrants is limited.\nThe pre-funded warrants are speculative in nature.\nThe pre-funded warrants offered hereby do not confer any rights of share of common stock ownership on their holders, such as voting rights or the right to receive dividends, but\nrather merely represent the right to acquire shares of common stock at a fixed price. Specifically, commencing on the date of issuance, holders of the pre-funded warrants may\nacquire the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such pre-funded warrants at an exercise price of $0.0001 per share of common stock. Moreover, following this\noffering, the market value of the pre-funded warrants is uncertain and there can be no assurance that the market value of the pre-funded warrants will equal or exceed their\nrespective public offering prices. There can be no assurance that the market price of the shares of common stock will ever equal or exceed the exercise price of the pre-funded\nwarrants, and consequently, whether it will ever be profitable for holders of the pre-funded warrants to exercise the pre-funded warrants.\n7\nHolders of the pre-funded warrants offered hereby will have no rights as common stockholders with respect to the shares our common stock underlying the pre-funded\nwarrants until such holders exercise such pre-funded warrants and acquire our common stock, except as otherwise provided in the pre-funded warrants.\nUntil holders of the pre-funded warrants acquire shares of our common stock upon exercise thereof, such holders will have no rights with respect to the shares of our common\nstock underlying such pre-funded warrants, except to the extent that holders of such pre-funded warrants will have certain rights to participate in distributions or dividends paid on\nour common stock as set forth in the pre-funded warrants. Upon exercise of the pre-funded warrants, the holders will be entitled to exercise the rights of a common stockholder\nonly as to matters for which the record date occurs after the exercise date.\nProvisions of the pre-funded warrants offered by this prospectus could discourage an acquisition of us by a third party.\nCertain provisions of the pre-funded warrants offered by this prospectus could make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire us. Such pre-funded warrants prohibit\nus from engaging in certain transactions constituting “fundamental transactions” unless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the pre-funded\nwarrants. This and other provisions of the pre-funded warrants offered by this prospectus could prevent or deter a third party from acquiring us even where the acquisition could\nbe beneficial to you.\nWe have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds from this offering and may not use them effectively.\nOur management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds, including for any of the purposes described in the section of this prospectus. (See “Use of\nProceeds.”) You will be relying on the judgment of our management with regard to the use of these net proceeds, and you will not have the opportunity, as part of your investment\ndecision, to assess whether the net proceeds are being used appropriately. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could result in financial losses that\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, cause the price of our securities to decline and delay the development of our product candidates. Pending the application of\nthese funds, we may invest the net proceeds from this offering in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value.\nRisks Related to our Securities\nIt is not possible to predict the actual number of shares we will sell under the SEPA to YA II PN, or the actual gross proceeds resulting from those sales.\nWe are party to a Standby Equity Purchase Agreement with YA II PN, LTD (“YA II PN”) dated February 12, 2024 (the “SEPA”). Pursuant to the SEPA, we may sell to YA II PN up\nto $5,000,000 of shares of common stock (the “Advance Shares”), from time to time during the term of the SEPA. Subject to certain limitations in the SEPA and compliance with\napplicable law, we have the discretion to deliver notices to YA II PN at any time throughout the term of the SEPA. The actual number of shares of common stock are sold to YA II\nPN may depend based on a number of factors, including the market price of our common stock during the sales period.\nBecause the price per share of each share sold to YA II PN will fluctuate during the sales period, it is not currently possible to predict the number of shares that will be sold or the\nactual gross proceeds to be raised in connection with those sales.\nIn addition, any issuance and sale by us under the SEPA of a substantial amount of shares of common stock could cause additional substantial dilution to our stockholders.\nWe may require additional financing to sustain our operations and without it we may not be able to continue operations.\nSubject to the terms and conditions of the SEPA, we may, at our discretion, direct YA II PN to purchase up to $5.0 million of shares of our common stock under the SEPA from time-\nto-time. The purchase price per share for the shares of common stock that we may elect to sell to YA II PN under the SEPA will fluctuate based on the market prices of our common\nstock for each purchase made pursuant to the SEPA, if any. Accordingly, it is not currently possible to predict the number of shares that will be sold to YA II PN, the actual\npurchase price per share to be paid by YA II PN for those shares, if any, or the actual gross proceeds to be raised in connection with those sales.\n8\nThe extent to which we rely on YA II PN as a source of funding will depend on a number of factors including, the prevailing market price of our common stock and the extent to\nwhich we are able to secure working and other capital from other sources. If obtaining sufficient funding from YA II PN were to prove unavailable or prohibitively dilutive, we may\nneed to secure another source of funding in order to satisfy our working and other capital needs. Even if we were to sell to YA II PN all of the shares of common stock available for\nsale to YA II PN under the SEPA, we may still need additional capital to fully implement our business, operating and development plans. Should the financing we require to sustain\nour working capital needs be unavailable or prohibitively expensive when we require it, the consequences may be a material adverse effect on our business, operating results,\nfinancial condition and prospects.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or other securities might result in significant dilution and could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nTo raise capital, we may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions, at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time.\nWe may sell shares or other securities in another offering at a price per share that is less than the price per share paid by investors in this offering, and investors purchasing shares\nor other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock, or securities\nconvertible or exchangeable into common stock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share paid by investors in this offering.\nWe cannot predict what effect, if any, sales of shares of our common stock in the public market or the availability of shares for sale will have on the market price of our common\nstock. However, future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including shares issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants and\nconvertible preferred shares, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe terms of our indebtedness, including the covenants and the dates on which principal and interest payments on our indebtedness are due, increases the risk that we will be\nunable to continue as a going concern.\nAs of December 31, 2023, and June 30, 2024 we had $1.48 million, and $1.57 million, respectively, in outstanding short-term borrowing. In addition, on May 20, 2024, we issued a\nnote which has a principal balance of $800,000 and, beginning on August 15, 2024, it required monthly principal and interest payments in excess of $266,667. On August 29, 2024,\nwe issued another note which has a principal balance of $500,000. The terms of our indebtedness, including the covenants and the dates on which principal and interest payments\non our indebtedness are due, increases the risk that we will be unable to continue as a going concern. To continue as a going concern over the next 12 months, we must make\npayments on our debt as they come due and comply with the covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness or, if we fail to do so, to (i) negotiate and obtain waivers of\nor forbearances with respect to any defaults that occur with respect to our indebtedness, (ii) amend, replace, refinance, or restructure any or all of the agreements governing our\nindebtedness, and/or (iii) otherwise secure additional capital. However, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in accomplishing any of these plans.\nDue to the implementation of the Reverse Stock Split, the liquidity of our common stock may be adversely effected.\nOur common stock began trading on Nasdaq on a Reverse Stock Split-adjusted basis beginning on January 22, 2024. The liquidity of the shares of our common stock may be\naffected adversely by any reverse stock split given the reduced number of shares of our common stock that are outstanding following the Reverse Stock Split, especially if the\nmarket price of our common stock does not increase as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. Following the Reverse Stock Split, the resulting market price of our common stock may\nnot attract new investors and may not satisfy the investing requirements of those investors. Although we believe that a higher market price of our common stock may help\ngenerate greater or broader investor interest, there can be no assurance that the Reverse Stock Split resulted in a share price that will attract new investors, including institutional\ninvestors. In addition, there can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will satisfy the investing requirements of those investors. As a result, the trading\nliquidity of our common stock may not necessarily improve.\n9\nIf we are unable to satisfy the applicable continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, our common stock could be delisted.\nOn June 21, 2024, we received a written notice (the “Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq indicating that Nasdaq had determined that we had failed to\ncomply with certain Nasdaq Listing Rules because we had not yet filed our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024.\nAs previously announced, on May 15, 2024, we were required to dismiss BF Borgers CPA PC as our independent registered public accounting firm. We had to appoint a new\nindependent registered public accounting firm in order to complete and file the Form 10-Q, and on May 14, 2024, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of BCRG Group\n(“BCRG”) as our new independent registered public accounting firm. Due to the timing of the appointment of BCRG, we were unable without unreasonable effort and expense to\ncomplete the review of our financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 before the required filing date for the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nA Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) had previously placed us on a Discretionary Panel Monitor for a period of one year, or until May 16, 2025, after we regained compliance\nwith previous Nasdaq listing deficiencies, which would require Nasdaq to issue a Delist Determination Letter in the event that we failed to maintain compliance with any continued\nlisting requirement (the “Panel Monitor”). Due to the Panel Monitor, we requested an appeal of determination to the Panel, and request a stay of the suspension pending a hearing.\nOn July 19, 2024, we filed our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024.\nAlthough we anticipate complying with Nasdaq’s Listing Rules going forward, there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet continued listing requirements in the future.\nIn determining whether to afford a company a cure period prior to commencing suspension or delisting procedures, Nasdaq analyzes all relevant facts including any past\ndeficiencies, and thus our prior deficiencies could be used as a factor by Nasdaq in any future decision to delist our securities from trading on its exchange.\nIf our common stock is delisted, it could reduce the price of our common stock and the levels of liquidity available to our stockholders. In addition, the delisting of our common\nstock could materially adversely affect our access to the capital markets and any limitation on liquidity or reduction in the price of our common stock could materially adversely\naffect our ability to raise capital. Delisting from Nasdaq could also result in other negative consequences, including the potential loss of confidence by suppliers, customers and\nemployees, the loss of institutional investor interest, and fewer business development opportunities.\n10\nSPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis prospectus contains various forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, which represent our\nexpectations or beliefs concerning future events that are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management, and which\nstatements involve substantial risk and uncertainties. All statements contained in this prospectus other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding our future\noperating results and financial position, our business strategy and plans, market growth and trends, and objectives for future operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-\nlooking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they\ncontain words such as “may,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “could,” “intends,” “target,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,”\n“potential,” or “continue” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or intentions.\nThese risks and uncertainties include, among other things:\n● our ability to continue as a going concern;\n● our reliance on third party vendors;\n● our dependence on our executive officers;\n● our financial performance guidance;\n● material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting;\n● regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries;\n● the impact of laws, regulations, accounting standards, regulatory requirements, judicial decisions and guidance issued by authoritative bodies;\n● our estimates regarding expenses, future revenue and cash flow, capital requirements and needs for additional financing;\n● our financial performance; and\n● the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of our business combination and/or divestitures.\nYou should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this prospectus primarily on our\ncurrent expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. The\noutcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors described elsewhere in this prospectus and in the section\ntitled “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n11\nUSE OF PROCEEDS\nWe estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $[ ], assuming a public offering price per share of common stock of $[ ], the closing price of our\ncommon stock on Nasdaq on [ ], 2024, after deducting the placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses payable by us, assuming the sale of all of the securities offered\nunder this prospectus and no sale of any fixed combinations of pre-funded warrants offered hereunder. Because this is a best efforts offering and there is no minimum offering\namount required as a condition to the closing of this offering, the actual offering amount, the placement agent’s fees, and net proceeds to us are not presently determinable and\nmay be substantially less than the maximum amounts set forth on the cover page of this prospectus.\nWe intend to use any proceeds from this offering for working capital, strategic and general corporate purposes.\nThe expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents management’s estimates based upon current business and economic conditions. The amounts and timing of our\nactual use of net proceeds will vary depending on numerous factors. As a result, management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and investors will\nbe relying on our judgment regarding the application of the net proceeds of this offering. Although we do not contemplate changes in the proposed use of proceeds, to the extent\nwe find that adjustment is required for other uses by reason of existing business conditions, the use of proceeds may be adjusted. We reserve the right to use the net proceeds we\nreceive in the offering in any manner we consider to be appropriate, which could differ materially from those outlined above as a result of several factors including those set forth\nunder “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this prospectus.\nWe will incur all costs associated with this prospectus and the registration statement of which it is a part.\n12\nMARKET FOR COMMON STOCK AND DIVIDEND POLICY\nMarket Information and Number of Stockholders\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “REBN.” The last reported closing price for our common stock on Nasdaq on [ ], 2024 was $[ ] per\nshare.\nAs of October 31, 2024, there were 3,672,564 of our shares of common stock issued and outstanding held by approximately 198 stockholders of record. The number of record\nholders was determined from the records of our transfer agent and does not include beneficial owners of shares of common stock whose shares are held in the names of various\nsecurity brokers, dealers, and registered clearing agencies.\nDividend Policy\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and future earnings, if any, for the operation and\nexpansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination related to our dividend policy will be made\nat the discretion of our board of directors after considering our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business prospects and other factors the board of\ndirectors deems relevant, and subject to the restrictions contained in any financing instruments. Our ability to declare dividends may also be limited by restrictive covenants\npursuant to any other future debt financing agreements.\n13\nCAPITALIZATION\nThe following table sets forth our actual cash and cash equivalents and our capitalization as of June 30, 2024:\n● on an actual basis;\n● on an as adjusted basis to give effect to the events above and the issuance and sale of [ ] shares of our common stock at an assumed purchase price of $[ ] and\nassumes no issuance of the pre-funded warrants.\nYou should read this information in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our consolidated financial\nstatements and related notes for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024, included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024, which\nis incorporated by reference herein.\nAs of June 30, 2024\n(unaudited)\n(in thousands) Actual As adjusted\nCash and Cash Equivalents: $ 617,051 $\nTotal Current Liabilities: 3,711,482\nTotal Long-Term Liabilities: 4,274,836\nStockholders’ Equity (Deficit):\nCommon Stock - $0.0001 par value per share; 40,000,000 authorized shares; 3,235,657 shares issued and outstanding at June 30, 2024 324\nAdditional paid in capital 21,603,006\nAccumulated deficit (19,064,080) ([ ])\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 3,438\nTotal stockholders’ equity 2,542,688\nThe as adjusted information discussed above is illustrative only.\nThe total number of shares of our common stock reflected in the discussion and table above is based on 3,235,657 shares outstanding as of June 30, 2024.\n14\nSECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT\nThe following table sets forth certain information regarding the ownership of our common stock as of October 31, 2024 (the “Determination Date”) by: (i) each current director of\nour company; (ii) each of our Named Executive Officers (“NEOs”); (iii) all current executive officers and directors of our company as a group; and (iv) all those known by us to be\nbeneficial owners of more than five percent of our common stock.\nBeneficial ownership and percentage ownership are determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC. Under these rules, beneficial ownership generally includes any shares as to\nwhich the individual or entity has sole or shared voting power or investment power and includes any shares that an individual or entity has the right to acquire beneficial\nownership of within 60 days of the Determination Date, through the exercise of any option, warrant or similar right (such instruments being deemed to be “presently exercisable”).\nIn computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, shares of our common stock that could be issued upon the\nexercise of presently exercisable options and warrants are considered to be outstanding. These shares, however, are not considered outstanding as of the Determination Date\nwhen computing the percentage ownership of each other person.\nTo our knowledge, except as indicated in the footnotes to the following table, and subject to state community property laws where applicable, all beneficial owners named in the\nfollowing table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares shown as beneficially owned by them. Percentage of ownership is based on 3,672,564 shares of\ncommon stock outstanding as of the Determination Date. Unless otherwise indicated, the business address of each person in the table below is c/o Reborn Coffee Inc., 580 N.\nBerry St. Brea, California 92821.

For instructions on how to find copies of the filings incorporated by reference in this prospectus, see “Where You Can Find More Information.”\n16\nDESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES WE ARE OFFERING\nWe are offering up to [ ] shares of our common stock. We are also offering up to [ ] pre-funded warrants to those purchasers whose purchase of shares of common stock in this\noffering would result in the purchaser, together with its affiliates and certain related parties, beneficially owning more than 4.99% (or, at the election of the purchaser, 9.99%) of our\noutstanding shares of common stock following the consummation of this offering in lieu of the shares of common stock that would result in such excess ownership. For each pre-\nfunded warrant we sell, the number of shares of common stock we are offering will be decreased on a one-for-one basis. Each pre-funded warrant will be exercisable for one share of\ncommon stock. No warrant for fractional shares of common stock will be issued, rather warrants will be issued only for whole shares of common stock. We are also registering the\nshares of common stock issuable from time to time upon exercise of the pre-funded warrants offered hereby.\nCommon Stock\nThe material terms and provisions of our common stock are described under the caption “Description of Securities” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 filed with the SEC and Exhibit 4.3 thereto, entitled Description of Securities, and incorporated by reference in this prospectus\nPre-funded Warrants\nThe following summary of certain terms and provisions of the pre-funded warrants that are being offered hereby is not complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by,\nthe provisions of the pre-funded warrant, the form of which will be filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. Prospective investors\nshould carefully review the terms and provisions of the form of pre-funded warrant for a complete description of the terms and conditions of the pre-funded warrants.\nDuration and Exercise Price\nEach pre-funded warrant offered hereby will have an initial exercise price per share of common stock equal to $0.0001. The pre-funded warrants will be immediately exercisable and\nwill expire when exercised in full. The exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise is subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of share\ndividends, share splits, reorganizations or similar events affecting our shares of common stock and the exercise price.\nExercisability\nThe pre-funded warrants will be exercisable, at the option of each holder, in whole or in part, by delivering to us a duly executed exercise notice accompanied by payment in full for\nthe number of shares of common stock purchased upon such exercise (except in the case of a cashless exercise as discussed below). A holder (together with its affiliates) may not\nexercise any portion of the pre-funded warrant to the extent that the holder would own more than 4.99% of the outstanding shares of common stock immediately after exercise,\nexcept that upon at least 61 days’ prior notice from the holder to us, the holder may increase the amount of beneficial ownership of outstanding shares after exercising the holder’s\npre-funded warrants up to 9.99% of the number of our shares of common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the exercise, as such percentage ownership is\ndetermined in accordance with the terms of the pre-funded warrants.\nCashless Exercise\nIn lieu of making the cash payment otherwise contemplated to be made to us upon such exercise in payment of the aggregate exercise price, the holder may elect instead to receive\nupon such exercise (either in whole or in part) the net number of shares of common stock determined according to a formula set forth in the pre-funded warrants.\n17\nFractional Shares\nNo fractional shares of common stock will be issued upon the exercise of the pre-funded warrants. Rather, at our election, the number of shares of common stock to be issued will\nbe rounded up to the nearest whole number or we will pay a cash adjustment in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the exercise price.\nTransferability\nSubject to applicable laws, a pre-funded warrant may be transferred at the option of the holder upon surrender of the pre-funded warrants to us together with the appropriate\ninstruments of transfer.\nTrading Market\nThere is no trading market available for the pre-funded warrants on any securities exchange or nationally recognized trading system, and we do not expect a trading market to\ndevelop. We do not intend to list the pre-funded warrants on any securities exchange or nationally recognized trading market. Without a trading market, the liquidity of the pre-\nfunded warrants will be extremely limited. The shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the pre-funded warrants are currently traded on Nasdaq under the symbol\n“REBN.”\nRight as a Shareholder\nExcept as otherwise provided in the pre-funded warrants or by virtue of such holder’s ownership of shares of common stock, the holders of the pre-funded warrants do not have\nthe rights or privileges of holders of our shares of common stock, including any voting rights, until they exercise their pre-funded warrants. The pre-funded warrants will provide\nthat holders have the right to participate in distributions or dividends paid on our shares of common stock.\nFundamental Transaction\nIn the event of a fundamental transaction, as described in the pre-funded warrants and generally including any reorganization, recapitalization or reclassification of our shares of\ncommon stock, the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of our properties or assets, our consolidation or merger with or into another person, the acquisition of\nmore than 50% of our outstanding securities, or any person or group becoming the beneficial owner of 50% of the voting power represented by our outstanding shares of\nsecurities, the holders of the pre-funded warrants will be entitled to receive upon exercise of the pre-funded warrants the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property that\nthe holders would have received had they exercised the pre-funded warrants immediately prior to such fundamental transaction on a net exercise basis.\n18\nPLAN OF DISTRIBUTION\nWe engaged Dawson James Securities, Inc. (“Dawson” or the “placement agent”) to act as our exclusive placement agent to solicit offers to purchase the securities offered by this\nprospectus on a reasonable best efforts basis. Dawson is not purchasing or selling any securities, nor are they required to arrange for the purchase and sale of any specific number\nor dollar amount of securities, other than to use their “reasonable best efforts” to arrange for the sale of the securities by us. Therefore, we may not sell the entire amount of\nsecurities being offered. There is no minimum amount of proceeds that is a condition to closing of this offering. Dawson may engage one or more sub-placement agents or selected\ndealers to assist with the offering. Investors purchasing securities offered hereby will have the option to execute a securities purchase agreement with us. In addition to rights and\nremedies available to all investors in this offering under federal securities and state law, the investors which enter into a securities purchase agreement will also be able to bring\nclaims of breach of contract against us. The ability to pursue a claim for breach of contract is material to larger investors in this offering as a means to enforce the following\ncovenants uniquely available to them under the securities purchase agreement.\nWe will deliver the securities being issued to the investors upon receipt of such investor’s funds for the purchase of the securities offered pursuant to this prospectus supplement.\nWe expect to deliver the securities being offered pursuant to this prospectus supplement on or about [ ], 2024.\nFees and Expenses\nThe following table shows the per share and per pre-funded warrant, and total placement agent fees we will pay in connection with the sale of the securities in this offering.\nPer Share of Per\nCommon Pre- Funded\nStock Warrant Total\nPublic offering price $ $ $\nPlacement agent fees $ $ $\nProceeds to us, before expenses(1) $ $ $\n(1) The amount of the offering proceeds to us presented in this table does not give effect to any exercise of the pre-funded warrants being issued in this offering.\nWe have agreed to pay the placement agent a total cash fee up to (i) 8.0% of the gross proceeds of this offering, provided that such commissions shall be reduced to 3.5% if and to\nthe extent any retail investors introduced to the offering by any officer and director of the Company. We will also be responsible for any pay all expenses related to the offering,\nincluding (a) all filing fees and registration with the Commission, (b) all FINRA and Nasdaq fees; (c) all blue sky fees; (d) the costs of mailing and printing, transfer and stamp taxes;\nand (e) fees and expenses of our accountants and legal counsel. We estimate the total offering expenses of this offering that will be payable by us, excluding the placement agent\nfees and expenses, will be approximately $[125,000]. After deducting the placement agent fees and our estimated offering expenses, we expect the net proceeds from this offering to\nbe approximately $[ ].\nLock-Ups\nWe have agreed that our directors and officers will enter into customary “lock-up” agreements for a period of 180 days following the consummation of this offering that the\naforementioned parties will not, without the written consent of Dawson, (a) offer, sell, or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of capital stock or any\nsecurities convertible or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of capital stock of the Company; or (b) file or cause to be filed any registration statement with the Commission\nrelating to the offering of any shares of capital stock of the Company or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock of the Company.\n19\nDetermination of Offering Price\nThe public offering price per share and the public offering price per pre-funded warrant we are offering and the exercise prices and other terms of the pre-funded warrants were\nnegotiated between us and the investors, in consultation with the placement agent based on the trading of our common stock prior to this offering, among other things. Other\nfactors considered in determining the public offering prices of the securities we are offering and the exercise prices and other terms of the pre-funded warrants include the history\nand prospects of our company, the stage of development of our business, our business plans for the future and the extent to which they have been implemented, an assessment of\nour management, general conditions of the securities markets at the time of the offering and such other factors as were deemed relevant.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nOur transfer agent and registrar is Securities Transfer Corporation. The transfer agent’s address is 15500 Roosevelt Blvd, Suite 104, Clearwater, Florida 33760 and the telephone\nnumber is (469) 633-0101.\nListing\nOur common stock is currently listed on Nasdaq under the symbol “REBN.” On [ ], 2024, the closing price per share of our common stock was $[ ]. There is no established public\ntrading market for the pre-funded warrants, and we do not expect such markets to develop. In addition, we do not intend to apply to list the pre-funded warrants on any national\nsecurities exchange or other nationally recognized trading system. Without an active trading market, the liquidity of the pre-funded warrants will be limited.\nIndemnification\nWe have agreed to indemnify the placement agent against certain liabilities, including certain liabilities arising under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments that the\nplacement agent may be required to make for these liabilities.\nRegulation M\nThe placement agent may be deemed to be an underwriter within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act and any fees received by it and any profit realized on the sale\nof the securities by it while acting as principal might be deemed to be underwriting discounts or commissions under the Securities Act. The placement agent will be required to\ncomply with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, including, without limitation, Rule 10b-5 and Regulation M under the Exchange Act. These rules and\nregulations may limit the timing of purchases and sales of our securities by the placement agent. Under these rules and regulations, the placement agent may not engage in any\nstabilization activity in connection with our securities; and (ii) bid for or purchase any of our securities or attempt to induce any person to purchase any of our securities, other\nthan as permitted under the Exchange Act, until they have completed their participation in the distribution.\nDiscretionary Accounts\nThe Placement Agent does not intend to confirm sales of the securities offered hereby to any accounts over which it has discretionary authority.\n20\nOther Relationships\nThe Placement Agent and certain of its affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment\nbanking, financial advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Placement Agent and certain of\nits affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various commercial and investment banking and financial advisory services for us and our affiliates,\nfor which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses.\nIn the ordinary course of their various business activities, the Placement Agent and certain of its affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt\nand equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers, and such\ninvestment and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments issued by us and our affiliates. If the Placement Agent or its affiliates have a lending relationship\nwith us, they routinely hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. The Placement Agent and its affiliates may hedge such exposure\nby entering into transactions that consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities or the securities of our affiliates,\nincluding potentially the common stock offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the common stock offered hereby. The Placement\nAgent and certain of its affiliates may also communicate independent investment recommendations, market color or trading ideas and/or publish or express independent research\nviews in respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and\ninstruments.\nElectronic Offer, Sale, and Distribution of Securities\nA prospectus in electronic format may be made available on the websites maintained by the placement agent, if any, participating in this offering and the placement agent may\ndistribute prospectuses electronically. Other than the prospectus in electronic format, the information on these websites is not part of this prospectus or the registration statement\nof which this prospectus forms a part, has not been approved or endorsed by us or the placement agent, and should not be relied upon by investors.\nOffer and Sale Restrictions Outside the United States\nOther than in the United States, no action has been taken by us or the placement agent that would permit a public offering of the securities offered by this prospectus in any\njurisdiction where action for that purpose is required. The securities offered by this prospectus may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, nor may this prospectus or any\nother offering material or advertisements in connection with the offer and sale of any such securities be distributed or published in any jurisdiction, except under circumstances\nthat will result in compliance with the applicable rules and regulations of that jurisdiction. Persons into whose possession this prospectus comes are advised to inform themselves\nabout and to observe any restrictions relating to the offering and the distribution of this prospectus. This prospectus does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer\nto buy any securities offered by this prospectus in any jurisdiction in which such an offer or a solicitation is unlawful.\n21\nMANAGEMENT\nCurrent Directors and Executive Officers\nThe following table provides information regarding our executive officers and members of our board of directors as of the date of the registration statement of which this\nprospectus is a part:\nName Age Position\nExecutive Officers\nJay Kim 62 Chief Executive Officer and Director\nStephan Kim 48 Chief Financial Officer\nNon-Employee Directors\nFarooq M.

Indemnification of Directors and Officers.\nUnder Delaware law, a Delaware corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action,\nsuit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than one by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that the person is or was a\ndirector, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, against\njudgments, fines, amounts paid in settlement and reasonable expenses, including attorneys’ fees actually and necessarily incurred as a result of such action or proceeding, if such\ndirector or officer acted, in good faith, for a purpose which such person reasonably believed to be, in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation and, in criminal\nactions or proceedings, in addition, had no reasonable cause to believe that such conduct was unlawful.\nIn the case of a derivative action, a Delaware corporation may indemnify any such person against expense, including attorneys’ fees actually and necessarily incurred by such\nperson in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if such director or officer if such director or officer acted, in good faith, for a purpose which such person\nreasonably believed to be, in or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation, except that no indemnification will be made in respect on any claim, issue or matter as to\nwhich such person will have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any other court in\nwhich such action was brought determines such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expense.\nDelaware Law permits a corporation to include in its certificate of incorporation a provision eliminating or limiting a director’s liability to a corporation or its stockholders for\nmonetary damages for breaches of fiduciary duty. Delaware Law provides, however, that liability for breaches of the duty of loyalty, acts or omissions not in good faith or\ninvolving intentional misconduct, or knowing violation of the law, and the unlawful purchase or redemption of stock or payment of unlawful purchase or redemption of stock or\npayment of unlawful dividends or the receipt of improper personal benefits cannot be eliminated or limited in this manner.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law and may, if and to the extent authorized by\nthe Board of Directors, indemnify our officers and any other person whom we have the power to indemnify against any liability, reasonable expense or other matter whatsoever.\nAny amendment, modification or repeal of the foregoing provisions shall be prospective only, and shall not affect any rights or protections of any of our directors existing as of the\ntime of such amendment, modification or repeal.\nII-1\nWe may also, at the discretion of the Board of Directors, purchase and maintain insurance to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law on behalf of any of our directors, officers,\nemployees or agents against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity.\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling the\nRegistrant pursuant to the foregoing, the Registrant has been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities\nAct and is therefore unenforceable.\nItem 15.

Exhibits.\nThe list of exhibits in the Exhibit Index to this registration statement is incorporated herein by reference.\nII-2\nItem 17. Undertakings.\n(a) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:\n(1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement:\n(i) to include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;\n(ii) to reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post- effective amendment thereof) that,\nindividually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or\ndecrease in the volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or\nhigh end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in\nvolume and price represent no more than 20 percent change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the “Calculation of Registration Fee” table in the effective\nregistration statement; and\n(iii) to include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such\ninformation in the registration statement;\nprovided, however, that paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii), and (a)(1)(iii) above do not apply if the information required to be included in a post-effective amendment by those\nparagraphs is contained in reports filed with or furnished to the SEC by the registrant pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended\n(the “Exchange Act”) that are incorporated by reference in the registration statement, or is contained in a form of prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) that is a part of the\nregistration statement.\n(2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement\nrelating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.\n(3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered that remain unsold at the termination of the offering.\n(4) That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser:\n(i) each prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) shall be deemed to be part of the registration statement as of the date the filed prospectus was deemed\npart of and included in the registration statement; and\nII-3\n(ii) each prospectus required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2), (b)(5), or (b)(7) as part of a registration statement in reliance on Rule 430B relating to an offering made\npursuant to Rule 415(a)(1)(i), (vii), or (x) for the purpose of providing the information required by Section 10(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 shall be deemed to be part of\nand included in the registration statement as of the earlier of the date such form of prospectus is first used after effectiveness or the date of the first contract of sale of\nsecurities in the offering described in the prospectus. As provided in Rule 430B, for liability purposes of the issuer and any person that is at that date an underwriter, such\ndate shall be deemed to be a new effective date of the registration statement relating to the securities in the registration statement to which that prospectus relates, and\nthe offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration\nstatement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement\nor prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such effective date, supersede or modify any statement\nthat was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such effective\ndate.\n(5) That, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each filing of the registrant’s annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act\n(and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plan’s annual report pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act) that is incorporated by reference in the\nregistration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be\ndeemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.\n(i) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to\nthe foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the\nSecurities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses\nincurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer\nor controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling\nprecedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will\nbe governed by the final adjudication of such issue.\nII-4\nSIGNATURES\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, the registrant has duly caused this registration statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly\nauthorized in the Brea, California, on November 12, 2024.\nREBORN COFFEE, INC.\nBy: /s/ Jay Kim\nJay Kim\nChief Executive Officer\nPOWER OF ATTORNEY\nEach person whose signature appears below constitutes and appoints Jay Kim as his true and lawful attorneys-in-fact and agents, each acting alone, with full power of\nsubstitution and resubstitution, for him and in his name, place and stead, in any and all capacities, to sign any and all amendments (including post-effective amendments) to this\nregistration statement on Form S-1 and any subsequent registration statement the Registrant may hereafter file with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 462\nunder the Securities Act to register additional securities in connection with this registration statement, and to file this registration statement, with all exhibits thereto, and other\ndocuments in connection therewith, with the Securities and Exchange Commission, granting unto said attorneys-in-fact and agents, and each of them, full power and authority to\ndo and perform each and every act and thing requisite and necessary to be done in order to effectuate the same as fully, to all intents and purposes, as he might or could do in\nperson, hereby ratifying and confirming all that said attorneys-in-fact and agents, or any of them, may lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof.\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act, this registration statement has been signed by the following persons in the capacities and on the dates indicated.\nSignature Title Date\n/s/ Jay Kim Chief Executive Officer and Director November 12, 2024\nJay Kim (Principal Executive Officer)\n/s/ Stephan Kim Chief Financial Officer November 12, 2024\nStephan Kim (Principal Financial Officer and Principal\nAccounting Officer)\n/s/ Farooq M.

The Company expressly\nacknowledges and agrees that Dawson’s obligations hereunder are on a reasonable “best efforts” basis only and that the execution of this Agreement does not constitute a\ncommitment by Dawson to purchase the Securities and does not ensure the successful placement of the Securities or any portion thereof or the success of Dawson placing the\nSecurities. The terms of the Placement and the Securities shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company and the Purchasers and nothing herein constitutes that the Placement\nAgent would have the power or authority to bind the Company or any Purchaser or an obligation for the Company to issue any Securities or complete the Offering. This\nAgreement and the documents, if any, executed and delivered by the Company and the Purchasers in connection with the Offering, including but not limited to the Purchase\nAgreement (as defined below) shall be collectively referred to herein as the “Transaction Documents.”\n1.

Under no circumstances will the Placement Agent be obligated to underwrite or purchase any Securities for its own account and, in soliciting purchases of the Securities,\nthe Placement Agent shall act solely as an agent of the Company. The Services provided pursuant to this Agreement shall be on an “agency” basis and not on a “principal” basis.\nThe Placement Agent will solicit offers for the purchase of the Securities in the Offering at such times and in such amounts as the Placement Agent deems advisable.

Upon receipt by an Indemnified Person of actual notice of an action against such Indemnified Person with respect to which indemnity, contribution or\nadvancement of expenses may reasonably be expected to be sought under this Agreement, such Indemnified Person shall promptly notify the Company in writing; provided that\nfailure by any Indemnified Person so to notify the Company shall not relieve the Company from any obligation or liability which the Company may have on account of this Section\n9 or otherwise to such Indemnified Person, except to the extent (and only to the extent) that its ability to assume the defense is actually impaired by such failure or delay.

The advancement, reimbursement, indemnification and contribution obligations of the Company required hereby shall be made by\nperiodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as every Liability and Expense is incurred and is due and payable, and in such amounts\nas fully satisfy each and every Liability and Expense as it is incurred (and in no event later than 30 days following the date of any invoice therefor).\nC.

The Placement Agent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration\nStatement and persons who control the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any and all Liabilities, but only\nwith respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions made in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Disclosure Package\nor Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon, and in strict conformity with, the Placement Agent’s Information. In case any action shall be brought\nagainst the Company or any other person so indemnified based on any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or Prospectus or any\namendment or supplement thereto, and in respect of which indemnity may be sought against the Placement Agent, the Placement Agent shall have the rights and duties given to\nthe Company, and the Company and each other person so indemnified shall have the rights and duties given to the Placement Agent by the provisions of Section 9.B. The\nCompany agrees promptly to notify the Placement Agent of the commencement of any litigation or proceedings against the Company or any of its officers, directors or any person,\nif any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, in connection with the issuance and sale of the\nSecurities or in connection with the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, provided, that failure by the Company\nso to notify the Placement Agent shall not relieve the Placement Agent from any obligation or liability which the Placement Agent may have on account of this Section 9.C. or\notherwise to the Company, except to the extent the Placement Agent is materially prejudiced as a proximate result of such failure..\n17\nD. Contribution. In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction makes a finding that indemnity is unavailable to any indemnified person, then each indemnifying party\nshall contribute to the Liabilities and Expenses paid or payable by such indemnified person in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect (i) the relative benefits to the Company,\non the one hand, and to the Placement Agent and any other Indemnified Person, on the other hand, of the matters contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided\nby the immediately preceding clause is not permitted by applicable law, not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the\nPlacement Agent and any other Indemnified Person, on the other hand, in connection with the matters as to which such Liabilities or Expenses relate, as well as any other relevant\nequitable considerations; provided that in no event shall the Company contribute less than the amount necessary to ensure that all Indemnified Persons, in the aggregate, are not\nliable for any Liabilities and Expenses in excess of the amount of commissions actually received by the Placement Agent pursuant to this Agreement. The relative fault shall be\ndetermined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates\nto information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Placement Agent on the other and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to\ncorrect or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Placement Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection\n(D) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection\n(D). For purposes of this paragraph, the relative benefits to the Company, on the one hand, and to the Placement Agent on the other hand, of the matters contemplated by this\nAgreement shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as: (a) the total value received by the Company in the Offering, whether or not such Offering is consummated, bears to (b)\nthe commissions paid to the Placement Agent under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation within the meaning of Section\n11(f) of the Securities Act shall be entitled to contribution from a party who was not guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation.\nE. Limitation. The Company also agrees that no Indemnified Person shall have any liability (whether direct or indirect, in contract or tort or otherwise) to the Company for\nor in connection with advice or services rendered or to be rendered by any Indemnified Person pursuant to this Agreement, the transactions contemplated thereby or any\nIndemnified Person’s actions or inactions in connection with any such advice, services or transactions, except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction has made a\nfinding that Liabilities (and related Expenses) of the Company have resulted primarily from such Indemnified Person’s gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with\nany such advice, actions, inactions or services.\nF. Survival. The advancement, reimbursement, indemnity and contribution obligations set forth in this Section 9 shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any\ntermination of, or the completion of any Indemnified Person’s services under or in connection with, this Agreement.

Limitation of Engagement to the Company.\nThe Company acknowledges that the Placement Agent has been retained only by the Company, that the Placement Agent is providing services hereunder as an\nindependent contractor (and not in any fiduciary or agency capacity) and that the Company’s engagement of the Placement Agent is not deemed to be on behalf of, and is not\nintended to confer rights upon, any shareholder, owner or partner of the Company or any other person not a party hereto as against the Placement Agent or any of its affiliates, or\nany of its or their respective officers, directors, controlling persons (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act), employees or agents.\nUnless otherwise expressly agreed in writing by the Placement Agent, no one other than the Company is authorized to rely upon any statement or conduct of the Placement Agent\nin connection with this Agreement.

If any action shall be brought against any Purchaser Party in respect of which indemnity may be sought\npursuant to this Agreement, such Purchaser Party shall promptly notify the Company in writing, and the Company shall have the right to assume the defense thereof with counsel\nof its own choosing reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser Party. Any Purchaser Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the\ndefense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Purchaser Party except to the extent that (x) the employment thereof has been\nspecifically authorized by the Company in writing, (y) the Company has failed after a reasonable period of time to assume such defense and to employ counsel or (z) in such action\nthere is, in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the applicable Purchaser Party, a material conflict on any material issue between the position of the Company and the position of\nsuch Purchaser Party, in which case the Company shall be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of no more than one such separate counsel. The Company will not be\nliable to any Purchaser Party under this Agreement (1) for any settlement by a Purchaser Party effected without the Company’s prior written consent, which shall not be\nunreasonably withheld or delayed; or (2) to the extent, but only to the extent that a loss, claim, damage or liability is attributable to any Purchaser Party’s breach of any of the\nrepresentations, warranties, covenants or agreements made by such Purchaser Party in this Agreement or in the other Transaction Documents. The indemnification required by\nthis Section 4.9 shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or are incurred;\nprovided, that if any Purchaser Party is finally judicially determined not to be entitled to indemnification or payment under this Section 4.9, such Purchaser Party shall promptly\nreimburse the Company for any payments that are advanced under this sentence. The indemnity agreements contained herein shall be in addition to any cause of action or similar\nright of any Purchaser Party against the Company or others and any liabilities the Company may be subject to pursuant to law.\n4.10. Reservation of Common Stock. As of the date hereof, the Company has reserved and the Company shall continue to reserve and keep available at all times, free of\npreemptive rights, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock for the purpose of enabling the Company to issue the Shares pursuant to this Agreement and the Pre-Funded\nWarrant Shares pursuant to any exercise of the Pre-Funded Warrants.\n27\n4.11. Listing of Common Stock. For as long as any Pre-Funded Warrants are outstanding and exercisable, the Company hereby agrees to use commercially reasonable best\nefforts to maintain the listing or quotation of the Common Stock on the Trading Market on which it is currently listed, and concurrently with the Closing, the Company shall apply\nto list or quote all of the Shares and Pre-Funded Warrant Shares on such Trading Market and promptly secure the listing of all of the Shares and Pre-Funded Warrant Shares on\nsuch Trading Market to the extent required by the rules of such Trading Market; provided, however, that the Purchasers acknowledge that the Common Stock is currently subject\nto delisting by the Trading Market. The Company further agrees, if the Company applies to have the Common Stock traded on any other Trading Market, it will then include in\nsuch application all of the Shares and Pre-Funded Warrant Shares, and will take such other action as is necessary to cause all of the Shares and Pre-Funded Warrant Shares to be\nlisted or quoted on such other Trading Market as promptly as possible. The Company will then take all action reasonably necessary to continue the listing and trading of its\nCommon Stock on a Trading Market and will comply in all respects with the Company’s reporting, filing and other obligations under the bylaws or rules of the Trading Market. For\nso long as the Company maintains a listing or quotation of the Common Stock on a Trading Market, the Company agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the\neligibility of the Common Stock for electronic transfer through the Depository Trust Company or another established clearing corporation, including, without limitation, by timely\npayment of fees to the Depository Trust Company or such other established clearing corporation in connection with such electronic transfer.\n4.12. Subsequent Equity Sales.\n(a) From the date hereof until ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, except as permitted pursuant Section 4.12(b), to neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall (i)\nissue, enter into any agreement to issue or announce the issuance or proposed issuance of any shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents or (ii) file any registration\nstatement or amendment or supplement thereto, other than filing the final Prospectus and a registration statement on Form S-8 in connection with any employee benefit plan.\n(b) From the date hereof until one hundred and ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the Company shall be prohibited from effecting or entering into an agreement to\neffect any issuance by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents (or a combination of units thereof) involving a Variable\nRate Transaction. “Variable Rate Transaction” means a transaction in which the Company (i) issues or sells any debt or equity securities that are convertible into, exchangeable or\nexercisable for, or include the right to receive additional shares of Common Stock either (A) at a conversion price, exercise price or exchange rate or other price that is based upon\nand/or varies with the trading prices of or quotations for the Common Stock at any time after the initial issuance of such debt or equity securities, or (B) with a conversion, exercise\nor exchange price that is subject to being reset at some future date after the initial issuance of such debt or equity security (other than in connection with a stock split or stock\ndividend or similar event) or upon the occurrence of specified or contingent events directly or indirectly related to the business of the Company or the market for the Common\nStock, or (ii) enters into, or effects a transaction under, any agreement, including, but not limited to, an equity line of credit or an “at-the-market offering”, whereby the Company\nmay issue securities at a future determined price regardless of whether shares pursuant to such agreement have actually been issued and regardless of whether such agreement is\nsubsequently cancelled.\n(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 4.12 shall not apply in respect of an Exempt Issuance.\n28\n4.13. Equal Treatment of Purchasers. No consideration (including any modification of any Transaction Document) shall be offered or paid to any Person to amend or\nconsent to a waiver or modification of any provision of the Transaction Documents unless the same consideration is also offered to all of the parties to such Transaction\nDocuments. For clarification purposes, this provision constitutes a separate right granted to each Purchaser by the Company and negotiated separately by each Purchaser, and is\nintended for the Company to treat the Purchasers as a class and shall not in any way be construed as the Purchasers acting in concert or as a group with respect to the purchase,\ndisposition or voting of Shares or otherwise.\n4.14. Certain Transactions and Confidentiality. Each Purchaser, severally and not jointly with the other Purchasers, covenants that neither it nor any Affiliate acting on its\nbehalf or pursuant to any understanding with it will execute any purchases or sales, including Short Sales, of any of the Company’s securities during the period commencing with\nthe execution of this Agreement and ending at such time that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are first publicly announced pursuant to the initial press release as\ndescribed in Section 4.5. Each Purchaser, severally and not jointly with the other Purchasers, covenants that until such time as the transactions contemplated by this Agreement\nare publicly disclosed by the Company pursuant to the initial press release as described in Section 4.5, such Purchaser will maintain the confidentiality of the existence and terms of\nthis transaction and the information included in this Agreement, including the schedules hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and notwithstanding anything contained in this\nAgreement to the contrary, the Company expressly acknowledges and agrees that (i) no Purchaser makes any representation, warranty or covenant hereby that it will not engage in\neffecting transactions in any securities of the Company after the time that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are first publicly announced pursuant to the initial\npress release as described in Section 4.5, (ii) no Purchaser shall be restricted or prohibited from effecting any transactions in any securities of the Company in accordance with\napplicable securities laws from and after the time that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are first publicly announced pursuant to the initial press release as\ndescribed in Section 4.5 and (iii) no Purchaser shall have any duty of confidentiality or duty not to trade in the securities of the Company to the Company or the Subsidiaries after\nthe issuance of the initial press release as described in Section 4.5. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of a Purchaser that is a multi-managed investment vehicle whereby\nseparate portfolio managers manage separate portions of such Purchaser’s assets and the portfolio managers have no direct knowledge of the investment decisions made by the\nportfolio managers managing other portions of such Purchaser’s assets, the covenant set forth above shall only apply with respect to the portion of assets managed by the\nportfolio manager that made the investment decision to purchase the Securities covered by this Agreement.\n4.15. Exercise Procedures. The form of Notice of Exercise included in the Pre-Funded Warrants sets forth the totality of the procedures required of the Purchasers in order\nto exercise the Pre-Funded Warrants. No additional legal opinion, other information, or instructions shall be required of the Purchasers to exercise their Pre-Funded Warrants.\nWithout limiting the preceding sentences, no ink-original Notice of Exercise shall be required, nor shall any medallion guarantee (or other type of guarantee or notarization) of any\nNotice of Exercise form be required in order to exercise the Pre-Funded Warrants. The Company shall honor exercises of the Pre-Funded Warrants and shall deliver Pre-Funded\nWarrant Shares in accordance with the terms, conditions, and time periods set forth in the Transaction Documents.\n4.16. [Reserved].\n4.17. Lock-Up Agreements. The Company shall not amend, modify, waive or terminate any provision of any of the Lock-Up Agreements except to extend the term of the\nlock-up period and shall enforce the provisions of each Lock-Up Agreement in accordance with its terms. If any party to a Lock-Up Agreement breaches any provision of a Lock-\nUp Agreement, the Company shall promptly use its best efforts to seek specific performance of the terms of such Lock-Up Agreement.\n29\nARTICLE V\nMISCELLANEOUS\n5.1. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated by any Purchaser, as to such Purchaser’s obligations hereunder only and without any effect whatsoever on the\nobligations between the Company and the other Purchasers, by written notice to the other parties, if the Closing has not been consummated on or before the fifth (5th) Trading\nDay following the date hereof; provided, however, that no such termination will affect the right of any party to sue for any breach by any other party (or parties).\n5.2. Fees and Expenses. Except as expressly set forth in the Transaction Documents to the contrary, each party shall pay the fees and expenses of its advisers, counsel,\naccountants and other experts, if any, and all other expenses incurred by such party incident to the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and performance of this\nAgreement.

Entire Agreement. The Transaction Documents, together with the exhibits and schedules thereto, the Preliminary Prospectus, and the Prospectus contain the entire\nunderstanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, with respect to such\nmatters, which the parties acknowledge have been merged into such documents, exhibits and schedules.\n5.4.

No waiver of any default with respect to any provision, condition or requirement of this Agreement\nshall be deemed to be a continuing waiver in the future or a waiver of any subsequent default or a waiver of any other provision, condition or requirement hereof, nor shall any\ndelay or omission of any party to exercise any right hereunder in any manner impair the exercise of any such right. Any proposed amendment or waiver that disproportionately,\nmaterially and adversely affects the rights and obligations of any Purchaser relative to the comparable rights and obligations of the other Purchasers shall require the prior written\nconsent of such adversely affected Purchaser. Any amendment effected in accordance with this Section 5.5 shall be binding upon each Purchaser and holder of Securities and the\nCompany. To the extent that any notice provided pursuant to any Transaction Document constitutes, or contains, material, non-public information regarding the Company or any\nSubsidiaries, the Company shall simultaneously file such notice with the Commission pursuant to a Current Report on Form 8-K.\n5.6.

Each party hereby\nirrevocably waives personal service of process and consents to process being served in any such suit, action or proceeding by mailing a copy thereof via registered or certified\nmail or overnight delivery (with evidence of delivery) to such party at the address in effect for notices to it under this Agreement and agrees that such service shall constitute good\nand sufficient service of process and notice thereof.

This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, all of which when taken together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall\nbecome effective when counterparts have been signed by each party and delivered to each other party, it being understood that the parties need not sign the same counterpart. In\nthe event that any signature is delivered by e-mail delivery of a “.pdf” format data file, by other electronic signing created on an electronic platform (such as DocuSign) or by digital\nsigning (such as Adobe Sign), such signature shall create a valid and binding obligation of the party executing (or on whose behalf such signature is executed) with the same force\nand effect as if such “.pdf” or other electronic or digital signature page were an original thereof.\n31\n5.12. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable,\nthe remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions set forth herein shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and\nthe parties hereto shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to find and employ an alternative means to achieve the same or substantially the same result as that contemplated\nby such term, provision, covenant or restriction. It is hereby stipulated and declared to be the intention of the parties that they would have executed the remaining terms,\nprovisions, covenants and restrictions without including any of such that may be hereafter declared invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable.\n5.13. Rescission and Withdrawal Right. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in (and without limiting any similar provisions of) any of the other\nTransaction Documents, whenever any Purchaser exercises a right, election, demand or option under a Transaction Document and the Company does not timely perform its related\nobligations within the periods therein provided, then such Purchaser may rescind or withdraw, in its sole discretion from time to time upon written notice to the Company, any\nrelevant notice, demand or election in whole or in part without prejudice to its future actions and rights provided, however, that in the case of a rescission of an exercise of a Pre-\nFunded Warrant, the applicable Purchaser shall be required to return any shares of Common Stock subject to any such rescinded exercise notice concurrently (if such shares were\ndelivered to the applicable Purchaser) with the return to such Purchaser of the aggregate exercise price paid to the Company for such shares and the restoration of such\nPurchaser’s right to acquire such shares pursuant to such Purchaser’s Pre-Funded Warrant (including, issuance of a replacement warrant certificate evidencing such restored\nright).\n5.14. Replacement of Securities. If any certificate or instrument evidencing any Securities is mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the Company shall issue or cause to be\nissued in exchange and substitution for and upon cancellation thereof (in the case of mutilation), or in lieu of and substitution therefor, a new certificate or instrument, but only\nupon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of such loss, theft or destruction. The applicant for a new certificate or instrument under such circumstances\nshall also pay any reasonable third-party costs (including customary indemnity) associated with the issuance of such replacement Securities.\n5.15. Remedies. In addition to being entitled to exercise all rights provided herein or granted by law, including recovery of damages, each of the Purchasers and the\nCompany will be entitled to specific performance under the Transaction Documents. The parties agree that monetary damages may not be adequate compensation for any loss\nincurred by reason of any breach of obligations contained in the Transaction Documents and hereby agree to waive and not to assert in any action for specific performance of any\nsuch obligation the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.\n5.16. Payment Set Aside. To the extent that the Company makes a payment or payments to any Purchaser pursuant to any Transaction Document or a Purchaser enforces\nor exercises its rights thereunder, and such payment or payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or exercise or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be\nfraudulent or preferential, set aside, recovered from, disgorged by or are required to be refunded, repaid or otherwise restored to the Company, a trustee, receiver or any other\nPerson under any law (including, without limitation, any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause of action), then to the extent of any such restoration\nthe obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such enforcement or\nsetoff had not occurred.\n32\n5.17. Independent Nature of Purchasers’ Obligations and Rights. The obligations of each Purchaser under any Transaction Document are several and not joint with the\nobligations of any other Purchaser, and no Purchaser shall be responsible in any way for the performance or nonperformance of the obligations of any other Purchaser under any\nTransaction Document. Nothing contained herein or in any other Transaction Document, and no action taken by any Purchaser pursuant hereto or thereto, shall be deemed to\nconstitute the Purchasers as a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of entity, or create a presumption that the Purchasers are in any way acting in concert\nor as a group with respect to such obligations or the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents. Each Purchaser shall be entitled to independently protect and\nenforce its rights including, without limitation, the rights arising out of this Agreement or out of the other Transaction Documents, and it shall not be necessary for any other\nPurchaser to be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose. Each Purchaser has been represented by its own separate legal counsel in its review and\nnegotiation of the Transaction Documents. For reasons of administrative convenience only, each Purchaser and its respective counsel have chosen to communicate with the\nCompany through ArentFox Schiff LLP, the legal counsel of the Placement Agent, and ArentFox Schiff LLP, as legal counsel of the Placement Agent, does not represent any of the\nPurchasers and only represents the Placement Agent. The Company has elected to provide all Purchasers with the same terms and Transaction Documents for the convenience of\nthe Company and not because it was required or requested to do so by any of the Purchasers. It is expressly understood and agreed that each provision contained in this\nAgreement and in each other Transaction Document is between the Company and a Purchaser, solely, and not between the Company and the Purchasers collectively and not\nbetween and among the Purchasers.\n5.18. Liquidated Damages. The Company’s obligations to pay any partial liquidated damages or other amounts owing under the Transaction Documents is a continuing\nobligation of the Company and shall not terminate until all unpaid partial liquidated damages and other amounts have been paid notwithstanding the fact that the instrument or\nsecurity pursuant to which such partial liquidated damages or other amounts are due and payable shall have been canceled.\n5.19. Saturdays, Sundays, Holidays, etc. If the last or appointed day for the taking of any action or the expiration of any right required or granted herein shall not be a\nTrading Day, then such action may be taken or such right may be exercised on the next succeeding Trading Day.\n5.20. Currency. Unless otherwise stated, all dollar amounts and references to “$” in this Agreement refer to the lawful currency of the United States.\n5.21. Construction. The parties agree that each of them and/or their respective counsel have reviewed and had an opportunity to revise the Transaction Documents and,\ntherefore, the normal rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be employed in the interpretation of the\nTransaction Documents or any amendments thereto. In addition, each and every reference to share prices and shares of Common Stock in any Transaction Document shall be\nsubject to adjustment for reverse and forward stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations and other similar transactions of the Common Stock that occur after the date of this\nAgreement.\n5.22. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. IN ANY ACTION, SUIT, OR PROCEEDING IN ANY JURISDICTION BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY, THE\nPARTIES EACH KNOWINGLY AND INTENTIONALLY, TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, HEREBY ABSOLUTELY, UNCONDITIONALLY,\nIRREVOCABLY AND EXPRESSLY WAIVES FOREVER TRIAL BY JURY.\n(Signature Pages Follow)\n33\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Securities Purchase Agreement to be duly executed by their respective authorized signatories as of the date\nfirst indicated above.\nREBORN COFFEE, INC.\nBy:\nName:\nTitle:\nAddress for Notice:\n[___]\nEmail: [___]\nWith a copy to (which shall not constitute notice):\n[___]\nEmail: [___]\n[PURCHASER SIGNATURE PAGES TO CNSP\nSECURITIES PURCHASE AGREEMENT]\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have caused this Securities Purchase Agreement to be duly executed by their respective authorized signatories as of the date\nfirst indicated above.\nName of\nPurchaser:\nSignature of Authorized Signatory of Purchaser:\nName of Authorized Signatory:\nTitle of Authorized Signatory:\nEmail Address of Authorized Signatory:\nAddress for Notice to\nPurchaser:\nAddress for Delivery of Securities to Purchaser (if not same as address for\nnotice):\nDWAC for Shares:\nSubscription Amount: $\nShares:\nPre-Funded Warrant Shares: ___________ Beneficial Ownership Blocker ☐ 4.99% or ☐ 9.99%\nCommon Warrant Shares: _____________ Beneficial Ownership Blocker ☐ 4.99% or ☐ 9.99%\nEIN Number: ____________________\n☐ Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, by checking this box (i) the obligations of the above-signed to purchase the securities set forth in this\nAgreement to be purchased from the Company by the above-signed, and the obligations of the Company to sell such securities to the above-signed, shall be unconditional and all\nconditions to Closing shall be disregarded, (ii) the Closing shall occur on the first (1st) Trading Day following the date of this Agreement and (iii) any condition to Closing\ncontemplated by this Agreement (but prior to being disregarded by clause (i) above) that required delivery by the Company or the above-signed of any agreement, instrument,\ncertificate or the like or purchase price (as applicable) shall no longer be a condition and shall instead be an unconditional obligation of the Company or the above-signed (as\napplicable) to deliver such agreement, instrument, certificate or the like or purchase price (as applicable) to such other party on the Closing Date.\nExhibit A\nForm of Lock-Up Agreement\n(See attached)\nExhibit B\nForm of Pre-Funded Warrant\n(See attached)\nExhibit 4.5\nCOMMON STOCK PURCHASE WARRANT\nREBORN COFFEE, INC.\nWarrant Shares: _______ Initial Exercise Date: __________, 2024\nTHIS COMMON STOCK PURCHASE WARRANT (the “Warrant”) certifies that, for value received, _____________ or its assigns (the “Holder”) is entitled, upon the\nterms and subject to the limitations on exercise and the conditions hereinafter set forth, at any time on or after _______________, 2024 (the “Initial Exercise Date”) and until this\nWarrant is exercised in full (the “Termination Date”) but not thereafter, to subscribe for and purchase from Reborn Coffee, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), up to\n______ shares (as subject to adjustment hereunder, the “Warrant Shares”) of Common Stock.

Partial exercises of this Warrant resulting in purchases of a portion of the total number of Warrant Shares available hereunder shall have the\neffect of lowering the outstanding number of Warrant Shares purchasable hereunder in an amount equal to the applicable number of Warrant Shares purchased. The\nHolder and the Company shall maintain records showing the number of Warrant Shares purchased and the date of such purchases.

The exercise price per share of the Common Stock under this Warrant shall be $0.0001, subject to adjustment hereunder (the “Exercise Price”).\nc) Cashless Exercise. If at any time after the date hereof, there is no effective registration statement registering, or no current prospectus available for, the\nissuance of the Warrant Shares to the Holder, then this Warrant may only be exercised, in whole or in part, at such time by means of a “cashless exercise” in which the\nHolder shall be entitled to receive a number of Warrant Shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing [(A-B) (X)] by (A), where:\n(A) = as applicable: (i) the VWAP on the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of the applicable Notice of Exercise if such Notice of Exercise is (1) both\nexecuted and delivered pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof on a day that is not a Trading Day or (2) both executed and delivered pursuant to Section 2(a)\nhereof on a Trading Day prior to the opening of “regular trading hours” (as defined in Rule 600(b)(64) of Regulation NMS promulgated under the federal\nsecurities laws) on such Trading Day, (ii) at the option of the Holder, either (y) the VWAP on the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of the\napplicable Notice of Exercise or (z) the Bid Price of the Common Stock on the principal Trading Market as reported by Bloomberg L.P. as of the time of the\nHolder’s execution of the applicable Notice of Exercise if such Notice of Exercise is executed during “regular trading hours” on a Trading Day and is\ndelivered within two (2) hours thereafter (including until two (2) hours after the close of “regular trading hours” on a Trading Day) pursuant to Section 2(a)\nhereof or (iii) the VWAP on the date of the applicable Notice of Exercise if the date of such Notice of Exercise is a Trading Day and such Notice of Exercise\nis both executed and delivered pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof after the close of “regular trading hours” on such Trading Day;\n4\n(B) = the Exercise Price of this Warrant, as adjusted hereunder; and\n(X) = the number of Warrant Shares that would be issuable upon exercise of this Warrant in accordance with the terms of this Warrant if such exercise were by\nmeans of a cash exercise rather than a cashless exercise.\nIf Warrant Shares are issued in such a cashless exercise, the parties acknowledge and agree that in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, the\nWarrant Shares shall take on the registered characteristics of the Warrants being exercised. The Company agrees not to take any position contrary to this Section 2(c).\nNotwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, on the Termination Date, this Warrant shall be automatically exercised via cashless exercise pursuant to this\nSection 2(c).\nd) Mechanics of Exercise.\ni. Delivery of Warrant Shares Upon Exercise. The Company shall cause the Warrant Shares purchased hereunder to be transmitted by the\nTransfer Agent to the Holder by crediting the account of the Holder’s or its designee’s balance account with The Depository Trust Company through\nits Deposit or Withdrawal at Custodian system (“DWAC”) if the Company is then a participant in such system and either (A) there is an effective\nregistration statement permitting the issuance of the Warrant Shares to or resale of the Warrant Shares by Holder or (B) this Warrant is being exercised\nvia cashless exercise, and otherwise by physical delivery of a certificate, registered in the Company’s share register in the name of the Holder or its\ndesignee, for the number of Warrant Shares to which the Holder is entitled pursuant to such exercise to the address specified by the Holder in the\nNotice of Exercise by the date that is the earliest of (i) two (2) Trading Days after the delivery to the Company of the Notice of Exercise, (ii) one (1)\nTrading Day after delivery of the aggregate Exercise Price to the Company and (iii) the number of Trading Days comprising the Standard Settlement\nPeriod after the delivery to the Company of the Notice of Exercise (such date, the “Warrant Share Delivery Date”). Upon delivery of the Notice of\nExercise, the Holder shall be deemed for all corporate purposes to have become the holder of record of the Warrant Shares with respect to which this\nWarrant has been exercised, irrespective of the date of delivery of the Warrant Shares, provided that payment of the aggregate Exercise Price (other than\nin the case of a cashless exercise) is received within the earlier of (i) two (2) Trading Days and (ii) the number of Trading Days comprising the Standard\nSettlement Period following delivery of the Notice of Exercise. If the Company fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder the Warrant Shares subject to\na Notice of Exercise by the Warrant Share Delivery Date, the Company shall pay to the Holder, in cash, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, for\neach $1,000 of Warrant Shares subject to such exercise (based on the VWAP of the Common Stock on the date of the applicable Notice of Exercise), $10\nper Trading Day (increasing to $20 per Trading Day on the fifth Trading Day after such liquidated damages begin to accrue) for each Trading Day after\nsuch Warrant Share Delivery Date until such Warrant Shares are delivered or Holder rescinds such exercise. The Company agrees to maintain a transfer\nagent that is a participant in the FAST program so long as this Warrant remains outstanding and exercisable. As used herein, “Standard Settlement\nPeriod” means the standard settlement period, expressed in a number of Trading Days, on the Company’s primary Trading Market with respect to the\nCommon Stock as in effect on the date of delivery of the Notice of Exercise.\n5\nii. Delivery of New Warrants Upon Exercise. If this Warrant shall have been exercised in part, the Company shall, at the request of a Holder and\nupon surrender of this Warrant certificate, at the time of delivery of the Warrant Shares, deliver to the Holder a new Warrant evidencing the rights of the\nHolder to purchase the unpurchased Warrant Shares called for by this Warrant, which new Warrant shall in all other respects be identical with this\nWarrant.\niii. Rescission Rights. If the Company fails to cause the Transfer Agent to transmit to the Holder the Warrant Shares pursuant to Section 2(d)(i)\nby the Warrant Share Delivery Date, then the Holder will have the right to rescind such exercise.\niv. Compensation for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Warrant Shares Upon Exercise. In addition to any other rights available to the Holder,\nif the Company fails to cause the Transfer Agent to transmit to the Holder the Warrant Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 2(d)(i) above\npursuant to an exercise on or before the Warrant Share Delivery Date, and if after such date the Holder is required by its broker to purchase (in an open\nmarket transaction or otherwise) or the Holder’s brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the\nHolder of the Warrant Shares which the Holder anticipated receiving upon such exercise (a “Buy-In”), then the Company shall (A) pay in cash to the\nHolder the amount, if any, by which (x) the Holder’s total purchase price (including brokerage commissions, if any) for the shares of Common Stock so\npurchased exceeds (y) the amount obtained by multiplying (1) the number of Warrant Shares that the Company was required to deliver to the Holder in\nconnection with the exercise at issue times (2) the price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed, and (B) at the\noption of the Holder, either reinstate the portion of the Warrant and equivalent number of Warrant Shares for which such exercise was not honored (in\nwhich case such exercise shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been issued had\nthe Company timely complied with its exercise and delivery obligations hereunder. For example, if the Holder purchases Common Stock having a total\npurchase price of $11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted exercise of shares of Common Stock with an aggregate sale price giving rise to\nsuch purchase obligation of $10,000, under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence the Company shall be required to pay the Holder $1,000.\nThe Holder shall provide the Company written notice indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect of the Buy-In and, upon request of the\nCompany, evidence of the amount of such loss. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder’s right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law\nor in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company’s failure to timely deliver\nshares of Common Stock upon exercise of the Warrant as required pursuant to the terms hereof.\nv. No Fractional Shares or Scrip. No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the exercise of this Warrant.\nAs to any fraction of a share which the Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such exercise, the Company shall, at its election, either pay\na cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the Exercise Price or round up to the next whole\nshare.\nvi. Charges, Taxes and Expenses. Issuance of Warrant Shares shall be made without charge to the Holder for any issue or transfer tax or other\nincidental expense in respect of the issuance of such Warrant Shares, all of which taxes and expenses shall be paid by the Company, and such Warrant\nShares shall be issued in the name of the Holder or in such name or names as may be directed by the Holder; provided, however, that in the event that\nWarrant Shares are to be issued in a name other than the name of the Holder, this Warrant when surrendered for exercise shall be accompanied by the\nAssignment Form attached hereto duly executed by the Holder and the Company may require, as a condition thereto, the payment of a sum sufficient to\nreimburse it for any transfer tax incidental thereto. The Company shall pay all Transfer Agent fees required for same-day processing of any Notice of\nExercise and all fees to the Depository Trust Company (or another established clearing corporation performing similar functions) required for same-day\nelectronic delivery of the Warrant Shares.\n6\nvii. Closing of Books. The Company will not close its stockholder books or records in any manner which prevents the timely exercise of this\nWarrant, pursuant to the terms hereof.\ne) Holder’s Exercise Limitations. The Company shall not effect any exercise of this Warrant, and a Holder shall not have the right to exercise any portion\nof this Warrant, pursuant to Section 2 or otherwise, to the extent that after giving effect to such issuance after exercise as set forth on the applicable Notice of\nExercise, the Holder (together with the Holder’s Affiliates, and any other Persons acting as a group together with the Holder or any of the Holder’s Affiliates\n(such Persons, “Attribution Parties”)), would beneficially own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below). For purposes of the foregoing\nsentence, the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its Affiliates and Attribution Parties shall include the number of shares of\nCommon Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant with respect to which such determination is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of\nCommon Stock which would be issuable upon (i) exercise of the remaining, nonexercised portion of this Warrant beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its\nAffiliates or Attribution Parties and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any other securities of the Company (including,\nwithout limitation, any other Common Stock Equivalents) subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein\nbeneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution Parties. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 2(e),\nbeneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, it being\nacknowledged by the Holder that the Company is not representing to the Holder that such calculation is in compliance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act\nand the Holder is solely responsible for any schedules required to be filed in accordance therewith. To the extent that the limitation contained in this Section 2(e)\napplies, the determination of whether this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates and Attribution\nParties) and of which portion of this Warrant is exercisable shall be in the sole discretion of the Holder, and the submission of a Notice of Exercise shall be\ndeemed to be the Holder’s determination of whether this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates\nand Attribution Parties) and of which portion of this Warrant is exercisable, in each case subject to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, and the Company shall\nhave no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination. In addition, a determination as to any group status as contemplated above shall be\ndetermined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. For purposes of this Section 2(e), in\ndetermining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, a Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (A) the\nCompany’s most recent periodic or annual report filed with the Commission, as the case may be, (B) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (C) a\nmore recent written notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Upon the written or oral\nrequest of a Holder, the Company shall within one Trading Day confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then\noutstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities\nof the Company, including this Warrant, by the Holder or its Affiliates or Attribution Parties since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of\nCommon Stock was reported. The “Beneficial Ownership Limitation” shall be 4.99% (or, upon election by a Holder prior to the issuance of and Warrants, 9.99%)\nof the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of\nthis Warrant. The Holder, upon notice to the Company, may increase or decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of this Section 2(e), provided\nthat the Beneficial Ownership Limitation in no event exceeds 9.99% of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to\nthe issuance of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of this Warrant held by the Holder and the provisions of this Section 2(e) shall continue to apply. Any\nincrease in the Beneficial Ownership Limitation will not be effective until the 61st day after such notice is delivered to the Company. The provisions of this\nparagraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this Section 2(e) to correct this paragraph (or any\nportion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Beneficial Ownership Limitation herein contained or to make changes or supplements\nnecessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. The limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of this Warrant.\n7\nSection 3. Certain Adjustments.\na) Stock Dividends and Splits. If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding: (i) pays a stock dividend or otherwise makes a distribution or\ndistributions on shares of its Common Stock or any other equity or equity equivalent securities payable in shares of Common Stock (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall\nnot include any shares of Common Stock issued by the Company upon exercise of this Warrant), (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number\nof shares, (iii) combines (including by way of reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or (iv) issues by reclassification of\nshares of the Common Stock any shares of capital stock of the Company, then in each case the Exercise Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall\nbe the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) outstanding immediately before such event and of which the denominator shall be the\nnumber of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event, and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be proportionately\nadjusted such that the aggregate Exercise Price of this Warrant shall remain unchanged. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 3(a) shall become effective\nimmediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the\neffective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or re-classification.\nb) Subsequent Rights Offerings. In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 3(a) above, if at any time the Company grants, issues or sells any Common\nStock Equivalents or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record holders of any class of shares of Common Stock (the “Purchase\nRights”), then the Holder will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder could have\nacquired if the Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete exercise of this Warrant (without regard to any limitations on exercise\nhereof, including without limitation, the Beneficial Ownership Limitation) immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such\nPurchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such\nPurchase Rights (provided, however, that, to the extent that the Holder’s right to participate in any such Purchase Right would result in the Holder exceeding the\nBeneficial Ownership Limitation, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Purchase Right to such extent (or beneficial ownership of such shares of\nCommon Stock as a result of such Purchase Right to such extent) and such Purchase Right to such extent shall be held in abeyance for the Holder until such time, if ever,\nas its right thereto would not result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation).\nc) Pro Rata Distributions. During such time as this Warrant is outstanding, if the Company shall declare or make any dividend or other distribution of its assets\n(or rights to acquire its assets) to holders of shares of Common Stock, by way of return of capital or otherwise (including, without limitation, any distribution of cash,\nstock or other securities, property or options by way of a dividend, spin off, reclassification, corporate rearrangement, scheme of arrangement or other similar transaction)\n(a “Distribution”), at any time after the issuance of this Warrant, then, in each such case, the Holder shall be entitled to participate in such Distribution to the same extent\nthat the Holder would have participated therein if the Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete exercise of this Warrant (without\nregard to any limitations on exercise hereof, including without limitation, the Beneficial Ownership Limitation) immediately before the date of which a record is taken for\nsuch Distribution, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the participation in such\nDistribution (provided, however, that, to the extent that the Holder’s right to participate in any such Distribution would result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial\nOwnership Limitation, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Distribution to such extent (or in the beneficial ownership of any shares of Common\nStock as a result of such Distribution to such extent) and the portion of such Distribution shall be held in abeyance for the benefit of the Holder until such time, if ever, as\nits right thereto would not result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation). To the extent that this Warrant has not been partially or completely\nexercised at the time of such Distribution, such portion of the Distribution shall be held in abeyance for the benefit of the Holder until the Holder has exercised this\nWarrant.\n8\nd) Fundamental Transaction. If, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, (i) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects\nany merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another Person, (ii) the Company, directly or indirectly, effects any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer,\nconveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets in one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any, direct or indirect, purchase offer, tender offer or\nexchange offer (whether by the Company or another Person) is completed pursuant to which holders of Common Stock are permitted to sell, tender or exchange their\nshares for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by the holders of 50% or more of the outstanding Common Stock, (iv) the Company, directly or\nindirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any reclassification, reorganization or recapitalization of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange\npursuant to which the Common Stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property, or (v) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or\nmore related transactions consummates a stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization,\nrecapitalization, spin-off or scheme of arrangement) with another Person or group of Persons whereby such other Person or group acquires more than 50% of the\noutstanding shares of Common Stock (not including any shares of Common Stock held by the other Person or other Persons making or party to, or associated or affiliated\nwith the other Persons making or party to, such stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination) (each a “Fundamental Transaction”), then, upon any\nsubsequent exercise of this Warrant, the Holder shall have the right to receive, for each Warrant Share that would have been issuable upon such exercise immediately\nprior to the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction, at the option of the Holder (without regard to any limitation in Section 2(e) on the exercise of this Warrant), the\nnumber of shares of Common Stock of the successor or acquiring corporation or of the Company, if it is the surviving corporation, and any additional consideration (the\n“Alternate Consideration”) receivable as a result of such Fundamental Transaction by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock for which this Warrant is\nexercisable immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitation in Section 2(e) on the exercise of this Warrant). For purposes of any such\nexercise, the determination of the Exercise Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration\nissuable in respect of one share of Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction, and the Company shall apportion the Exercise Price among the Alternate\nConsideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative value of any different components of the Alternate Consideration. If holders of Common Stock are given any\nchoice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration\nit receives upon any exercise of this Warrant following such Fundamental Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a Fundamental Transaction, the\nCompany or any Successor Entity (as defined below) shall, at the Holder’s option, exercisable at any time concurrently with, or within 30 days after, the consummation of\nthe Fundamental Transaction, purchase this Warrant from the Holder by paying the same type or form of consideration (and in the same proportion), at the Black Scholes\nValue of the unexercised portion of this Warrant, that is being offered and paid to the holders of Common Stock of the Company in connection with the Fundamental\nTransaction, whether that consideration be in the form of cash, stock or any combination thereof, or whether the holders of Common Stock are given the choice to receive\nfrom among alternative forms of consideration in connection with the Fundamental Transaction. “Black Scholes Value” means the value of this Warrant based on the\nBlack and Scholes Option Pricing Model obtained from the “OV” function on Bloomberg, L.P. (“Bloomberg”) determined as of the day of consummation of the applicable\nFundamental Transaction for pricing purposes and reflecting (A) a risk-free interest rate corresponding to the U.S. Treasury rate for a period equal to the time between the\ndate of the public announcement of the applicable Fundamental Transaction and the Termination Date, (B) an expected volatility equal to the 100 day volatility obtained\nfrom the HVT function on Bloomberg as of the Trading Day immediately following the public announcement of the applicable Fundamental Transaction, (C) the\nunderlying price per share used in such calculation shall be the greater of (i) the sum of the price per share being offered in cash, if any, plus the value of any non-cash\nconsideration, if any, being offered in such Fundamental Transaction and (ii) the greater of (x) the last VWAP immediately prior to the public announcement of such\nFundamental Transaction and (y) the last VWAP immediately prior to the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction and (D) a remaining option time equal to the\ntime between the date of the public announcement of the applicable Fundamental Transaction and the Termination Date. The payment of the Black Scholes Value will be\nmade by wire transfer of immediately available funds within five Business Days of the Holder’s election (or, if later, on the effective date of the Fundamental Transaction).\nThe Company shall cause any successor entity in a Fundamental Transaction in which the Company is not the survivor (the “Successor Entity”) to assume in writing all\nof the obligations of the Company under this Warrant in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3(d) pursuant to written agreements in form and substance\nreasonably satisfactory to the Holder and approved by the Holder (without unreasonable delay) prior to such Fundamental Transaction and shall, at the option of the\nHolder, deliver to the Holder in exchange for this Warrant a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance\nto this Warrant which is exercisable for a corresponding number of shares of capital stock of such Successor Entity (or its parent entity) equivalent to the shares of\nCommon Stock acquirable and receivable upon exercise of this Warrant (without regard to any limitations on the exercise of this Warrant) prior to such Fundamental\nTransaction, and with an exercise price which applies the exercise price hereunder to such shares of capital stock (but taking into account the relative value of the shares\nof Common Stock pursuant to such Fundamental Transaction and the value of such shares of capital stock, such number of shares of capital stock and such exercise price\nbeing for the purpose of protecting the economic value of this Warrant immediately prior to the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction), and which is\nreasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Holder.

(“YA II PN”) dated February 12, 2024 (the “SEPA”); (2) a Convertible Promissory Note issued by us to YA II PN dated May\n20, 2024 (the “May Note”) and related warrant (the “Warrant”) to purchase 175,000 shares (the “Warrant Shares”) of the Common Stock; (3) a Convertible Promissory Note issued\nby us to a different Selling Stockholder dated August 29, 2024 (the “August Note”); and (4) shares of Common Stock issued to accredited investors in private placements at\nvarious times in 2024 (the “2024 Shares”).\nIn connection with the SEPA, we committed to issue to YA II PN 64,656 shares of common stock within three trading days (any day during which the Nasdaq Capital Market is\nopen for business, a “Trading Day”) of the execution of the SEPA (the “Commitment Shares”).\nThe shares of Common Stock being registered for resale hereby were issued to, purchased by or will be purchased by the Selling Stockholders for the following consideration: (i) a\nprice of $2.32 per share for the Commitment Shares; (ii) a purchase price yet to be determined for the Advance Shares under the SEPA (as described herein); (iii) a purchase price of\n$2.29 per share of Common Stock for conversion of the May Note (as may be adjusted as described herein); (iv) a purchase price of $3.36 per share of Common Stock for\nconversion of the August Note; (v) a purchase price of $2.25 for 444,445 of the 2024 Shares purchased in February 2024; (vi) a purchase price of $2.75 for 181,819 of the 2024 Shares\npurchased in May 2024; and (vii) a purchase price of $3.00 for 200,000 of the 2024 Shares purchased in June 2024. The shares of Common Stock underlying the Warrant will be\npurchased, if at all, by such holders at the $2.29 exercise price of the Warrant.\nWe are not selling any securities under this prospectus and we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares by the Selling Stockholders, except we will receive cash\nproceeds from the exercise of the Warrant. In addition, the SEPA provides that we may sell up to an aggregate of $5,000,000 of our Common Stock to YA II PN under the SEPA,\nfrom time to time in our discretion after the date the registration statement that includes this prospectus is declared effective and after satisfaction of other conditions in the SEPA.\nYA II PN is an “underwriter” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The Selling Stockholders may sell the shares of\nCommon Stock described in this prospectus in a number of different ways and at varying prices. See “Plan of Distribution” for more information about how the Selling\nStockholders may sell the shares of Common Stock being registered pursuant to this prospectus.\nWe will pay the expenses of registering the Common Stock offered by this prospectus, but all selling and other expenses incurred by the Selling Stockholders will be paid by the\nSelling Stockholders. The Selling Stockholders may sell our shares of Common Stock offered by this prospectus from time to time on terms to be determined at the time of sale\nthrough ordinary brokerage transactions or through any other means described in this prospectus under “Plan of Distribution.” The prices at which the Selling Stockholders may\nsell shares will be determined by the prevailing market price for our Common Stock or in negotiated transactions.\nWe are a “smaller reporting company” as defined under the federal securities laws and, under applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rules, we have elected to comply\nwith certain reduced public company reporting and disclosure requirements.\nOur Common Stock is listed on Nasdaq under the symbol “REBN.” The last reported closing price for our Common Stock on Nasdaq on September 26, 2024 was $3.02 per share.\nAs of September 26, 2024, there were 3,509,754 shares of Common Stock outstanding.

Before investing in our securities, you should carefully read this entire prospectus, including the information set forth under the headings “Risk\nFactors” as included elsewhere in this prospectus and our financial statements and the related notes and the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations”, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023, our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the\nperiod ended March 31, 2024, our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2024, which are incorporated by reference herein.\nOverview of Our Company\nReborn is focused on serving high quality, specialty-roasted coffee at retail locations, kiosks and cafes. We are an innovative company that strives for constant improvement\nin the coffee experience through exploration of new technology and premier service, guided by traditional brewing techniques. We believe Reborn differentiates itself from\nother coffee roasters through its innovative techniques, including sourcing, washing, roasting, and brewing our coffee beans with a balance of precision and craft.\nFounded in 2015 by Jay Kim, our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Kim and his team launched Reborn with the vision of using the finest pure ingredients and pristine water. We\ncurrently serve customers through our retail store locations in California, Korea, and Malaysia.\nReborn continues to elevate the high-end coffee experience and we received first place traditional still in “America’s Best Cold Brew” competition by Coffee Fest in 2017 in\nPortland and 2018 in Los Angeles.\nThe source of coffee is pinnacle to specialty coffee. The coffee industry has gone through various phases including the first, second, third and fourth wave. In the first and\nsecond waves of coffee, the single-origin source and type of the coffee is not necessarily in the forefront during the sourcing process. As such, much of the coffee may be a\nblend with various sources and a mix of Robusta and Arabica coffee beans. The third wave of coffee focuses on a single-origin source and one variety of coffee bean\n(specifically Arabica beans). Single-origin beans can focus on specific countries and can also have hyper-focused on specific regions in the third wave of coffee, such as\nCoban in Guatemala. Arabia beans are considered premier due to the specific requirements for growth and the high-quality flavor they produce. Arabica coffee is required to be\ngrown in higher, cooler elevations in regions.\nDifferentiated from other coffee companies, the Reborn Wash Process is the key to creating the clean flavor of our coffee. Our Wash Process is distinguished by the use of\nmagnetized water to wash our green coffee beans when they arrive at the Reborn facility, in order to extract impurities and enhance hydration before the roasting process.\nMagnetizing water is a process that converts the particles of water, which can naturally appear in various sizes, into evenly sized particles. As a result of this process, we\nbelieve that the water increases its hydration and ability to absorb into organic material. Our water is created through a water magnetizing device in which water is flowed\nthrough the device and magnetizes the water on-site immediately prior to use.\nAfter the wash, we roast our washed-green beans based on the profile of each single-origin. After the coffee beans are roasted, they are then packaged into various products\nsuch as whole bean coffee, pour over packs, and cold brew packs. Additionally, whole bean inventory is also supplied to the kiosk and cafes. A portion of the roasted coffee is\nalso allotted to create our award-winning cold brew concentrate. Our cold brew production is created using a proprietary percolation technique, also using magnetized water at\neach step to enhance the flavor of the cold brew.\n1\nWe continually innovate in the way we serve coffee. At our cafes, we serve customers our award-winning coffee through cold brew taps in addition to freshly ground coffee\nbeans in espresso-made drinks. Other brew methods, such as an in-house pour over and drip coffee, are also available.\nIn August 2022, we consummated our initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 1,440,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $5.00 per share, generating gross\nproceeds of $7,200,000. Net proceeds from the IPO was approximately $6.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses of\napproximately $998,000.\nWe had granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 216,000 additional shares (equal to 15% of the shares of common stock sold in the offering) to cover over-\nallotments. In addition, we had agreed to issue to the representative of the several underwriters warrants to purchase the number of shares of common stock in the aggregate\nequal to five percent (5%) of the shares of common stock to be issued and sold in the IPO. The warrants are exercisable for a price per share equal to 125% of the public offering\nprice. No over-allotment option or representative’s warrants have been exercised.\nOn August 12, 2022, our stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “REBN”.\nThe Experience, Reborn\nWe believe that we are the leading pioneers of the emerging “Fourth Wave” movement and that our business is redefining specialty coffee as an experience that demands\nmuch more than premium quality. We consider ourselves leaders of the “fourth wave” coffee movement because we are constantly developing our bean processing methods,\nresearching design concepts, and reinventing new ways of drinking coffee. For instance, the current transition from the K-Cup trend to the pour over drip concept allowed us\nto reinvent the way people consume coffee, by merging convenience and quality. We took the pour over drip concept and made it available and affordable to the public\nthrough our Reborn Coffee Pour Over packs. Our Pour Over Packs allow our consumers to consume our specialty coffee outdoors and on-the-go.\nOur success in innovating within the “Fourth Wave” coffee movement is measured by our success in B2B sales with our introduction of Reborn Coffee Pour Over Packs to\nhotels. With the introduction of our Pour Over Packs to major hotels (including one hotel company with 7 locations), our B2B sales increased as these companies recognized\nthe convenience and functionality our Pour Over Packs serve to their customers.\nCentered around its core values of service, trust, and well-being, we deliver an appreciation of coffee as both a science and an art. Developing innovative processes such as\nwashing green coffee beans with magnetized water, we challenge traditional preparation methods by focusing on the relationship between water chemistry, health, and flavor\nprofile. Leading research studies, testing brewing equipment, and refining roasting/brewing methods to a specific, we proactively distinguish exceptional quality from good\nquality by starting at the foundation and paying attention to the details. Our mission places an equal emphasis on humanizing the coffee experience, delivering a fresh take on\n“farm-to-table” by sourcing internationally. In this way, we create opportunities to develop transparency by paying homage to origin stories and spark new conversations by\nbuilding cross-cultural communities united by a passion for the finest coffee.\nThrough a broad product offering, Reborn provides customers with a wide variety of beverages and coffee options. As a result, we believe we can capture share of any\nexperience where customers seek to consume great beverages whether in our inviting store atmospheres which are designed for comfort, or on the go through our pour over\npacks, or at home with our whole bean ground coffee bags. We believe that the retail coffee market in the US is large and growing. According to IBIS, in 2021, the retail market\nfor coffee in the United States is expected to be $46.2 billion. This is expected to grow due to a shift in consumer preferences to premium coffee, including specialized blends,\nespresso-based beverages, and cold brew options. Reborn aims to capture a growing portion of the market as we expand and increase consumer awareness of our brand.\nBranding\nReborn Coffee focuses on two key features in our branding, including “Introducing the Fourth Wave” and “America’s Best Cold Brew.” These phrases encapsulate the quality\nof the Reborn Process of sourcing, washing, roasting, and brewing coffee and the quality of the product that we create.\n2\nThe Reborn brand is essential to our marketing strategy, as it allows us to stand out compared to our competitors. The products aim to make customers feel “reborn” after\ndrinking a cup of coffee.\nOur Menu and Products\nWe purchase and roast high-quality coffees that we sell, along with handcrafted coffee, tea and other beverages and a variety of high-quality food items. We believe in offering\ncustomers the same great taste and quality whether served in store or on the go. We also partner with third-party importers and exporters to purchase and import our green\ncoffee beans. Through these relationships, we source high-quality coffee beans from across the globe, including Mexico, Ethiopia, Colombia, Guatemala, Brazil, and Honduras.\nFranchise Operations\nIn January 2021, the Company formed Reborn Coffee Franchise LLC in the State of California in order to begin franchising Reborn Coffee retail stores and kiosks. The Company\nplans to charge future franchisees a non-refundable franchise fee and certain marketing and royalty fees based on gross sales, however we presently have no contractual\ncommitments or other agreements to do so. We expect to begin franchise sales in 2024. We believe that our team’s prior experience building a large, global foodservice\nbusiness will allow us to rapidly scale our future franchise effort. In addition, we have formed a franchise council consisting of a team of franchise experts to advise us. We plan\nto expand beyond California to additional states to create a national and global presence.\nExpanding Sales Channels\nToday, we sell a variety of our coffee and tea products through the enterprise, or commercial, channel, which we refer to as “B2B”, as well as direct-to-consumer via our\nwebsite. We expect to increase our channel presence by increasing the availability of Reborn Coffee in businesses and enterprises, and expand upon the partnerships we have\nin place with hotel operators to increase the use and brand awareness in hospitality. We also expect to grow our online sales through new partnerships with third-party\nretailers. Our products are available in various form factors, such as whole bean roasted coffee bags, single-serve drip bags, and pour over packs. We are exploring\npartnerships with grocery operators and foodservice providers to expand the Reborn Coffee brand.\nExperienced Leadership Team\nOur relentless commitment to excellence is driven by our passionate management team under the leadership of Founder and Chief Executive Officer Jay Kim. Jay launched\nReborn Coffee with the vision to provide the best coffee using the purest ingredients. Jay is focused on the expansion of Reborn and he has surrounded himself with leaders\nwith direct experience in beverage and retail. Stephan Kim, our Chief Financial Officer, has 20 years of experience in public accounting and consulting. Other members of our\nexecutive leadership team bring high growth, franchise and sector expertise.\nOur Commitment to Our Team\nReborn Coffee believes in mentoring the developing the next generation of premium coffee baristas. Through our in-depth training, we aim to train dedicated employees who\nunderstand the science and art behind every cup of coffee. We also expect to form a training school specializing in creating passionate baristas and coffee connoisseurs, by\neducating its students about coffee processes and preparation methods. The efforts for the training school are underway and we expect to launch the program in 2024.\nOur Highly Engaged Customers\nReborn Coffee customers are loyal to our brand due to our intense focus on premium coffee and customer service. Community engagement is another essential element of\nReborn Coffee’s in-person marketing strategy. Reborn hosts on-site engagements, such as event sponsorships, and engages with local Chambers of Commerce. Previously, we\nhave worked with Lululemon to host yoga sessions outside of our retail locations, creatively engaging the community while simultaneously promoting Reborn as an active\nlifestyle. We have also hosted pop-up locations on the Facebook campus, further expanding our outreach and introducing our brand name to different communities. We further\nengage with the community by organizing our own latte art competitions, in which baristas can compete for prizes and customers in the audience can witness the competitive\npassion Reborn Coffee encompasses.\n3\nDigital Channels\nReborn Coffee focuses on many digital channels in its marketing strategy. Social media is an important leg that creates engagement and education of Reborn Coffee’s brand.\nCustomers primarily engage the brand on Instagram, where we host giveaways, share new store openings, and promote seasonal menus. Through our unique, modern aesthetic\nand intense focus on high-quality coffee, we are able to share the quality and essence of Reborn Coffee on display inside of our retail locations with existing and future\ncustomers on social media platforms.\nFor both the in-store café channel and the e-commerce channel, SMS & email marketing are used for reengagement and communication of new products and offerings.\nDigital advertising channels are also used, primarily to engage the online market audience. Google and Facebook are the primary paid ad channels that we currently utilize. Yelp\nadvertising is also used to engage local customers and tourists who visit specific areas where Reborn Coffee retail locations are located.\nIn-Person Marketing Engagement\nEngaging customers in-store with a marketing plan is essential for customer retention and new customer generation. Reborn Coffee’s customer loyalty program provides free\ndrinks for every 10 drinks purchased. Additionally, store customers may participate in promotional deals, especially during the holidays and new item releases, to try new\ninnovative items created in-house. We also offer coffee samples of our pour over packs as well as new beans to our retail location customers. The distribution of coffee\nsamples has expanded customers’ knowledge of our products and, led to increased contributing to whole bean sales.\nReborn Coffee locations are located in heavily trafficked areas as well as popular malls. As such, the potential for marketing and branding is very high in these locations.\nSignage and promotional deals with giveaways are essential to attracting new customers.\nGrowth Strategies\nCorporate and Franchise Expansion\nReborn Coffee plans to expand across the Unites States with company operated locations and franchise locations to share the quality of specialty coffee. Reborn Coffee aims\nto accelerate our growth through our franchise program. Reborn Coffee will continue to innovate in the coffee industry by making the industry more personal to the consumers,\nprospective franchisees, and employees. This goal will be achieved through the continued innovation in our products, sourcing directly from farms, and giving customers\nchoices in how their coffee is served to them. As Reborn expands, we hope to show the world that expanding in volume and size does not diminish the quality and personal\nelement that is instilled in the coffee industry.\nWe have started to scale our logistics and supply chain to provide support for our rapid growth, including for our future franchisees. We have increased roasting capacity and\nour paper goods supplies, including an emphasis on eco-friendly products.\nB2B Strategy\nReborn Coffee products are unique given their potential to engage with business partners for large wholesale orders. Currently, Reborn Coffee builds strong relationships with\nhotel management companies within California and out-of-state. We currently work with several hotels, providing pour over packs and cold brew packs to cater to their\ncustomer needs. Reborn Coffee plans to continue growing its B2B marketing and sales strategy through active outreach and advertising to potential partners. We believe that\naccess to large-scale distribution channels such as hotels increases consumer awareness of our brand while providing us access to large enterprise customers. Gift giving\ncomprises a large percentage of winter B2B sales at Reborn Coffee. During the holidays, Reborn Coffee’s B2B marketing strategy focuses on targeting companies, and specific\nteams within companies, that are seeking to provide end of the year gifts to their clients and customers. Reborn Coffee provides customized gift sets to each customer’s needs.\nWord-of-mouth marketing has grown our B2B holiday gift giving accounts greatly, forging opportunities to have worked with companies like Google to provide gift sets for\ntheir clients. Reborn Coffee plans to expand not only by growing its retail location footprint, but also through the development of more hotel partnerships, expansion into\ngrocery stores and markets, expansion of our e-commerce and wholesale.\nReborn Coffee believes the grocery market is another major channel through which we expect to access. Through both bulk sales of roasted beans and in-store kiosks, as well\nsales of pre-packaged products, Reborn Coffee will access customers who purchase both in volume and for those customers looking for a handcrafted beverage during their in-\nstore shopping experience. We are exploring discussions with a variety of retailers and expect to access these additional sales channels in 2023.\n4\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings from time to time as part of its business. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, if determined\nadversely to us, we believe would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nHowever, legal proceedings are inherently uncertain. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter or a combination of matters may be material to our results of operations for a\nparticular period, depending upon the size of the loss or our income for that particular period.\nEmployees and Human Capital\nAs of September 26, 2024 we had 19 full-time employees. We believe in mentoring and developing the next generation of premium coffee baristas. Through our in-depth\ntraining, we aim to train dedicated employees who understand the science and art behind every cup of coffee. We also expect to form a training school specializing in creating\npassionate baristas and coffee connoisseurs, by educating its students about coffee processes and preparation methods. The efforts for the training school are underway and\nwe expect to launch the program in 2024.\nProperties\nWe have a production and distribution center at our headquarters that we use to process and roast coffee for wholesale and retail distribution.

Before deciding whether to invest in our securities, you should carefully consider the risks described below and\nthose discussed under the Section captioned “Risk Factors” contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023, as revised or\nsupplemented by our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or our current reports on Form 8-K, each as filed with the SEC and which are incorporated by reference in\nthis prospectus, together with other information in this prospectus, the information and documents incorporated by reference herein, and in any free writing prospectus that we\nhave authorized for use in connection with this offering. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be\nseriously harmed. This could cause the trading price of our Common Stock to decline, resulting in a loss of all or part of your investment. Please also read carefully the section\nbelow entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”\nRisks Related to This Offering\nIt is not possible to predict the actual number of shares we will sell under the SEPA to YA II PN, or the actual gross proceeds resulting from those sales.\nSubject to certain limitations in the SEPA and compliance with applicable law, we have the discretion to deliver notices to YA II PN at any time throughout the term of the SEPA.\nThe actual number of shares of Common Stock are sold to YA II PN may depend based on a number of factors, including the market price of our Common Stock during the sales\nperiod. Actual gross proceeds may be less than $5.0 million, which may impact our future liquidity. Because the price per share of each share sold to YA II PN will fluctuate during\nthe sales period, it is not currently possible to predict the number of shares that will be sold or the actual gross proceeds to be raised in connection with those sales.\nMoreover, although the SEPA provides that we may sell up to an aggregate of $5.0 million of our Common Stock to YA II PN, we are registering 1,670,844 shares of our Common\nStock (the “Advance Shares”). If we elect to sell to YA II PN all of the Advance Shares being registered for resale under this prospectus that are available for sale by us to YA II\nPN under the SEPA, depending on the market prices of our Common Stock for each purchase made pursuant to the SEPA, the actual gross proceeds from the sale of the shares\nmay be substantially less than the $5.0 million total commitment available to us under the SEPA. If it becomes necessary for us to issue and sell to YA II PN under the SEPA more\nshares than the Advance Shares being registered for resale under this prospectus in order to receive aggregate gross proceeds equal to $5.0 million under the SEPA, we must file\nwith the SEC one or more additional registration statements to register under the Securities Act the resale by YA II PN of any such additional shares of our Common Stock over the\nAdvance Shares registered in this Registration Statement that we wish to sell from time to time under the SEPA, which the SEC must declare effective, in each case before we may\nelect to sell any additional shares of our Common Stock to YA II PN under the SEPA.\nAny issuance and sale by us under the SEPA of a substantial amount of shares of Common Stock in addition to the Advance Shares being registered for resale by YA II PN under\nthis prospectus could cause additional substantial dilution to our stockholders. The number of shares of our Common Stock ultimately offered for sale by YA II PN is dependent\nupon the number of shares of Common Stock, if any, we ultimately sell to YA II PN under the SEPA.\nInvestors who buy shares in this offering at different times will likely pay different prices.\nInvestors who purchase shares of Common Stock in this offering at different times will likely pay different prices, and so may experience different levels of dilution and different\noutcomes in their investment results. In connection with the SEPA, we will have discretion, subject to market demand, to vary the timing, prices, and numbers of shares of Common\nStock sold to YA II PN. Similarly, YA II PN may sell such shares at different times and at different prices. Investors may experience a decline in the value of the shares they\npurchase from YA II PN in this offering as a result of sales made by us in future transactions to YA II PN at prices lower than the prices they paid.\n8\nThe issuance of Common Stock to the Selling Stockholders may cause substantial dilution to our existing shareholders and the sale of such shares acquired by the Selling\nStockholders could cause the price of our Common Stock to decline.\nWe are registering for resale by the Selling Stockholders up to 3,172,948 shares of Common Stock. The number of shares of our Common Stock ultimately offered for resale by the\nSelling Stockholders under this prospectus is dependent upon the number of shares of Common Stock issued to the Selling Stockholders pursuant to the SEPA, the Notes, and the\nWarrant. Depending on a variety of factors, including market liquidity of our Common Stock, the issuance of shares to the Selling Stockholders may cause the trading price of our\nCommon Stock to decline.\nIf and when we elect to sell Common Stock to YA II PN, sales of newly issued Common Stock by us to YA II PN could result in substantial dilution to the interests of existing\nholders of our Common Stock. Additionally, the sale of a substantial number of Common Stock to YA II PN, or the anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to\nsell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales.\nWe expect to grant equity awards to employees and directors under our equity incentive plans. We may also raise capital through equity financings in the future. As part of our\nbusiness strategy, we may make or receive investments in companies, solutions or technologies and issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition or investment. Any\nsuch issuances of additional share capital may cause shareholders to experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our Common Stock to\ndecline.\nWe may require additional financing to sustain our operations and without it we may not be able to continue operations.\nSubject to the terms and conditions of the SEPA, we may, at our discretion, direct YA II PN to purchase up to $5.0 million of shares of our Common Stock under the SEPA from\ntime-to-time. The purchase price per share for the shares of Common Stock that we may elect to sell to YA II PN under the SEPA will fluctuate based on the market prices of our\nCommon Stock for each purchase made pursuant to the SEPA, if any. Accordingly, it is not currently possible to predict the number of shares that will be sold to YA II PN, the\nactual purchase price per share to be paid by YA II PN for those shares, if any, or the actual gross proceeds to be raised in connection with those sales.\nThe extent to which we rely on YA II PN as a source of funding will depend on a number of factors including, the prevailing market price of our Common Stock and the extent to\nwhich we are able to secure working and other capital from other sources. If obtaining sufficient funding from YA II PN were to prove unavailable or prohibitively dilutive, we may\nneed to secure another source of funding in order to satisfy our working and other capital needs. Even if we were to sell to YA II PN all of the shares of Common Stock available for\nsale to YA II PN under the SEPA, we may still need additional capital to fully implement our business, operating and development plans. Should the financing we require to sustain\nour working capital needs be unavailable or prohibitively expensive when we require it, the consequences may be a material adverse effect on our business, operating results,\nfinancial condition and prospects.\nFuture sales and issuances of our Common Stock or other securities might result in significant dilution and could cause the price of our Common Stock to decline.\nTo raise capital, we may sell Common Stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions other than those contemplated by the SEPA, at prices and\nin a manner we determine from time to time. We may sell shares or other securities in another offering at a price per share that is less than the price per share paid by investors in\nthis offering, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders. The price per share at which we sell additional\nshares of our Common Stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into Common Stock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share paid by investors\nin this offering.\nWe cannot predict what effect, if any, sales of shares of our Common Stock in the public market or the availability of shares for sale will have on the market price of our Common\nStock. However, future sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock in the public market, including shares issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants and\nconvertible preferred shares, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\n9\nOur management will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from our sale of shares of Common Stock to YA II PN, and you may not agree with how we use\nthe proceeds and the proceeds may not be invested successfully.\nOur management will have broad discretion with respect to the use of proceeds from the sale of any shares of our Common Stock to YA II PN, including for any of the purposes\ndescribed in the section of this prospectus entitled “Use of Proceeds.” You will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the proceeds from the\nsale of any shares of our Common Stock to YA II PN. The results and effectiveness of the use of proceeds are uncertain, and we could spend the proceeds in ways that you do not\nagree with or that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our Common Stock. Our failure to apply these funds effectively could harm our business, delay\nthe development of our pipeline product candidates and cause the price of our Common Stock to decline.\nIt is not possible to predict the actual number of shares of Common Stock, if any, we will issue upon conversion of the Notes to the Selling Stockholders.\nWe do not have the right to control the timing and amount of any conversions of principal under the Notes by the Selling Stockholders. The number of shares that we issue to the\nSelling Stockholders pursuant to the Notes, if any, will depend upon market conditions and other factors to be determined by the Selling Stockholders. The Selling Stockholders\nmay ultimately decide to convert none or a portion of the principal amount of the Notes.\nThe number of shares of Common Stock ultimately offered for sale by the Selling Stockholders is dependent upon the number of shares, if any, we ultimately issue upon\nconversion of the Notes. However, even if the Selling Stockholders elect to convert the entire principal amount of the Notes, the Selling Stockholders may resell all, some or none\nof such shares at any time or from time to time in its sole discretion and at different prices.\nThe terms of our indebtedness, including the covenants and the dates on which principal and interest payments on our indebtedness are due, increases the risk that we will be\nunable to continue as a going concern.\nAs of December 31, 2023, and June 30, 2024 we had $1.48 million, and $1.57 million in outstanding short-term borrowing. In addition, on May 20, 2024, we issued the May Note\nwhich has a principal balance of $800,000 and, beginning on August 15, 2024, requires monthly principal and interest payments in excess of $266,667, and on August 29, 2024, we\nissued the August Note which has a principal balance of $500,000. The terms of our indebtedness, including the covenants and the dates on which principal and interest payments\non our indebtedness are due, increases the risk that we will be unable to continue as a going concern. To continue as a going concern over the next twelve months, we must make\npayments on our debt as they come due and comply with the covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness or, if we fail to do so, to (i) negotiate and obtain waivers of\nor forbearances with respect to any defaults that occur with respect to our indebtedness, (ii) amend, replace, refinance or restructure any or all of the agreements governing our\nindebtedness, and/or (iii) otherwise secure additional capital. However, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in accomplishing any of these plans.\nWe do not intend to apply for any listing of the Notes or the Warrant on any exchange or nationally recognized trading system, and we do not expect a market to develop for\nthe unregistered securities.\nWe do not intend to apply for any listing of the Notes or the Warrant on Nasdaq or any other securities exchange or nationally recognized trading system, and we do not expect a\nmarket to develop for the Notes or the Warrant. Without an active market, the liquidity of the Notes and the Warrant will be limited. Further, the existence of the Notes and Warrant\nmay act to reduce both the trading volume and the trading price of our common stock.\n10\nDue to the recent implementation of the Reverse Stock Split, the liquidity of our common stock may be adversely effected.\nOur common stock began trading on Nasdaq on a Reverse Stock Split-adjusted basis beginning on January 22, 2024. The liquidity of the shares of our common stock may be\naffected adversely by any reverse stock split given the reduced number of shares of our common stock that are outstanding following the Reverse Stock Split, especially if the\nmarket price of our common stock does not increase as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. Following the Reverse Stock Split, the resulting market price of our common stock may\nnot attract new investors and may not satisfy the investing requirements of those investors. Although we believe that a higher market price of our common stock may help\ngenerate greater or broader investor interest, there can be no assurance that the Reverse Stock Split resulted in a share price that will attract new investors, including institutional\ninvestors. In addition, there can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will satisfy the investing requirements of those investors. As a result, the trading\nliquidity of our common stock may not necessarily improve.\nIf we are unable to satisfy the applicable continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, our common stock could be delisted.\nOn June 21, 2024, we received a written notice (the “Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq indicating that Nasdaq had determined that we had failed to\ncomply with certain Nasdaq Listing Rules because we had not yet filed our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024.\nAs previously announced, on May 15, 2024, we were required to dismiss BF Borgers CPA PC as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm. We had to appoint\na new independent registered public accounting firm in order to complete and file the Form 10-Q, and on May 14, 2024, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of BCRG\nGroup (“BCRG”) as our new independent registered public accounting firm. Due to the timing of the appointment of BCRG, we were unable without unreasonable effort and\nexpense to complete the review of our financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 before the required filing date for the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nA Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) had previously placed us on a Discretionary Panel Monitor for a period of one year or until May 16, 2025 after we regained compliance with\nprevious Nasdaq listing deficiencies, which would require Nasdaq to issue a Delist Determination Letter in the event that we failed to maintain compliance with any continued\nlisting requirement (the “Panel Monitor”). Due to the Panel Monitor, we requested an appeal of determination to the Panel, and request a stay of the suspension pending a hearing.\nOn July 19, 2024, we filed Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024.\nAlthough we anticipate complying with Nasdaq’s Listing Rules going forward, there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet continued listing requirements in the future.\nIn determining whether to afford a company a cure period prior to commencing suspension or delisting procedures, Nasdaq analyzes all relevant facts including any past\ndeficiencies, and thus our prior deficiencies could be used as a factor by Nasdaq in any future decision to delist our securities from trading on its exchange.\nIf our Common Stock is delisted, it could reduce the price of our Common Stock and the levels of liquidity available to our stockholders. In addition, the delisting of our Common\nStock could materially adversely affect our access to the capital markets and any limitation on liquidity or reduction in the price of our Common Stock could materially adversely\naffect our ability to raise capital. Delisting from Nasdaq could also result in other negative consequences, including the potential loss of confidence by suppliers, customers and\nemployees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities.\nBecause the currently outstanding shares of Common Stock that are being registered in this prospectus represent a substantial percentage of our outstanding Common Stock,\nthe sale of such securities could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline significantly.\nThis prospectus relates to the offer and sale from time to time by the Selling Stockholders of an aggregate of up to 890,290 shares of our currently outstanding Common Stock. This\nprospectus also relates to the offer and sale from time to time by the Selling Stockholders of up to 2,282,028 shares of Common Stock issuable by us, consisting of (i) up to\n1,670,844 shares of Common Stock that we may sell to YA II PN, from time to time at our sole discretion, pursuant to the SEPA; (ii) up to 462,374 shares of Common Stock issuable\nto YA II PN upon conversion of the May Note and/or exercise of the Warrant; and (iii) up to 148,810 shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the August Note.\n11\nThe number of shares of Common Stock that the Selling Stockholders can sell into the public markets pursuant to this prospectus represents a significant amount of our\noutstanding shares of Common Stock. As of September 26, 2024, there were 3,509,754 shares of Common Stock outstanding. If all shares being registered hereby were sold, it\nwould comprise approximately 47.5% of our total shares of Common Stock outstanding. Given the substantial number of shares of Common Stock registered pursuant to this\nprospectus, the sale of Common Stock by the Selling Stockholders, or the perception in the market that the Selling Stockholders of a large number of shares of Common Stock\nintend to sell Common Stock, could increase the volatility of the market price of our Common Stock or result in a significant decline in the public trading price of our Common Stock.\nIn addition, certain Selling Stockholders have an incentive to sell because they have purchased their Common Stock at prices lower than the public investors or the current trading\nprice of the Common Stock, and they may profit significantly so even under circumstances in which our public stockholders or certain other Selling Stockholders would experience\nlosses in connection with their investment. The securities being registered for resale were issued to, purchased by or will be purchased by the Selling Stockholders for the\nfollowing consideration: (i) a price of $2.32 per share for the Commitment Shares; (ii) a purchase price yet to be determined for the Advance Shares under the SEPA (as described\nherein); (iii) a purchase price of $2.29 per share of Common Stock for conversion of the May Note (as may be adjusted as described herein); (iv) a purchase price of $3.36 per share\nof Common Stock for conversion of the August Note; (v) a purchase price of $2.25 for 444,445 of the 2024 Shares purchased in February 2024; (vi) a purchase price of $2.75 for\n181,819 of the 2024 Shares purchased in May 2024; and (vii) a purchase price of $3.00 for 200,000 of the 2024 Shares purchased in June 2024. The shares of Common Stock\nunderlying the Warrant will be purchased, if at all, by such holders at the $2.29 exercise price of the Warrant. If the Selling Stockholders were to sell the shares of Common Stock at\na price of $3.02 per share (the last reported sale price of our Common Stock on September 26, 2024), they would recognize a profit or loss as follows: (i) a profit of approximately\n$0.70 per share of Common Stock for the Commitment Shares; (ii) a profit of approximately $0.73 per share of Common Stock for the shares underlying the May Note; (iii) a loss of\napproximately $0.34 per share of Common Stock for shares underlying the August Note; (iv) a profit of approximately $0.77 per share of Common Stock for the 2024 Shares\npurchased in February 2024; (v) a profit of approximately $0.27 per share of Common Stock for the 2024 Shares purchased in May 2024; and (vi) a profit of approximately $0.02 per\nshare of Common Stock for the 2024 Shares purchased in June 2024.\nPublic stockholders of Common Stock may have paid more than certain of the Selling Stockholders for their Common Stock and would not expect to see a positive return unless the\nprice of the Common Stock appreciates above the price at which such stockholders purchased their Common Stock. Investors who purchase Common Stock on open market may\nnot experience a similar rate of return on the Common Stock they purchase due to differences in the purchase prices and the current trading price referenced above. In addition,\nsales by the Selling Stockholders may cause the trading prices of our securities to experience a decline. As a result, the Selling Stockholders may effect sales of Common Stock at\nprices below the current market price, which could cause market prices to decline further.\n12\nSPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis prospectus contains various forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, which represent our\nexpectations or beliefs concerning future events that are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management, and which\nstatements involve substantial risk and uncertainties. All statements contained in this prospectus other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding our future\noperating results and financial position, our business strategy and plans, market growth and trends, and objectives for future operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-\nlooking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they\ncontain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “could,” “intends,” “target,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,”\n“potential,” or “continue” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or intentions.\nThese risks and uncertainties include, among other things:\n● our ability to continue as a going concern;\n● our reliance on third party vendors;\n● our dependence on our executive officers;\n● our financial performance guidance;\n● material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting;\n● regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries;\n● the impact of laws, regulations, accounting standards, regulatory requirements, judicial decisions and guidance issued by authoritative bodies;\n● our estimates regarding expenses, future revenue and cash flow, capital requirements and needs for additional financing;\n● our financial performance;\n● the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of our business combination and/or divestitures; and\n● the effect of COVID-19 on the foregoing.\nYou should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this prospectus primarily on our\ncurrent expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. The\noutcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors described elsewhere in this prospectus and in the section\ntitled “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n13\nTHE SEPA TRANSACTION\nOn February 12, 2024, we entered into the Standby Equity Purchase Agreement (the “SEPA”) with YA II PN. Pursuant to the SEPA, we may sell to YA II PN up to $5,000,000, of\nshares of Common Stock (the “Advance Shares”), from time to time during the term of the SEPA. The SEPA contains customary representations, warranties, conditions and\nindemnification obligations of the parties. Pursuant to the SEPA, we also agreed to file a registration statement with the SEC, covering the resale of Advance Shares issued or sold\nto YA II PN under the SEPA under the Securities Act.\nIn consideration for YA II PN’s execution and delivery of the SEPA, we issued to YA II PN 64,656 (the “Commitment Shares”).\nWe cannot sell any additional shares to YA II PN until the date that the registration statement which contains this prospectus is declared effective by the SEC and a final\nprospectus in connection therewith is filed and all of the other conditions set forth in the SEPA are satisfied (the “Commencement Date”). From and after such time, we will control\nthe timing and amount of any sales of our Common Stock to YA II PN. Actual sales of shares of our Common Stock to YA II PN under the SEPA will depend on a variety of factors\nto be determined by us from time to time, including, among others, market conditions, the trading price of the Common Stock and determinations by us as to the appropriate\nsources of funding for our company and our operations.\nBeginning on the Commencement Date and until February 12, 2027, under the terms and subject to the conditions of the SEPA, from time to time, at our discretion, we have the\nright, but not the obligation, to issue to YA II PN, and YA II PN is obligated to purchase, the Advance Shares, subject to certain limitations set forth in the SEPA. The purchase\nprice of the Advance Shares will be at one of two prices, as chosen by us in our sole discretion and specified in the notice given to YA II PN (each, a “SEPA Advance Notice”): (i)\n95% of the Market Price (as defined below) for any period commencing (1) if submitted to YA II PN prior to 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time on a trading day, the open of trading on such day\nor (2) if submitted to YA II PN after 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time on a trading day, upon receipt by us of written confirmation of acceptance of such SEPA Advance Notice by YA II PN\n(or the open of regular trading hours, if later), and in either case, ending on 4:00 pm New York Citytime on the applicable trading day (the “Option 1 Pricing Period”), and (ii) 96% of\nthe Market Price for any three consecutive trading days commencing on the SEPA Advance Notice date (the “Option 2 Pricing Period,” and each of the Option 1 Pricing Period and\nthe Option 2 Pricing Period, a “Pricing Period”). “Market Price” is defined as, for any Option 1 Pricing Period, the VWAP of the Common Stock on Nasdaq during the Option 1\nPricing Period, and for any Option 2 Pricing Period, the lowest VWAP of the Common Stock on the Nasdaq during the Option 2 Pricing Period.\nOur ability to issue Advance Shares under the SEPA are subject to certain limitations, including that YA II PN cannot purchase any shares that would result in it beneficially\nowning more than 4.99% of the our Common Stock at the time of us issuing a SEPA Advance Notice. Additionally, if the total number of shares of Common Stock traded on\nNasdaq during the applicable Pricing Period is less than the Volume Threshold (as defined below), then the number of shares of Common Stock issued and sold pursuant to such\nSEPA Advance Notice will be reduced to the greater of (a) 30% of the trading volume of the Common Stock on Nasdaq during the relevant Pricing Period as reported by Bloomberg\nL.P., or (b) the number of shares of Common Stock sold by YA II PN during such Pricing Period. “Volume Threshold” is defined as a number of shares of Common Stock equal to\nthe quotient of (a) the number of shares in the SEPA Advance Notice requested by the company divided by (b) 0.30.\nUnder the applicable rules of Nasdaq and pursuant to the SEPA, in no event were we permitted to issue to YA II PN more than 19.99% of the shares of the Common Stock\noutstanding immediately prior to the execution of the SEPA unless we obtained stockholder approval to issue shares of Common Stock in excess of such amount. On May 10, 2024,\nour stockholders approved the issuance of Common Stock in excess of 19.99% of the shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the execution of the SEPA.\nThe net proceeds from sales, if any, under the SEPA, will depend on the frequency and prices at which we sell shares of Common Stock to YA II PN. To the extent we sell shares\nunder the SEPA, we currently plan to use any proceeds therefrom for costs of this transaction, for working capital, strategic and other general corporate purposes.\nThe SEPA does not include any of the following: (i) limitations on our use of amounts we receive as the purchase price for shares of Common Stock sold to YA II PN; (ii) financial\nor business covenants, except that we may not effect any consolidation or transfer of substantially all of our assets while a SEPA Advance Notice is outstanding; (iii) restrictions\non future financings; (iv) rights of first refusal; or (v) participation rights or penalties.\nAs of September 26, 2024, there were 3,509,754 shares of our Common Stock outstanding. Although the SEPA provides that we may sell up to an aggregate of $5,000,000 of shares\nof our Common Stock to YA II PN, only 1,670,844 shares of our Common Stock are being registered for resale under this prospectus that we may issue and sell to YA II PN in the\nfuture under the SEPA, if and when we elect to sell shares of our Common Stock to YA II PN under the SEPA. Depending on the market prices of our Common Stock at the time we\nelect to issue and sell shares of our Common Stock to YA II PN under the SEPA, we may need to register for resale under the Securities Act additional shares of our Common Stock\nin order to receive aggregate gross proceeds equal to the $5,000,000 total commitment available to us under the SEPA. If all of such 1,670,844 shares of our Common Stock offered\nhereby were issued and outstanding as of the date of this prospectus, such shares would represent approximately 28.5% of the total number of outstanding shares of Common\nStock, and approximately 35.6% of the total number of outstanding shares of Common Stock held by non-affiliates, in each case as of the date of this prospectus. If we elect to\nissue and sell to YA II PN under the SEPA more than the 1,670,844 shares of our Common Stock being registered for resale by YA II PN under this prospectus, which we have the\nright, but not the obligation, to do, we must first register for resale under the Securities Act any such additional shares of our Common Stock, which could cause additional\nsubstantial dilution to our shareholders. The number of shares of our Common Stock ultimately offered for sale by YA II PN is dependent upon the number of shares purchased by\nYA II PN under the SEPA.\n14\nIssuances of our Common Stock to YA II PN under the SEPA will not affect the rights or privileges of our existing shareholders, except that the economic and voting interests of\neach of our existing shareholders will be diluted as a result of any such issuance. Although the number of shares of our Common Stock that our existing shareholders own will not\ndecrease, the shares of our Common Stock owned by our existing shareholders will represent a smaller percentage of our total outstanding shares of our Common Stock after any\nsuch issuance of shares of our Common Stock to YA II PN under the SEPA. There are substantial risks to our shareholders as a result of the sale and issuance of Common Stock to\nYA II PN under the SEPA. See “Risk Factors.”\nConditions to Commencement and for Delivery of SEPA Advance Notices\nOur ability to deliver SEPA Advance Notices to YA II PN under the SEPA are subject to the satisfaction by us, of certain conditions, all of which are entirely outside of YA II PN’s\ncontrol, including, but not limited to, the following:\n● the accuracy in all material respects of our representations and warranties included in the SEPA on the date of the SEPA and the date of each closing of a purchase and\nsale under the SEPA of;\n● we having performed, satisfied and complied in all material respects with all covenants, agreements and conditions required by the SEPA to be performed, satisfied or\ncomplied with by us;\n● the registration statement that includes this prospectus (and amendment or supplement thereto) shall have been declared effective and remain effective for the offering\nand sale of the shares and (i) we shall not have received notice that the SEC has issued or intends to issue a stop order with respect to such registration statement or that\nthe SEC otherwise has suspended or withdrawn the effectiveness of such registration statement, either temporarily or permanently, or intends or has threatened to do so\nand (ii) no other suspension of the use of, or withdrawal of the effectiveness of, such registration statement or the prospectus shall exist. YA II PN shall not have received\nany notice from us that the registration statement, prospectus and/or any prospectus supplement or amendment thereto fails to meet the requirements of Section 5(b) or\nSection 10 of the Securities Act;\n● the number of shares then to be purchased by YA II PN shall not exceed the number of such shares that, when aggregated with all other shares of Common Stock then\nowned by YA II PN beneficially or deemed beneficially owned by YA II PN, would result in YA II PN owning more than the beneficial ownership limitation;\n● trading in the Common Stock shall not have been suspended by the SEC or the Nasdaq, or otherwise halted for any reason, and the Common Stock shall have been\napproved for listing or quotation on and shall not have been delisted from or no longer quoted on the Nasdaq.\n● the issuance of shares of Common Stock to YA II PN, including the Commitment Shares, shall not exceed 19.99% of the shares of the Common Stock outstanding\nimmediately prior to the execution of the SEPA, if applicable, subject to appropriate adjustment for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, rights offerings,\nreclassification or similar transaction that proportionately decreases or increases the Common Stock unless holders of a majority of our outstanding voting common stock\nthat are present or represented by proxy at a meeting, to effectuate the transactions contemplated by the SEPA;\n● the absence of any statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, ruling or injunction shall have been enacted, entered, promulgated or adopted by any court or\ngovernmental authority of competent jurisdiction that prohibits or directly and materially adversely affects any of the transactions contemplated by the SEPA and the\nexhibits thereto, and no proceeding shall have been commenced that may have the effect of prohibiting or materially adversely affecting any of the transactions\ncontemplated by the SEPA and the exhibits thereto;\n● the Common Stock must be DWAC Eligible and not subject to a “DTC chill”;\n● the issuance of the Advance Shares shall not violate the shareholder approval requirements of Nasdaq; and\n● all reports, schedules, registrations, forms, statements, information and other documents required to have been filed by us with the SEC pursuant to the reporting\nrequirements of the Exchange Act shall have been filed with the SEC.\n15\nTermination of the SEPA\nUnless earlier terminated as provided in the SEPA, the SEPA will terminate automatically on the earliest to occur of:\n● February 12, 2027; or\n● the date on which YA II PN shall have purchased Advance Shares for an aggregate purchase price of $5,000,000.\nNo Short-Selling or Hedging by YA II PN\nYA II PN has agreed that neither it nor any of its affiliates shall engage in any direct or indirect short-selling our Common Stock during any time prior to the termination of the\nSEPA.\nEffect of Performance of the SEPA on our Shareholders\nAll shares registered in this offering that may be issued or sold by us to YA II PN under the SEPA are expected to be freely tradable. The resale by YA II PN of a significant number\nof shares registered in this offering at any given time, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline and to be highly\nvolatile. Sales of our Common Stock to YA II PN, if any, will depend upon market conditions and other factors to be determined by us. We may ultimately decide to sell to YA II PN\nall, some or none of the additional shares of our Common Stock that may be available for us to sell pursuant to the SEPA. If and when we do sell shares to YA II PN, after YA II PN\nhas acquired the shares, YA II PN may resell all, some or none of those shares of Common Stock at any time or from time to time in its discretion. Therefore, sales to YA II PN by us\nunder the SEPA may result in substantial dilution to the interests of other holders of our Common Stock. In addition, if we sell a substantial number of shares to YA II PN under the\nSEPA, or if investors expect that we will do so, the actual sales of shares or the mere existence of our arrangement with YA II PN may make it more difficult for us to sell equity or\nequity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect such sales. However, we have the right to control the timing and amount of any\nadditional sales of Common Stock to YA II PN and the SEPA may be terminated by us at any time at our discretion without any cost to us, subject to certain conditions.\nPursuant to the terms of the SEPA, we have the right, but not the obligation, to direct YA II PN to purchase up to $5,000,000 of our Common Stock, subject to certain limitations. If\nwe elect to issue and sell to YA II PN under the SEPA more than the 1,670,844 shares of our Common Stock being registered for resale by YA II PN under this prospectus, which we\nhave the right, but not the obligation, to do, we must first register for resale under the Securities Act any such additional shares of our Common Stock, which could cause\nadditional substantial dilution to our shareholders. The number of shares of our Common Stock ultimately offered for sale by YA II PN is dependent upon the number of shares\npurchased by YA II PN under the SEPA.\nThe following table sets forth the amount of gross proceeds we would receive from YA II PN from our sale of shares of Common Stock to YA II PN under the SEPA at varying\npurchase prices:\nAssumed Number of Percentage of\nAverage Registered Shares to Outstanding Shares Gross Proceeds from\nPurchase Price be Issued if Full Issued After Giving the Sale of Shares to\nPer Share Purchase(1) Effect to the Issuance to YA II PN(2) YA II PN Under the SEPA\n$ 1.00 1,670,844 32.3% $ 1,670,844\n$ 1.50 1,670,844 32.3% $ 2,506,266\n$ 2.00 1,670,844 32.3% $ 3,341,688\n$ 2.50 1,670,844 32.3% $ 4,177,110\n$ 3.00(3) 1,666,667 32.2% $ 5,000,000\n$ 3.02 1,655,629 32.1% $ 5,000,000\n(1) Although the SEPA provides that we may sell up to $5,000,000 of our Common Stock to YA II PN, we are only registering 1,670,844 shares under this prospectus that we may\nissue and sell to YA II PN in the future under the SEPA, if and when we elect to sell shares of our Common Stock to YA II PN under the SEPA.\n(2) The denominator is based on 3,509,754 shares of our Common Stock outstanding as of September 26, 2024, plus the number of shares set forth in the adjacent column that we\nwould have issued or sold to YA II PN, assuming the average purchase price in the first column. The numerator is based on the number of shares of our Common Stock\nissuable under the SEPA (that are the subject of this offering) at the corresponding assumed average purchase price set forth in the first column. The denominator does not\nassume the issuance of any shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the May Note or exercise of the Warrant.\n(3) The closing price of our Common Stock on September 26, 2024.\n16\nTHE YA NOTE TRANSACTION\nOn May 20, 2024, we issued the May Note in the original principal amount of $800,000 and related Warrant to EF Hutton YA Fund, LP (the “EF Hutton Fund”), a fund co-managed\nby Yorkville Advisors Global, LLC. EF Hutton Fund paid a purchase price of $720,000 to us for the May Note and Warrant. In addition, we paid a $36,000 financial advisory fee paid\nto EF Hutton LLC. The May Note was subsequently assigned by the EF Hutton Fund to YA II PN effective on July 25, 2024.\nThe May Note accrues an interest at an annual rate of 0%, however, the interest rate will increase to an annual rate of 18% upon the occurrence of an event of default. Beginning\non August 15, 2024, and continuing on the same day of each successive calendar month thereafter, we are required to make installment payments on the May Note until it is fully\nrepaid or YA II PN has converted the outstanding balance into shares of Common Stock. We have failed to make the first two payments that were due on August 15, 2024 and\nSeptember 15, 2024, and thus the May Note is accruing interest at the default rate of 18%. At any time, subject to certain ownership limitations, YA II PN may convert any portion\nof the outstanding and unpaid principal, interest, or other amounts outstanding under the May Note into Common Stock at a price equal to $2.29 per share, as may be adjusted to a\nvariable price equal to 85% of the lowest daily VWAP during the ten trading days preceding conversion, but no lower than $1.00. In addition, the May Note grants us the right to\nredeem early a portion or all of the amount under the Promissory Note prior to its maturity or conversion at a 15% premium. The maturity date of the May Note is May 20, 2025\nalthough it may be extended at the option of YA II PN.\nThe Warrant is exercisable by YA II PN at any time after issuance until the date that is 60 months after the issuance date. The Warrant is exercisable into Warrant Shares at an\nexercise price of $2.29 per share, subject to adjustment as described in the Warrant. If a registration statement covering the resale of the Warrant Shares is not available by August\n15, 2024, then YA II PN may exercise the Warrant in whole or in part on a cashless basis.\nUnder the applicable Nasdaq rules, in no event may we issue to YA II PN under the May Note and/or the Warrant more than the Exchange Cap of 462,374 shares of our common\nstock representing 19.99% of the Common Stock outstanding as of May 20, 22024 (the “Exchange Cap”), unless we obtain stockholder approval to do so, or unless sales of\ncommon stock are made at a price equal to or greater than the Nasdaq minimum price, such that the Exchange Cap limitation would not apply under applicable Nasdaq rules. In any\nevent, the May Note specifically provides that we may not issue or sell any shares of our Common Stock under the May Note and/or the Warrant if such issuance or sale would\nbreach any applicable Nasdaq rules.\nPursuant to the May Note and the Warrant, we agreed to, at any time after July 15, 2024 and upon written notice from YA II PN, file a registration statement within 30 days of such\nnotice on Form S-3 or Form S-1 covering the resale by the Holder of Common Stock underlying the May Note and the Warrant. We are registering hereby 462,374 shares of\nCommon Stock underlying the May Note and the Warrant because that is equal to the maximum number of shares issuable pursuant to the Exchange Cap under the May Note.\nThe May Note contains customary representations and warranties for the benefit of YA II PN. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the May Note were\nmade only for purposes of the May Note and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreement and are subject to certain important limitations.\nAdditionally, while any amount remains outstanding on the May Note, we have agreed not to effect any transaction involving a Variable Rate Transaction (as defined in the May\nNote) and we granted YA II PN a right of first refusal on any financing transaction pursuant to which we propose to issue and sell our securities. YA II PN shall not have the right\nto convert any portion of the May Note to the extent that after giving effect to such conversion, YA II PN would beneficially own 4.99% of the number of Common Stock\noutstanding immediately after giving effect to such conversion or receipt of Common Stock as interest. The provisions of the 4.99% beneficial ownership limitation can be waived\nby YA II PN (but only as to itself) upon not less than 65 days prior notice to us.\nIssuances of our Common Stock to YA II PN under the May Note or the Warrant will not affect the rights or privileges of our existing shareholders, except that the economic and\nvoting interests of each of our existing shareholders will be diluted as a result of any such issuance. Although the number of shares of our Common Stock that our existing\nshareholders own will not decrease, the shares of our Common Stock owned by our existing shareholders will represent a smaller percentage of our total outstanding shares of our\nCommon Stock after any such issuance of shares of our Common Stock to YA II PN upon conversion of the May Note or exercise of the Warrant. There are substantial risks to our\nshareholders as a result of the sale and issuance of Common Stock to YA II PN under the May Note and the Warrant. See “Risk Factors.”\n17\nPRIVATE PLACEMENTS\nFrom February 29, 2024 through June 21, 2024, we closed on private placement transactions with four “accredited investors” (the “Investors”), as defined in Rule 501(a) of\nRegulation D under the Securities Act. In connection with the private placement transactions, we entered into securities subscription agreements (the “Subscription Agreements”)\nwith the Investors pursuant to which we offered and sold to the Investors a total of 826,264 shares (the “2024 Shares”) of our Common Stock at a purchase price of $2.25 per share\nfor 444,445 shares, $2.75 per share for 181,819 Shares, and $3.00 for 200,000 Shares, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $2.1 million.\nOn August 29, 2024, we issued the August Note in the original principal amount of $500,000, to Quen Inno Tech Co., Ltd. (the “Quen Inno Tech”). Quen Inno Tech paid a purchase\nprice of $500,000 to the Company for the August Note.\nThe August Note accrues interest at an annual rate of 0%; however, the interest rate will increase to an annual rate of 10% upon the occurrence of an event of default. Beginning\non August 21, 2025, and continuing on the same day of each successive calendar month thereafter, we are required to make installment payments on the August Note until it is\nfully repaid or Quen Inno Tech has converted the outstanding balance into shares of our Common Stock. At any time, subject to certain ownership limitations, Quen Inno Tech\nmay convert any portion of the outstanding and unpaid principal, interest, or other amounts outstanding under the August Note into Common Stock at a price equal to $3.36 per\nshare. In addition, the August Note grants us the right to redeem early a portion or all of the amount under the August Note prior to its maturity or conversion at a 15% premium.\nThe August Note contains customary representations and warranties for the benefit of Quen Inno Tech. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the August\nNote were made only for purposes of the August Note and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreement and are subject to certain important\nlimitations.\nIssuances of our Common Stock to Quen Inno Tech under the August Note will not affect the rights or privileges of our existing shareholders, except that the economic and voting\ninterests of each of our existing shareholders will be diluted as a result of any such issuance. Although the number of shares of our Common Stock that our existing shareholders\nown will not decrease, the shares of our Common Stock owned by our existing shareholders will represent a smaller percentage of our total outstanding shares of our Common\nStock after any such issuance of shares of our Common Stock to Quen Inno Tech upon conversion of the August Note. There are substantial risks to our shareholders as a result\nof the sale and issuance of Common Stock to Quen Inno Tech under the August Note. See “Risk Factors.”\n18\nUSE OF PROCEEDS\nThis prospectus relates to shares of Common Stock that may be offered and sold from time to time by the Selling Stockholders. We will not receive any proceeds from the resale of\nshares of Common Stock by the Selling Stockholders.\nWe may receive up to $5,000,000 in gross proceeds pursuant to the SEPA and up to $400,750 upon exercise of the Warrant. See “Plan of Distribution” elsewhere in this prospectus\nfor more information.\nWe intend to use any proceeds from YA II PN that we receive under the SEPA or the Warrant for working capital, strategic and general corporate purposes. We cannot specify\nwith certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds that we will have from the sale of our shares pursuant to the SEPA or the Warrant. Therefore, our management will have\nbroad discretion to determine the specific use for the net proceeds and we may use the proceeds for purposes that are not contemplated at the time of this offering.\nWe will incur all costs associated with this prospectus and the registration statement of which it is a part.\n19\nMARKET FOR COMMON STOCK AND DIVIDEND POLICY\nMarket Information and Number of Stockholders\nOur Common Stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “REBN.” The last reported closing price for our Common Stock on Nasdaq on September 26, 2024 was\n$3.02 per share.\nAs of September 26, 2024, there were 3,509,754 of our shares of common stock issued and outstanding held by approximately 196 stockholders of record. The number of record\nholders was determined from the records of our transfer agent and does not include beneficial owners of shares of common stock whose shares are held in the names of various\nsecurity brokers, dealers, and registered clearing agencies.\nDividend Policy\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and future earnings, if any, for the operation and\nexpansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination related to our dividend policy will be made\nat the discretion of our board of directors after considering our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business prospects and other factors the board of\ndirectors deems relevant, and subject to the restrictions contained in any financing instruments. Our ability to declare dividends may also be limited by restrictive covenants\npursuant to any other future debt financing agreements.\n20\nCAPITALIZATION\nThe following table sets forth our actual cash and cash equivalents and our capitalization as of June 30, 2024:\n● on an actual basis;\n● on an as adjusted basis to give effect to the events above and the issuance and sale of 1,538,462 shares of our Common Stock at an assumed Purchase Price to YA II PN\nof $3.25 per share.\nYou should read this information in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our consolidated financial\nstatements and related notes for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024, included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024, which\nis incorporated by reference herein.\nAs of June 30, 2024\n(unaudited)\n(in thousands) Actual As adjusted\nCash and Cash Equivalents: $ 617,051 $ 5,617,051\nTotal Current Liabilities: 3,711,482 3,711,482\nTotal Long-Term Liabilities: 4,274,836 4,274,836\nStockholders’ Equity (Deficit):\nCommon Stock - $0.0001 par value per share; 40,000,000 authorized shares; 3,235,657 shares issued and outstanding at June 30, 2024 324 477\nAdditional paid in capital 21,603,006 26,602,852\nAccumulated deficit (19,064,080) (19,064,080)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 3,438 3,438\nTotal stockholders’ equity 2,542,688 7,542,687\nThe as adjusted information discussed above is illustrative only.\nThe total number of shares of our Common Stock reflected in the discussion and table above is based on 3,235,657 shares outstanding as of June 30, 2024.\n21\nSECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT\nThe following table sets forth certain information regarding the ownership of our Common Stock as of September 26, 2024 (the “Determination Date”) by: (i) each current director of\nour company; (ii) each of our Named Executive Officers (“NEOs”); (iii) all current executive officers and directors of our company as a group; and (iv) all those known by us to be\nbeneficial owners of more than five percent (5%) of our Common Stock.\nBeneficial ownership and percentage ownership are determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC. Under these rules, beneficial ownership generally includes any shares as to\nwhich the individual or entity has sole or shared voting power or investment power and includes any shares that an individual or entity has the right to acquire beneficial\nownership of within 60 days of the Determination Date, through the exercise of any option, warrant or similar right (such instruments being deemed to be “presently exercisable”).\nIn computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, shares of our Common Stock that could be issued upon the\nexercise of presently exercisable options and warrants are considered to be outstanding. These shares, however, are not considered outstanding as of the Determination Date\nwhen computing the percentage ownership of each other person.\nTo our knowledge, except as indicated in the footnotes to the following table, and subject to state community property laws where applicable, all beneficial owners named in the\nfollowing table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares shown as beneficially owned by them. Percentage of ownership is based on 3,509,754 shares of\nCommon Stock outstanding as of the Determination Date. Unless otherwise indicated, the business address of each person in the table below is c/o Reborn Coffee Inc., 580 N.\nBerry St. Brea, CA 92821.

You should also refer to the text\nof our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws, which are filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is part.\nAuthorized and Outstanding Capital Stock\nThe total amount of our authorized share capital consists of 40,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value\n$0.0001 per share.\nCommon Stock\nHolders of shares of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters on which stockholders are entitled to vote generally, including the\nelection or removal of directors. The holders of our common stock do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors.\nHolders of shares of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends at the same rate when, as and if declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available therefor,\nsubject to any statutory or contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends and to the rights of the holders of one or more outstanding series of our preferred stock.\nUpon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, and after payment in full of all amounts required to be paid to creditors, the holders of shares of our common will be entitled to\nreceive pro rata our remaining assets available for distribution.\nAll shares of our common stock that are outstanding are fully paid and non-assessable. The common stock is be subject to further calls or assessments by us. Holders of shares of\nour common stock do not have preemptive, subscription, redemption or conversion rights. There will be no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock.\nThe rights, powers, preferences and privileges of holders of our common stock will be subject to those of the holders of any shares of our preferred stock or any other series or\nclass of stock we may authorize and issue in the future.\nNo shares of common stock are subject to redemption or have preemptive rights to purchase additional shares of common stock. Holders of shares of our common stock do not\nhave subscription, redemption or conversion rights. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock.\nAnti-Takeover Effects of Certain Provisions\nBecause our stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights, stockholders holding a majority of the voting power of our shares of common stock will be able to elect all our\ndirectors. A special meeting of stockholders may be called by a majority of our board of directors, the chair of our board of directors, or our chief executive officer. Our bylaws\nestablish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for\nelection to our board of directors.\nThis will make it more difficult for another party to obtain control of us by replacing our board of directors. Since our board of directors has the power to retain and discharge our\nofficers, these provisions could also make it more difficult for existing stockholders or another party to effect a change in management. This intended to preserve our existing\ncontrol structure following this offering, facilitate our continued product innovation and the risk-taking that it requires, permit us to continue to prioritize our long-term goals rather\nthan short-term results, enhance the likelihood of continued stability in the composition of our board of directors and its policies and to discourage certain types of transactions\nthat may involve an actual or threatened acquisition of us. These provisions are also designed to reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited acquisition proposal and to discourage\ncertain tactics that may be used in proxy fights. However, such provisions could have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares and may have the\neffect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying changes in our control or management. As a consequence, these provisions may also inhibit fluctuations in the market price of our\nstock that could result from actual or rumored takeover attempts.\n23\nWe are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested\nstockholder for a period of three years after the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder, subject to certain exceptions.\nExclusive Forum\nOur bylaws contain an exclusive forum provision providing that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for: (1) any derivative action or\nproceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by, or other wrongdoing by, any of our directors, officers, employees, agents\nor stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or (4)\nany action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. However, the exclusive forum provision states that it shall not apply to actions arising under the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nIn addition, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the\nSecurities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the\nSecurities Act or any other claim for which the federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with\nthe federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nAny person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to this provision included in\nour bylaws. The exclusive forum provision, if enforced, may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our\ndirectors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find the exclusive forum provision to be inapplicable or unenforceable\nin an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and growth prospects. For example, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware recently determined that a provision stating that U.S. federal\ndistrict courts are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act is not enforceable.\nCorporate Opportunities\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce any interest or expectancy in the business opportunities of our its officers, directors, agents, stockholders, members,\npartners, affiliates and subsidiaries and each such party shall not have any obligation to offer us those opportunities unless presented to one of our directors or officers in his or\nher capacity as a director or officer.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nOur transfer agent and registrar is Securities Transfer Corporation. The transfer agent’s address is 15500 Roosevelt Blvd, Suite 104, Clearwater, Florida 33760 and the telephone\nnumber is (469) 633-0101.\nListing\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “REBN”.\n24\nSELLING STOCKHOLDER\nThis prospectus relates to:\n● The resale of 890,920 shares of our currently outstanding Common Stock.\n● The issuance and resale of up to 2,282,028 shares of Common Stock issuable by us, consisting of (i) up to 1,670,844 shares of Common Stock that we may sell to YA II PN,\nfrom time to time at our sole discretion, pursuant to the SEPA; (ii) up to 462,374 shares of Common Stock issuable to YA II PN upon conversion of the May Note and/or\nexercise of the Warrant; and (iii) up to 148,810 shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the August Note.\nFor additional information regarding the shares of Common Stock included in this prospectus, see the section titled “The SEPA Transaction,” “The YA Note Transaction,” and\n“Private Placements” above. We are registering the shares of Common Stock included in this prospectus pursuant to the provisions of the SEPA, the Notes, the Warrant, and the\nSubscription Agreements in order to permit the Selling Stockholders to offer the shares for resale from time to time. Except for the transactions contemplated by the SEPA, the\nNotes, the Warrant, the Subscription Agreements and pursuant to a Pre-Paid Advance Agreement between us and YA II PN, whereby we were advanced $1,100,000 and YA II PN\nhas the right to us to sell shares to YA II PN pursuant to the terms of the Pre-Paid Advance Agreement, the Selling Stockholders have not had any material relationship with us\nwithin the past three years.\nThe table below presents information regarding the Selling Stockholders and the shares of Common Stock that may be resold by the Selling Stockholders from time to time under\nthis prospectus. This table is prepared based on information supplied to us by the Selling Stockholders, and reflects holdings as of September 26, 2024. The number of shares in\nthe column “Maximum Number of Shares of Common Stock to be Offered Pursuant to this Prospectus” represents all of the shares of Common Stock being offered for resale by the\nSelling Stockholders under this prospectus. The Selling Stockholders may sell some, all or none of the shares being offered for resale in this offering. We do not know how long\nthe Selling Stockholders will hold the shares before selling them, and we know of no existing arrangements between the Selling Stockholders or any other stockholder, broker,\ndealer, underwriter or agent relating to the sale or distribution of the shares of our Common Stock offered by this prospectus.\nBeneficial ownership is determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3(d) promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act, and includes shares of Common Stock with respect to which\nthe Selling Stockholders have voting power, including the power to vote or to direct the voting of such shares, and/or investment power, including the power to dispose or to\ndirect the disposition of such shares. The percentage of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Selling Stockholders prior to the offering shown in the table below is\nbased on an aggregate of 3,509,754 shares of our Common Stock outstanding on September 26, 2024.\nBecause the purchase price per share to be paid by YA II PN for the shares of Common Stock that we may, in our discretion, elect to sell to YA II PN from time to time after the date\nof this prospectus in purchases pursuant to the SEPA, if any, will fluctuate based on the market prices of our Common Stock at the times we elect to sell such shares to YA II PN in\npurchases under the SEPA, it is not possible for us to predict, as of the date of this prospectus and prior to any such purchases under the SEPA, the actual number of shares of\nCommon Stock that we will sell to YA II PN under the SEPA, which may be fewer than the number of shares of Common Stock being offered for resale by YA II PN under this\nprospectus. The fourth column assumes the resale by the Selling Stockholders of all of the shares of Common Stock being offered pursuant to this prospectus.\n25\nMaximum Number of\nNumber of Shares of Shares of Common Number of Shares of\nCommon Stock Stock to be Offered Common Stock\nOwned Prior to Offering Pursuant Owned After Offering\nName of Selling Stockholder Number(1) Percent(2) to this Prospectus Number(3) Percent(2)\nYA II PN, LTD (4) 164,760 4.7% 2,197,874 100,104 *\nLisa Lee(5) 181,819 5.2% 181,819 0 *\nCharles Chang Woo Jeong(6) 100,000 2.8% 100,000 0 *\nJames Chae(7) 100,000 2.8% 100,000 0 *\nQuen Inno Tech Co.

Furthermore, the purchases of the Common Stock are subject to certain agreed upon\nmaximum amount limitations set forth in the SEPA. Also, the SEPA, the Notes, and the Warrant prohibit us from issuing and selling any shares of our Common Stock to the\nSelling Stockholders to the extent such shares, when aggregated with all other shares of our Common Stock then beneficially owned by such Selling Stockholder, would cause\nsuch Selling Stockholder’s beneficial ownership of Common Stock to exceed the 4.99% beneficial ownership limitation. The beneficial ownership limitation may not be\namended or waived under the SEPA, the Notes, or the Warrant. Finally, The May Note also prohibits us from issuing or selling shares of our Common Stock under the May\nNote and/or the Warrant in excess of the 19.99% Exchange Cap, unless we obtain stockholder approval to do so, or unless sales of Common Stock are made at a price equal to\nor greater than the Nasdaq minimum price per share, such that the Exchange Cap limitation would not apply under applicable Nasdaq rules. The Exchange Cap (to the extent\napplicable under Nasdaq rules) may be not amended or waived under the May Note and/or the Warrant.\n(2) Applicable percentage ownership is based on 3,509,754 shares of our Common Stock outstanding as of September 26, 2024.\n(3) Assumes the sale of all shares being offered pursuant to this prospectus.\n(4) YA II PN, LTD, a Cayman Islands exempt limited partnership, is a fund managed by Yorkville Advisors Global, LP (“Yorkville LP”).

The composition and responsibilities of each of the committees of our board of directors\nare described below. Members serve on these committees until their resignation or until otherwise determined by our board of directors. Our board of directors may establish other\ncommittees as it deems necessary or appropriate from time to time.\nAudit Committee\nAs of the date of this filing, our audit committee consists of Farooq M.

The chair of our audit committee is Farooq M. Arjomand, who our board of directors has determined\nis an “audit committee financial expert” within the meaning of SEC regulations.

We encourage you to review all of the important information\ncontained in the proxy materials contained herein or accessed via our website before voting.\nSolicitation and Voting Procedures\nSolicitation. The s olicitation of proxies will be conducted by mail, and we will bear all attendant costs.\nThese costs will include the expense of preparing and mailing proxy materials for the Annual Meeting and\nreimbursements paid to brokerage firms and others for their expenses incurred in forwarding solicitation materials\nregarding the Annual Meeting to beneficial owners of our shares entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. We\nmay conduct further solicitation personally, telephonically, electronically or by facsimile through our officers,\ndirectors and regular employees, none of whom would receive additional compensation for assisting with the\nsolicitation. We do not intend, but reserve the right, to use the services of a third party solicitation firm to assist\nus in soliciting proxies.\nVoting. Stoc k holders of record may authorize the proxies named in the enclosed proxy cards to vote their\nshares in the following manner:\n• by mail, by marking the enclosed proxy card(s) applicable to you as the holder of shares of our\nCommon Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock”), signing and dating it, and returning it\nin the postage-paid envelope provided;\n• by telephone, using any touch-tone telephone to transmit your voting instructions by calling the\nnumber specified on your proxy card. Stockholders voting by telephone need not return the proxy\ncard(s) applicable to them as the holder of shares of our Common Stock; and\n• through the Internet, which we encourage if you have Internet access, at the address shown on your\nproxy card. Stockholders voting by the Internet need not return the proxy card(s) applicable to them\nas the holder of shares of our Common Stock.\nRevocability of Proxies. Any proxy given pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked by the person\ngiving it at any time before it is exercised in the same manner in which it was given, or by delivering to Stephan\nKim, the Chief Financial Officer of Reborn Coffee, Inc., at 580 N. Berry Street, Brea, CA 92821, a written notice of\nrevocation or a properly executed proxy bearing a later date, or by attending the Annual Meeting and giving\nnotice of your intention to vote in person.\nVoting Procedure. The p resence at the Annual Meeting of a majority of our outstanding shares of\nvoting stock entitled to vote and represented either in person or by proxy, will constitute a quorum for the\ntransaction of business at the Annual Meeting. The close of business on September 23, 2024, has been fixed as\nthe record date (the “Record Date”) for determining the holders of shares of our Common Stock entitled to notice\nof and to vote at the Annual Meeting. Each share of Common Stock outstanding on the Record Date is entitled\nto one vote on all matters.\n1\nAs of the Record Date, there were 2,683,490 shares of Common Stock outstanding, which shares were\nentitled to an aggregate of 2,683,490 votes at the Annual Meeting. Under Delaware law, stockholders will not\nhave appraisal or similar rights in connection with any proposal set forth in this Proxy Statement.\nVotes will be tabulated by the persons appointed by the Board of Directors to act as inspectors of election\nfor the Annual Meeting. Shares represented by a properly executed and delivered proxy will be voted at the\nAnnual Meeting and, when instructions have been given by the stockholder, will be voted in accordance with\nthose instructions. If no instructions are given, the shares will be voted FOR Proposal Nos. 1, 2, and 3 as\napplicable.\nAbstentions and broker non-votes will each be counted as present for the purpose of determining whether\na quorum is present at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the\noutcome of Proposal No. 1. Abstentions will have the effect of being cast “against” Proposal Nos. 2 and 3, but\nbroker non-votes will have no effect on such proposal.\nA broker non-vote occurs when a broker submits a proxy card with respect to shares of Common Stock\nheld in a fiduciary capacity (typically referred to as being held in “street name”), but declines to vote on a\nparticular matter because the broker has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner. If the\nbeneficial owner does not provide voting instructions, the broker or nominee can still vote the shares with\nrespect to matters that are considered to be “routine,” but not with respect to “non-routine” matters. In the event\nthat a broker, bank, or other agent indicates on a proxy that it does not have discretionary authority to vote\ncertain shares on a non-routine proposal, then those shares will be treated as broker non-votes. We believe that\nall proposals in this proxy statement, other than the ratification of the independent registered public accounting\nfirm (Proposal No. 2) are non-routine proposals; therefore, your broker, bank or other agent will only be entitled\nto vote on Proposal No. 2 at the Annual Meeting without your instructions.\nStockholders do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors.\nVote Required.\nFor the election of directors (Proposal No. 1), the nominees who receive a plurality of votes from the shares\npresent in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be elected.\nFor the approval of the ratification of our independent registered public accounting firm (Proposal No. 2),\nand the approval of the issuance of our shares of Common Stock to YA II PN, LTD. (“Yorkville”), pursuant to the\nConvertible Promissory Note (the “Note”) and related warrant (the “Warrant”) issued on May 20, 2024, in excess\nof the Exchange Cap (as defined in the Note) (Proposal No. 3), the vote of a majority of the shares present in\nperson or by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter at the Annual Meeting is required.\nIf any other matters are properly presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting, the persons named in\nthe enclosed proxy will have discretion to vote on those matters in accordance with their best judgment.\nHouseholding. Som e banks, brokers and other nominee record holders may be participating in the\npractice of “householding” proxy statements and annual reports. This means that only one copy of this Proxy\nStatement or our annual report may have been sent to multiple stockholders in your household. We will promptly\ndeliver a separate copy of either document to you if you call or write us at the following address or phone\nnumber: Reborn Coffee, Inc., 580 N.

Under these rules, beneficial ownership generally includes any shares as to which the individual or entity\nhas sole or shared voting power or investment power and includes any shares that an individual or entity has\nthe right to acquire beneficial ownership of within 60 days of the Determination Date, through the exercise of any\noption, warrant or similar right (such instruments being deemed to be “presently exercisable”). In computing the\nnumber of shares beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, shares of our\nCommon Stock that could be issued upon the exercise of presently exercisable options and warrants are\nconsidered to be outstanding. These shares, however, are not considered outstanding as of the Determination\nDate when computing the percentage ownership of each other person.\nTo our knowledge, except as indicated in the footnotes to the following table, and subject to state\ncommunity property laws where applicable, all beneficial owners named in the following table have sole voting\nand investment power with respect to all shares shown as beneficially owned by them. Percentage of ownership\nis based on 2,683,490 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the Determination Date. Unless otherwise\nindicated, the business address of each person in the table below is c/o Reborn Coffee, Inc., 580 N. Berry Street,\nBrea, CA 92821.

Unless otherwise indicated, voting and\ninvestment power relating to the shares shown in the table for our directors and executive officers is exercised solely\nby the beneficial owner or shared by the owner and the owner’s spouse or children.\nFrom time to time, the number of our shares held in the “street name” accounts of various securities\ndealers for the benefit of their clients or in centralized securities depositories may exceed 5% of the total shares\nof our Common Stock outstanding.\nBiographical Information Concerning Executive Officers\nBiographical information concerning our Chief Executive Officer, who also serves as a member of our\nBoard of Directors, is set forth above. Biographical information concerning our Chief Financial Officer is set forth\nbelow.\nStephan Kim is our Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Kim has served as our full-time Chief Financial Officer since\nJune 26, 2022. Prior to joining Reborn Coffee, Mr. Kim provided professional accounting and tax consulting\nservices for nearly 20 years to various clients in the consumer retail, healthcare, industrial manufacturing, and\ntechnology industries, including public accounting and tax consulting services under his own practice since\n2011.

Mr. Kim\ngraduated from Sogang University in South Korea with a B.A. in Sociology and Business in 2002 and earned a\nMaster’s degree in Professional Accountancy from Indiana University in 2005. Mr. Kim began his career in 2002\nas a banker with Shinhan Bank in South Korea. From 2005 to 2010, Mr. Kim was an Audit Manager at KPMG, Los\nAngeles office.\nDirector’s Qualifications\nIn selecting a particular candidate to serve on our Board of Directors, we consider the needs of our\nCompany based on particular experiences, qualifications, attributes and skills that we believe would be\nadvantageous for members of our Board of Directors to have and that would qualify such candidate to serve on\nour Board of Directors given our business profile and the environment in which we operate. The table below sets\nforth such experiences, qualifications, attributes and skills, and identifies the ones that each director nominee\npossess.\nFarooq M.\nAttributes Arjomand Jay Kim Sehan Kim Dennis Egidi Andy Nasim Jennifer Tan\nFinancial Experience x x x x x x\nPublic Board Experience x x\nIndustry Experience x x x x x\nScientific Experience x x\nCommercial Experience x x x x x x\nCorporate Governance\nExperience x x x x x x\nCapital Markets\nExperience x x x x x\nManagement Experience x x x x x x\nArrangements Regarding Director Nominations\nThere are no arrangements regarding the nomination of our directors.\nFamily Relationships\nThere are no familial relationships between any of our executive officers and directors.\nDirector or Officer Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings\nOur directors and executive officers were not involved in any legal proceedings as described in\nItem 401(f) of Regulation S-K in the past ten years.\nIndependence of the Board of Directors\nThe Board of Directors utilizes Nasdaq’s standards for determining the independence of its members. In\napplying these standards, the Board of Directors considers commercial, industrial, banking, consulting, legal,\naccounting, charitable and familial relationships, among others, in assessing the independence of directors, and\nmust disclose any basis for determining that a relationship is not material. The Board of Directors has determined\nthat the following four (4) director nominees, namely Farooq M. Arjomand, Sehan Kim, Andy Nasim, and Jennifer\nTan, are independent directors within the meaning of the Nasdaq independence standards. In making these\nindependence determinations, the Board of Directors did not exclude from consideration as immaterial any\nrelationship potentially compromising the independence of any of the above directors.\nMeetings of the Board of Directors\nThe Board of Directors held 4 meetings during our 2023 fiscal year. During our 2023 fiscal year, each\nmember of our Board of Directors attended more than 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board of\nDirectors that were held during the time that they served as members of the Board of Directors. We do not have\na formal policy regarding attendance by members of the Board of Directors at the annual meeting of\nstockholders, but we strongly encourage all members of the Board of Directors to attend our annual meetings\nand expect such attendance except in the event of extraordinary circumstances.\n7\nCommittees of the Board of Directors\nThe Board of Directors has established and currently maintains the following two standing committees: the\nAudit Committee and the Compensation Committee.\nCurrently, the Audit Committee consists of Farooq Arjomand (Chair), Andy Nasim and Sehan Kim, and the\nCompensation Committee consists of Andy Nasim (Chair), Farooq Arjomand and Sehan Kim. It is anticipated\nthat, following the Annual Meeting, the committee members will remain the same. During the 2023 fiscal year, the\nAudit Committee held 2 meeting and the Compensation Committee held 2 meeting. Each member of the Board of\nDirectors attended at least 75% of the meetings that were held during the periods when they served as members\nof such committee.\nAudit Committee. The A udit Committee provides assistance to the Board of Directors in fulfilling its\noversight responsibilities regarding the integrity of financial statements, our compliance with applicable legal\nand regulatory requirements, the integrity of our financial reporting processes including its systems of internal\naccounting and financial controls, the performance of our internal audit function and independent auditor and\nour financial policy matters by approving the services performed by our independent accountants and reviewing\ntheir reports regarding our accounting practices and systems of internal accounting controls. The Audit\nCommittee also oversees the audit efforts of our independent accountants and takes action as it deems\nnecessary to satisfy itself that the accountants are independent of management. Mr. Arjomand, Mr. Nasim, and\nMr. Sehan Kim meet the definition of “independent directors” for the purposes of serving on an Audit\nCommittee under applicable SEC and Nasdaq Stock Market rules, and we are in compliance with these\nindependence requirements. In addition, Mr. Arjomand qualifies as our “audit committee financial experts,” as\nsuch term is defined in Item 407 of Regulation S-K.\nIn general, an “audit committee financial expert” is an individual member of the audit committee or Board of\nDirectors who:\n• understands generally accepted accounting principles and financial statements;\n• is able to assess the general application of such principles in connection with accounting for\nestimates, accruals and reserves;\n• has experience preparing, auditing, analyzing or evaluating financial statements comparable to the\nbreadth and complexity to our financial statements;\n• understands internal controls over financial reporting; and\n• understands audit committee functions.\nOur Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for the Audit Committee, which is available on our\ncorporate website at https://www.reborncoffee.net/corporate-governance/governance-documents/.\nCompensation Committee. The C ompensation Committee oversees our overall compensation structure,\npolicies and programs, and assesses whether our compensation structure establishes appropriate incentives for\nofficers and employees. The Compensation Committee reviews and approves corporate goals and objectives\nrelevant to compensation of our chief executive officer and other executive officers, evaluates the performance of\nthese officers in light of those goals and objectives, sets the compensation of these officers based on such\nevaluations and reviews and recommends to the Board of Directors any employment-related agreements, any\nproposed severance arrangements or change in control or similar agreements with these officers. The\nCompensation Committee also grants stock options and other awards under our stock plans. The Compensation\nCommittee will review and self-evaluate, at least annually, the performance of the Compensation Committee and\nits members and the adequacy of the charter of the Compensation Committee.\nOur Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for the Compensation Committee, which is available\nat https://www.reborncoffee.net/corporate-governance/governance-documents/.\nSelection of Board Candidates\nOur Board of Directors does not have a nominating committee that nominates candidates for election to\nour Board of Directors. That function is performed by our Board of Directors. Each member of our Board of\nDirectors participates in the consideration of director nominees. Our Board of Directors believes that it can\nadequately fulfill\n8\nthe functions of a nominating committee without having to appoint an additional committee to perform that\nfunction. Our Board of Directors believes that not having a separate nominating committee saves the\nadministrative expense that would be incurred in maintaining such a committee, and saves time for directors who\nwould serve on a nominating committee if it were established. As there is no nominating committee, there is no\nnominating committee charter.\nAt least a majority of our independent directors participate in the consideration of director nominees.\nThese directors are independent, as independence for nominating committee members is defined in the Nasdaq\nlisting standards. After discussion and evaluation of potential nominees, the full Board of Directors selects the\ndirector nominees.\nIn selecting candidates for the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors begins by determining whether\nthe incumbent directors whose terms expire at the annual meeting of stockholders desire and are qualified to\ncontinue their service on the Board of Directors. If there are positions on the Board of Directors for which the\nBoard of Directors will not be re-nominating an incumbent director, or if there is a vacancy on the Board of\nDirectors, the Board of Directors will solicit recommendations for nominees from persons whom the Board\nbelieves are likely to be familiar with qualified candidates, including members of our Board of Directors and our\nsenior management. The Board of Directors may also engage a search firm to assist in the identification of\nqualified candidates. The Board of Directors will review and evaluate those candidates whom it believes merit\nserious consideration, taking into account all available information concerning the candidate, the existing\ncomposition and mix of talent and expertise on the Board of Directors and other factors that it deems relevant. In\nconducting its review and evaluation, the Board of Directors may solicit the views of management and other\nmembers of the Board of Directors, and may conduct interviews of proposed candidates.\nThe Board of Directors generally requires that all candidates for the Board of Directors be of the highest\npersonal and professional integrity and have demonstrated exceptional ability and judgment. The Board of\nDirectors will consider whether such candidate will be effective, in conjunction with the other members of the\nBoard of Directors, in collectively serving the long-term interests of our stockholders. In addition, the Board of\nDirectors requires that all candidates have no interests that materially conflict with our interests and those of our\nstockholders, have meaningful management, advisory or policy making experience, have a general appreciation\nof the major business issues facing us and have adequate time to devote to service on the Board of Directors.\nThe Board of Directors will consider stockholder recommendations for nominees to fill director positions,\nprovided that the Board of Directors will not entertain stockholder nominations from stockholders who do not\nmeet the eligibility criteria for submission of stockholder proposals under Rule 14a-8 of Regulation 14A under the\nExchange Act. Stockholders may submit written recommendations for nominees to the Board of Directors,\ntogether with appropriate biographical information and qualifications of such nominees as required by our\nBylaws, to our Secretary following the same procedures as described in “Stockholder Communications” in this\nProxy Statement. In order for a nominee for directorship submitted by a stockholder to be considered, such\nrecommendation must be received by the Secretary by the time period set forth in our most recent proxy\nstatement for the submission of stockholder proposals under Rule 14a-8 of Regulation 14A under the\nExchange Act. The Secretary shall then deliver any such communications to the Chairman of the Board of\nDirectors. The Board of Directors will evaluate stockholder recommendations for candidates for the Board of\nDirectors using the same criteria as for other candidates, except that the Board of Directors may consider, as one\nof the factors in its evaluation of stockholder recommended candidates, the size and duration of the interest of\nthe recommending stockholder or stockholder group in our equity.\nBoard Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight\nThe Board of Directors is committed to promoting our effective independent governance. Our Board of\nDirectors believes it is in the best interests of the stockholders and the company for the Board of Directors to\nhave the flexibility to select the best director to serve as chairman at any given time, regardless of whether that\ndirector is an independent director or the chief executive officer. Consequently, we do not have a policy\ngoverning whether the roles of chairman of the board and chief executive officer should be separate or\ncombined. This decision is made by our Board of Directors, based on the best interests of the company\nconsidering the circumstances at the time.\nThe leadership structure of the Board of Directors currently consists of a Chairman of the Board of\nDirectors who oversees the Board of Directors meetings and a Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors. We\ncurrently have two different people holding the roles of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive\nOfficer in recognition of the differences between the two roles. Our Board of Directors believes this division of\nresponsibility is an effective\n9\napproach for addressing the risks we face and increasing management accountability and improving the ability\nof the board to monitor whether management’s actions are in the best interests of the company and its\nstockholders. We have determined that the leadership structure of our Board of Directors has permitted our\nBoard of Directors to fulfill its duties effectively and efficiently and is appropriate given the size and scope of our\ncompany and its financial condition.\nOur Board of Directors and the Audit Committee thereof is responsible for overseeing the risk management\nprocesses on behalf of our company. The Board of Directors and, to the extent applicable, the Audit Committee,\nreceive and review periodic reports from management, auditors, legal counsel and others, as considered\nappropriate regarding our company’s assessment of risks. Where applicable, the Audit Committee reports\nregularly to the full Board of Directors with respect to risk management processes. The Audit Committee and the\nfull Board of Directors focus on the most significant risks facing our company and our company’s general risk\nmanagement strategy, and also ensure that risks undertaken by our company are consistent with the Board of\nDirector’s appetite for risk. While the Board of Directors oversees the risk management of our company,\nmanagement is responsible for day-to-day risk management processes. We believe this division of\nresponsibilities is the most effective approach for addressing the risks facing our company and that our Board of\nDirectors leadership structure supports this approach.\nStockholder Communications\nAll stockholder communications must: (i) be addressed to our Secretary or Board of Directors at our\naddress; (ii) be in writing in print and delivered in person or by first class United States mail postage prepaid or\nby reputable overnight delivery service; (iii) be signed by the stockholder sending the communication;\n(iv) indicate whether the communication is intended for the entire Board of Directors, a committee thereof, or the\nindependent directors; (v) if the communication relates to a stockholder proposal or director nominee, the name\nand address of the stockholder, the class and number of shares held by the stockholder, a description of any\nagreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to the nomination or other business between or among\nsuch stockholder or beneficial owner and any other person, including without limitation any agreements that\nwould be required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 5 or Item 6 of Exchange Act Schedule 13D (regardless of\nwhether the requirement to file a Schedule 13D is applicable to the stockholder or beneficial owner) and a\ndescription of any agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any derivative or short positions, profit\ninterests, options, hedging transactions, and borrowed or loaned shares) that has been entered into as of the\ndate of the stockholder’s notice by, or on behalf of, such stockholder or beneficial owner, the effect or intent of\nwhich is to mitigate loss, manage risk or benefit from changes in the share price of any class of our capital stock,\nor maintain, increase or decrease the voting power of the stockholder or beneficial owner with respect to shares\nof our stock; provided that we will not entertain stockholder proposals or stockholder nominations from\nstockholders who do not meet the eligibility and procedural criteria for submission of stockholder proposals\nunder Rule 14a-8 of Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act; and (vi) if the communication relates to a director\nnominee being recommended by the stockholder, must include all other information as required by our Bylaws,\nincluding without limitation, appropriate biographical information of the candidate.\nUpon receipt of a stockholder communication that is compliant with the requirements identified above, the\nSecretary shall promptly deliver such communication to the appropriate member(s) of the Board of Directors or\ncommittee member(s) identified by the stockholder as the intended recipient of such communication by\nforwarding the communication to either the chairman of the Board of Directors with a copy to the Chief Executive\nOfficer, the chairman of the applicable committee, or to each of the independent directors, as the case may be.\nThe Chief Executive Officer may, in his sole discretion and acting in good faith, provide copies of any such\nstockholder communication to any one or more of our directors and executive officers, except that in processing\nany stockholder communication addressed to the independent directors, the Chief Executive Officer may not\ncopy any member of management in forwarding such communications. In addition, the Chief Executive Officer\nmay, in his sole discretion and acting in good faith, not forward certain items if they are deemed of a commercial\nor frivolous nature or otherwise inappropriate for consideration by the intended recipient and any such\ncorrespondence may be forwarded elsewhere in our company for review and possible response.\n10\nCERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nPolicies and Procedures for Related Person Transactions\nOur Board of Directors has adopted a written related person transaction policy, which sets forth the\npolicies and procedures for the review and approval or ratification of related party transactions. This policy is\nadministrated by our Audit Committee. These policies provide that, in determining whether or not to recommend\nthe initial approval or ratification of a related party transaction, the relevant facts and circumstances available\nshall be considered, including, among other factors it deems appropriate, whether the interested transaction is on\nterms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar\ncircumstances and the extent of the related party’s interest in the transaction.\nRelated Party Transactions\nOther than compensation arrangements for our directors and executive officers, which are described\nelsewhere in this proxy statement, below we describe transactions since January 1, 2021 to which we were a party\nor will be a party, in which:\n• the amounts involved exceeded or will exceed $120,000; and\n• any of our directors, executive officers or holders of more than 5% of our capital stock, or any\nmember of the immediate family of, or person sharing the household with, the foregoing persons\n(each, a “related party” and collectively, “related parties”), had or will have a direct or indirect\nmaterial interest, other than equity and other compensation, termination, change in control and other\narrangements, which are described under the section titled “Executive and Director Compensation.”\nWe had the following related party transactions:\n• Loan Payable to Director (December 2016 — $1,489,809 non-bearing interest loan) — On\nDecember 2016, we received a non-bearing interest loan from Farooq Arjomand, the Chairman of our\nBoard of Directors.

In\nSeptember 2021, this note was converted into 9,000 shares of Common Stock.\n• Loan Payable to Director (May 2022 — $150,000 loan bearing 5% interest) — In May 2022, we\nentered into a convertible note agreement with an entity controlled by Dennis Egidi, a member of our\nBoard of Directors, for a period of up to one year from the date of the note. In connection with our\ninitial public offering, the note was converted into shares of Common Stock at a conversion rate\ndetermined by our valuation and capitalization at the time of the initial public offering.\n• Loan Payable to Director (June 2023 — $1,000,000 loan bearing a variable interest rate) — In\nJune 2022, we entered into a debt agreement with an entity controlled by Dennis Egidi, a member of\nour Board of Directors.

BCRG has served as our independent registered public accounting\nfirm since May 14, 2024.\nDuring our two most recent fiscal years and the subsequent interim period through May 14, 2024, neither\nwe nor anyone on our behalf consulted with BCRG regarding (i) the application of accounting principles to a\nspecified transaction, either completed or proposed; or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our\nfinancial statements, and neither a written report nor oral advice was provided that BCRG concluded was an\nimportant factor considered by us in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting\nissue; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of\nRegulation S-K and its related instructions) or a reportable event (as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of\nRegulation S-K).\nWe are not required to seek stockholder approval for the appointment of BCRG, however, the Audit\nCommittee and the full Board of Directors believe it is sound corporate practice to seek such approval. If the\nappointment is not ratified, the Audit Committee will investigate the reasons for stockholder rejection and will re-\nconsider the appointment. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may direct the\nappointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it\ndetermines that such change would be in the best interests of us and our stockholders.\nRepresentatives of BCRG are not expected to be present at the Annual Meeting. However, we will provide\ncontact information for BCRG to any stockholders who would like to contact the firm with questions.\nPrior Audit Firms\nKreit & Chiu CPA LLP (“K&C”) (formerly known as Paris, Kreit & Chiu CPA LLP) served as our\nindependent registered public accounting firm from 2020 to May 1, 2023. At such time, we amicably terminated\nthe engagement of K&C, and such termination was approved by our Board of Directors and Audit Committee.\nThe reports of K&C on our financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021\ndid not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to\nuncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, with the exception of providing a qualification as to our ability\nto continue as a going concern. During our two most recent fiscal years and the subsequent interim period\nthrough May 1, 2023, there were no disagreements with K&C on any matter of accounting principles or practices,\nfinancial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreement(s), if not resolved to the\nsatisfaction of K&C, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement(s) in\nconnection with its report. During our two most recent fiscal years and the subsequent interim period through\nMay 1, 2023, there were no reportable events of the type described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.\nBF Borgers CPA PC (“BF Borgers”) served as our independent registered accounting public firm from\nMay 1, 2023 to May 7, 2024. At such time, we terminated the engagement of BF Borgers following the SEC’s\norder declaring that BF Borgers is not permitted to appear or practice before the SEC for reasons described in the\nSEC’s Order Instituting Public Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8A of the\nSecurities Act of 1933, Sections 4C and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 102(e) of the SEC’s\nRules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order, dated\nMay 3, 2024. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and the subsequent interim period through May 7,\n2024, there were no disagreements, as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K, with BF\nBorgers on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or\nprocedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to BF Borgers’ satisfaction, would have caused BF Borgers to\nmake reference to such disagreements in its audit reports. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and\nthe subsequent interim period through May 7, 2024, there were no reportable events within the meaning of\nItem 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.\n12\nFees Billed to the Company in fiscal years 2023 and 2022\nThe following table sets forth the fees billed to us by our former principal auditor, K&C, for professional\nservices rendered during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and our former principal auditor, BF Borgers,\nfor professional services rendered during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023:\n31-Dec-23 31-Dec-22\nAudit fees(1) $ 85,000 $ 60,000\nAudit related fees(2) — —\nTax fees(3) — —\nAll other fees — —\nTotal fees $ 85,000 $ 60,000\n____________\n(1) Audit Fees — Audit fees consist of fees billed for the audit of our annual financial statements and the review of the\ninterim consolidated financial statements.\n(2) Audit-Related Fees — These consisted principally of the aggregate fees related to audits that are not included Audit\nFees.\n(3) Tax Fees — Tax fees consist of aggregate fees for tax compliance and tax advice, including the review and preparation\nof our various jurisdictions’ income tax returns.\nNo fees have yet been billed by our current principal auditor, BCRG.\nPre-Approval Policies and Procedures\nThe Audit Committee has the authority to appoint or replace our independent registered public accounting\nfirm (subject, if applicable, to stockholder ratification). The Audit Committee is also responsible for the\ncompensation and oversight of the work of the independent registered public accounting firm (including\nresolution of disagreements between management and the independent registered public accounting firm\nregarding financial reporting) for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or related work. The\nindependent registered public accounting firm was engaged by, and reports directly to, the Audit Committee.\nThe Audit Committee pre-approves all audit services and permitted non-audit services (including the fees\nand terms thereof) to be performed for us by our independent registered public accounting firm, subject to the de\nminimis exceptions for non-audit services described in Section 10A(i)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rule 2-01(c)\n(7)(i)(C) of Regulation S-X, provided that all such excepted services are subsequently approved prior to the\ncompletion of the audit. We have complied with the procedures set forth above, and the Audit Committee has\notherwise complied with the provisions of its charter.\nVote Required and Board of Directors’ Recommendation\nAssuming a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present at the Annual\nMeeting and entitled to vote, either in person or by proxy, is required for approval of Proposal No. 2.

The Note was subsequently assigned by the EF Hutton Fund to Yorkville effective on July 25, 2024.\nThe Note accrues interest at an annual rate of 0%, however, the interest rate will increase to an annual rate\nof 18% upon the occurrence of an event of default. Beginning on August 15, 2024, and continuing on the\nsame day of each successive calendar month thereafter, we are required to make installment payments on the\nNote until it is fully repaid or Yorkville has converted the outstanding balance into shares of Common Stock. We\nhave failed to make the first payment that was due on August 15, 2024, and thus the May Note is accruing\ninterest at the default rate of 18%. At any time, subject to certain ownership limitations, Yorkville may convert\nany portion of the outstanding and unpaid principal, interest, or other amounts outstanding under the Note into\nCommon Stock at a price equal to $2.29 per share (as may be reduced to a variable price equal to 85% of the\nlowest daily VWAP during the ten (10) consecutive trading days immediately preceding a conversion, but not be\nlower than $1.00 per share). In addition, the Note grants us the right to redeem early a portion or all of the amount\nunder the Note prior to its maturity or conversion at a 15% premium. The maturity date of the Note is May 20,\n2025 although it may be extended at the option of Yorkville.\nThe Warrant is exercisable by Yorkville at any time after issuance until the date that is 60 months after the\nissuance date. The Warrant is exercisable into Warrant Shares at an exercise price of $2.29 per share, subject to\nadjustment as described in the Warrant. If a registration statement covering the resale of the Warrant Shares is\nnot available by August 15, 2024, then Yorkville may exercise the Warrant in whole or in part on a cashless basis.\nPursuant to the Note, we agreed to, at any time after July 15, 2024 and upon written notice from Yorkville,\nfile a registration statement within 30 days of such notice on Form S-3 or Form S-1 covering the resale by\nYorkville of Common Stock underlying the Note.\nThe Note contains customary representations and warranties for the benefit of Yorkville. The\nrepresentations, warranties and covenants contained in the Note were made only for purposes of the Note and\nas of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreement and are subject to certain\nimportant limitations. Additionally, while any amount remains outstanding on the Note, we have agreed not to\neffect any transaction involving a Variable Rate Transaction (as defined in the Note) and we granted Yorkville a\nright of first refusal on any financing transaction pursuant to which we propose to issue and sell our securities.\nYorkville does not have the right to convert any portion of the Note to the extent that after giving effect to such\nconversion, Yorkville would beneficially own 4.99% of the number of Common Stock outstanding immediately\nafter giving effect to such conversion or receipt of Common Stock as interest. The provisions of the 4.99%\nbeneficial ownership limitation can be waived by Yorkville (but only as to itself) upon not less than 65 days prior\nnotice to us.\n14\nReasons for Proposal No. 3\nOur Board of Directors has determined that the Note, the Warrant, and our ability to issue Common Stock\nto Yorkville pursuant to the Note and/or the Warrant is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders\nbecause the Note and Warrant provided us with capital in exchange for the issuance of equity. Accordingly, we\nare seeking shareholder approval of Proposal No. 3 in order to comply with the terms of the Note, the Warrant,\nand Listing Rule 5635(d).\nListing Rule 5635(d) requires stockholder approval in connection with a transaction, other than a public\noffering, involving the sale or issuance by the issuer of Common Stock (or securities convertible into or\nexchangeable for Common Stock) equal to 20% or more of the Common Stock or 20% or more of the voting power\nof such company outstanding before the issuance for a price that is less than the lower of: (i) the closing price of\nthe Common Stock immediately preceding the signing of the binding agreement for the issuance of such\nsecurities and (ii) the average closing price of the Common Stock for the five trading days immediately preceding\nthe signing of the binding agreement for the issuance of such securities.\nTherefore, we are seeking stockholder approval to issue more than 20% of our outstanding Common Stock\nto Yorkville pursuant to the Note and/or the Warrant in compliance with Listing Rule 5635(d). In addition, we are\nseeking stockholder approval for waiver of the “Exchange Cap” limitation in the Note.\nPotential Consequences if Proposal No. 3 is Not Approved\nIf the shareholders do not approve Proposal No. 3, we will be unable to issue shares of Common Stock in\nexcess of the Exchange Cap to Yorkville upon the receipt of a notice of conversion pursuant to the Note or\nnotice of exercise of the Warrant, thereby requiring us to repay the Note in cash at its maturity. Accordingly, if\nshareholder approval of Proposal No. 3 is not obtained, we may need to seek alternative sources of financing,\nwhich financing may not be available on advantageous terms, or at all, and which may result in the incurrence of\nadditional transaction expenses. Our ability to successfully implement our business plans and ultimately\ngenerate value for our shareholders is dependent on our ability to maximize capital raising opportunities.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Proposal No. 3\nEach share of Common Stock that would be issuable to Yorkville would have the same rights and\nprivileges as each of our currently outstanding shares of Common Stock. The issuance of Common Stock to\nYorkville pursuant to the terms of the Note and the Warrant will not affect the rights of the holders of our\noutstanding shares of Common Stock, but such issuances will have a dilutive effect on our existing\nshareholders, including the voting power and economic rights of existing shareholders, and may result in a\ndecline in our stock price or greater price volatility. Further, any sales in the public market of our Common Stock\nissuable to Yorkville could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Common Stock.\nInterests of Directors and Executive Officers\nOur directors and executive officers have no substantial interests, directly or indirectly, in the matters set\nforth in this Proposal No. 3 except to the extent of their ownership of shares of our Common Stock.\nVote Required and Board of Directors’ Recommendation\nAssuming a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present at the Annual\nMeeting, either in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote, is required for approval of this Proposal No. 3. For\npurposes of the approval of Proposal No. 3, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against this proposal,\nand broker non-votes, if any, will have no effect on the result of the vote.\nTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS\nVOTE “FOR” PROPOSAL NO. 3.\n15\nREPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, on behalf of the Board of Directors, serves as an\nindependent and objective party to monitor and provide general oversight of the integrity of our financial\nstatements, the independent registered public accounting firm’s qualifications and independence, the\nperformance of the independent registered public accounting firm, the compliance by us with legal and\nregulatory requirements and our standards of business conduct. The Audit Committee performs these oversight\nresponsibilities in accordance with its Audit Committee Charter.\nOur management is responsible for preparing our financial statements and our financial reporting process.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an independent audit of our\nconsolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board (“PCAOB”). The Audit Committee’s responsibility is to administer and oversee these\nprocesses.\nHowever, the members of the Audit Committee are not practicing certified public accountants or\nprofessional auditors and rely, without independent verification, on information provided to them and on the\nrepresentations made by management, and on the report issued by the independent registered public accounting\nfirm.\nThe Audit Committee met with the independent registered public accounting firm, with and without\nmanagement present, to discuss the audit plan, the results of their examinations, and the overall quality of our\nfinancial reporting.\nIn this context, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023 with management and with the independent registered public accounting firm. The\nAudit Committee has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to\nbe discussed by Auditing Standard No. 16, Communications with Audit Committees, which includes, among\nother items, matters related to the conduct of the audit of our annual financial statements.\nThe Audit Committee has also received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent\nregistered public accounting firm required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent\naccountant’s communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the\nindependent registered public accounting firm the issue of its independence from us and management. In\naddition, the Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of any non-audit services by the\nindependent registered public accounting firm in the year ended December 31, 2023 is compatible with\nmaintaining the registered public accounting firm’s independence and has concluded that it is.\nBased on its review of the audited financial statements and the various discussions noted above, the\nAudit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as amended by Form 10-K/A filed on July 8,\n2024 and Form 10-K/A filed on August 15, 2024.\nRespectfully,\nFarooq M. Arjomand, Chairman\nSehan Kim\nAndy Nasim\nThe foregoing Audit Committee Report does not constitute soliciting material and shall not be deemed\nfiled or incorporated by reference into any of our filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except to the extent we specifically incorporate this Audit\nCommittee Report by reference therein.\n16\nEXECUTIVE AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION\nSummary Compensation Table\nThe following information is related to all plan and non-plan compensation awarded to, earned by, or paid\nby us for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 for all individuals serving as our principal\nexecutive officer or acting in a similar capacity during the year ended December 31, 2023, and our two most\ncompensated executive officers, other than the principal executive officer, serving at December 31, 2023 whose\ntotal compensation exceeded $100,000 (the “NEO”).\n(a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) (h) (i) (j)\nNon-equity Nonqualified\nIncentive deferred\nStock Option plan compensation All other\nName and Principal Position Year Salary Bonus Awards Awards compensation earnings compensation Total\n($) ($) ($) ($) ($) ($) ($) ($)\nJay Kim, 2023 150,000 — — — — — — 150,000\nChief Executive Officer\nStephan Kim, 2023 144,000 — — — — — — 144,000\nChief Financial Officer\nJay Kim, 2022 144,000 200,000 — — — — — 344,000\nChief Executive Officer\nStephan Kim, 2022 83,000 — 56,000 — — — — 139,000\nChief Financial Officer\nNarrative to Summary Compensation Table\nEmployment Agreements\nEffective July 27, 2022, we executed an employment agreement with Stephan Kim for Mr. Kim to serve as\nour full time Chief Financial Officer, effective immediately. Mr. Kim shall receive a monthly payment of $12,000\n($144,000 annually) as compensation for his services, and we granted $56,000 worth of restricted stock units\n(RSUs), which vested 3 months after employment and can be sold after one year. The employment agreement is\nan at-will agreement and is terminable by either party at any time.\nExcept as set forth above we do not currently have employment agreements with any of our NEOs.\nPerformance-Based Bonus\nTo incentivize management to drive strong operating performance and reward achievement of our\ncompany’s business goals, our executive compensation program includes performance-based bonuses for\nNEOs. Our Compensation Committee has established annual target performance-based bonuses for each NEO\nduring the first quarter of the fiscal year.\nOutstanding Equity Awards at the Year End\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were no outstanding equity awards for each of the NEOs.\nPayments Upon Termination or Change in Control\nNone of our NEOs are entitled to receive payments or other benefits upon termination of employment or a\nchange in control.\nRetirement Plans\nWe do not maintain any deferred compensation, retirement, pension or profit-sharing plans.\n17\nEmployee Benefits\nAll of our full-time employees are eligible to participate in health and welfare plans maintained by us,\nincluding:\n• medical, dental and vision benefits; and\n• basic life and accidental death & dismemberment insurance.\nOur NEOs participate in these plans on the same basis as other eligible employees. We do not maintain\nany supplemental health and welfare plans for our NEOs.\nNonqualified Deferred Compensation\nOur NEOs did not earn any nonqualified deferred compensation benefits from us during the years 2022 and\n2023.\nDirector Compensation\nOur non-employee directors did not receive any compensation for serving as a member of our Board of\nDirectors during the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nPay Versus Performance Table\nAs required by Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the\nrelationship between executive compensation actually paid and certain financial performance of the company.\nWe are permitted to report as a “smaller reporting company” as defined under the U.S. federal securities laws.\nAccordingly, we have not included a tabular list of financial performance measures, and the table below does not\ninclude a column for a “Company-Selected Measure” as defined in Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K.\nAverage Value of\nSummary initial fixed\nCompensation $100\nTable Total for Average Investment\nSummary non-PEO Compensation Based on\nCompensation Compensation Named Actually Paid Total Net (Loss)\nTable Total for Actually Paid Executive to Non-PEO Shareholder Income(6)\nYear PEO(1) to PEO(2) Officers(3) NEOs(4) Return(5) (in thousands)\n($) ($) ($) ($) ($) ($)\n2023 150,000 150,000 144,000 144,000 (88.13) (3,600)\n2022 344,000 344,000 139,000 183,800 (82.91) (3,555)\n____________\n(1) Represent the amounts of total compensation reported for our Principal Executive Officer (“PEO”), Jay Kim, during\neach corresponding year in the “Total” column of the Summary Compensation Table above.\n(2) Represents the amount of “compensation actually paid” to our PEO, as computed in accordance with Item 402(v) of\nRegulation S-K, with no adjustments because no equity compensation was paid to our PEO.\n(3) Represents the average of the amounts reported for our NEOs as a group (excluding our PEO) (“non-PEO NEOs”) in\neach applicable year in the “Total” column of the Summary Compensation Table above. In the fiscal year ending\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the only non-PEO NEO was Stephan Kim.\n(4) Represents the average amount of “compensation actually paid” to the Non-PEO NEOs, as computed in accordance\nwith Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K. The dollar amounts do not reflect the actual average compensation earned or paid\nto the Non-PEO NEOs during the applicable year. To calculate the average compensation actually paid, as determined\nin accordance with SEC rules, to the Non-PEO NEOs in 2022, the average of the Summary Compensation Table total\nfor the Non-PEO NEOs is adjusted to reflect the changes in the value of equity awards, described in the following:\n(1) $56,000 was deducted from the total, representing the amount reported in the Stock Awards column of the\nSummary Compensation Table; and (2) $100,800 was added representing the fair value of the equity awards granted\nin 2022 that vested in 2022.\n(5) Total Share Return (TSR) is calculated by dividing the difference between our share price at the end and the beginning\nof the measurement period by our share price at the end of the measurement period and is determined based on the\nvalue of an initial fixed investment of $100 in our Common Stock at the beginning of the measurement period. No\ndividends were paid in 2023 or 2022. The calculation of TSR included in this column is based on a measurement\nperiod beginning on August 12, 2022, the day our Common Stock began trading on Nasdaq.\n(6) The dollar amounts reported represent the amount of net loss reflected in our consolidated audited financial\nstatements for the applicable years.\n18\nNarrative Disclosure to Pay Versus Performance Table\nOur Compensation Committee believes the PEO’s base salary reflects the value of the executive position\nand attributes the PEO brings to the company, including tenure, experience, skill level and performance. No\nspecific weights have been assigned to those factors. The Compensation Committee periodically reviews the\nsalaries of the PEO and NEOs and adjusts them as needed to maintain market positioning and consistency with\nother similarly situated executive officers and their evolving responsibilities.\nBonus payments when made have not been tied to any financial performance measure and have been and\nare planned to continue to be discretionary based on the evaluation of each individual’s performance, change in\nresponsibilities, their potential to contribute to the success of the company, and the performance of the\ncompany.\n19\nSUBMISSION OF STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS\nOur Bylaws require advance notice of any proposal by a stockholder intended to be presented at an\nannual meeting that is not included in our notice of annual meeting and proxy statement because it was not\ntimely submitted under the following paragraph, or made by or at the direction of any member of the Board of\nDirectors, including any proposal for the nomination for election as a director. To be considered for such\npresentation at this Annual Meeting, because the Annual Meeting is being held more than 30 days before the\nanniversary date of the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, we filed a Current Report on Form 8-K on\nSeptember 13, 2024 providing that stockholder proposals must have been submitted no later than the close of\nbusiness on September 20, 2024 (seven days after the filing of the Current Report on Form 8-K).\nTo be considered for such presentation at our 2025 annual meeting of stockholders (the “2025 Annual\nMeeting”), any such stockholder proposal must be received by the Secretary, Reborn Coffee, Inc., Reborn\nCoffee, Inc., 580 N.

Before investing in our securities, you should carefully read this entire prospectus, including the information set forth under the headings “Risk\nFactors” as included elsewhere in this prospectus and our financial statements and the related notes and the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations”, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023, our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the\nperiod ended March 31, 2024, our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2024, which are incorporated by reference herein.\nOverview of Our Company\nReborn is focused on serving high quality, specialty-roasted coffee at retail locations, kiosks and cafes. We are an innovative company that strives for constant improvement\nin the coffee experience through exploration of new technology and premier service, guided by traditional brewing techniques. We believe Reborn differentiates itself from\nother coffee roasters through its innovative techniques, including sourcing, washing, roasting, and brewing our coffee beans with a balance of precision and craft.\nFounded in 2015 by Jay Kim, our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Kim and his team launched Reborn with the vision of using the finest pure ingredients and pristine water. We\ncurrently serve customers through our retail store locations in California, Korea, and Malaysia.\nReborn continues to elevate the high-end coffee experience and we received first place traditional still in “America’s Best Cold Brew” competition by Coffee Fest in 2017 in\nPortland and 2018 in Los Angeles.\nThe source of coffee is pinnacle to specialty coffee. The coffee industry has gone through various phases including the first, second, third and fourth wave. In the first and\nsecond waves of coffee, the single-origin source and type of the coffee is not necessarily in the forefront during the sourcing process. As such, much of the coffee may be a\nblend with various sources and a mix of Robusta and Arabica coffee beans. The third wave of coffee focuses on a single-origin source and one variety of coffee bean\n(specifically Arabica beans). Single-origin beans can focus on specific countries and can also have hyper-focused on specific regions in the third wave of coffee, such as\nCoban in Guatemala. Arabia beans are considered premier due to the specific requirements for growth and the high-quality flavor they produce. Arabica coffee is required to be\ngrown in higher, cooler elevations in regions.\nDifferentiated from other coffee companies, the Reborn Wash Process is the key to creating the clean flavor of our coffee. Our Wash Process is distinguished by the use of\nmagnetized water to wash our green coffee beans when they arrive at the Reborn facility, in order to extract impurities and enhance hydration before the roasting process.\nMagnetizing water is a process that converts the particles of water, which can naturally appear in various sizes, into evenly sized particles. As a result of this process, we\nbelieve that the water increases its hydration and ability to absorb into organic material. Our water is created through a water magnetizing device in which water is flowed\nthrough the device and magnetizes the water on-site immediately prior to use.\nAfter the wash, we roast our washed-green beans based on the profile of each single-origin. After the coffee beans are roasted, they are then packaged into various products\nsuch as whole bean coffee, pour over packs, and cold brew packs. Additionally, whole bean inventory is also supplied to the kiosk and cafes. A portion of the roasted coffee is\nalso allotted to create our award-winning cold brew concentrate. Our cold brew production is created using a proprietary percolation technique, also using magnetized water at\neach step to enhance the flavor of the cold brew.\n1\nWe continually innovate in the way we serve coffee. At our cafes, we serve customers our award-winning coffee through cold brew taps in addition to freshly ground coffee\nbeans in espresso-made drinks. Other brew methods, such as an in-house pour over and drip coffee, are also available.\nIn August 2022, we consummated our initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 1,440,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $5.00 per share, generating gross\nproceeds of $7,200,000. Net proceeds from the IPO was approximately $6.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses of\napproximately $998,000.\nWe had granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 216,000 additional shares (equal to 15% of the shares of common stock sold in the offering) to cover over-\nallotments. In addition, we had agreed to issue to the representative of the several underwriters warrants to purchase the number of shares of common stock in the aggregate\nequal to five percent (5%) of the shares of common stock to be issued and sold in the IPO. The warrants are exercisable for a price per share equal to 125% of the public offering\nprice. No over-allotment option or representative’s warrants have been exercised.\nOn August 12, 2022, our stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “REBN”.\nThe Experience, Reborn\nWe believe that we are the leading pioneers of the emerging “Fourth Wave” movement and that our business is redefining specialty coffee as an experience that demands\nmuch more than premium quality. We consider ourselves leaders of the “fourth wave” coffee movement because we are constantly developing our bean processing methods,\nresearching design concepts, and reinventing new ways of drinking coffee. For instance, the current transition from the K-Cup trend to the pour over drip concept allowed us\nto reinvent the way people consume coffee, by merging convenience and quality. We took the pour over drip concept and made it available and affordable to the public\nthrough our Reborn Coffee Pour Over packs. Our Pour Over Packs allow our consumers to consume our specialty coffee outdoors and on-the-go.\nOur success in innovating within the “Fourth Wave” coffee movement is measured by our success in B2B sales with our introduction of Reborn Coffee Pour Over Packs to\nhotels. With the introduction of our Pour Over Packs to major hotels (including one hotel company with 7 locations), our B2B sales increased as these companies recognized\nthe convenience and functionality our Pour Over Packs serve to their customers.\nCentered around its core values of service, trust, and well-being, we deliver an appreciation of coffee as both a science and an art. Developing innovative processes such as\nwashing green coffee beans with magnetized water, we challenge traditional preparation methods by focusing on the relationship between water chemistry, health, and flavor\nprofile. Leading research studies, testing brewing equipment, and refining roasting/brewing methods to a specific, we proactively distinguish exceptional quality from good\nquality by starting at the foundation and paying attention to the details. Our mission places an equal emphasis on humanizing the coffee experience, delivering a fresh take on\n“farm-to-table” by sourcing internationally. In this way, we create opportunities to develop transparency by paying homage to origin stories and spark new conversations by\nbuilding cross-cultural communities united by a passion for the finest coffee.\nThrough a broad product offering, Reborn provides customers with a wide variety of beverages and coffee options. As a result, we believe we can capture share of any\nexperience where customers seek to consume great beverages whether in our inviting store atmospheres which are designed for comfort, or on the go through our pour over\npacks, or at home with our whole bean ground coffee bags. We believe that the retail coffee market in the US is large and growing. According to IBIS, in 2021, the retail market\nfor coffee in the United States is expected to be $46.2 billion. This is expected to grow due to a shift in consumer preferences to premium coffee, including specialized blends,\nespresso-based beverages, and cold brew options. Reborn aims to capture a growing portion of the market as we expand and increase consumer awareness of our brand.\nBranding\nReborn Coffee focuses on two key features in our branding, including “Introducing the Fourth Wave” and “America’s Best Cold Brew.” These phrases encapsulate the quality\nof the Reborn Process of sourcing, washing, roasting, and brewing coffee and the quality of the product that we create.\n2\nThe Reborn brand is essential to our marketing strategy, as it allows us to stand out compared to our competitors. The products aim to make customers feel “reborn” after\ndrinking a cup of coffee.\nOur Menu and Products\nWe purchase and roast high-quality coffees that we sell, along with handcrafted coffee, tea and other beverages and a variety of high-quality food items. We believe in offering\ncustomers the same great taste and quality whether served in store or on the go. We also partner with third-party importers and exporters to purchase and import our green\ncoffee beans. Through these relationships, we source high-quality coffee beans from across the globe, including Mexico, Ethiopia, Colombia, Guatemala, Brazil, and Honduras.\nFranchise Operations\nIn January 2021, the Company formed Reborn Coffee Franchise LLC in the State of California in order to begin franchising Reborn Coffee retail stores and kiosks. The Company\nplans to charge future franchisees a non-refundable franchise fee and certain marketing and royalty fees based on gross sales, however we presently have no contractual\ncommitments or other agreements to do so. We expect to begin franchise sales in 2024. We believe that our team’s prior experience building a large, global foodservice\nbusiness will allow us to rapidly scale our future franchise effort. In addition, we have formed a franchise council consisting of a team of franchise experts to advise us. We plan\nto expand beyond California to additional states to create a national and global presence.\nExpanding Sales Channels\nToday, we sell a variety of our coffee and tea products through the enterprise, or commercial, channel, which we refer to as “B2B”, as well as direct-to-consumer via our\nwebsite. We expect to increase our channel presence by increasing the availability of Reborn Coffee in businesses and enterprises, and expand upon the partnerships we have\nin place with hotel operators to increase the use and brand awareness in hospitality. We also expect to grow our online sales through new partnerships with third-party\nretailers. Our products are available in various form factors, such as whole bean roasted coffee bags, single-serve drip bags, and pour over packs. We are exploring\npartnerships with grocery operators and foodservice providers to expand the Reborn Coffee brand.\nExperienced Leadership Team\nOur relentless commitment to excellence is driven by our passionate management team under the leadership of Founder and Chief Executive Officer Jay Kim. Jay launched\nReborn Coffee with the vision to provide the best coffee using the purest ingredients. Jay is focused on the expansion of Reborn and he has surrounded himself with leaders\nwith direct experience in beverage and retail. Stephan Kim, our Chief Financial Officer, has 20 years of experience in public accounting and consulting. Other members of our\nexecutive leadership team bring high growth, franchise and sector expertise.\nOur Commitment to Our Team\nReborn Coffee believes in mentoring the developing the next generation of premium coffee baristas. Through our in-depth training, we aim to train dedicated employees who\nunderstand the science and art behind every cup of coffee. We also expect to form a training school specializing in creating passionate baristas and coffee connoisseurs, by\neducating its students about coffee processes and preparation methods. The efforts for the training school are underway and we expect to launch the program in 2024.\nOur Highly Engaged Customers\nReborn Coffee customers are loyal to our brand due to our intense focus on premium coffee and customer service. Community engagement is another essential element of\nReborn Coffee’s in-person marketing strategy. Reborn hosts on-site engagements, such as event sponsorships, and engages with local Chambers of Commerce. Previously, we\nhave worked with Lululemon to host yoga sessions outside of our retail locations, creatively engaging the community while simultaneously promoting Reborn as an active\nlifestyle. We have also hosted pop-up locations on the Facebook campus, further expanding our outreach and introducing our brand name to different communities. We further\nengage with the community by organizing our own latte art competitions, in which baristas can compete for prizes and customers in the audience can witness the competitive\npassion Reborn Coffee encompasses.\n3\nDigital Channels\nReborn Coffee focuses on many digital channels in its marketing strategy. Social media is an important leg that creates engagement and education of Reborn Coffee’s brand.\nCustomers primarily engage the brand on Instagram, where we host giveaways, share new store openings, and promote seasonal menus. Through our unique, modern aesthetic\nand intense focus on high-quality coffee, we are able to share the quality and essence of Reborn Coffee on display inside of our retail locations with existing and future\ncustomers on social media platforms.\nFor both the in-store café channel and the e-commerce channel, SMS & email marketing are used for reengagement and communication of new products and offerings.\nDigital advertising channels are also used, primarily to engage the online market audience. Google and Facebook are the primary paid ad channels that we currently utilize. Yelp\nadvertising is also used to engage local customers and tourists who visit specific areas where Reborn Coffee retail locations are located.\nIn-Person Marketing Engagement\nEngaging customers in-store with a marketing plan is essential for customer retention and new customer generation. Reborn Coffee’s customer loyalty program provides free\ndrinks for every 10 drinks purchased. Additionally, store customers may participate in promotional deals, especially during the holidays and new item releases, to try new\ninnovative items created in-house. We also offer coffee samples of our pour over packs as well as new beans to our retail location customers. The distribution of coffee\nsamples has expanded customers’ knowledge of our products and, led to increased contributing to whole bean sales.\nReborn Coffee locations are located in heavily trafficked areas as well as popular malls. As such, the potential for marketing and branding is very high in these locations.\nSignage and promotional deals with giveaways are essential to attracting new customers.\nGrowth Strategies\nCorporate and Franchise Expansion\nReborn Coffee plans to expand across the Unites States with company operated locations and franchise locations to share the quality of specialty coffee. Reborn Coffee aims\nto accelerate our growth through our franchise program. Reborn Coffee will continue to innovate in the coffee industry by making the industry more personal to the consumers,\nprospective franchisees, and employees. This goal will be achieved through the continued innovation in our products, sourcing directly from farms, and giving customers\nchoices in how their coffee is served to them. As Reborn expands, we hope to show the world that expanding in volume and size does not diminish the quality and personal\nelement that is instilled in the coffee industry.\nWe have started to scale our logistics and supply chain to provide support for our rapid growth, including for our future franchisees. We have increased roasting capacity and\nour paper goods supplies, including an emphasis on eco-friendly products.\nB2B Strategy\nReborn Coffee products are unique given their potential to engage with business partners for large wholesale orders. Currently, Reborn Coffee builds strong relationships with\nhotel management companies within California and out-of-state. We currently work with several hotels, providing pour over packs and cold brew packs to cater to their\ncustomer needs. Reborn Coffee plans to continue growing its B2B marketing and sales strategy through active outreach and advertising to potential partners. We believe that\naccess to large-scale distribution channels such as hotels increases consumer awareness of our brand while providing us access to large enterprise customers. Gift giving\ncomprises a large percentage of winter B2B sales at Reborn Coffee. During the holidays, Reborn Coffee’s B2B marketing strategy focuses on targeting companies, and specific\nteams within companies, that are seeking to provide end of the year gifts to their clients and customers. Reborn Coffee provides customized gift sets to each customer’s needs.\nWord-of-mouth marketing has grown our B2B holiday gift giving accounts greatly, forging opportunities to have worked with companies like Google to provide gift sets for\ntheir clients. Reborn Coffee plans to expand not only by growing its retail location footprint, but also through the development of more hotel partnerships, expansion into\ngrocery stores and markets, expansion of our e-commerce and wholesale.\nReborn Coffee believes the grocery market is another major channel through which we expect to access. Through both bulk sales of roasted beans and in-store kiosks, as well\nsales of pre-packaged products, Reborn Coffee will access customers who purchase both in volume and for those customers looking for a handcrafted beverage during their in-\nstore shopping experience. We are exploring discussions with a variety of retailers and expect to access these additional sales channels in 2023.\n4\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings from time to time as part of its business. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, if determined\nadversely to us, we believe would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nHowever, legal proceedings are inherently uncertain. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter or a combination of matters may be material to our results of operations for a\nparticular period, depending upon the size of the loss or our income for that particular period.\nEmployees and Human Capital\nAs of September 26, 2024 we had 19 full-time employees. We believe in mentoring and developing the next generation of premium coffee baristas. Through our in-depth\ntraining, we aim to train dedicated employees who understand the science and art behind every cup of coffee.

The efforts for the training school are underway and\nwe expect to launch the program in 2024.\nProperties\nWe have a production and distribution center at our headquarters that we use to process and roast coffee for wholesale and retail distribution.

Unless otherwise noted, all share and per share information relating our Common Stock in this prospectus has been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split.\n6\nTHE OFFERING\nShares of Common Stock offered by us Up to 3,172,948 shares of our Common Stock, consisting of:\n● 64,656 shares of Common Stock we issued to YA II PN as consideration for its commitment to purchase\nshares of our Common Stock under the SEPA (the “Commitment Shares”);\n● Up to a maximum of 1,670,844 shares of Common Stock that we may sell to YA II PN from time to time at\nour sole discretion, pursuant to the SEPA, as described below;\n● Up to 462,374 shares of Common Stock (the “May Note Shares”) issuable to YA II PN upon conversion\nof the Convertible Promissory Note issued by us to YA II PN dated May 20, 2024 (the “May Note”)\nand/or issuable to YA II PN (the “Warrant Shares”) upon exercise of a warrant to purchase common\nstock issued on May 20, 2024 in connection with the May Note (the “Warrant”);\n● Up to 148,810 shares of Common Stock (the “August Note Shares,” and together with the May Note\nShares, the “Note Shares”) issuable to a Selling Stockholder upon conversion of the Convertible\nPromissory Note issued by us to such Selling Stockholder dated August 29, 2024 (the “August Note,”\nand together with the August Note, the “Notes”); and\n● 826,264 shares of Common Stock (the “2024 Shares”) issued to certain Selling Stockholders in 2024.\nCommon Stock outstanding 3,509,754 shares of Common Stock.\nCommon Stock outstanding after this offering 5,856,438 shares of Common Stock.\nUse of proceeds We will not receive any proceeds from the sale by the Selling Stockholders of the shares of Common Stock\nbeing offered by this prospectus. However, we may receive gross proceeds of up to $5,000,000 from the sale of\nour Common Stock to the YA II PN under the SEPA. We did not receive any cash proceeds from the issuance\nof the Commitment Shares to YA II PN under the SEPA. In addition, we may receive proceeds from the cash\nexercise of the Warrant, which, if fully exercised in cash at the current exercise price with respect to the\nWarrant, would result in gross proceeds to us of approximately $400,750. We intend to use any proceeds from\nYA II PN that we receive under the SEPA and the Warrant exercises for working capital, strategic and general\ncorporate purposes. See “Use of Proceeds” on page 19 for more information.\nRisk factors An investment in our securities is highly speculative and involves substantial risk. Please carefully consider\nthe risks described under the heading “Risk Factors” on page 8 and other information included and\nincorporated by reference in this prospectus for a discussion of factors to consider before deciding to invest\nin the securities offered hereby. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we\ncurrently deem to be immaterial may also impair our business and operations.\nTransfer agent and registrar The registrar and transfer agent for our Common Stock is Securities Transfer Corporation. The transfer agent’s\naddress is 15500 Roosevelt Blvd, Suite 104, Clearwater, Florida 33760 and the telephone number is (469) 633-\n0101.\nNasdaq symbol and trading Our Common Stock is listed on Nasdaq under the symbol “REBN.”\n7\nRISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Before deciding whether to invest in our securities, you should carefully consider the risks described below and\nthose discussed under the Section captioned “Risk Factors” contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023, as revised or\nsupplemented by our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or our current reports on Form 8-K, each as filed with the SEC and which are incorporated by reference in\nthis prospectus, together with other information in this prospectus, the information and documents incorporated by reference herein, and in any free writing prospectus that we\nhave authorized for use in connection with this offering. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be\nseriously harmed. This could cause the trading price of our Common Stock to decline, resulting in a loss of all or part of your investment. Please also read carefully the section\nbelow entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”\nRisks Related to This Offering\nIt is not possible to predict the actual number of shares we will sell under the SEPA to YA II PN, or the actual gross proceeds resulting from those sales.\nSubject to certain limitations in the SEPA and compliance with applicable law, we have the discretion to deliver notices to YA II PN at any time throughout the term of the SEPA.\nThe actual number of shares of Common Stock are sold to YA II PN may depend based on a number of factors, including the market price of our Common Stock during the sales\nperiod. Actual gross proceeds may be less than $5.0 million, which may impact our future liquidity. Because the price per share of each share sold to YA II PN will fluctuate during\nthe sales period, it is not currently possible to predict the number of shares that will be sold or the actual gross proceeds to be raised in connection with those sales.\nMoreover, although the SEPA provides that we may sell up to an aggregate of $5.0 million of our Common Stock to YA II PN, we are registering 1,670,844 shares of our Common\nStock (the “Advance Shares”). If we elect to sell to YA II PN all of the Advance Shares being registered for resale under this prospectus that are available for sale by us to YA II\nPN under the SEPA, depending on the market prices of our Common Stock for each purchase made pursuant to the SEPA, the actual gross proceeds from the sale of the shares\nmay be substantially less than the $5.0 million total commitment available to us under the SEPA. If it becomes necessary for us to issue and sell to YA II PN under the SEPA more\nshares than the Advance Shares being registered for resale under this prospectus in order to receive aggregate gross proceeds equal to $5.0 million under the SEPA, we must file\nwith the SEC one or more additional registration statements to register under the Securities Act the resale by YA II PN of any such additional shares of our Common Stock over the\nAdvance Shares registered in this Registration Statement that we wish to sell from time to time under the SEPA, which the SEC must declare effective, in each case before we may\nelect to sell any additional shares of our Common Stock to YA II PN under the SEPA.\nAny issuance and sale by us under the SEPA of a substantial amount of shares of Common Stock in addition to the Advance Shares being registered for resale by YA II PN under\nthis prospectus could cause additional substantial dilution to our stockholders. The number of shares of our Common Stock ultimately offered for sale by YA II PN is dependent\nupon the number of shares of Common Stock, if any, we ultimately sell to YA II PN under the SEPA.\nInvestors who buy shares in this offering at different times will likely pay different prices.\nInvestors who purchase shares of Common Stock in this offering at different times will likely pay different prices, and so may experience different levels of dilution and different\noutcomes in their investment results. In connection with the SEPA, we will have discretion, subject to market demand, to vary the timing, prices, and numbers of shares of Common\nStock sold to YA II PN. Similarly, YA II PN may sell such shares at different times and at different prices. Investors may experience a decline in the value of the shares they\npurchase from YA II PN in this offering as a result of sales made by us in future transactions to YA II PN at prices lower than the prices they paid.\n8\nThe issuance of Common Stock to the Selling Stockholders may cause substantial dilution to our existing shareholders and the sale of such shares acquired by the Selling\nStockholders could cause the price of our Common Stock to decline.\nWe are registering for resale by the Selling Stockholders up to 3,172,948 shares of Common Stock. The number of shares of our Common Stock ultimately offered for resale by the\nSelling Stockholders under this prospectus is dependent upon the number of shares of Common Stock issued to the Selling Stockholders pursuant to the SEPA, the Notes, and the\nWarrant. Depending on a variety of factors, including market liquidity of our Common Stock, the issuance of shares to the Selling Stockholders may cause the trading price of our\nCommon Stock to decline.\nIf and when we elect to sell Common Stock to YA II PN, sales of newly issued Common Stock by us to YA II PN could result in substantial dilution to the interests of existing\nholders of our Common Stock. Additionally, the sale of a substantial number of Common Stock to YA II PN, or the anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to\nsell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales.\nWe expect to grant equity awards to employees and directors under our equity incentive plans. We may also raise capital through equity financings in the future. As part of our\nbusiness strategy, we may make or receive investments in companies, solutions or technologies and issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition or investment. Any\nsuch issuances of additional share capital may cause shareholders to experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our Common Stock to\ndecline.\nWe may require additional financing to sustain our operations and without it we may not be able to continue operations.\nSubject to the terms and conditions of the SEPA, we may, at our discretion, direct YA II PN to purchase up to $5.0 million of shares of our Common Stock under the SEPA from\ntime-to-time. The purchase price per share for the shares of Common Stock that we may elect to sell to YA II PN under the SEPA will fluctuate based on the market prices of our\nCommon Stock for each purchase made pursuant to the SEPA, if any. Accordingly, it is not currently possible to predict the number of shares that will be sold to YA II PN, the\nactual purchase price per share to be paid by YA II PN for those shares, if any, or the actual gross proceeds to be raised in connection with those sales.\nThe extent to which we rely on YA II PN as a source of funding will depend on a number of factors including, the prevailing market price of our Common Stock and the extent to\nwhich we are able to secure working and other capital from other sources. If obtaining sufficient funding from YA II PN were to prove unavailable or prohibitively dilutive, we may\nneed to secure another source of funding in order to satisfy our working and other capital needs. Even if we were to sell to YA II PN all of the shares of Common Stock available for\nsale to YA II PN under the SEPA, we may still need additional capital to fully implement our business, operating and development plans. Should the financing we require to sustain\nour working capital needs be unavailable or prohibitively expensive when we require it, the consequences may be a material adverse effect on our business, operating results,\nfinancial condition and prospects.\nFuture sales and issuances of our Common Stock or other securities might result in significant dilution and could cause the price of our Common Stock to decline.\nTo raise capital, we may sell Common Stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions other than those contemplated by the SEPA, at prices and\nin a manner we determine from time to time. We may sell shares or other securities in another offering at a price per share that is less than the price per share paid by investors in\nthis offering, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders. The price per share at which we sell additional\nshares of our Common Stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into Common Stock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share paid by investors\nin this offering.\nWe cannot predict what effect, if any, sales of shares of our Common Stock in the public market or the availability of shares for sale will have on the market price of our Common\nStock. However, future sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock in the public market, including shares issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants and\nconvertible preferred shares, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\n9\nOur management will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from our sale of shares of Common Stock to YA II PN, and you may not agree with how we use\nthe proceeds and the proceeds may not be invested successfully.\nOur management will have broad discretion with respect to the use of proceeds from the sale of any shares of our Common Stock to YA II PN, including for any of the purposes\ndescribed in the section of this prospectus entitled “Use of Proceeds.” You will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the proceeds from the\nsale of any shares of our Common Stock to YA II PN. The results and effectiveness of the use of proceeds are uncertain, and we could spend the proceeds in ways that you do not\nagree with or that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our Common Stock. Our failure to apply these funds effectively could harm our business, delay\nthe development of our pipeline product candidates and cause the price of our Common Stock to decline.\nIt is not possible to predict the actual number of shares of Common Stock, if any, we will issue upon conversion of the Notes to the Selling Stockholders.\nWe do not have the right to control the timing and amount of any conversions of principal under the Notes by the Selling Stockholders. The number of shares that we issue to the\nSelling Stockholders pursuant to the Notes, if any, will depend upon market conditions and other factors to be determined by the Selling Stockholders. The Selling Stockholders\nmay ultimately decide to convert none or a portion of the principal amount of the Notes.\nThe number of shares of Common Stock ultimately offered for sale by the Selling Stockholders is dependent upon the number of shares, if any, we ultimately issue upon\nconversion of the Notes. However, even if the Selling Stockholders elect to convert the entire principal amount of the Notes, the Selling Stockholders may resell all, some or none\nof such shares at any time or from time to time in its sole discretion and at different prices.\nThe terms of our indebtedness, including the covenants and the dates on which principal and interest payments on our indebtedness are due, increases the risk that we will be\nunable to continue as a going concern.\nAs of December 31, 2023, and June 30, 2024 we had $1.48 million, and $1.57 million in outstanding short-term borrowing. In addition, on May 20, 2024, we issued the May Note\nwhich has a principal balance of $800,000 and, beginning on August 15, 2024, requires monthly principal and interest payments in excess of $266,667, and on August 29, 2024, we\nissued the August Note which has a principal balance of $500,000. The terms of our indebtedness, including the covenants and the dates on which principal and interest payments\non our indebtedness are due, increases the risk that we will be unable to continue as a going concern. To continue as a going concern over the next twelve months, we must make\npayments on our debt as they come due and comply with the covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness or, if we fail to do so, to (i) negotiate and obtain waivers of\nor forbearances with respect to any defaults that occur with respect to our indebtedness, (ii) amend, replace, refinance or restructure any or all of the agreements governing our\nindebtedness, and/or (iii) otherwise secure additional capital. However, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in accomplishing any of these plans.\nWe do not intend to apply for any listing of the Notes or the Warrant on any exchange or nationally recognized trading system, and we do not expect a market to develop for\nthe unregistered securities.\nWe do not intend to apply for any listing of the Notes or the Warrant on Nasdaq or any other securities exchange or nationally recognized trading system, and we do not expect a\nmarket to develop for the Notes or the Warrant. Without an active market, the liquidity of the Notes and the Warrant will be limited. Further, the existence of the Notes and Warrant\nmay act to reduce both the trading volume and the trading price of our common stock.\n10\nDue to the recent implementation of the Reverse Stock Split, the liquidity of our common stock may be adversely effected.\nOur common stock began trading on Nasdaq on a Reverse Stock Split-adjusted basis beginning on January 22, 2024. The liquidity of the shares of our common stock may be\naffected adversely by any reverse stock split given the reduced number of shares of our common stock that are outstanding following the Reverse Stock Split, especially if the\nmarket price of our common stock does not increase as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. Following the Reverse Stock Split, the resulting market price of our common stock may\nnot attract new investors and may not satisfy the investing requirements of those investors. Although we believe that a higher market price of our common stock may help\ngenerate greater or broader investor interest, there can be no assurance that the Reverse Stock Split resulted in a share price that will attract new investors, including institutional\ninvestors. In addition, there can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will satisfy the investing requirements of those investors. As a result, the trading\nliquidity of our common stock may not necessarily improve.\nIf we are unable to satisfy the applicable continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, our common stock could be delisted.\nOn June 21, 2024, we received a written notice (the “Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq indicating that Nasdaq had determined that we had failed to\ncomply with certain Nasdaq Listing Rules because we had not yet filed our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024.\nAs previously announced, on May 15, 2024, we were required to dismiss BF Borgers CPA PC as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm. We had to appoint\na new independent registered public accounting firm in order to complete and file the Form 10-Q, and on May 14, 2024, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of BCRG\nGroup (“BCRG”) as our new independent registered public accounting firm. Due to the timing of the appointment of BCRG, we were unable without unreasonable effort and\nexpense to complete the review of our financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 before the required filing date for the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nA Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) had previously placed us on a Discretionary Panel Monitor for a period of one year or until May 16, 2025 after we regained compliance with\nprevious Nasdaq listing deficiencies, which would require Nasdaq to issue a Delist Determination Letter in the event that we failed to maintain compliance with any continued\nlisting requirement (the “Panel Monitor”). Due to the Panel Monitor, we requested an appeal of determination to the Panel, and request a stay of the suspension pending a hearing.\nOn July 19, 2024, we filed Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024.\nAlthough we anticipate complying with Nasdaq’s Listing Rules going forward, there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet continued listing requirements in the future.\nIn determining whether to afford a company a cure period prior to commencing suspension or delisting procedures, Nasdaq analyzes all relevant facts including any past\ndeficiencies, and thus our prior deficiencies could be used as a factor by Nasdaq in any future decision to delist our securities from trading on its exchange.\nIf our Common Stock is delisted, it could reduce the price of our Common Stock and the levels of liquidity available to our stockholders. In addition, the delisting of our Common\nStock could materially adversely affect our access to the capital markets and any limitation on liquidity or reduction in the price of our Common Stock could materially adversely\naffect our ability to raise capital. Delisting from Nasdaq could also result in other negative consequences, including the potential loss of confidence by suppliers, customers and\nemployees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities.\nBecause the currently outstanding shares of Common Stock that are being registered in this prospectus represent a substantial percentage of our outstanding Common Stock,\nthe sale of such securities could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline significantly.\nThis prospectus relates to the offer and sale from time to time by the Selling Stockholders of an aggregate of up to 890,290 shares of our currently outstanding Common Stock. This\nprospectus also relates to the offer and sale from time to time by the Selling Stockholders of up to 2,282,028 shares of Common Stock issuable by us, consisting of (i) up to\n1,670,844 shares of Common Stock that we may sell to YA II PN, from time to time at our sole discretion, pursuant to the SEPA; (ii) up to 462,374 shares of Common Stock issuable\nto YA II PN upon conversion of the May Note and/or exercise of the Warrant; and (iii) up to 148,810 shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the August Note.\n11\nThe number of shares of Common Stock that the Selling Stockholders can sell into the public markets pursuant to this prospectus represents a significant amount of our\noutstanding shares of Common Stock. As of September 26, 2024, there were 3,509,754 shares of Common Stock outstanding. If all shares being registered hereby were sold, it\nwould comprise approximately 47.5% of our total shares of Common Stock outstanding. Given the substantial number of shares of Common Stock registered pursuant to this\nprospectus, the sale of Common Stock by the Selling Stockholders, or the perception in the market that the Selling Stockholders of a large number of shares of Common Stock\nintend to sell Common Stock, could increase the volatility of the market price of our Common Stock or result in a significant decline in the public trading price of our Common Stock.\nIn addition, certain Selling Stockholders have an incentive to sell because they have purchased their Common Stock at prices lower than the public investors or the current trading\nprice of the Common Stock, and they may profit significantly so even under circumstances in which our public stockholders or certain other Selling Stockholders would experience\nlosses in connection with their investment. The securities being registered for resale were issued to, purchased by or will be purchased by the Selling Stockholders for the\nfollowing consideration: (i) a price of $2.32 per share for the Commitment Shares; (ii) a purchase price yet to be determined for the Advance Shares under the SEPA (as described\nherein); (iii) a purchase price of $2.29 per share of Common Stock for conversion of the May Note (as may be adjusted as described herein); (iv) a purchase price of $3.36 per share\nof Common Stock for conversion of the August Note; (v) a purchase price of $2.25 for 444,445 of the 2024 Shares purchased in February 2024; (vi) a purchase price of $2.75 for\n181,819 of the 2024 Shares purchased in May 2024; and (vii) a purchase price of $3.00 for 200,000 of the 2024 Shares purchased in June 2024. The shares of Common Stock\nunderlying the Warrant will be purchased, if at all, by such holders at the $2.29 exercise price of the Warrant. If the Selling Stockholders were to sell the shares of Common Stock at\na price of $3.02 per share (the last reported sale price of our Common Stock on September 26, 2024), they would recognize a profit or loss as follows: (i) a profit of approximately\n$0.70 per share of Common Stock for the Commitment Shares; (ii) a profit of approximately $0.73 per share of Common Stock for the shares underlying the May Note; (iii) a loss of\napproximately $0.34 per share of Common Stock for shares underlying the August Note; (iv) a profit of approximately $0.77 per share of Common Stock for the 2024 Shares\npurchased in February 2024; (v) a profit of approximately $0.27 per share of Common Stock for the 2024 Shares purchased in May 2024; and (vi) a profit of approximately $0.02 per\nshare of Common Stock for the 2024 Shares purchased in June 2024.\nPublic stockholders of Common Stock may have paid more than certain of the Selling Stockholders for their Common Stock and would not expect to see a positive return unless the\nprice of the Common Stock appreciates above the price at which such stockholders purchased their Common Stock. Investors who purchase Common Stock on open market may\nnot experience a similar rate of return on the Common Stock they purchase due to differences in the purchase prices and the current trading price referenced above. In addition,\nsales by the Selling Stockholders may cause the trading prices of our securities to experience a decline. As a result, the Selling Stockholders may effect sales of Common Stock at\nprices below the current market price, which could cause market prices to decline further.\n12\nSPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis prospectus contains various forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, which represent our\nexpectations or beliefs concerning future events that are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management, and which\nstatements involve substantial risk and uncertainties. All statements contained in this prospectus other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding our future\noperating results and financial position, our business strategy and plans, market growth and trends, and objectives for future operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-\nlooking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they\ncontain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “could,” “intends,” “target,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,”\n“potential,” or “continue” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or intentions.\nThese risks and uncertainties include, among other things:\n● our ability to continue as a going concern;\n● our reliance on third party vendors;\n● our dependence on our executive officers;\n● our financial performance guidance;\n● material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting;\n● regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries;\n● the impact of laws, regulations, accounting standards, regulatory requirements, judicial decisions and guidance issued by authoritative bodies;\n● our estimates regarding expenses, future revenue and cash flow, capital requirements and needs for additional financing;\n● our financial performance;\n● the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of our business combination and/or divestitures; and\n● the effect of COVID-19 on the foregoing.\nYou should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this prospectus primarily on our\ncurrent expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. The\noutcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors described elsewhere in this prospectus and in the section\ntitled “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n13\nTHE SEPA TRANSACTION\nOn February 12, 2024, we entered into the Standby Equity Purchase Agreement (the “SEPA”) with YA II PN. Pursuant to the SEPA, we may sell to YA II PN up to $5,000,000, of\nshares of Common Stock (the “Advance Shares”), from time to time during the term of the SEPA. The SEPA contains customary representations, warranties, conditions and\nindemnification obligations of the parties. Pursuant to the SEPA, we also agreed to file a registration statement with the SEC, covering the resale of Advance Shares issued or sold\nto YA II PN under the SEPA under the Securities Act.\nIn consideration for YA II PN’s execution and delivery of the SEPA, we issued to YA II PN 64,656 (the “Commitment Shares”).\nWe cannot sell any additional shares to YA II PN until the date that the registration statement which contains this prospectus is declared effective by the SEC and a final\nprospectus in connection therewith is filed and all of the other conditions set forth in the SEPA are satisfied (the “Commencement Date”). From and after such time, we will control\nthe timing and amount of any sales of our Common Stock to YA II PN. Actual sales of shares of our Common Stock to YA II PN under the SEPA will depend on a variety of factors\nto be determined by us from time to time, including, among others, market conditions, the trading price of the Common Stock and determinations by us as to the appropriate\nsources of funding for our company and our operations.\nBeginning on the Commencement Date and until February 12, 2027, under the terms and subject to the conditions of the SEPA, from time to time, at our discretion, we have the\nright, but not the obligation, to issue to YA II PN, and YA II PN is obligated to purchase, the Advance Shares, subject to certain limitations set forth in the SEPA. The purchase\nprice of the Advance Shares will be at one of two prices, as chosen by us in our sole discretion and specified in the notice given to YA II PN (each, a “SEPA Advance Notice”): (i)\n95% of the Market Price (as defined below) for any period commencing (1) if submitted to YA II PN prior to 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time on a trading day, the open of trading on such day\nor (2) if submitted to YA II PN after 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time on a trading day, upon receipt by us of written confirmation of acceptance of such SEPA Advance Notice by YA II PN\n(or the open of regular trading hours, if later), and in either case, ending on 4:00 pm New York Citytime on the applicable trading day (the “Option 1 Pricing Period”), and (ii) 96% of\nthe Market Price for any three consecutive trading days commencing on the SEPA Advance Notice date (the “Option 2 Pricing Period,” and each of the Option 1 Pricing Period and\nthe Option 2 Pricing Period, a “Pricing Period”). “Market Price” is defined as, for any Option 1 Pricing Period, the VWAP of the Common Stock on Nasdaq during the Option 1\nPricing Period, and for any Option 2 Pricing Period, the lowest VWAP of the Common Stock on the Nasdaq during the Option 2 Pricing Period.\nOur ability to issue Advance Shares under the SEPA are subject to certain limitations, including that YA II PN cannot purchase any shares that would result in it beneficially\nowning more than 4.99% of the our Common Stock at the time of us issuing a SEPA Advance Notice. Additionally, if the total number of shares of Common Stock traded on\nNasdaq during the applicable Pricing Period is less than the Volume Threshold (as defined below), then the number of shares of Common Stock issued and sold pursuant to such\nSEPA Advance Notice will be reduced to the greater of (a) 30% of the trading volume of the Common Stock on Nasdaq during the relevant Pricing Period as reported by Bloomberg\nL.P., or (b) the number of shares of Common Stock sold by YA II PN during such Pricing Period. “Volume Threshold” is defined as a number of shares of Common Stock equal to\nthe quotient of (a) the number of shares in the SEPA Advance Notice requested by the company divided by (b) 0.30.\nUnder the applicable rules of Nasdaq and pursuant to the SEPA, in no event were we permitted to issue to YA II PN more than 19.99% of the shares of the Common Stock\noutstanding immediately prior to the execution of the SEPA unless we obtained stockholder approval to issue shares of Common Stock in excess of such amount. On May 10, 2024,\nour stockholders approved the issuance of Common Stock in excess of 19.99% of the shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the execution of the SEPA.\nThe net proceeds from sales, if any, under the SEPA, will depend on the frequency and prices at which we sell shares of Common Stock to YA II PN. To the extent we sell shares\nunder the SEPA, we currently plan to use any proceeds therefrom for costs of this transaction, for working capital, strategic and other general corporate purposes.\nThe SEPA does not include any of the following: (i) limitations on our use of amounts we receive as the purchase price for shares of Common Stock sold to YA II PN; (ii) financial\nor business covenants, except that we may not effect any consolidation or transfer of substantially all of our assets while a SEPA Advance Notice is outstanding; (iii) restrictions\non future financings; (iv) rights of first refusal; or (v) participation rights or penalties.\nAs of September 26, 2024, there were 3,509,754 shares of our Common Stock outstanding. Although the SEPA provides that we may sell up to an aggregate of $5,000,000 of shares\nof our Common Stock to YA II PN, only 1,670,844 shares of our Common Stock are being registered for resale under this prospectus that we may issue and sell to YA II PN in the\nfuture under the SEPA, if and when we elect to sell shares of our Common Stock to YA II PN under the SEPA. Depending on the market prices of our Common Stock at the time we\nelect to issue and sell shares of our Common Stock to YA II PN under the SEPA, we may need to register for resale under the Securities Act additional shares of our Common Stock\nin order to receive aggregate gross proceeds equal to the $5,000,000 total commitment available to us under the SEPA. If all of such 1,670,844 shares of our Common Stock offered\nhereby were issued and outstanding as of the date of this prospectus, such shares would represent approximately 28.5% of the total number of outstanding shares of Common\nStock, and approximately 35.6% of the total number of outstanding shares of Common Stock held by non-affiliates, in each case as of the date of this prospectus. If we elect to\nissue and sell to YA II PN under the SEPA more than the 1,670,844 shares of our Common Stock being registered for resale by YA II PN under this prospectus, which we have the\nright, but not the obligation, to do, we must first register for resale under the Securities Act any such additional shares of our Common Stock, which could cause additional\nsubstantial dilution to our shareholders. The number of shares of our Common Stock ultimately offered for sale by YA II PN is dependent upon the number of shares purchased by\nYA II PN under the SEPA.\n14\nIssuances of our Common Stock to YA II PN under the SEPA will not affect the rights or privileges of our existing shareholders, except that the economic and voting interests of\neach of our existing shareholders will be diluted as a result of any such issuance. Although the number of shares of our Common Stock that our existing shareholders own will not\ndecrease, the shares of our Common Stock owned by our existing shareholders will represent a smaller percentage of our total outstanding shares of our Common Stock after any\nsuch issuance of shares of our Common Stock to YA II PN under the SEPA. There are substantial risks to our shareholders as a result of the sale and issuance of Common Stock to\nYA II PN under the SEPA. See “Risk Factors.”\nConditions to Commencement and for Delivery of SEPA Advance Notices\nOur ability to deliver SEPA Advance Notices to YA II PN under the SEPA are subject to the satisfaction by us, of certain conditions, all of which are entirely outside of YA II PN’s\ncontrol, including, but not limited to, the following:\n● the accuracy in all material respects of our representations and warranties included in the SEPA on the date of the SEPA and the date of each closing of a purchase and\nsale under the SEPA of;\n● we having performed, satisfied and complied in all material respects with all covenants, agreements and conditions required by the SEPA to be performed, satisfied or\ncomplied with by us;\n● the registration statement that includes this prospectus (and amendment or supplement thereto) shall have been declared effective and remain effective for the offering\nand sale of the shares and (i) we shall not have received notice that the SEC has issued or intends to issue a stop order with respect to such registration statement or that\nthe SEC otherwise has suspended or withdrawn the effectiveness of such registration statement, either temporarily or permanently, or intends or has threatened to do so\nand (ii) no other suspension of the use of, or withdrawal of the effectiveness of, such registration statement or the prospectus shall exist. YA II PN shall not have received\nany notice from us that the registration statement, prospectus and/or any prospectus supplement or amendment thereto fails to meet the requirements of Section 5(b) or\nSection 10 of the Securities Act;\n● the number of shares then to be purchased by YA II PN shall not exceed the number of such shares that, when aggregated with all other shares of Common Stock then\nowned by YA II PN beneficially or deemed beneficially owned by YA II PN, would result in YA II PN owning more than the beneficial ownership limitation;\n● trading in the Common Stock shall not have been suspended by the SEC or the Nasdaq, or otherwise halted for any reason, and the Common Stock shall have been\napproved for listing or quotation on and shall not have been delisted from or no longer quoted on the Nasdaq.\n● the issuance of shares of Common Stock to YA II PN, including the Commitment Shares, shall not exceed 19.99% of the shares of the Common Stock outstanding\nimmediately prior to the execution of the SEPA, if applicable, subject to appropriate adjustment for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, rights offerings,\nreclassification or similar transaction that proportionately decreases or increases the Common Stock unless holders of a majority of our outstanding voting common stock\nthat are present or represented by proxy at a meeting, to effectuate the transactions contemplated by the SEPA;\n● the absence of any statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, ruling or injunction shall have been enacted, entered, promulgated or adopted by any court or\ngovernmental authority of competent jurisdiction that prohibits or directly and materially adversely affects any of the transactions contemplated by the SEPA and the\nexhibits thereto, and no proceeding shall have been commenced that may have the effect of prohibiting or materially adversely affecting any of the transactions\ncontemplated by the SEPA and the exhibits thereto;\n● the Common Stock must be DWAC Eligible and not subject to a “DTC chill”;\n● the issuance of the Advance Shares shall not violate the shareholder approval requirements of Nasdaq; and\n● all reports, schedules, registrations, forms, statements, information and other documents required to have been filed by us with the SEC pursuant to the reporting\nrequirements of the Exchange Act shall have been filed with the SEC.\n15\nTermination of the SEPA\nUnless earlier terminated as provided in the SEPA, the SEPA will terminate automatically on the earliest to occur of:\n● February 12, 2027; or\n● the date on which YA II PN shall have purchased Advance Shares for an aggregate purchase price of $5,000,000.\nNo Short-Selling or Hedging by YA II PN\nYA II PN has agreed that neither it nor any of its affiliates shall engage in any direct or indirect short-selling our Common Stock during any time prior to the termination of the\nSEPA.\nEffect of Performance of the SEPA on our Shareholders\nAll shares registered in this offering that may be issued or sold by us to YA II PN under the SEPA are expected to be freely tradable. The resale by YA II PN of a significant number\nof shares registered in this offering at any given time, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline and to be highly\nvolatile. Sales of our Common Stock to YA II PN, if any, will depend upon market conditions and other factors to be determined by us. We may ultimately decide to sell to YA II PN\nall, some or none of the additional shares of our Common Stock that may be available for us to sell pursuant to the SEPA. If and when we do sell shares to YA II PN, after YA II PN\nhas acquired the shares, YA II PN may resell all, some or none of those shares of Common Stock at any time or from time to time in its discretion. Therefore, sales to YA II PN by us\nunder the SEPA may result in substantial dilution to the interests of other holders of our Common Stock. In addition, if we sell a substantial number of shares to YA II PN under the\nSEPA, or if investors expect that we will do so, the actual sales of shares or the mere existence of our arrangement with YA II PN may make it more difficult for us to sell equity or\nequity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect such sales. However, we have the right to control the timing and amount of any\nadditional sales of Common Stock to YA II PN and the SEPA may be terminated by us at any time at our discretion without any cost to us, subject to certain conditions.\nPursuant to the terms of the SEPA, we have the right, but not the obligation, to direct YA II PN to purchase up to $5,000,000 of our Common Stock, subject to certain limitations. If\nwe elect to issue and sell to YA II PN under the SEPA more than the 1,670,844 shares of our Common Stock being registered for resale by YA II PN under this prospectus, which we\nhave the right, but not the obligation, to do, we must first register for resale under the Securities Act any such additional shares of our Common Stock, which could cause\nadditional substantial dilution to our shareholders. The number of shares of our Common Stock ultimately offered for sale by YA II PN is dependent upon the number of shares\npurchased by YA II PN under the SEPA.\nThe following table sets forth the amount of gross proceeds we would receive from YA II PN from our sale of shares of Common Stock to YA II PN under the SEPA at varying\npurchase prices:\nAssumed Number of Percentage of\nAverage Registered Shares to Outstanding Shares Gross Proceeds from\nPurchase Price be Issued if Full Issued After Giving the Sale of Shares to\nPer Share Purchase(1) Effect to the Issuance to YA II PN(2) YA II PN Under the SEPA\n$ 1.00 1,670,844 32.3% $ 1,670,844\n$ 1.50 1,670,844 32.3% $ 2,506,266\n$ 2.00 1,670,844 32.3% $ 3,341,688\n$ 2.50 1,670,844 32.3% $ 4,177,110\n$ 3.00(3) 1,666,667 32.2% $ 5,000,000\n$ 3.02 1,655,629 32.1% $ 5,000,000\n(1) Although the SEPA provides that we may sell up to $5,000,000 of our Common Stock to YA II PN, we are only registering 1,670,844 shares under this prospectus that we may\nissue and sell to YA II PN in the future under the SEPA, if and when we elect to sell shares of our Common Stock to YA II PN under the SEPA.\n(2) The denominator is based on 3,509,754 shares of our Common Stock outstanding as of September 26, 2024, plus the number of shares set forth in the adjacent column that we\nwould have issued or sold to YA II PN, assuming the average purchase price in the first column. The numerator is based on the number of shares of our Common Stock\nissuable under the SEPA (that are the subject of this offering) at the corresponding assumed average purchase price set forth in the first column. The denominator does not\nassume the issuance of any shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the May Note or exercise of the Warrant.\n(3) The closing price of our Common Stock on September 26, 2024.\n16\nTHE YA NOTE TRANSACTION\nOn May 20, 2024, we issued the May Note in the original principal amount of $800,000 and related Warrant to EF Hutton YA Fund, LP (the “EF Hutton Fund”), a fund co-managed\nby Yorkville Advisors Global, LLC. EF Hutton Fund paid a purchase price of $720,000 to us for the May Note and Warrant. In addition, we paid a $36,000 financial advisory fee paid\nto EF Hutton LLC. The May Note was subsequently assigned by the EF Hutton Fund to YA II PN effective on July 25, 2024.\nThe May Note accrues an interest at an annual rate of 0%, however, the interest rate will increase to an annual rate of 18% upon the occurrence of an event of default. Beginning\non August 15, 2024, and continuing on the same day of each successive calendar month thereafter, we are required to make installment payments on the May Note until it is fully\nrepaid or YA II PN has converted the outstanding balance into shares of Common Stock. We have failed to make the first two payments that were due on August 15, 2024 and\nSeptember 15, 2024, and thus the May Note is accruing interest at the default rate of 18%. At any time, subject to certain ownership limitations, YA II PN may convert any portion\nof the outstanding and unpaid principal, interest, or other amounts outstanding under the May Note into Common Stock at a price equal to $2.29 per share, as may be adjusted to a\nvariable price equal to 85% of the lowest daily VWAP during the ten trading days preceding conversion, but no lower than $1.00. In addition, the May Note grants us the right to\nredeem early a portion or all of the amount under the Promissory Note prior to its maturity or conversion at a 15% premium. The maturity date of the May Note is May 20, 2025\nalthough it may be extended at the option of YA II PN.\nThe Warrant is exercisable by YA II PN at any time after issuance until the date that is 60 months after the issuance date. The Warrant is exercisable into Warrant Shares at an\nexercise price of $2.29 per share, subject to adjustment as described in the Warrant. If a registration statement covering the resale of the Warrant Shares is not available by August\n15, 2024, then YA II PN may exercise the Warrant in whole or in part on a cashless basis.\nUnder the applicable Nasdaq rules, in no event may we issue to YA II PN under the May Note and/or the Warrant more than the Exchange Cap of 462,374 shares of our common\nstock representing 19.99% of the Common Stock outstanding as of May 20, 22024 (the “Exchange Cap”), unless we obtain stockholder approval to do so, or unless sales of\ncommon stock are made at a price equal to or greater than the Nasdaq minimum price, such that the Exchange Cap limitation would not apply under applicable Nasdaq rules. In any\nevent, the May Note specifically provides that we may not issue or sell any shares of our Common Stock under the May Note and/or the Warrant if such issuance or sale would\nbreach any applicable Nasdaq rules.\nPursuant to the May Note and the Warrant, we agreed to, at any time after July 15, 2024 and upon written notice from YA II PN, file a registration statement within 30 days of such\nnotice on Form S-3 or Form S-1 covering the resale by the Holder of Common Stock underlying the May Note and the Warrant. We are registering hereby 462,374 shares of\nCommon Stock underlying the May Note and the Warrant because that is equal to the maximum number of shares issuable pursuant to the Exchange Cap under the May Note.\nThe May Note contains customary representations and warranties for the benefit of YA II PN. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the May Note were\nmade only for purposes of the May Note and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreement and are subject to certain important limitations.\nAdditionally, while any amount remains outstanding on the May Note, we have agreed not to effect any transaction involving a Variable Rate Transaction (as defined in the May\nNote) and we granted YA II PN a right of first refusal on any financing transaction pursuant to which we propose to issue and sell our securities. YA II PN shall not have the right\nto convert any portion of the May Note to the extent that after giving effect to such conversion, YA II PN would beneficially own 4.99% of the number of Common Stock\noutstanding immediately after giving effect to such conversion or receipt of Common Stock as interest. The provisions of the 4.99% beneficial ownership limitation can be waived\nby YA II PN (but only as to itself) upon not less than 65 days prior notice to us.\nIssuances of our Common Stock to YA II PN under the May Note or the Warrant will not affect the rights or privileges of our existing shareholders, except that the economic and\nvoting interests of each of our existing shareholders will be diluted as a result of any such issuance. Although the number of shares of our Common Stock that our existing\nshareholders own will not decrease, the shares of our Common Stock owned by our existing shareholders will represent a smaller percentage of our total outstanding shares of our\nCommon Stock after any such issuance of shares of our Common Stock to YA II PN upon conversion of the May Note or exercise of the Warrant. There are substantial risks to our\nshareholders as a result of the sale and issuance of Common Stock to YA II PN under the May Note and the Warrant. See “Risk Factors.”\n17\nPRIVATE PLACEMENTS\nFrom February 29, 2024 through June 21, 2024, we closed on private placement transactions with four “accredited investors” (the “Investors”), as defined in Rule 501(a) of\nRegulation D under the Securities Act. In connection with the private placement transactions, we entered into securities subscription agreements (the “Subscription Agreements”)\nwith the Investors pursuant to which we offered and sold to the Investors a total of 826,264 shares (the “2024 Shares”) of our Common Stock at a purchase price of $2.25 per share\nfor 444,445 shares, $2.75 per share for 181,819 Shares, and $3.00 for 200,000 Shares, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $2.1 million.\nOn August 29, 2024, we issued the August Note in the original principal amount of $500,000, to Quen Inno Tech Co., Ltd. (the “Quen Inno Tech”). Quen Inno Tech paid a purchase\nprice of $500,000 to the Company for the August Note.\nThe August Note accrues interest at an annual rate of 0%; however, the interest rate will increase to an annual rate of 10% upon the occurrence of an event of default. Beginning\non August 21, 2025, and continuing on the same day of each successive calendar month thereafter, we are required to make installment payments on the August Note until it is\nfully repaid or Quen Inno Tech has converted the outstanding balance into shares of our Common Stock. At any time, subject to certain ownership limitations, Quen Inno Tech\nmay convert any portion of the outstanding and unpaid principal, interest, or other amounts outstanding under the August Note into Common Stock at a price equal to $3.36 per\nshare. In addition, the August Note grants us the right to redeem early a portion or all of the amount under the August Note prior to its maturity or conversion at a 15% premium.\nThe August Note contains customary representations and warranties for the benefit of Quen Inno Tech. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the August\nNote were made only for purposes of the August Note and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreement and are subject to certain important\nlimitations.\nIssuances of our Common Stock to Quen Inno Tech under the August Note will not affect the rights or privileges of our existing shareholders, except that the economic and voting\ninterests of each of our existing shareholders will be diluted as a result of any such issuance. Although the number of shares of our Common Stock that our existing shareholders\nown will not decrease, the shares of our Common Stock owned by our existing shareholders will represent a smaller percentage of our total outstanding shares of our Common\nStock after any such issuance of shares of our Common Stock to Quen Inno Tech upon conversion of the August Note. There are substantial risks to our shareholders as a result\nof the sale and issuance of Common Stock to Quen Inno Tech under the August Note. See “Risk Factors.”\n18\nUSE OF PROCEEDS\nThis prospectus relates to shares of Common Stock that may be offered and sold from time to time by the Selling Stockholders. We will not receive any proceeds from the resale of\nshares of Common Stock by the Selling Stockholders.\nWe may receive up to $5,000,000 in gross proceeds pursuant to the SEPA and up to $400,750 upon exercise of the Warrant. See “Plan of Distribution” elsewhere in this prospectus\nfor more information.\nWe intend to use any proceeds from YA II PN that we receive under the SEPA or the Warrant for working capital, strategic and general corporate purposes. We cannot specify\nwith certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds that we will have from the sale of our shares pursuant to the SEPA or the Warrant. Therefore, our management will have\nbroad discretion to determine the specific use for the net proceeds and we may use the proceeds for purposes that are not contemplated at the time of this offering.\nWe will incur all costs associated with this prospectus and the registration statement of which it is a part.\n19\nMARKET FOR COMMON STOCK AND DIVIDEND POLICY\nMarket Information and Number of Stockholders\nOur Common Stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “REBN.” The last reported closing price for our Common Stock on Nasdaq on September 26, 2024 was\n$3.02 per share.\nAs of September 26, 2024, there were 3,509,754 of our shares of common stock issued and outstanding held by approximately 196 stockholders of record. The number of record\nholders was determined from the records of our transfer agent and does not include beneficial owners of shares of common stock whose shares are held in the names of various\nsecurity brokers, dealers, and registered clearing agencies.\nDividend Policy\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and future earnings, if any, for the operation and\nexpansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination related to our dividend policy will be made\nat the discretion of our board of directors after considering our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business prospects and other factors the board of\ndirectors deems relevant, and subject to the restrictions contained in any financing instruments. Our ability to declare dividends may also be limited by restrictive covenants\npursuant to any other future debt financing agreements.\n20\nCAPITALIZATION\nThe following table sets forth our actual cash and cash equivalents and our capitalization as of June 30, 2024:\n● on an actual basis;\n● on an as adjusted basis to give effect to the events above and the issuance and sale of 1,538,462 shares of our Common Stock at an assumed Purchase Price to YA II PN\nof $3.25 per share.\nYou should read this information in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our consolidated financial\nstatements and related notes for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024, included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024, which\nis incorporated by reference herein.\nAs of June 30, 2024\n(unaudited)\n(in thousands) Actual As adjusted\nCash and Cash Equivalents: $ 617,051 $ 5,617,051\nTotal Current Liabilities: 3,711,482 3,711,482\nTotal Long-Term Liabilities: 4,274,836 4,274,836\nStockholders’ Equity (Deficit):\nCommon Stock - $0.0001 par value per share; 40,000,000 authorized shares; 3,235,657 shares issued and outstanding at June 30, 2024 324 477\nAdditional paid in capital 21,603,006 26,602,852\nAccumulated deficit (19,064,080) (19,064,080)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 3,438 3,438\nTotal stockholders’ equity 2,542,688 7,542,687\nThe as adjusted information discussed above is illustrative only.\nThe total number of shares of our Common Stock reflected in the discussion and table above is based on 3,235,657 shares outstanding as of June 30, 2024.\n21\nSECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT\nThe following table sets forth certain information regarding the ownership of our Common Stock as of September 26, 2024 (the “Determination Date”) by: (i) each current director of\nour company; (ii) each of our Named Executive Officers (“NEOs”); (iii) all current executive officers and directors of our company as a group; and (iv) all those known by us to be\nbeneficial owners of more than five percent (5%) of our Common Stock.\nBeneficial ownership and percentage ownership are determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC. Under these rules, beneficial ownership generally includes any shares as to\nwhich the individual or entity has sole or shared voting power or investment power and includes any shares that an individual or entity has the right to acquire beneficial\nownership of within 60 days of the Determination Date, through the exercise of any option, warrant or similar right (such instruments being deemed to be “presently exercisable”).\nIn computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, shares of our Common Stock that could be issued upon the\nexercise of presently exercisable options and warrants are considered to be outstanding. These shares, however, are not considered outstanding as of the Determination Date\nwhen computing the percentage ownership of each other person.\nTo our knowledge, except as indicated in the footnotes to the following table, and subject to state community property laws where applicable, all beneficial owners named in the\nfollowing table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares shown as beneficially owned by them. Percentage of ownership is based on 3,509,754 shares of\nCommon Stock outstanding as of the Determination Date. Unless otherwise indicated, the business address of each person in the table below is c/o Reborn Coffee Inc., 580 N.\nBerry St. Brea, CA 92821.

You should also refer to the text\nof our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws, which are filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is part.\nAuthorized and Outstanding Capital Stock\nThe total amount of our authorized share capital consists of 40,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value\n$0.0001 per share.\nCommon Stock\nHolders of shares of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters on which stockholders are entitled to vote generally, including the\nelection or removal of directors. The holders of our common stock do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors.\nHolders of shares of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends at the same rate when, as and if declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available therefor,\nsubject to any statutory or contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends and to the rights of the holders of one or more outstanding series of our preferred stock.\nUpon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, and after payment in full of all amounts required to be paid to creditors, the holders of shares of our common will be entitled to\nreceive pro rata our remaining assets available for distribution.\nAll shares of our common stock that are outstanding are fully paid and non-assessable. The common stock is be subject to further calls or assessments by us. Holders of shares of\nour common stock do not have preemptive, subscription, redemption or conversion rights. There will be no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock.\nThe rights, powers, preferences and privileges of holders of our common stock will be subject to those of the holders of any shares of our preferred stock or any other series or\nclass of stock we may authorize and issue in the future.\nNo shares of common stock are subject to redemption or have preemptive rights to purchase additional shares of common stock. Holders of shares of our common stock do not\nhave subscription, redemption or conversion rights. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock.\nAnti-Takeover Effects of Certain Provisions\nBecause our stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights, stockholders holding a majority of the voting power of our shares of common stock will be able to elect all our\ndirectors. A special meeting of stockholders may be called by a majority of our board of directors, the chair of our board of directors, or our chief executive officer. Our bylaws\nestablish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for\nelection to our board of directors.\nThis will make it more difficult for another party to obtain control of us by replacing our board of directors. Since our board of directors has the power to retain and discharge our\nofficers, these provisions could also make it more difficult for existing stockholders or another party to effect a change in management. This intended to preserve our existing\ncontrol structure following this offering, facilitate our continued product innovation and the risk-taking that it requires, permit us to continue to prioritize our long-term goals rather\nthan short-term results, enhance the likelihood of continued stability in the composition of our board of directors and its policies and to discourage certain types of transactions\nthat may involve an actual or threatened acquisition of us. These provisions are also designed to reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited acquisition proposal and to discourage\ncertain tactics that may be used in proxy fights. However, such provisions could have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares and may have the\neffect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying changes in our control or management. As a consequence, these provisions may also inhibit fluctuations in the market price of our\nstock that could result from actual or rumored takeover attempts.\n23\nWe are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested\nstockholder for a period of three years after the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder, subject to certain exceptions.\nExclusive Forum\nOur bylaws contain an exclusive forum provision providing that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for: (1) any derivative action or\nproceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by, or other wrongdoing by, any of our directors, officers, employees, agents\nor stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or (4)\nany action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. However, the exclusive forum provision states that it shall not apply to actions arising under the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nIn addition, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the\nSecurities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the\nSecurities Act or any other claim for which the federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with\nthe federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nAny person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to this provision included in\nour bylaws. The exclusive forum provision, if enforced, may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our\ndirectors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find the exclusive forum provision to be inapplicable or unenforceable\nin an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and growth prospects. For example, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware recently determined that a provision stating that U.S. federal\ndistrict courts are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act is not enforceable.\nCorporate Opportunities\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce any interest or expectancy in the business opportunities of our its officers, directors, agents, stockholders, members,\npartners, affiliates and subsidiaries and each such party shall not have any obligation to offer us those opportunities unless presented to one of our directors or officers in his or\nher capacity as a director or officer.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nOur transfer agent and registrar is Securities Transfer Corporation.

The other Selling Stockholders and any broker-dealers or agents that are involved in selling the\nsecurities may be deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with such sales. In such event, any commissions received by such broker-\ndealers or agents and any profit on the resale of the securities purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. YA II PN\nhas informed us that each such broker-dealer participating in a distribution of securities by YA II PN may receive commissions from YA II PN and, if so, such commissions will not\nexceed customary brokerage commissions. Each Selling Stockholder has informed us that it does not have any written or oral agreement or understanding, directly or indirectly,\nwith any person to distribute the securities. The compensation paid to any such particular broker-dealer or agent by any such purchasers of shares of our Common Stock sold by\nYA II PN or any other Selling Stockholder may be less than or in excess of customary commissions.

The composition and responsibilities of each of the committees of our board of directors\nare described below. Members serve on these committees until their resignation or until otherwise determined by our board of directors. Our board of directors may establish other\ncommittees as it deems necessary or appropriate from time to time.\nAudit Committee\nAs of the date of this filing, our audit committee consists of Farooq M. Arjomand, Sehan Kim, and Andy Nasim. Each member of our audit committee can read and understand\nfundamental financial statements in accordance with applicable requirements. The chair of our audit committee is Farooq M. Arjomand, who our board of directors has determined\nis an “audit committee financial expert” within the meaning of SEC regulations. In arriving at these determinations, our board of directors has examined each audit committee\nmember’s scope of experience and the nature of their employment in the corporate finance sector.\nThe principal duties and responsibilities of our audit committee include, among other things:\n● hiring and selecting a qualified firm to serve as the independent registered public accounting firm to audit our financial statements;\n31\n● helping to ensure the independence and performance of the independent registered public accounting firm;\n● helping to maintain and foster an open avenue of communication between management and the independent registered public accounting firm;\n● discussing the scope and results of the audit with the independent registered public accounting firm, and reviewing, with management and the independent registered\npublic accounting firm, our interim and year-end operating results;\n● developing procedures for employees to submit concerns anonymously about questionable accounting or audit matters;\n● reviewing our policies on risk assessment and risk management;\n● reviewing related party transactions;\n● obtaining and reviewing a report by the independent registered public accounting firm at least annually, that describes its internal quality-control procedures, any material\nissues with such procedures, and any steps taken to deal with such issues when required by applicable law; and\n● approving (or, as permitted, pre-approving) all audit and all permissible non-audit services to be performed by the independent registered public accounting firm.\nOur audit committee operates under a written charter that satisfies the applicable listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nCompensation Committee\nOur compensation committee consists of Farooq M.

In adding additional members to our board of directors, we will consider each\ncandidate’s independence, skills and expertise based on a variety of factors, including the person’s experience or background in management, finance, regulatory matters and\ncorporate governance. Further, when identifying nominees to serve as a director, we expect that our board of directors will seek to create a board of directors that is strong in its\ncollective knowledge and has a diversity of skills and experience with respect to accounting and finance, management and leadership, vision and strategy, business operations,\nbusiness judgment, industry knowledge and corporate governance.\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\nIn filing our Registration Statement on Form S-1 on July 3, 2017, we adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to all our employees, officers and directors.

The committee will also administer our equity compensation plan and awards.\nElements of Compensation\nOur compensation program for NEOs consists of the following elements of compensation, each described in greater depth below:\n● base salaries;\n● performance-based bonuses;\n● equity-based incentive compensation; and\n● general benefits.\nBase Salary\nBase salaries are an annual fixed level of cash compensation to reflect each NEO’s performance, role and responsibilities, and retention considerations.\nPerformance-Based Bonus\nTo incentivize management to drive strong operating performance and reward achievement of our company’s business goals, our executive compensation program includes\nperformance-based bonuses for NEOs. Our Compensation Committee has established annual target performance-based bonuses for each NEO during the first quarter of the fiscal\nyear.\n34\nEquity Compensation\nWe may pay equity-based compensation to our NEOs in order to link our long-term results achieved for our stockholders and the rewards provided to NEOs, thereby ensuring that\nsuch NEOs have a continuing stake in our long-term success.\nGeneral Benefits\nOur NEOs are provided with other fringe benefits that we believe are commonly provided to similarly situated executives.\nSummary Compensation Table – Officers\nThe following table sets forth information concerning the compensation of our named executive officers for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nChange in\nPension\nNon-equity Value and\nIncentive Nonqualified\nStock Option plan deferred All other\nSalary Bonus Awards Awards compensation compensation Compensation Total\nName and principal position Year ($) ($) ($) ($) ($) ($) ($) ($)\nJay Kim\nChief Executive Officer 2023 150,000 -0- -0- -0- -0- -0- -0- 150,000\nStephan Kim\nChief Financial Officer 2023 144,000 -0- -0- -0- -0- -0- -0- 144,000\nJay Kim\nChief Executive Officer 2022 144,000 200,000 -0- -0- -0- -0- -0- 344,000\nStephan Kim\nChief Financial Officer 2022 83,000 -0- 56,000 -0- -0- -0- -0- 139,000\nEmployment Agreements\nEffective July 27, 2022, we executed an employment agreement with Stephan Kim for Mr. Kim to serve as our full time Chief Financial Officer, effective immediately.

Indemnification of Directors and Officers.\nUnder Delaware law, a Delaware corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action,\nsuit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than one by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that the person is or was a\ndirector, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, against\njudgments, fines, amounts paid in settlement and reasonable expenses, including attorneys’ fees actually and necessarily incurred as a result of such action or proceeding, if such\ndirector or officer acted, in good faith, for a purpose which such person reasonably believed to be, in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation and, in criminal\nactions or proceedings, in addition, had no reasonable cause to believe that such conduct was unlawful.\nIn the case of a derivative action, a Delaware corporation may indemnify any such person against expense, including attorneys’ fees actually and necessarily incurred by such\nperson in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if such director or officer if such director or officer acted, in good faith, for a purpose which such person\nreasonably believed to be, in or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation, except that no indemnification will be made in respect on any claim, issue or matter as to\nwhich such person will have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any other court in\nwhich such action was brought determines such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expense.\nDelaware Law permits a corporation to include in its certificate of incorporation a provision eliminating or limiting a director’s liability to a corporation or its stockholders for\nmonetary damages for breaches of fiduciary duty. Delaware Law provides, however, that liability for breaches of the duty of loyalty, acts or omissions not in good faith or\ninvolving intentional misconduct, or knowing violation of the law, and the unlawful purchase or redemption of stock or payment of unlawful purchase or redemption of stock or\npayment of unlawful dividends or the receipt of improper personal benefits cannot be eliminated or limited in this manner.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law and may, if and to the extent authorized by\nthe Board of Directors, indemnify our officers and any other person whom we have the power to indemnify against any liability, reasonable expense or other matter whatsoever.\nAny amendment, modification or repeal of the foregoing provisions shall be prospective only, and shall not affect any rights or protections of any of our directors existing as of the\ntime of such amendment, modification or repeal.\nWe may also, at the discretion of the Board of Directors, purchase and maintain insurance to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law on behalf of any of our directors, officers,\nemployees or agents against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity.\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling the\nRegistrant pursuant to the foregoing, the Registrant has been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities\nAct and is therefore unenforceable.\nII-1\nItem 15. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nThe following is a summary of all of our securities sold by us within the past three years which were not registered under the Securities Act:\nIn November 2023, we entered into an exchange agreement with an entity controlled by one of our directors whereby we issued for 1,666,667 shares of Common Stock for the\nsurrender and termination of a promissory note in the amount of $1 million.\nIn January 2024, we sold 1,666,667 shares of Common Stock to one of our directors for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1 million.\nIn February 2024, we entered into a Standby Equity Purchase Agreement (“SEPA”) with YA II PN, LTD.

Undertakings.\n(a) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:\n(1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement:\n(i) to include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;\n(ii) to reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post- effective amendment thereof)\nthat, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,\nany increase or decrease in the volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any\ndeviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b)\nif, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20 percent change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the\n“Calculation of Registration Fee” table in the effective registration statement; and\n(iii) to include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such\ninformation in the registration statement;\nprovided, however, that paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii), and (a)(1)(iii) above do not apply if the information required to be included in a post-effective amendment by those\nparagraphs is contained in reports filed with or furnished to the SEC by the registrant pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended\n(the “Exchange Act”) that are incorporated by reference in the registration statement, or is contained in a form of prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) that is a part of the\nregistration statement.\n(2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration\nstatement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.\n(3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered that remain unsold at the termination of the offering.\n(4) That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser:\n(i) each prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) shall be deemed to be part of the registration statement as of the date the filed prospectus was\ndeemed part of and included in the registration statement; and\n(ii) each prospectus required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2), (b)(5), or (b)(7) as part of a registration statement in reliance on Rule 430B relating to an offering\nmade pursuant to Rule 415(a)(1)(i), (vii), or (x) for the purpose of providing the information required by Section 10(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 shall be deemed\nto be part of and included in the registration statement as of the earlier of the date such form of prospectus is first used after effectiveness or the date of the first\ncontract of sale of securities in the offering described in the prospectus. As provided in Rule 430B, for liability purposes of the issuer and any person that is at\nthat date an underwriter, such date shall be deemed to be a new effective date of the registration statement relating to the securities in the registration statement\nto which that prospectus relates, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. Provided, however,\nthat no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed\nincorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of\nsale prior to such effective date, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration\nstatement or made in any such document immediately prior to such effective date.\nII-3\n(5) That, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each filing of the registrant’s annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange\nAct (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plan’s annual report pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act) that is incorporated by reference in\nthe registration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time\nshall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.\n(i) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant\npursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as\nexpressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by\nthe registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding)\nis asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its\ncounsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is\nagainst public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.\nII-4\nSIGNATURES\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, the registrant has duly caused this registration statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly\nauthorized in the Brea, California, on September 27, 2024.\nREBORN COFFEE, INC.\nBy: /s/ Jay Kim\nJay Kim\nChief Executive Officer\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, this amendment no. 1 to registration statement on Form S-1 has been signed by the following persons in the capacities\nand on the dates indicated.\nSignature Title Date\n/s/ Jay Kim Chief Executive Officer and Director September 27, 2024\nJay Kim (Principal Executive Officer)\n* Chief Financial Officer September 27, 2024\nStephan Kim (Principal Financial Officer and Principal\nAccounting Officer)\n*\nFarooq M.

We encourage you to review all of the important information\ncontained in the proxy materials contained herein or accessed via our website before voting.\nSolicitation and Voting Procedures\nSolicitation. The s olicitation of proxies will be conducted by mail, and we will bear all attendant costs.\nThese costs will include the expense of preparing and mailing proxy materials for the Annual Meeting and\nreimbursements paid to brokerage firms and others for their expenses incurred in forwarding solicitation materials\nregarding the Annual Meeting to beneficial owners of our shares entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. We\nmay conduct further solicitation personally, telephonically, electronically or by facsimile through our officers,\ndirectors and regular employees, none of whom would receive additional compensation for assisting with the\nsolicitation. We do not intend, but reserve the right, to use the services of a third party solicitation firm to assist\nus in soliciting proxies.\nVoting. Stoc k holders of record may authorize the proxies named in the enclosed proxy cards to vote their\nshares in the following manner:\n• by mail, by marking the enclosed proxy card(s) applicable to you as the holder of shares of our\nCommon Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock”), signing and dating it, and returning it\nin the postage-paid envelope provided;\n• by telephone, using any touch-tone telephone to transmit your voting instructions by calling the\nnumber specified on your proxy card.

Stockholders voting by the Internet need not return the proxy card(s) applicable to them\nas the holder of shares of our Common Stock.\nRevocability of Proxies. Any proxy given pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked by the person\ngiving it at any time before it is exercised in the same manner in which it was given, or by delivering to Stephan\nKim, the Chief Financial Officer of Reborn Coffee, Inc., at 580 N. Berry Street, Brea, CA 92821, a written notice of\nrevocation or a properly executed proxy bearing a later date, or by attending the Annual Meeting and giving\nnotice of your intention to vote in person.\nVoting Procedure. The p resence at the Annual Meeting of a majority of our outstanding shares of\nvoting stock entitled to vote and represented either in person or by proxy, will constitute a quorum for the\ntransaction of business at the Annual Meeting. The close of business on September 23, 2024, has been fixed as\nthe record date (the “Record Date”) for determining the holders of shares of our Common Stock entitled to notice\nof and to vote at the Annual Meeting. Each share of Common Stock outstanding on the Record Date is entitled\nto one vote on all matters.\n1\nAs of the Record Date, there were [__] shares of Common Stock outstanding, which shares were entitled\nto an aggregate of [__] votes at the Annual Meeting. Under Delaware law, stockholders will not have appraisal\nor similar rights in connection with any proposal set forth in this Proxy Statement.\nVotes will be tabulated by the persons appointed by the Board of Directors to act as inspectors of election\nfor the Annual Meeting. Shares represented by a properly executed and delivered proxy will be voted at the\nAnnual Meeting and, when instructions have been given by the stockholder, will be voted in accordance with\nthose instructions. If no instructions are given, the shares will be voted FOR Proposal Nos. 1, 2, and 3 as\napplicable.\nAbstentions and broker non-votes will each be counted as present for the purpose of determining whether\na quorum is present at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the\noutcome of Proposal No. 1. Abstentions will have the effect of being cast “against” Proposal Nos. 2 and 3, but\nbroker non-votes will have no effect on such proposal.\nA broker non-vote occurs when a broker submits a proxy card with respect to shares of Common Stock\nheld in a fiduciary capacity (typically referred to as being held in “street name”), but declines to vote on a\nparticular matter because the broker has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner. If the\nbeneficial owner does not provide voting instructions, the broker or nominee can still vote the shares with\nrespect to matters that are considered to be “routine,” but not with respect to “non-routine” matters. In the event\nthat a broker, bank, or other agent indicates on a proxy that it does not have discretionary authority to vote\ncertain shares on a non-routine proposal, then those shares will be treated as broker non-votes. We believe that\nall proposals in this proxy statement, other than the ratification of the independent registered public accounting\nfirm (Proposal No. 2) are non-routine proposals; therefore, your broker, bank or other agent will only be entitled\nto vote on Proposal No. 2 at the Annual Meeting without your instructions.\nStockholders do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors.\nVote Required.\nFor the election of directors (Proposal No. 1), the nominees who receive a plurality of votes from the shares\npresent in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be elected.\nFor the approval of the ratification of our independent registered public accounting firm (Proposal No. 2),\nand the approval of the issuance of our shares of Common Stock to YA II PN, LTD.

Under these rules, beneficial ownership generally includes any shares as to which the individual or entity\nhas sole or shared voting power or investment power and includes any shares that an individual or entity has\nthe right to acquire beneficial ownership of within 60 days of the Determination Date, through the exercise of any\noption, warrant or similar right (such instruments being deemed to be “presently exercisable”). In computing the\nnumber of shares beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, shares of our\nCommon Stock that could be issued upon the exercise of presently exercisable options and warrants are\nconsidered to be outstanding. These shares, however, are not considered outstanding as of the Determination\nDate when computing the percentage ownership of each other person.\nTo our knowledge, except as indicated in the footnotes to the following table, and subject to state\ncommunity property laws where applicable, all beneficial owners named in the following table have sole voting\nand investment power with respect to all shares shown as beneficially owned by them.

The table below sets\nforth such experiences, qualifications, attributes and skills, and identifies the ones that each director nominee\npossess.\nFarooq M.\nAttributes Arjomand Jay Kim Sehan Kim Dennis Egidi Andy Nasim Jennifer Tan\nFinancial Experience x x x x x x\nPublic Board Experience x x\nIndustry Experience x x x x x\nScientific Experience x x\nCommercial Experience x x x x x x\nCorporate Governance\nExperience x x x x x x\nCapital Markets\nExperience x x x x x\nManagement Experience x x x x x x\nArrangements Regarding Director Nominations\nThere are no arrangements regarding the nomination of our directors.\nFamily Relationships\nThere are no familial relationships between any of our executive officers and directors.\nDirector or Officer Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings\nOur directors and executive officers were not involved in any legal proceedings as described in\nItem 401(f) of Regulation S-K in the past ten years.\nIndependence of the Board of Directors\nThe Board of Directors utilizes Nasdaq’s standards for determining the independence of its members. In\napplying these standards, the Board of Directors considers commercial, industrial, banking, consulting, legal,\naccounting, charitable and familial relationships, among others, in assessing the independence of directors, and\nmust disclose any basis for determining that a relationship is not material. The Board of Directors has determined\nthat the following four (4) director nominees, namely Farooq M. Arjomand, Sehan Kim, Andy Nasim, and Jennifer\nTan, are independent directors within the meaning of the Nasdaq independence standards. In making these\nindependence determinations, the Board of Directors did not exclude from consideration as immaterial any\nrelationship potentially compromising the independence of any of the above directors.\nMeetings of the Board of Directors\nThe Board of Directors held 4 meetings during our 2023 fiscal year. During our 2023 fiscal year, each\nmember of our Board of Directors attended more than 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board of\nDirectors that were held during the time that they served as members of the Board of Directors. We do not have\na formal policy regarding attendance by members of the Board of Directors at the annual meeting of\nstockholders, but we strongly encourage all members of the Board of Directors to attend our annual meetings\nand expect such attendance except in the event of extraordinary circumstances.\n7\nCommittees of the Board of Directors\nThe Board of Directors has established and currently maintains the following two standing committees: the\nAudit Committee and the Compensation Committee.\nCurrently, the Audit Committee consists of Farooq Arjomand (Chair), Andy Nasim and Sehan Kim, and the\nCompensation Committee consists of Andy Nasim (Chair), Farooq Arjomand and Sehan Kim. It is anticipated\nthat, following the Annual Meeting, the committee members will remain the same. During the 2023 fiscal year, the\nAudit Committee held 2 meeting and the Compensation Committee held 2 meeting. Each member of the Board of\nDirectors attended at least 75% of the meetings that were held during the periods when they served as members\nof such committee.\nAudit Committee. The A udit Committee provides assistance to the Board of Directors in fulfilling its\noversight responsibilities regarding the integrity of financial statements, our compliance with applicable legal\nand regulatory requirements, the integrity of our financial reporting processes including its systems of internal\naccounting and financial controls, the performance of our internal audit function and independent auditor and\nour financial policy matters by approving the services performed by our independent accountants and reviewing\ntheir reports regarding our accounting practices and systems of internal accounting controls. The Audit\nCommittee also oversees the audit efforts of our independent accountants and takes action as it deems\nnecessary to satisfy itself that the accountants are independent of management. Mr. Arjomand, Mr. Nasim, and\nMr. Sehan Kim meet the definition of “independent directors” for the purposes of serving on an Audit\nCommittee under applicable SEC and Nasdaq Stock Market rules, and we are in compliance with these\nindependence requirements. In addition, Mr. Arjomand qualifies as our “audit committee financial experts,” as\nsuch term is defined in Item 407 of Regulation S-K.\nIn general, an “audit committee financial expert” is an individual member of the audit committee or Board of\nDirectors who:\n• understands generally accepted accounting principles and financial statements;\n• is able to assess the general application of such principles in connection with accounting for\nestimates, accruals and reserves;\n• has experience preparing, auditing, analyzing or evaluating financial statements comparable to the\nbreadth and complexity to our financial statements;\n• understands internal controls over financial reporting; and\n• understands audit committee functions.\nOur Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for the Audit Committee, which is available on our\ncorporate website at https://www.reborncoffee.net/corporate-governance/governance-documents/.\nCompensation Committee. The C ompensation Committee oversees our overall compensation structure,\npolicies and programs, and assesses whether our compensation structure establishes appropriate incentives for\nofficers and employees. The Compensation Committee reviews and approves corporate goals and objectives\nrelevant to compensation of our chief executive officer and other executive officers, evaluates the performance of\nthese officers in light of those goals and objectives, sets the compensation of these officers based on such\nevaluations and reviews and recommends to the Board of Directors any employment-related agreements, any\nproposed severance arrangements or change in control or similar agreements with these officers. The\nCompensation Committee also grants stock options and other awards under our stock plans. The Compensation\nCommittee will review and self-evaluate, at least annually, the performance of the Compensation Committee and\nits members and the adequacy of the charter of the Compensation Committee.\nOur Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for the Compensation Committee, which is available\nat https://www.reborncoffee.net/corporate-governance/governance-documents/.\nSelection of Board Candidates\nOur Board of Directors does not have a nominating committee that nominates candidates for election to\nour Board of Directors. That function is performed by our Board of Directors. Each member of our Board of\nDirectors participates in the consideration of director nominees. Our Board of Directors believes that it can\nadequately fulfill\n8\nthe functions of a nominating committee without having to appoint an additional committee to perform that\nfunction. Our Board of Directors believes that not having a separate nominating committee saves the\nadministrative expense that would be incurred in maintaining such a committee, and saves time for directors who\nwould serve on a nominating committee if it were established. As there is no nominating committee, there is no\nnominating committee charter.\nAt least a majority of our independent directors participate in the consideration of director nominees.\nThese directors are independent, as independence for nominating committee members is defined in the Nasdaq\nlisting standards. After discussion and evaluation of potential nominees, the full Board of Directors selects the\ndirector nominees.\nIn selecting candidates for the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors begins by determining whether\nthe incumbent directors whose terms expire at the annual meeting of stockholders desire and are qualified to\ncontinue their service on the Board of Directors. If there are positions on the Board of Directors for which the\nBoard of Directors will not be re-nominating an incumbent director, or if there is a vacancy on the Board of\nDirectors, the Board of Directors will solicit recommendations for nominees from persons whom the Board\nbelieves are likely to be familiar with qualified candidates, including members of our Board of Directors and our\nsenior management. The Board of Directors may also engage a search firm to assist in the identification of\nqualified candidates. The Board of Directors will review and evaluate those candidates whom it believes merit\nserious consideration, taking into account all available information concerning the candidate, the existing\ncomposition and mix of talent and expertise on the Board of Directors and other factors that it deems relevant. In\nconducting its review and evaluation, the Board of Directors may solicit the views of management and other\nmembers of the Board of Directors, and may conduct interviews of proposed candidates.\nThe Board of Directors generally requires that all candidates for the Board of Directors be of the highest\npersonal and professional integrity and have demonstrated exceptional ability and judgment. The Board of\nDirectors will consider whether such candidate will be effective, in conjunction with the other members of the\nBoard of Directors, in collectively serving the long-term interests of our stockholders. In addition, the Board of\nDirectors requires that all candidates have no interests that materially conflict with our interests and those of our\nstockholders, have meaningful management, advisory or policy making experience, have a general appreciation\nof the major business issues facing us and have adequate time to devote to service on the Board of Directors.\nThe Board of Directors will consider stockholder recommendations for nominees to fill director positions,\nprovided that the Board of Directors will not entertain stockholder nominations from stockholders who do not\nmeet the eligibility criteria for submission of stockholder proposals under Rule 14a-8 of Regulation 14A under the\nExchange Act. Stockholders may submit written recommendations for nominees to the Board of Directors,\ntogether with appropriate biographical information and qualifications of such nominees as required by our\nBylaws, to our Secretary following the same procedures as described in “Stockholder Communications” in this\nProxy Statement. In order for a nominee for directorship submitted by a stockholder to be considered, such\nrecommendation must be received by the Secretary by the time period set forth in our most recent proxy\nstatement for the submission of stockholder proposals under Rule 14a-8 of Regulation 14A under the\nExchange Act. The Secretary shall then deliver any such communications to the Chairman of the Board of\nDirectors. The Board of Directors will evaluate stockholder recommendations for candidates for the Board of\nDirectors using the same criteria as for other candidates, except that the Board of Directors may consider, as one\nof the factors in its evaluation of stockholder recommended candidates, the size and duration of the interest of\nthe recommending stockholder or stockholder group in our equity.\nBoard Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight\nThe Board of Directors is committed to promoting our effective independent governance. Our Board of\nDirectors believes it is in the best interests of the stockholders and the company for the Board of Directors to\nhave the flexibility to select the best director to serve as chairman at any given time, regardless of whether that\ndirector is an independent director or the chief executive officer. Consequently, we do not have a policy\ngoverning whether the roles of chairman of the board and chief executive officer should be separate or\ncombined. This decision is made by our Board of Directors, based on the best interests of the company\nconsidering the circumstances at the time.\nThe leadership structure of the Board of Directors currently consists of a Chairman of the Board of\nDirectors who oversees the Board of Directors meetings and a Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors. We\ncurrently have two different people holding the roles of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive\nOfficer in recognition of the differences between the two roles. Our Board of Directors believes this division of\nresponsibility is an effective\n9\napproach for addressing the risks we face and increasing management accountability and improving the ability\nof the board to monitor whether management’s actions are in the best interests of the company and its\nstockholders. We have determined that the leadership structure of our Board of Directors has permitted our\nBoard of Directors to fulfill its duties effectively and efficiently and is appropriate given the size and scope of our\ncompany and its financial condition.\nOur Board of Directors and the Audit Committee thereof is responsible for overseeing the risk management\nprocesses on behalf of our company. The Board of Directors and, to the extent applicable, the Audit Committee,\nreceive and review periodic reports from management, auditors, legal counsel and others, as considered\nappropriate regarding our company’s assessment of risks. Where applicable, the Audit Committee reports\nregularly to the full Board of Directors with respect to risk management processes. The Audit Committee and the\nfull Board of Directors focus on the most significant risks facing our company and our company’s general risk\nmanagement strategy, and also ensure that risks undertaken by our company are consistent with the Board of\nDirector’s appetite for risk. While the Board of Directors oversees the risk management of our company,\nmanagement is responsible for day-to-day risk management processes. We believe this division of\nresponsibilities is the most effective approach for addressing the risks facing our company and that our Board of\nDirectors leadership structure supports this approach.\nStockholder Communications\nAll stockholder communications must: (i) be addressed to our Secretary or Board of Directors at our\naddress; (ii) be in writing in print and delivered in person or by first class United States mail postage prepaid or\nby reputable overnight delivery service; (iii) be signed by the stockholder sending the communication;\n(iv) indicate whether the communication is intended for the entire Board of Directors, a committee thereof, or the\nindependent directors; (v) if the communication relates to a stockholder proposal or director nominee, the name\nand address of the stockholder, the class and number of shares held by the stockholder, a description of any\nagreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to the nomination or other business between or among\nsuch stockholder or beneficial owner and any other person, including without limitation any agreements that\nwould be required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 5 or Item 6 of Exchange Act Schedule 13D (regardless of\nwhether the requirement to file a Schedule 13D is applicable to the stockholder or beneficial owner) and a\ndescription of any agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any derivative or short positions, profit\ninterests, options, hedging transactions, and borrowed or loaned shares) that has been entered into as of the\ndate of the stockholder’s notice by, or on behalf of, such stockholder or beneficial owner, the effect or intent of\nwhich is to mitigate loss, manage risk or benefit from changes in the share price of any class of our capital stock,\nor maintain, increase or decrease the voting power of the stockholder or beneficial owner with respect to shares\nof our stock; provided that we will not entertain stockholder proposals or stockholder nominations from\nstockholders who do not meet the eligibility and procedural criteria for submission of stockholder proposals\nunder Rule 14a-8 of Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act; and (vi) if the communication relates to a director\nnominee being recommended by the stockholder, must include all other information as required by our Bylaws,\nincluding without limitation, appropriate biographical information of the candidate.\nUpon receipt of a stockholder communication that is compliant with the requirements identified above, the\nSecretary shall promptly deliver such communication to the appropriate member(s) of the Board of Directors or\ncommittee member(s) identified by the stockholder as the intended recipient of such communication by\nforwarding the communication to either the chairman of the Board of Directors with a copy to the Chief Executive\nOfficer, the chairman of the applicable committee, or to each of the independent directors, as the case may be.\nThe Chief Executive Officer may, in his sole discretion and acting in good faith, provide copies of any such\nstockholder communication to any one or more of our directors and executive officers, except that in processing\nany stockholder communication addressed to the independent directors, the Chief Executive Officer may not\ncopy any member of management in forwarding such communications. In addition, the Chief Executive Officer\nmay, in his sole discretion and acting in good faith, not forward certain items if they are deemed of a commercial\nor frivolous nature or otherwise inappropriate for consideration by the intended recipient and any such\ncorrespondence may be forwarded elsewhere in our company for review and possible response.\n10\nCERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nPolicies and Procedures for Related Person Transactions\nOur Board of Directors has adopted a written related person transaction policy, which sets forth the\npolicies and procedures for the review and approval or ratification of related party transactions.

BCRG has served as our independent registered public accounting\nfirm since May 14, 2024.\nDuring our two most recent fiscal years and the subsequent interim period through May 14, 2024, neither\nwe nor anyone on our behalf consulted with BCRG regarding (i) the application of accounting principles to a\nspecified transaction, either completed or proposed; or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our\nfinancial statements, and neither a written report nor oral advice was provided that BCRG concluded was an\nimportant factor considered by us in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting\nissue; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of\nRegulation S-K and its related instructions) or a reportable event (as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of\nRegulation S-K).\nWe are not required to seek stockholder approval for the appointment of BCRG, however, the Audit\nCommittee and the full Board of Directors believe it is sound corporate practice to seek such approval. If the\nappointment is not ratified, the Audit Committee will investigate the reasons for stockholder rejection and will re-\nconsider the appointment. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may direct the\nappointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it\ndetermines that such change would be in the best interests of us and our stockholders.\nRepresentatives of BCRG are not expected to be present at the Annual Meeting. However, we will provide\ncontact information for BCRG to any stockholders who would like to contact the firm with questions.\nPrior Audit Firms\nKreit & Chiu CPA LLP (“K&C”) (formerly known as Paris, Kreit & Chiu CPA LLP) served as our\nindependent registered public accounting firm from 2020 to May 1, 2023. At such time, we amicably terminated\nthe engagement of K&C, and such termination was approved by our Board of Directors and Audit Committee.\nThe reports of K&C on our financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021\ndid not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to\nuncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, with the exception of providing a qualification as to our ability\nto continue as a going concern. During our two most recent fiscal years and the subsequent interim period\nthrough May 1, 2023, there were no disagreements with K&C on any matter of accounting principles or practices,\nfinancial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreement(s), if not resolved to the\nsatisfaction of K&C, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement(s) in\nconnection with its report. During our two most recent fiscal years and the subsequent interim period through\nMay 1, 2023, there were no reportable events of the type described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.\nBF Borgers CPA PC (“BF Borgers”) served as our independent registered accounting public firm from\nMay 1, 2023 to May 7, 2024. At such time, we terminated the engagement of BF Borgers following the SEC’s\norder declaring that BF Borgers is not permitted to appear or practice before the SEC for reasons described in the\nSEC’s Order Instituting Public Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8A of the\nSecurities Act of 1933, Sections 4C and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 102(e) of the SEC’s\nRules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order, dated\nMay 3, 2024. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and the subsequent interim period through May 7,\n2024, there were no disagreements, as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K, with BF\nBorgers on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or\nprocedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to BF Borgers’ satisfaction, would have caused BF Borgers to\nmake reference to such disagreements in its audit reports. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and\nthe subsequent interim period through May 7, 2024, there were no reportable events within the meaning of\nItem 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.\n12\nFees Billed to the Company in fiscal years 2023 and 2022\nThe following table sets forth the fees billed to us by our former principal auditor, K&C, for professional\nservices rendered during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and our former principal auditor, BF Borgers,\nfor professional services rendered during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023:\n31-Dec-23 31-Dec-22\nAudit fees(1) $ 85,000 $ 60,000\nAudit related fees(2) — —\nTax fees(3) — —\nAll other fees — —\nTotal fees $ 85,000 $ 60,000\n____________\n(1) Audit Fees — Audit fees consist of fees billed for the audit of our annual financial statements and the review of the\ninterim consolidated financial statements.\n(2) Audit-Related Fees — These consisted principally of the aggregate fees related to audits that are not included Audit\nFees.\n(3) Tax Fees — Tax fees consist of aggregate fees for tax compliance and tax advice, including the review and preparation\nof our various jurisdictions’ income tax returns.\nNo fees have yet been billed by our current principal auditor, BCRG.\nPre-Approval Policies and Procedures\nThe Audit Committee has the authority to appoint or replace our independent registered public accounting\nfirm (subject, if applicable, to stockholder ratification). The Audit Committee is also responsible for the\ncompensation and oversight of the work of the independent registered public accounting firm (including\nresolution of disagreements between management and the independent registered public accounting firm\nregarding financial reporting) for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or related work. The\nindependent registered public accounting firm was engaged by, and reports directly to, the Audit Committee.\nThe Audit Committee pre-approves all audit services and permitted non-audit services (including the fees\nand terms thereof) to be performed for us by our independent registered public accounting firm, subject to the de\nminimis exceptions for non-audit services described in Section 10A(i)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rule 2-01(c)\n(7)(i)(C) of Regulation S-X, provided that all such excepted services are subsequently approved prior to the\ncompletion of the audit. We have complied with the procedures set forth above, and the Audit Committee has\notherwise complied with the provisions of its charter.\nVote Required and Board of Directors’ Recommendation\nAssuming a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present at the Annual\nMeeting and entitled to vote, either in person or by proxy, is required for approval of Proposal No. 2. For\npurposes of the ratification of our independent registered public accounting firm, abstentions will have the same\neffect as a vote against this proposal, and broker non-votes will have no effect on the result of the vote. Proxies\nsubmitted without direction pursuant to this solicitation will be voted “FOR” approval of Proposal No. 2.\nTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS\nVOTE “FOR” PROPOSAL NO. 2.\n13\nPROPOSAL NO. 3\nPROPOSAL TO APPROVE THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK TO YORKVILLE\nPURSUANT TO THE NOTE AND/OR THE WARRANT, IN EXCESS OF THE EXCHANGE CAP\nWe are seeking stockholder approval, for purposes of complying with Listing Rule 5635(d) (“Listing\nRule 5635(d)”) of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”), for the issuance of up to $800,000 in shares of our\nCommon Stock to Yorkville pursuant to the Note.\nThe information set forth in this Proposal No. 3 is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the\nNote attached as exhibit 10.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 22, 2024.\nStockholders are urged to carefully read these documents.\nBackground\nOn May 20, 2024, we issued the Note in the original principal amount of $800,000 and related Warrant to\npurchase 175,000 shares (the “Warrant Shares”) of our Common Stock to EF Hutton YA Fund, LP (the “EF\nHutton Fund”), a fund co-managed by Yorkville Advisors Global, LLC. EF Hutton Fund paid a purchase price of\n$720,000 to us for the Note and Warrant. In addition, we paid a $36,000 financial advisory fee paid to EF Hutton\nLLC. The Note was subsequently assigned by the EF Hutton Fund to Yorkville effective on July 25, 2024.\nThe Note accrues interest at an annual rate of 0%, however, the interest rate will increase to an annual rate\nof 18% upon the occurrence of an event of default. Beginning on August 15, 2024, and continuing on the\nsame day of each successive calendar month thereafter, we are required to make installment payments on the\nNote until it is fully repaid or Yorkville has converted the outstanding balance into shares of Common Stock. We\nhave failed to make the first payment that was due on August 15, 2024, and thus the May Note is accruing\ninterest at the default rate of 18%. At any time, subject to certain ownership limitations, Yorkville may convert\nany portion of the outstanding and unpaid principal, interest, or other amounts outstanding under the Note into\nCommon Stock at a price equal to $2.29 per share (as may be reduced to a variable price equal to 85% of the\nlowest daily VWAP during the ten (10) consecutive trading days immediately preceding a conversion, but not be\nlower than $1.00 per share). In addition, the Note grants us the right to redeem early a portion or all of the amount\nunder the Note prior to its maturity or conversion at a 15% premium. The maturity date of the Note is May 20,\n2025 although it may be extended at the option of Yorkville.\nThe Warrant is exercisable by Yorkville at any time after issuance until the date that is 60 months after the\nissuance date. The Warrant is exercisable into Warrant Shares at an exercise price of $2.29 per share, subject to\nadjustment as described in the Warrant. If a registration statement covering the resale of the Warrant Shares is\nnot available by August 15, 2024, then Yorkville may exercise the Warrant in whole or in part on a cashless basis.\nPursuant to the Note, we agreed to, at any time after July 15, 2024 and upon written notice from Yorkville,\nfile a registration statement within 30 days of such notice on Form S-3 or Form S-1 covering the resale by\nYorkville of Common Stock underlying the Note.\nThe Note contains customary representations and warranties for the benefit of Yorkville. The\nrepresentations, warranties and covenants contained in the Note were made only for purposes of the Note and\nas of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreement and are subject to certain\nimportant limitations. Additionally, while any amount remains outstanding on the Note, we have agreed not to\neffect any transaction involving a Variable Rate Transaction (as defined in the Note) and we granted Yorkville a\nright of first refusal on any financing transaction pursuant to which we propose to issue and sell our securities.\nYorkville does not have the right to convert any portion of the Note to the extent that after giving effect to such\nconversion, Yorkville would beneficially own 4.99% of the number of Common Stock outstanding immediately\nafter giving effect to such conversion or receipt of Common Stock as interest. The provisions of the 4.99%\nbeneficial ownership limitation can be waived by Yorkville (but only as to itself) upon not less than 65 days prior\nnotice to us.\n14\nReasons for Proposal No. 3\nOur Board of Directors has determined that the Note, the Warrant, and our ability to issue Common Stock\nto Yorkville pursuant to the Note and/or the Warrant is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders\nbecause the Note and Warrant provided us with capital in exchange for the issuance of equity. Accordingly, we\nare seeking shareholder approval of Proposal No. 3 in order to comply with the terms of the Note, the Warrant,\nand Listing Rule 5635(d).\nListing Rule 5635(d) requires stockholder approval in connection with a transaction, other than a public\noffering, involving the sale or issuance by the issuer of Common Stock (or securities convertible into or\nexchangeable for Common Stock) equal to 20% or more of the Common Stock or 20% or more of the voting power\nof such company outstanding before the issuance for a price that is less than the lower of: (i) the closing price of\nthe Common Stock immediately preceding the signing of the binding agreement for the issuance of such\nsecurities and (ii) the average closing price of the Common Stock for the five trading days immediately preceding\nthe signing of the binding agreement for the issuance of such securities.\nTherefore, we are seeking stockholder approval to issue more than 20% of our outstanding Common Stock\nto Yorkville pursuant to the Note and/or the Warrant in compliance with Listing Rule 5635(d). In addition, we are\nseeking stockholder approval for waiver of the “Exchange Cap” limitation in the Note.\nPotential Consequences if Proposal No. 3 is Not Approved\nIf the shareholders do not approve Proposal No. 3, we will be unable to issue shares of Common Stock in\nexcess of the Exchange Cap to Yorkville upon the receipt of a notice of conversion pursuant to the Note or\nnotice of exercise of the Warrant, thereby requiring us to repay the Note in cash at its maturity. Accordingly, if\nshareholder approval of Proposal No. 3 is not obtained, we may need to seek alternative sources of financing,\nwhich financing may not be available on advantageous terms, or at all, and which may result in the incurrence of\nadditional transaction expenses. Our ability to successfully implement our business plans and ultimately\ngenerate value for our shareholders is dependent on our ability to maximize capital raising opportunities.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Proposal No. 3\nEach share of Common Stock that would be issuable to Yorkville would have the same rights and\nprivileges as each of our currently outstanding shares of Common Stock. The issuance of Common Stock to\nYorkville pursuant to the terms of the Note and the Warrant will not affect the rights of the holders of our\noutstanding shares of Common Stock, but such issuances will have a dilutive effect on our existing\nshareholders, including the voting power and economic rights of existing shareholders, and may result in a\ndecline in our stock price or greater price volatility. Further, any sales in the public market of our Common Stock\nissuable to Yorkville could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Common Stock.\nInterests of Directors and Executive Officers\nOur directors and executive officers have no substantial interests, directly or indirectly, in the matters set\nforth in this Proposal No. 3 except to the extent of their ownership of shares of our Common Stock.\nVote Required and Board of Directors’ Recommendation\nAssuming a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present at the Annual\nMeeting, either in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote, is required for approval of this Proposal No. 3. For\npurposes of the approval of Proposal No. 3, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against this proposal,\nand broker non-votes, if any, will have no effect on the result of the vote.\nTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS\nVOTE “FOR” PROPOSAL NO. 3.\n15\nREPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, on behalf of the Board of Directors, serves as an\nindependent and objective party to monitor and provide general oversight of the integrity of our financial\nstatements, the independent registered public accounting firm’s qualifications and independence, the\nperformance of the independent registered public accounting firm, the compliance by us with legal and\nregulatory requirements and our standards of business conduct. The Audit Committee performs these oversight\nresponsibilities in accordance with its Audit Committee Charter.\nOur management is responsible for preparing our financial statements and our financial reporting process.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an independent audit of our\nconsolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board (“PCAOB”). The Audit Committee’s responsibility is to administer and oversee these\nprocesses.\nHowever, the members of the Audit Committee are not practicing certified public accountants or\nprofessional auditors and rely, without independent verification, on information provided to them and on the\nrepresentations made by management, and on the report issued by the independent registered public accounting\nfirm.\nThe Audit Committee met with the independent registered public accounting firm, with and without\nmanagement present, to discuss the audit plan, the results of their examinations, and the overall quality of our\nfinancial reporting.\nIn this context, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023 with management and with the independent registered public accounting firm. The\nAudit Committee has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to\nbe discussed by Auditing Standard No. 16, Communications with Audit Committees, which includes, among\nother items, matters related to the conduct of the audit of our annual financial statements.\nThe Audit Committee has also received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent\nregistered public accounting firm required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent\naccountant’s communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the\nindependent registered public accounting firm the issue of its independence from us and management. In\naddition, the Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of any non-audit services by the\nindependent registered public accounting firm in the year ended December 31, 2023 is compatible with\nmaintaining the registered public accounting firm’s independence and has concluded that it is.\nBased on its review of the audited financial statements and the various discussions noted above, the\nAudit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as amended by Form 10-K/A filed on July 8,\n2024 and Form 10-K/A filed on August 15, 2024.\nRespectfully,\nFarooq M.

The employment agreement is\nan at-will agreement and is terminable by either party at any time.\nExcept as set forth above we do not currently have employment agreements with any of our NEOs.\nPerformance-Based Bonus\nTo incentivize management to drive strong operating performance and reward achievement of our\ncompany’s business goals, our executive compensation program includes performance-based bonuses for\nNEOs. Our Compensation Committee has established annual target performance-based bonuses for each NEO\nduring the first quarter of the fiscal year.\nOutstanding Equity Awards at the Year End\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were no outstanding equity awards for each of the NEOs.\nPayments Upon Termination or Change in Control\nNone of our NEOs are entitled to receive payments or other benefits upon termination of employment or a\nchange in control.\nRetirement Plans\nWe do not maintain any deferred compensation, retirement, pension or profit-sharing plans.\n17\nEmployee Benefits\nAll of our full-time employees are eligible to participate in health and welfare plans maintained by us,\nincluding:\n• medical, dental and vision benefits; and\n• basic life and accidental death & dismemberment insurance.\nOur NEOs participate in these plans on the same basis as other eligible employees. We do not maintain\nany supplemental health and welfare plans for our NEOs.\nNonqualified Deferred Compensation\nOur NEOs did not earn any nonqualified deferred compensation benefits from us during the years 2022 and\n2023.\nDirector Compensation\nOur non-employee directors did not receive any compensation for serving as a member of our Board of\nDirectors during the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nPay Versus Performance Table\nAs required by Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the\nrelationship between executive compensation actually paid and certain financial performance of the company.\nWe are permitted to report as a “smaller reporting company” as defined under the U.S. federal securities laws.\nAccordingly, we have not included a tabular list of financial performance measures, and the table below does not\ninclude a column for a “Company-Selected Measure” as defined in Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K.\nAverage Value of\nSummary initial fixed\nCompensation $100\nTable Total for Average Investment\nSummary non-PEO Compensation Based on\nCompensation Compensation Named Actually Paid Total Net (Loss)\nTable Total for Actually Paid Executive to Non-PEO Shareholder Income(6)\nYear PEO(1) to PEO(2) Officers(3) NEOs(4) Return(5) (in thousands)\n($) ($) ($) ($) ($) ($)\n2023 150,000 150,000 144,000 144,000 (88.13) (3,600)\n2022 344,000 344,000 139,000 183,800 (82.91) (3,555)\n____________\n(1) Represent the amounts of total compensation reported for our Principal Executive Officer (“PEO”), Jay Kim, during\neach corresponding year in the “Total” column of the Summary Compensation Table above.\n(2) Represents the amount of “compensation actually paid” to our PEO, as computed in accordance with Item 402(v) of\nRegulation S-K, with no adjustments because no equity compensation was paid to our PEO.\n(3) Represents the average of the amounts reported for our NEOs as a group (excluding our PEO) (“non-PEO NEOs”) in\neach applicable year in the “Total” column of the Summary Compensation Table above. In the fiscal year ending\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the only non-PEO NEO was Stephan Kim.\n(4) Represents the average amount of “compensation actually paid” to the Non-PEO NEOs, as computed in accordance\nwith Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K. The dollar amounts do not reflect the actual average compensation earned or paid\nto the Non-PEO NEOs during the applicable year. To calculate the average compensation actually paid, as determined\nin accordance with SEC rules, to the Non-PEO NEOs in 2022, the average of the Summary Compensation Table total\nfor the Non-PEO NEOs is adjusted to reflect the changes in the value of equity awards, described in the following:\n(1) $56,000 was deducted from the total, representing the amount reported in the Stock Awards column of the\nSummary Compensation Table; and (2) $100,800 was added representing the fair value of the equity awards granted\nin 2022 that vested in 2022.\n(5) Total Share Return (TSR) is calculated by dividing the difference between our share price at the end and the beginning\nof the measurement period by our share price at the end of the measurement period and is determined based on the\nvalue of an initial fixed investment of $100 in our Common Stock at the beginning of the measurement period. No\ndividends were paid in 2023 or 2022. The calculation of TSR included in this column is based on a measurement\nperiod beginning on August 12, 2022, the day our Common Stock began trading on Nasdaq.\n(6) The dollar amounts reported represent the amount of net loss reflected in our consolidated audited financial\nstatements for the applicable years.\n18\nNarrative Disclosure to Pay Versus Performance Table\nOur Compensation Committee believes the PEO’s base salary reflects the value of the executive position\nand attributes the PEO brings to the company, including tenure, experience, skill level and performance. No\nspecific weights have been assigned to those factors. The Compensation Committee periodically reviews the\nsalaries of the PEO and NEOs and adjusts them as needed to maintain market positioning and consistency with\nother similarly situated executive officers and their evolving responsibilities.\nBonus payments when made have not been tied to any financial performance measure and have been and\nare planned to continue to be discretionary based on the evaluation of each individual’s performance, change in\nresponsibilities, their potential to contribute to the success of the company, and the performance of the\ncompany.\n19\nSUBMISSION OF STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS\nOur Bylaws require advance notice of any proposal by a stockholder intended to be presented at an\nannual meeting that is not included in our notice of annual meeting and proxy statement because it was not\ntimely submitted under the following paragraph, or made by or at the direction of any member of the Board of\nDirectors, including any proposal for the nomination for election as a director.

(“YA II PN”) dated February 12, 2024 (the “SEPA”); (2) a Convertible Promissory Note issued by us to YA II PN dated May\n20, 2024 (the “May Note”) and related warrant (the “Warrant”) to purchase 175,000 shares (the “Warrant Shares”) of the Common Stock; (3) a Convertible Promissory Note issued\nby us to a different Selling Stockholder dated August 29, 2024 (the “August Note”); and (4) shares of Common Stock issued to accredited investors in private placements at\nvarious times in 2024 (the “2024 Shares”).\nIn connection with the SEPA, we committed to issue to YA II PN 64,656 shares of common stock within three trading days (any day during which the Nasdaq Capital Market is\nopen for business, a “Trading Day”) of the execution of the SEPA (the “Commitment Shares”).\nThe shares of Common Stock being registered for resale hereby were issued to, purchased by or will be purchased by the Selling Stockholders for the following consideration: (i) a\nprice of $2.32 per share for the Commitment Shares; (ii) a purchase price yet to be determined for the Advance Shares under the SEPA (as described herein); (iii) a purchase price of\n$2.29 per share of Common Stock for conversion of the May Note (as may be adjusted as described herein); (iv) a purchase price of $3.36 per share of Common Stock for\nconversion of the August Note; (v) a purchase price of $2.25 for 444,445 of the 2024 Shares purchased in February 2024; (vi) a purchase price of $2.75 for 181,819 of the 2024 Shares\npurchased in May 2024; and (vii) a purchase price of $3.00 for 200,000 of the 2024 Shares purchased in June 2024. The shares of Common Stock underlying the Warrant will be\npurchased, if at all, by such holders at the $2.29 exercise price of the Warrant.\nWe are not selling any securities under this prospectus and we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares by the Selling Stockholders, except we will receive cash\nproceeds from the exercise of the Warrant. However, the SEPA provides that we may sell up to an aggregate of $5,000,000 of our Common Stock to YA II PN under the SEPA, from\ntime to time in our discretion after the date the registration statement that includes this prospectus is declared effective and after satisfaction of other conditions in the SEPA.\nYA II PN is an “underwriter” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The Selling Stockholders may sell the shares of\nCommon Stock described in this prospectus in a number of different ways and at varying prices. See “Plan of Distribution” for more information about how the Selling\nStockholders may sell the shares of Common Stock being registered pursuant to this prospectus.\nWe will pay the expenses of registering the Common Stock offered by this prospectus, but all selling and other expenses incurred by the Selling Stockholders will be paid by the\nSelling Stockholders. The Selling Stockholders may sell our shares of Common Stock offered by this prospectus from time to time on terms to be determined at the time of sale\nthrough ordinary brokerage transactions or through any other means described in this prospectus under “Plan of Distribution.” The prices at which the Selling Stockholders may\nsell shares will be determined by the prevailing market price for our Common Stock or in negotiated transactions.\nWe are a “smaller reporting company” as defined under the federal securities laws and, under applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rules, we have elected to comply\nwith certain reduced public company reporting and disclosure requirements.\nOur Common Stock is listed on Nasdaq under the symbol “REBN.” The last reported closing price for our Common Stock on Nasdaq on September 10, 2024 was $3.28 per share.\nAs of September 10, 2024, there were 3,988,317 shares of Common Stock outstanding. If all shares being registered hereby were sold, it would comprise approximately 48.0% of our\ntotal shares of Common Stock outstanding. Because the shares registered hereunder comprise a significant portion of our outstanding shares, any sales by the Selling\nStockholders, or the perception that such sales may occur, could have a significant negative impact on the trading price of our Common Stock. Given the current market price of our\nCommon Stock, certain of the Selling Stockholders who paid less for their shares than such current market price will receive a higher rate of return on any such sales than the public\nsecurityholders who purchased Common Stock in our initial public offering or any Selling Stockholder who paid more for their shares than the current market price.\nWe have not registered the sale of the shares under the securities laws of any state. Brokers or dealers effecting transactions in the shares of Common Stock offered hereby should\nconfirm that the shares have been registered under the securities laws of the state or states in which sales of the shares occur as of the time of such sales, or that there is an\navailable exemption from the registration requirements of the securities laws of such states.\nWe have not authorized anyone, including any salesperson or broker, to give oral or written information about this offering, Reborn Coffee, Inc., or the shares of Common Stock\noffered hereby that is different from the information included in this prospectus.

Before investing in our securities, you should carefully read this entire prospectus, including the information set forth under the headings “Risk\nFactors” as included elsewhere in this prospectus and our financial statements and the related notes and the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations”, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023, our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the\nperiod ended March 31, 2024, our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2024, which are incorporated by reference herein.\nOverview of Our Company\nReborn is focused on serving high quality, specialty-roasted coffee at retail locations, kiosks and cafes. We are an innovative company that strives for constant improvement\nin the coffee experience through exploration of new technology and premier service, guided by traditional brewing techniques. We believe Reborn differentiates itself from\nother coffee roasters through its innovative techniques, including sourcing, washing, roasting, and brewing our coffee beans with a balance of precision and craft.\nFounded in 2015 by Jay Kim, our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Kim and his team launched Reborn with the vision of using the finest pure ingredients and pristine water. We\ncurrently serve customers through our retail store locations in California, Korea, and Malaysia.\nReborn continues to elevate the high-end coffee experience and we received first place traditional still in “America’s Best Cold Brew” competition by Coffee Fest in 2017 in\nPortland and 2018 in Los Angeles.\nThe source of coffee is pinnacle to specialty coffee. The coffee industry has gone through various phases including the first, second, third and fourth wave. In the first and\nsecond waves of coffee, the single-origin source and type of the coffee is not necessarily in the forefront during the sourcing process. As such, much of the coffee may be a\nblend with various sources and a mix of Robusta and Arabica coffee beans. The third wave of coffee focuses on a single-origin source and one variety of coffee bean\n(specifically Arabica beans). Single-origin beans can focus on specific countries and can also have hyper-focused on specific regions in the third wave of coffee, such as\nCoban in Guatemala. Arabia beans are considered premier due to the specific requirements for growth and the high-quality flavor they produce. Arabica coffee is required to be\ngrown in higher, cooler elevations in regions.\nDifferentiated from other coffee companies, the Reborn Wash Process is the key to creating the clean flavor of our coffee. Our Wash Process is distinguished by the use of\nmagnetized water to wash our green coffee beans when they arrive at the Reborn facility, in order to extract impurities and enhance hydration before the roasting process.\nMagnetizing water is a process that converts the particles of water, which can naturally appear in various sizes, into evenly sized particles. As a result of this process, we\nbelieve that the water increases its hydration and ability to absorb into organic material. Our water is created through a water magnetizing device in which water is flowed\nthrough the device and magnetizes the water on-site immediately prior to use.\nAfter the wash, we roast our washed-green beans based on the profile of each single-origin. After the coffee beans are roasted, they are then packaged into various products\nsuch as whole bean coffee, pour over packs, and cold brew packs. Additionally, whole bean inventory is also supplied to the kiosk and cafes. A portion of the roasted coffee is\nalso allotted to create our award-winning cold brew concentrate. Our cold brew production is created using a proprietary percolation technique, also using magnetized water at\neach step to enhance the flavor of the cold brew.\n1\nWe continually innovate in the way we serve coffee. At our cafes, we serve customers our award-winning coffee through cold brew taps in addition to freshly ground coffee\nbeans in espresso-made drinks. Other brew methods, such as an in-house pour over and drip coffee, are also available.\nIn August 2022, we consummated our initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 1,440,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $5.00 per share, generating gross\nproceeds of $7,200,000. Net proceeds from the IPO was approximately $6.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses of\napproximately $998,000.\nWe had granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 216,000 additional shares (equal to 15% of the shares of common stock sold in the offering) to cover over-\nallotments. In addition, we had agreed to issue to the representative of the several underwriters warrants to purchase the number of shares of common stock in the aggregate\nequal to five percent (5%) of the shares of common stock to be issued and sold in the IPO. The warrants are exercisable for a price per share equal to 125% of the public offering\nprice. No over-allotment option or representative’s warrants have been exercised.\nOn August 12, 2022, our stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “REBN”.\nThe Experience, Reborn\nWe believe that we are the leading pioneers of the emerging “Fourth Wave” movement and that our business is redefining specialty coffee as an experience that demands\nmuch more than premium quality. We consider ourselves leaders of the “fourth wave” coffee movement because we are constantly developing our bean processing methods,\nresearching design concepts, and reinventing new ways of drinking coffee. For instance, the current transition from the K-Cup trend to the pour over drip concept allowed us\nto reinvent the way people consume coffee, by merging convenience and quality. We took the pour over drip concept and made it available and affordable to the public\nthrough our Reborn Coffee Pour Over packs. Our Pour Over Packs allow our consumers to consume our specialty coffee outdoors and on-the-go.\nOur success in innovating within the “Fourth Wave” coffee movement is measured by our success in B2B sales with our introduction of Reborn Coffee Pour Over Packs to\nhotels. With the introduction of our Pour Over Packs to major hotels (including one hotel company with 7 locations), our B2B sales increased as these companies recognized\nthe convenience and functionality our Pour Over Packs serve to their customers.\nCentered around its core values of service, trust, and well-being, we deliver an appreciation of coffee as both a science and an art. Developing innovative processes such as\nwashing green coffee beans with magnetized water, we challenge traditional preparation methods by focusing on the relationship between water chemistry, health, and flavor\nprofile. Leading research studies, testing brewing equipment, and refining roasting/brewing methods to a specific, we proactively distinguish exceptional quality from good\nquality by starting at the foundation and paying attention to the details. Our mission places an equal emphasis on humanizing the coffee experience, delivering a fresh take on\n“farm-to-table” by sourcing internationally. In this way, we create opportunities to develop transparency by paying homage to origin stories and spark new conversations by\nbuilding cross-cultural communities united by a passion for the finest coffee.\nThrough a broad product offering, Reborn provides customers with a wide variety of beverages and coffee options. As a result, we believe we can capture share of any\nexperience where customers seek to consume great beverages whether in our inviting store atmospheres which are designed for comfort, or on the go through our pour over\npacks, or at home with our whole bean ground coffee bags. We believe that the retail coffee market in the US is large and growing. According to IBIS, in 2021, the retail market\nfor coffee in the United States is expected to be $46.2 billion. This is expected to grow due to a shift in consumer preferences to premium coffee, including specialized blends,\nespresso-based beverages, and cold brew options. Reborn aims to capture a growing portion of the market as we expand and increase consumer awareness of our brand.\nBranding\nReborn Coffee focuses on two key features in our branding, including “Introducing the Fourth Wave” and “America’s Best Cold Brew.” These phrases encapsulate the quality\nof the Reborn Process of sourcing, washing, roasting, and brewing coffee and the quality of the product that we create.\n2\nThe Reborn brand is essential to our marketing strategy, as it allows us to stand out compared to our competitors. The products aim to make customers feel “reborn” after\ndrinking a cup of coffee.\nOur Menu and Products\nWe purchase and roast high-quality coffees that we sell, along with handcrafted coffee, tea and other beverages and a variety of high-quality food items. We believe in offering\ncustomers the same great taste and quality whether served in store or on the go. We also partner with third-party importers and exporters to purchase and import our green\ncoffee beans. Through these relationships, we source high-quality coffee beans from across the globe, including Mexico, Ethiopia, Colombia, Guatemala, Brazil, and Honduras.\nFranchise Operations\nIn January 2021, the Company formed Reborn Coffee Franchise LLC in the State of California in order to begin franchising Reborn Coffee retail stores and kiosks. The Company\nplans to charge future franchisees a non-refundable franchise fee and certain marketing and royalty fees based on gross sales, however we presently have no contractual\ncommitments or other agreements to do so. We expect to begin franchise sales in 2024. We believe that our team’s prior experience building a large, global foodservice\nbusiness will allow us to rapidly scale our future franchise effort. In addition, we have formed a franchise council consisting of a team of franchise experts to advise us. We plan\nto expand beyond California to additional states to create a national and global presence.\nExpanding Sales Channels\nToday, we sell a variety of our coffee and tea products through the enterprise, or commercial, channel, which we refer to as “B2B”, as well as direct-to-consumer via our\nwebsite. We expect to increase our channel presence by increasing the availability of Reborn Coffee in businesses and enterprises, and expand upon the partnerships we have\nin place with hotel operators to increase the use and brand awareness in hospitality. We also expect to grow our online sales through new partnerships with third-party\nretailers. Our products are available in various form factors, such as whole bean roasted coffee bags, single-serve drip bags, and pour over packs. We are exploring\npartnerships with grocery operators and foodservice providers to expand the Reborn Coffee brand.\nExperienced Leadership Team\nOur relentless commitment to excellence is driven by our passionate management team under the leadership of Founder and Chief Executive Officer Jay Kim. Jay launched\nReborn Coffee with the vision to provide the best coffee using the purest ingredients. Jay is focused on the expansion of Reborn and he has surrounded himself with leaders\nwith direct experience in beverage and retail. Stephan Kim, our Chief Financial Officer, has 20 years of experience in public accounting and consulting. Other members of our\nexecutive leadership team bring high growth, franchise and sector expertise.\nOur Commitment to Our Team\nReborn Coffee believes in mentoring the developing the next generation of premium coffee baristas. Through our in-depth training, we aim to train dedicated employees who\nunderstand the science and art behind every cup of coffee. We also expect to form a training school specializing in creating passionate baristas and coffee connoisseurs, by\neducating its students about coffee processes and preparation methods. The efforts for the training school are underway and we expect to launch the program in 2024.\nOur Highly Engaged Customers\nReborn Coffee customers are loyal to our brand due to our intense focus on premium coffee and customer service. Community engagement is another essential element of\nReborn Coffee’s in-person marketing strategy. Reborn hosts on-site engagements, such as event sponsorships, and engages with local Chambers of Commerce. Previously, we\nhave worked with Lululemon to host yoga sessions outside of our retail locations, creatively engaging the community while simultaneously promoting Reborn as an active\nlifestyle. We have also hosted pop-up locations on the Facebook campus, further expanding our outreach and introducing our brand name to different communities. We further\nengage with the community by organizing our own latte art competitions, in which baristas can compete for prizes and customers in the audience can witness the competitive\npassion Reborn Coffee encompasses.\n3\nDigital Channels\nReborn Coffee focuses on many digital channels in its marketing strategy. Social media is an important leg that creates engagement and education of Reborn Coffee’s brand.\nCustomers primarily engage the brand on Instagram, where we host giveaways, share new store openings, and promote seasonal menus. Through our unique, modern aesthetic\nand intense focus on high-quality coffee, we are able to share the quality and essence of Reborn Coffee on display inside of our retail locations with existing and future\ncustomers on social media platforms.\nFor both the in-store café channel and the e-commerce channel, SMS & email marketing are used for reengagement and communication of new products and offerings.\nDigital advertising channels are also used, primarily to engage the online market audience. Google and Facebook are the primary paid ad channels that we currently utilize. Yelp\nadvertising is also used to engage local customers and tourists who visit specific areas where Reborn Coffee retail locations are located.\nIn-Person Marketing Engagement\nEngaging customers in-store with a marketing plan is essential for customer retention and new customer generation. Reborn Coffee’s customer loyalty program provides free\ndrinks for every 10 drinks purchased. Additionally, store customers may participate in promotional deals, especially during the holidays and new item releases, to try new\ninnovative items created in-house. We also offer coffee samples of our pour over packs as well as new beans to our retail location customers. The distribution of coffee\nsamples has expanded customers’ knowledge of our products and, led to increased contributing to whole bean sales.\nReborn Coffee locations are located in heavily trafficked areas as well as popular malls. As such, the potential for marketing and branding is very high in these locations.\nSignage and promotional deals with giveaways are essential to attracting new customers.\nGrowth Strategies\nCorporate and Franchise Expansion\nReborn Coffee plans to expand across the Unites States with company operated locations and franchise locations to share the quality of specialty coffee. Reborn Coffee aims\nto accelerate our growth through our franchise program. Reborn Coffee will continue to innovate in the coffee industry by making the industry more personal to the consumers,\nprospective franchisees, and employees. This goal will be achieved through the continued innovation in our products, sourcing directly from farms, and giving customers\nchoices in how their coffee is served to them. As Reborn expands, we hope to show the world that expanding in volume and size does not diminish the quality and personal\nelement that is instilled in the coffee industry.\nWe have started to scale our logistics and supply chain to provide support for our rapid growth, including for our future franchisees. We have increased roasting capacity and\nour paper goods supplies, including an emphasis on eco-friendly products.\nB2B Strategy\nReborn Coffee products are unique given their potential to engage with business partners for large wholesale orders. Currently, Reborn Coffee builds strong relationships with\nhotel management companies within California and out-of-state. We currently work with several hotels, providing pour over packs and cold brew packs to cater to their\ncustomer needs. Reborn Coffee plans to continue growing its B2B marketing and sales strategy through active outreach and advertising to potential partners. We believe that\naccess to large-scale distribution channels such as hotels increases consumer awareness of our brand while providing us access to large enterprise customers. Gift giving\ncomprises a large percentage of winter B2B sales at Reborn Coffee. During the holidays, Reborn Coffee’s B2B marketing strategy focuses on targeting companies, and specific\nteams within companies, that are seeking to provide end of the year gifts to their clients and customers. Reborn Coffee provides customized gift sets to each customer’s needs.\nWord-of-mouth marketing has grown our B2B holiday gift giving accounts greatly, forging opportunities to have worked with companies like Google to provide gift sets for\ntheir clients. Reborn Coffee plans to expand not only by growing its retail location footprint, but also through the development of more hotel partnerships, expansion into\ngrocery stores and markets, expansion of our e-commerce and wholesale.\nReborn Coffee believes the grocery market is another major channel through which we expect to access. Through both bulk sales of roasted beans and in-store kiosks, as well\nsales of pre-packaged products, Reborn Coffee will access customers who purchase both in volume and for those customers looking for a handcrafted beverage during their in-\nstore shopping experience. We are exploring discussions with a variety of retailers and expect to access these additional sales channels in 2023.\n4\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings from time to time as part of its business. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, if determined\nadversely to us, we believe would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nHowever, legal proceedings are inherently uncertain. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter or a combination of matters may be material to our results of operations for a\nparticular period, depending upon the size of the loss or our income for that particular period.\nEmployees and Human Capital\nAs of September 10, 2024 we had 19 full-time employees. We believe in mentoring and developing the next generation of premium coffee baristas. Through our in-depth\ntraining, we aim to train dedicated employees who understand the science and art behind every cup of coffee. We also expect to form a training school specializing in creating\npassionate baristas and coffee connoisseurs, by educating its students about coffee processes and preparation methods. The efforts for the training school are underway and\nwe expect to launch the program in 2024.\nProperties\nWe have a production and distribution center at our headquarters that we use to process and roast coffee for wholesale and retail distribution. We consider our current office\nspace adequate for our current operations.\nAs of the date of this prospectus, we have twelve retail coffee locations:\n● La Floresta Shopping Village in Brea, California;\n● La Crescenta, California;\n● Corona Del Mar, California;\n● Home Depot Center in Laguna Woods, California;\n● Manhattan Village at Manhattan Beach, California.\n● Huntington Beach, California;\n● Galleria at Tyler in Riverside, California;\n● Intersect in Irvine, California;\n● Diamond Bar, California;\n● Anaheim, California;\n● Daejeon, Korea; and\n● Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n5\nCorporate Information\nOur principal executive offices are located at 580 N.

The Common Stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market on a Reverse Stock Split-adjusted basis at the market open on Monday, January 22,\n2024. Unless otherwise noted, all share and per share information relating our Common Stock in this prospectus has been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split.\n6\nTHE OFFERING\nShares of Common Stock offered by us Up to 3,685,574 shares of our Common Stock, consisting of:\n● 64,656 shares of Common Stock we committed to issue to YA II PN as consideration for its commitment\nto purchase shares of our Common Stock under the SEPA (the “Commitment Shares”);\n● Up to a maximum of 1,670,844 shares of Common Stock that we may sell to YA II PN from time to time at\nour sole discretion, pursuant to the SEPA, as described below;\n● Up to 800,000 shares of Common Stock (the “May Note Shares”) issuable to YA II PN upon conversion\nof the Convertible Promissory Note issued by us to YA II PN dated May 20, 2024 (the “May Note”);\n● Up to 175,000 shares of Common Stock (the “Warrant Shares”) issuable to YA II PN upon exercise of a\nwarrant to purchase common stock issued on May 20, 2024 in connection with the May Note (the\n“Warrant”);\n● Up to 148,810 shares of Common Stock (the “August Note Shares,” and together with the May Note\nShares, the “Note Shares”) issuable to a Selling Stockholder upon conversion of the Convertible\nPromissory Note issued by us to such Selling Stockholder dated August 29, 2024 (the “August Note,”\nand together with the August Note, the “Notes”); and\n● 826,264 shares of Common Stock (the “2024 Shares”) issued to certain Selling Stockholders in 2024.\nCommon Stock outstanding 3,988,317 shares of Common Stock.\nCommon Stock outstanding after this offering 6,847,627 shares of Common Stock.\nUse of proceeds We will not receive any proceeds from the sale by the Selling Stockholders of the shares of Common Stock\nbeing offered by this prospectus. However, we may receive gross proceeds of up to $5,000,000 from the sale of\nour Common Stock to the YA II PN under the SEPA. We will not receive any cash proceeds from the issuance\nof the Commitment Shares to YA II PN under the SEPA. In addition, we may receive proceeds from the cash\nexercise of the Warrant, which, if exercised in cash at the current exercise price with respect to the Warrant,\nwould result in gross proceeds to us of approximately $400,750. We intend to use any proceeds from YA II PN\nthat we receive under the SEPA and the Warrant exercises for working capital, strategic and general corporate\npurposes. See “Use of Proceeds” on page 19 for more information.\nRisk factors An investment in our securities is highly speculative and involves substantial risk. Please carefully consider\nthe risks described under the heading “Risk Factors” on page 8 and other information included and\nincorporated by reference in this prospectus for a discussion of factors to consider before deciding to invest\nin the securities offered hereby. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we\ncurrently deem to be immaterial may also impair our business and operations.\nTransfer agent and registrar The registrar and transfer agent for our Common Stock is Securities Transfer Corporation. The transfer agent’s\naddress is 15500 Roosevelt Blvd, Suite 104, Clearwater, Florida 33760 and the telephone number is (469) 633-\n0101.\nNasdaq symbol and trading Our Common Stock is listed on Nasdaq under the symbol “REBN.”\n7\nRISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Before deciding whether to invest in our securities, you should carefully consider the risks described below and\nthose discussed under the Section captioned “Risk Factors” contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023, as revised or\nsupplemented by our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or our current reports on Form 8-K, each as filed with the SEC and which are incorporated by reference in\nthis prospectus, together with other information in this prospectus, the information and documents incorporated by reference herein, and in any free writing prospectus that we\nhave authorized for use in connection with this offering. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be\nseriously harmed. This could cause the trading price of our Common Stock to decline, resulting in a loss of all or part of your investment. Please also read carefully the section\nbelow entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”\nRisks Related to This Offering\nIt is not possible to predict the actual number of shares we will sell under the SEPA to YA II PN, or the actual gross proceeds resulting from those sales.\nSubject to certain limitations in the SEPA and compliance with applicable law, we have the discretion to deliver notices to YA II PN at any time throughout the term of the SEPA.\nThe actual number of shares of Common Stock are sold to YA II PN may depend based on a number of factors, including the market price of our Common Stock during the sales\nperiod. Actual gross proceeds may be less than $5.0 million, which may impact our future liquidity. Because the price per share of each share sold to YA II PN will fluctuate during\nthe sales period, it is not currently possible to predict the number of shares that will be sold or the actual gross proceeds to be raised in connection with those sales.\nMoreover, although the SEPA provides that we may sell up to an aggregate of $5.0 million of our Common Stock to YA II PN, we are registering 1,670,844 shares of our Common\nStock (the “Advance Shares”). If we elect to sell to YA II PN all of the Advance Shares being registered for resale under this prospectus that are available for sale by us to YA II\nPN under the SEPA, depending on the market prices of our Common Stock for each purchase made pursuant to the SEPA, the actual gross proceeds from the sale of the shares\nmay be substantially less than the $5.0 million total commitment available to us under the SEPA. If it becomes necessary for us to issue and sell to YA II PN under the SEPA more\nshares than the Advance Shares being registered for resale under this prospectus in order to receive aggregate gross proceeds equal to $5.0 million under the SEPA, we must file\nwith the SEC one or more additional registration statements to register under the Securities Act the resale by YA II PN of any such additional shares of our Common Stock over the\nAdvance Shares registered in this Registration Statement that we wish to sell from time to time under the SEPA, which the SEC must declare effective, in each case before we may\nelect to sell any additional shares of our Common Stock to YA II PN under the SEPA.\nAny issuance and sale by us under the SEPA of a substantial amount of shares of Common Stock in addition to the Advance Shares being registered for resale by YA II PN under\nthis prospectus could cause additional substantial dilution to our stockholders. The number of shares of our Common Stock ultimately offered for sale by YA II PN is dependent\nupon the number of shares of Common Stock, if any, we ultimately sell to YA II PN under the SEPA.\nInvestors who buy shares in this offering at different times will likely pay different prices.\nInvestors who purchase shares of Common Stock in this offering at different times will likely pay different prices, and so may experience different levels of dilution and different\noutcomes in their investment results. In connection with the SEPA, we will have discretion, subject to market demand, to vary the timing, prices, and numbers of shares of Common\nStock sold to YA II PN. Similarly, YA II PN may sell such shares at different times and at different prices. Investors may experience a decline in the value of the shares they\npurchase from YA II PN in this offering as a result of sales made by us in future transactions to YA II PN at prices lower than the prices they paid.\n8\nThe issuance of Common Stock to the Selling Stockholders may cause substantial dilution to our existing shareholders and the sale of such shares acquired by the Selling\nStockholders could cause the price of our Common Stock to decline.\nWe are registering for resale by the Selling Stockholders up to 3,685,574 shares of Common Stock. The number of shares of our Common Stock ultimately offered for resale by the\nSelling Stockholders under this prospectus is dependent upon the number of shares of Common Stock issued to the Selling Stockholders pursuant to the SEPA, the Notes, and the\nWarrant. Depending on a variety of factors, including market liquidity of our Common Stock, the issuance of shares to the Selling Stockholders may cause the trading price of our\nCommon Stock to decline.\nIf and when we elect to sell Common Stock to YA II PN, sales of newly issued Common Stock by us to YA II PN could result in substantial dilution to the interests of existing\nholders of our Common Stock. Additionally, the sale of a substantial number of Common Stock to YA II PN, or the anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to\nsell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales.\nWe expect to grant equity awards to employees and directors under our equity incentive plans. We may also raise capital through equity financings in the future. As part of our\nbusiness strategy, we may make or receive investments in companies, solutions or technologies and issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition or investment. Any\nsuch issuances of additional share capital may cause shareholders to experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our Common Stock to\ndecline.\nWe may require additional financing to sustain our operations and without it we may not be able to continue operations.\nSubject to the terms and conditions of the SEPA, we may, at our discretion, direct YA II PN to purchase up to $5.0 million of shares of our Common Stock under the SEPA from\ntime-to-time. The purchase price per share for the shares of Common Stock that we may elect to sell to YA II PN under the SEPA will fluctuate based on the market prices of our\nCommon Stock for each purchase made pursuant to the SEPA, if any. Accordingly, it is not currently possible to predict the number of shares that will be sold to YA II PN, the\nactual purchase price per share to be paid by YA II PN for those shares, if any, or the actual gross proceeds to be raised in connection with those sales.\nThe extent to which we rely on YA II PN as a source of funding will depend on a number of factors including, the prevailing market price of our Common Stock and the extent to\nwhich we are able to secure working and other capital from other sources. If obtaining sufficient funding from YA II PN were to prove unavailable or prohibitively dilutive, we may\nneed to secure another source of funding in order to satisfy our working and other capital needs. Even if we were to sell to YA II PN all of the shares of Common Stock available for\nsale to YA II PN under the SEPA, we may still need additional capital to fully implement our business, operating and development plans. Should the financing we require to sustain\nour working capital needs be unavailable or prohibitively expensive when we require it, the consequences may be a material adverse effect on our business, operating results,\nfinancial condition and prospects.\nFuture sales and issuances of our Common Stock or other securities might result in significant dilution and could cause the price of our Common Stock to decline.\nTo raise capital, we may sell Common Stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions other than those contemplated by the SEPA, at prices and\nin a manner we determine from time to time. We may sell shares or other securities in another offering at a price per share that is less than the price per share paid by investors in\nthis offering, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders. The price per share at which we sell additional\nshares of our Common Stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into Common Stock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share paid by investors\nin this offering.\nWe cannot predict what effect, if any, sales of shares of our Common Stock in the public market or the availability of shares for sale will have on the market price of our Common\nStock. However, future sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock in the public market, including shares issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants and\nconvertible preferred shares, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\n9\nOur management will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from our sale of shares of Common Stock to YA II PN, and you may not agree with how we use\nthe proceeds and the proceeds may not be invested successfully.\nOur management will have broad discretion with respect to the use of proceeds from the sale of any shares of our Common Stock to YA II PN, including for any of the purposes\ndescribed in the section of this prospectus entitled “Use of Proceeds.” You will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the proceeds from the\nsale of any shares of our Common Stock to YA II PN. The results and effectiveness of the use of proceeds are uncertain, and we could spend the proceeds in ways that you do not\nagree with or that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our Common Stock. Our failure to apply these funds effectively could harm our business, delay\nthe development of our pipeline product candidates and cause the price of our Common Stock to decline.\nIt is not possible to predict the actual number of shares of Common Stock, if any, we will issue upon conversion of the Notes to the Selling Stockholders.\nWe do not have the right to control the timing and amount of any conversions of principal under the Notes by the Selling Stockholders. The number of shares that we issue to the\nSelling Stockholders pursuant to the Notes, if any, will depend upon market conditions and other factors to be determined by the Selling Stockholders. The Selling Stockholders\nmay ultimately decide to convert none or a portion of the principal amount of the Notes.\nThe number of shares of Common Stock ultimately offered for sale by the Selling Stockholders is dependent upon the number of shares, if any, we ultimately issue upon\nconversion of the Notes. However, even if the Selling Stockholders elect to convert the entire principal amount of the Notes, the Selling Stockholders may resell all, some or none\nof such shares at any time or from time to time in its sole discretion and at different prices.\nThe terms of our indebtedness, including the covenants and the dates on which principal and interest payments on our indebtedness are due, increases the risk that we will be\nunable to continue as a going concern.\nAs of December 31, 2023, and June 30, 2024 we had $1.48 million, and $1.57 million in outstanding short-term borrowing. In addition, on May 20, 2024, we issued the May Note\nwhich has a principal balance of $800,000 and, beginning on August 15, 2024, requires monthly principal and interest payments in excess of $266,667, and on August 29, 2024, we\nissued the August Note which has a principal balance of $500,000. The terms of our indebtedness, including the covenants and the dates on which principal and interest payments\non our indebtedness are due, increases the risk that we will be unable to continue as a going concern. To continue as a going concern over the next twelve months, we must make\npayments on our debt as they come due and comply with the covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness or, if we fail to do so, to (i) negotiate and obtain waivers of\nor forbearances with respect to any defaults that occur with respect to our indebtedness, (ii) amend, replace, refinance or restructure any or all of the agreements governing our\nindebtedness, and/or (iii) otherwise secure additional capital. However, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in accomplishing any of these plans.\nWe do not intend to apply for any listing of the Notes or the Warrant on any exchange or nationally recognized trading system, and we do not expect a market to develop for\nthe unregistered securities.\nWe do not intend to apply for any listing of the Notes or the Warrant on Nasdaq or any other securities exchange or nationally recognized trading system, and we do not expect a\nmarket to develop for the Notes or the Warrant. Without an active market, the liquidity of the Notes and the Warrant will be limited. Further, the existence of the Notes and Warrant\nmay act to reduce both the trading volume and the trading price of our common stock.\n10\nDue to the recent implementation of the Reverse Stock Split, the liquidity of our common stock may be adversely effected.\nOur common stock began trading on Nasdaq on a Reverse Stock Split-adjusted basis beginning on January 22, 2024. The liquidity of the shares of our common stock may be\naffected adversely by any reverse stock split given the reduced number of shares of our common stock that are outstanding following the Reverse Stock Split, especially if the\nmarket price of our common stock does not increase as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. Following the Reverse Stock Split, the resulting market price of our common stock may\nnot attract new investors and may not satisfy the investing requirements of those investors. Although we believe that a higher market price of our common stock may help\ngenerate greater or broader investor interest, there can be no assurance that the Reverse Stock Split resulted in a share price that will attract new investors, including institutional\ninvestors. In addition, there can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will satisfy the investing requirements of those investors. As a result, the trading\nliquidity of our common stock may not necessarily improve.\nIf we are unable to satisfy the applicable continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, our common stock could be delisted.\nOn June 21, 2024, we received a written notice (the “Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq indicating that Nasdaq had determined that we had failed to\ncomply with certain Nasdaq Listing Rules because we had not yet filed our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024.\nAs previously announced, on May 15, 2024, we were required to dismiss BF Borgers CPA PC as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm. We had to appoint\na new independent registered public accounting firm in order to complete and file the Form 10-Q, and on May 14, 2024, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of BCRG\nGroup (“BCRG”) as our new independent registered public accounting firm. Due to the timing of the appointment of BCRG, we were unable without unreasonable effort and\nexpense to complete the review of our financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 before the required filing date for the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nA Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) had previously placed us on a Discretionary Panel Monitor for a period of one year or until May 16, 2025 after we regained compliance with\nprevious Nasdaq listing deficiencies, which would require Nasdaq to issue a Delist Determination Letter in the event that we failed to maintain compliance with any continued\nlisting requirement (the “Panel Monitor”). Due to the Panel Monitor, we requested an appeal of determination to the Panel, and request a stay of the suspension pending a hearing.\nOn July 19, 2024, we filed Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024.\nAlthough we anticipate complying with Nasdaq’s Listing Rules going forward, there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet continued listing requirements in the future.\nIn determining whether to afford a company a cure period prior to commencing suspension or delisting procedures, Nasdaq analyzes all relevant facts including any past\ndeficiencies, and thus our prior deficiencies could be used as a factor by Nasdaq in any future decision to delist our securities from trading on its exchange.\nIf our Common Stock is delisted, it could reduce the price of our Common Stock and the levels of liquidity available to our stockholders. In addition, the delisting of our Common\nStock could materially adversely affect our access to the capital markets and any limitation on liquidity or reduction in the price of our Common Stock could materially adversely\naffect our ability to raise capital. Delisting from Nasdaq could also result in other negative consequences, including the potential loss of confidence by suppliers, customers and\nemployees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities.\nBecause the currently outstanding shares of Common Stock that are being registered in this prospectus represent a substantial percentage of our outstanding Common Stock,\nthe sale of such securities could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline significantly.\nThis prospectus relates to the offer and sale from time to time by the Selling Stockholders of an aggregate of up to 826,264 shares of our currently outstanding Common Stock. This\nprospectus also relates to the offer and sale from time to time by the Selling Stockholders of up to 2,859,310 shares of Common Stock issuable by us, consisting of (i) up to\n1,670,844 shares of Common Stock that we may sell to YA II PN, from time to time at our sole discretion, pursuant to the SEPA; (ii) 64,656 Commitment Shares; (iii) up to 175,000\nshares of Common Stock underlying the Warrant; and (iv) 948,810 shares of Common Stock underlying the Notes.\n11\nThe number of shares of Common Stock that the Selling Stockholders can sell into the public markets pursuant to this prospectus represents a significant amount of our\noutstanding shares of Common Stock. As of September 10, 2024, 2024, there were 3,988,317 shares of Common Stock outstanding. If all shares being registered hereby were sold, it\nwould comprise approximately 48.0% of our total shares of Common Stock outstanding. Given the substantial number of shares of Common Stock registered pursuant to this\nprospectus, the sale of Common Stock by the Selling Stockholders, or the perception in the market that the Selling Stockholders of a large number of shares of Common Stock\nintend to sell Common Stock, could increase the volatility of the market price of our Common Stock or result in a significant decline in the public trading price of our Common Stock.\nIn addition, certain Selling Stockholders have an incentive to sell because they have purchased their Common Stock at prices lower than the public investors or the current trading\nprice of the Common Stock, and they may profit significantly so even under circumstances in which our public stockholders or certain other Selling Stockholders would experience\nlosses in connection with their investment. The securities being registered for resale were issued to, purchased by or will be purchased by the Selling Stockholders for the\nfollowing consideration: (i) a price of $2.32 per share for the Commitment Shares; (ii) a purchase price yet to be determined for the Advance Shares under the SEPA (as described\nherein); (iii) a purchase price of $2.29 per share of Common Stock for conversion of the May Note (as may be adjusted as described herein); (iv) a purchase price of $3.36 per share\nof Common Stock for conversion of the August Note; (v) a purchase price of $2.25 for 444,445 of the 2024 Shares purchased in February 2024; (vi) a purchase price of $2.75 for\n181,819 of the 2024 Shares purchased in May 2024; and (vii) a purchase price of $3.00 for 200,000 of the 2024 Shares purchased in June 2024. The shares of Common Stock\nunderlying the Warrant will be purchased, if at all, by such holders at the $2.29 exercise price of the Warrant. If the Selling Stockholders were to sell the shares of Common Stock at\na price of $3.28 per share (the last reported sale price of our Common Stock on September 10, 2024), they would recognize a profit or loss as follows: (i) a profit of approximately\n$0.96 per share of Common Stock for the Commitment Shares; (ii) a profit of approximately $0.99 per share of Common Stock for the shares underlying the May Note; (iii) a loss of\napproximately $0.08 per share of Common Stock for shares underlying the August Note; (iv) a profit of approximately $1.03 per share of Common Stock for the 2024 Shares\npurchased in February 2024; (v) a profit of approximately $0.53 per share of Common Stock for the 2024 Shares purchased in May 2024; and (vi) a profit of approximately $0.28 per\nshare of Common Stock for the 2024 Shares purchased in June 2024.\nPublic stockholders of Common Stock may have paid more than certain of the Selling Stockholders for their Common Stock and would not expect to see a positive return unless the\nprice of the Common Stock appreciates above the price at which such stockholders purchased their Common Stock. Investors who purchase Common Stock on open market may\nnot experience a similar rate of return on the Common Stock they purchase due to differences in the purchase prices and the current trading price referenced above. In addition,\nsales by the Selling Stockholders may cause the trading prices of our securities to experience a decline. As a result, the Selling Stockholders may effect sales of Common Stock at\nprices below the current market price, which could cause market prices to decline further.\n12\nSPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis prospectus contains various forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, which represent our\nexpectations or beliefs concerning future events that are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management, and which\nstatements involve substantial risk and uncertainties. All statements contained in this prospectus other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding our future\noperating results and financial position, our business strategy and plans, market growth and trends, and objectives for future operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-\nlooking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they\ncontain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “could,” “intends,” “target,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,”\n“potential,” or “continue” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or intentions.\nThese risks and uncertainties include, among other things:\n● our ability to continue as a going concern;\n● our reliance on third party vendors;\n● our dependence on our executive officers;\n● our financial performance guidance;\n● material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting;\n● regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries;\n● the impact of laws, regulations, accounting standards, regulatory requirements, judicial decisions and guidance issued by authoritative bodies;\n● our estimates regarding expenses, future revenue and cash flow, capital requirements and needs for additional financing;\n● our financial performance;\n● the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of our business combination and/or divestitures; and\n● the effect of COVID-19 on the foregoing.\nYou should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this prospectus primarily on our\ncurrent expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. The\noutcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors described elsewhere in this prospectus and in the section\ntitled “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n13\nTHE SEPA TRANSACTION\nOn February 12, 2024, we entered into the Standby Equity Purchase Agreement (the “SEPA”) with YA II PN. Pursuant to the SEPA, we may sell to YA II PN up to $5,000,000, of\nshares of Common Stock (the “Advance Shares”), from time to time during the term of the SEPA. The SEPA contains customary representations, warranties, conditions and\nindemnification obligations of the parties. Pursuant to the SEPA, we also agreed to file a registration statement with the SEC, covering the resale of Advance Shares issued or sold\nto YA II PN under the SEPA under the Securities Act.\nIn consideration for YA II PN’s execution and delivery of the SEPA, we committed to issue to YA II PN 64,656 (the “Commitment Shares”).\nWe cannot sell any additional shares to YA II PN until the date that the registration statement which contains this prospectus is declared effective by the SEC and a final\nprospectus in connection therewith is filed and all of the other conditions set forth in the SEPA are satisfied (the “Commencement Date”). From and after such time, we will control\nthe timing and amount of any sales of our Common Stock to YA II PN. Actual sales of shares of our Common Stock to YA II PN under the SEPA will depend on a variety of factors\nto be determined by us from time to time, including, among others, market conditions, the trading price of the Common Stock and determinations by us as to the appropriate\nsources of funding for our company and our operations.\nBeginning on the Commencement Date and until February 12, 2027, under the terms and subject to the conditions of the SEPA, from time to time, at our discretion, we have the\nright, but not the obligation, to issue to YA II PN, and YA II PN is obligated to purchase, the Advance Shares, subject to certain limitations set forth in the SEPA. The purchase\nprice of the Advance Shares will be at one of two prices, as chosen by us in our sole discretion and specified in the notice given to YA II PN (each, a “SEPA Advance Notice”): (i)\n95% of the Market Price (as defined below) for any period commencing (1) if submitted to YA II PN prior to 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time on a trading day, the open of trading on such day\nor (2) if submitted to YA II PN after 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time on a trading day, upon receipt by us of written confirmation of acceptance of such SEPA Advance Notice by YA II PN\n(or the open of regular trading hours, if later), and in either case, ending on 4:00 pm New York Citytime on the applicable trading day (the “Option 1 Pricing Period”), and (ii) 96% of\nthe Market Price for any three consecutive trading days commencing on the SEPA Advance Notice date (the “Option 2 Pricing Period,” and each of the Option 1 Pricing Period and\nthe Option 2 Pricing Period, a “Pricing Period”). “Market Price” is defined as, for any Option 1 Pricing Period, the VWAP of the Common Stock on Nasdaq during the Option 1\nPricing Period, and for any Option 2 Pricing Period, the lowest VWAP of the Common Stock on the Nasdaq during the Option 2 Pricing Period.\nOur ability to issue Advance Shares under the SEPA are subject to certain limitations, including that YA II PN cannot purchase any shares that would result in it beneficially\nowning more than 4.99% of the our Common Stock at the time of us issuing a SEPA Advance Notice. Additionally, if the total number of shares of Common Stock traded on\nNasdaq during the applicable Pricing Period is less than the Volume Threshold (as defined below), then the number of shares of Common Stock issued and sold pursuant to such\nSEPA Advance Notice will be reduced to the greater of (a) 30% of the trading volume of the Common Stock on Nasdaq during the relevant Pricing Period as reported by Bloomberg\nL.P., or (b) the number of shares of Common Stock sold by YA II PN during such Pricing Period. “Volume Threshold” is defined as a number of shares of Common Stock equal to\nthe quotient of (a) the number of shares in the SEPA Advance Notice requested by the company divided by (b) 0.30.\nUnder the applicable rules of Nasdaq and pursuant to the SEPA, in no event were we permitted to issue to YA II PN more than 19.99% of the shares of the Common Stock\noutstanding immediately prior to the execution of the SEPA (the “Exchange Cap”), unless we obtained stockholder approval to issue shares of Common Stock in excess of the\nExchange Cap. On May 10, 2024, our stockholders approved the issuance of Common Stock in excess of the Exchange Cap.\nThe net proceeds from sales, if any, under the SEPA, will depend on the frequency and prices at which we sell shares of Common Stock to YA II PN. To the extent we sell shares\nunder the SEPA, we currently plan to use any proceeds therefrom for costs of this transaction, for working capital, strategic and other general corporate purposes.\nThe SEPA does not include any of the following: (i) limitations on our use of amounts we receive as the purchase price for shares of Common Stock sold to YA II PN; (ii) financial\nor business covenants, except that we may not effect any consolidation or transfer of substantially all of our assets while a SEPA Advance Notice is outstanding; (iii) restrictions\non future financings; (iv) rights of first refusal; or (v) participation rights or penalties.\nAs of September 10, 2024, there were 3,988,317 shares of our Common Stock outstanding. Although the SEPA provides that we may sell up to an aggregate of $5,000,000 of shares\nof our Common Stock to YA II PN, only 1,670,844 shares of our Common Stock are being registered for resale under this prospectus that we may issue and sell to YA II PN in the\nfuture under the SEPA, if and when we elect to sell shares of our Common Stock to YA II PN under the SEPA. Depending on the market prices of our Common Stock at the time we\nelect to issue and sell shares of our Common Stock to YA II PN under the SEPA, we may need to register for resale under the Securities Act additional shares of our Common Stock\nin order to receive aggregate gross proceeds equal to the $5,000,000 total commitment available to us under the SEPA. If all of such 1,670,844 shares of our Common Stock offered\nhereby were issued and outstanding as of the date of this prospectus, such shares would represent approximately 24.4% of the total number of outstanding shares of Common\nStock, and approximately 30.6% of the total number of outstanding shares of Common Stock held by non-affiliates, in each case as of the date of this prospectus. If we elect to\nissue and sell to YA II PN under the SEPA more than the 1,670,844 shares of our Common Stock being registered for resale by YA II PN under this prospectus, which we have the\nright, but not the obligation, to do, we must first register for resale under the Securities Act any such additional shares of our Common Stock, which could cause additional\nsubstantial dilution to our shareholders. The number of shares of our Common Stock ultimately offered for sale by YA II PN is dependent upon the number of shares purchased by\nYA II PN under the SEPA.\n14\nIssuances of our Common Stock to YA II PN under the SEPA will not affect the rights or privileges of our existing shareholders, except that the economic and voting interests of\neach of our existing shareholders will be diluted as a result of any such issuance. Although the number of shares of our Common Stock that our existing shareholders own will not\ndecrease, the shares of our Common Stock owned by our existing shareholders will represent a smaller percentage of our total outstanding shares of our Common Stock after any\nsuch issuance of shares of our Common Stock to YA II PN under the SEPA. There are substantial risks to our shareholders as a result of the sale and issuance of Common Stock to\nYA II PN under the SEPA. See “Risk Factors.”\nConditions to Commencement and for Delivery of SEPA Advance Notices\nOur ability to deliver SEPA Advance Notices to YA II PN under the SEPA are subject to the satisfaction by us, of certain conditions, all of which are entirely outside of YA II PN’s\ncontrol, including, but not limited to, the following:\n● the accuracy in all material respects of our representations and warranties included in the SEPA on the date of the SEPA and the date of each closing of a purchase and\nsale under the SEPA of;\n● we having performed, satisfied and complied in all material respects with all covenants, agreements and conditions required by the SEPA to be performed, satisfied or\ncomplied with by us;\n● the registration statement that includes this prospectus (and amendment or supplement thereto) shall have been declared effective and remain effective for the offering\nand sale of the shares and (i) we shall not have received notice that the SEC has issued or intends to issue a stop order with respect to such registration statement or that\nthe SEC otherwise has suspended or withdrawn the effectiveness of such registration statement, either temporarily or permanently, or intends or has threatened to do so\nand (ii) no other suspension of the use of, or withdrawal of the effectiveness of, such registration statement or the prospectus shall exist. YA II PN shall not have received\nany notice from us that the registration statement, prospectus and/or any prospectus supplement or amendment thereto fails to meet the requirements of Section 5(b) or\nSection 10 of the Securities Act;\n● the number of shares then to be purchased by YA II PN shall not exceed the number of such shares that, when aggregated with all other shares of Common Stock then\nowned by YA II PN beneficially or deemed beneficially owned by YA II PN, would result in YA II PN owning more than the beneficial ownership limitation;\n● trading in the Common Stock shall not have been suspended by the SEC or the Nasdaq, or otherwise halted for any reason, and the Common Stock shall have been\napproved for listing or quotation on and shall not have been delisted from or no longer quoted on the Nasdaq.\n● the issuance of shares of Common Stock to YA II PN, including the Commitment Shares, shall not exceed the Exchange Cap, if applicable, subject to appropriate\nadjustment for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, rights offerings, reclassification or similar transaction that proportionately decreases or increases the\nCommon Stock unless holders of a majority of our outstanding voting common stock that are present or represented by proxy at a meeting, to effectuate the transactions\ncontemplated by the SEPA;\n● the absence of any statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, ruling or injunction shall have been enacted, entered, promulgated or adopted by any court or\ngovernmental authority of competent jurisdiction that prohibits or directly and materially adversely affects any of the transactions contemplated by the SEPA and the\nexhibits thereto, and no proceeding shall have been commenced that may have the effect of prohibiting or materially adversely affecting any of the transactions\ncontemplated by the SEPA and the exhibits thereto;\n● the Common Stock must be DWAC Eligible and not subject to a “DTC chill”;\n● the issuance of the Advance Shares shall not violate the shareholder approval requirements of Nasdaq; and\n● all reports, schedules, registrations, forms, statements, information and other documents required to have been filed by us with the SEC pursuant to the reporting\nrequirements of the Exchange Act shall have been filed with the SEC.\n15\nTermination of the SEPA\nUnless earlier terminated as provided in the SEPA, the SEPA will terminate automatically on the earliest to occur of:\n● February 12, 2027; or\n● the date on which YA II PN shall have purchased Advance Shares for an aggregate purchase price of $5,000,000.\nNo Short-Selling or Hedging by YA II PN\nYA II PN has agreed that neither it nor any of its affiliates shall engage in any direct or indirect short-selling our Common Stock during any time prior to the termination of the\nSEPA.\nEffect of Performance of the SEPA on our Shareholders\nAll shares registered in this offering that may be issued or sold by us to YA II PN under the SEPA are expected to be freely tradable. The resale by YA II PN of a significant number\nof shares registered in this offering at any given time, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline and to be highly\nvolatile. Sales of our Common Stock to YA II PN, if any, will depend upon market conditions and other factors to be determined by us. We may ultimately decide to sell to YA II PN\nall, some or none of the additional shares of our Common Stock that may be available for us to sell pursuant to the SEPA. If and when we do sell shares to YA II PN, after YA II PN\nhas acquired the shares, YA II PN may resell all, some or none of those shares of Common Stock at any time or from time to time in its discretion. Therefore, sales to YA II PN by us\nunder the SEPA may result in substantial dilution to the interests of other holders of our Common Stock. In addition, if we sell a substantial number of shares to YA II PN under the\nSEPA, or if investors expect that we will do so, the actual sales of shares or the mere existence of our arrangement with YA II PN may make it more difficult for us to sell equity or\nequity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect such sales. However, we have the right to control the timing and amount of any\nadditional sales of Common Stock to YA II PN and the SEPA may be terminated by us at any time at our discretion without any cost to us, subject to certain conditions.\nPursuant to the terms of the SEPA, we have the right, but not the obligation, to direct YA II PN to purchase up to $5,000,000 of our Common Stock, subject to certain limitations. If\nwe elect to issue and sell to YA II PN under the SEPA more than the 1,670,844 shares of our Common Stock being registered for resale by YA II PN under this prospectus, which we\nhave the right, but not the obligation, to do, we must first register for resale under the Securities Act any such additional shares of our Common Stock, which could cause\nadditional substantial dilution to our shareholders. The number of shares of our Common Stock ultimately offered for sale by YA II PN is dependent upon the number of shares\npurchased by YA II PN under the SEPA.\nThe following table sets forth the amount of gross proceeds we would receive from YA II PN from our sale of shares of Common Stock to YA II PN under the SEPA at varying\npurchase prices:\nAssumed Number of Percentage of\nAverage Registered Shares to Outstanding Shares Gross Proceeds from\nPurchase Price be Issued if Full Issued After Giving the Sale of Shares to\nPer Share Purchase(1) Effect to the Issuance to YA II PN(2) YA II PN Under the SEPA\n$ 1.00 1,670,844 29.5% $ 1,670,844\n$ 1.50 1,670,844 29.5% $ 2,506,266\n$ 2.00(3) 1,670,844 29.5% $ 3,341,688\n$ 2.50 1,670,844 29.5% $ 4,177,110\n$ 3.00 1,666,667 29.5% $ 5,000,000\n$ 3.28(3) 1,524,390 27.7% $ 5,000,000\n(1) Although the SEPA provides that we may sell up to $5,000,000 of our Common Stock to YA II PN, we are only registering 1,670,844 shares under this prospectus that we may\nissue and sell to YA II PN in the future under the SEPA, if and when we elect to sell shares of our Common Stock to YA II PN under the SEPA.\n(2) The denominator is based on 3,988,317 shares of our Common Stock outstanding as of September 10, 2024, plus the number of shares set forth in the adjacent column that we\nwould have issued or sold to YA II PN, assuming the average purchase price in the first column. The numerator is based on the number of shares of our Common Stock\nissuable under the SEPA (that are the subject of this offering) at the corresponding assumed average purchase price set forth in the first column. The denominator does not\nassume the issuance of any shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the May Note or exercise of the Warrant.\n(3) The closing price of our Common Stock on September 10, 2024.\n16\nTHE YA NOTE TRANSACTION\nOn May 20, 2024, we issued the May Note in the original principal amount of $800,000 and related Warrant to EF Hutton YA Fund, LP (the “EF Hutton Fund”), a fund co-managed\nby Yorkville Advisors Global, LLC. EF Hutton Fund paid a purchase price of $720,000 to us for the May Note and Warrant. In addition, we paid a $36,000 financial advisory fee paid\nto EF Hutton LLC. The May Note was subsequently assigned by the EF Hutton Fund to YA II PN effective on July 25, 2024.\nThe May Note accrues an interest at an annual rate of 0%, however, the interest rate will increase to an annual rate of 18% upon the occurrence of an event of default. Beginning\non August 15, 2024, and continuing on the same day of each successive calendar month thereafter, we are required to make installment payments on the May Note until it is fully\nrepaid or YA II PN has converted the outstanding balance into shares of Common Stock. We have failed to make the first payment that was due on August 15, 2024, and thus the\nMay Note is accruing interest at the default rate of 18%. At any time, subject to certain ownership limitations, YA II PN may convert any portion of the outstanding and unpaid\nprincipal, interest, or other amounts outstanding under the May Note into Common Stock at a price equal to $2.29 per share, as may be adjusted to a variable price equal to 85% of\nthe lowest daily VWAP during the ten trading days preceding conversion, but no lower than $1.00. In addition, the May Note grants us the right to redeem early a portion or all of\nthe amount under the Promissory Note prior to its maturity or conversion at a 15% premium. The maturity date of the May Note is May 20, 2025 although it may be extended at the\noption of YA II PN.\nThe Warrant is exercisable by YA II PN at any time after issuance until the date that is 60 months after the issuance date. The Warrant is exercisable into Warrant Shares at an\nexercise price of $2.29 per share, subject to adjustment as described in the Warrant. If a registration statement covering the resale of the Warrant Shares is not available by August\n15, 2024, then YA II PN may exercise the Warrant in whole or in part on a cashless basis.\nPursuant to the May Note, we agreed to, at any time after July 15, 2024 and upon written notice from YA II PN, file a registration statement within 30 days of such notice on Form S-\n3 or Form S-1 covering the resale by the Holder of Common Stock underlying the May Note. We are registering hereby 800,000 shares of Common Stock underlying the May Note\nbecause that is equal to the maximum number of shares issuable upon conversion of the May Note.\nThe May Note contains customary representations and warranties for the benefit of YA II PN. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the May Note were\nmade only for purposes of the May Note and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreement and are subject to certain important limitations.\nAdditionally, while any amount remains outstanding on the May Note, we have agreed not to effect any transaction involving a Variable Rate Transaction (as defined in the May\nNote) and we granted YA II PN a right of first refusal on any financing transaction pursuant to which we propose to issue and sell our securities. YA II PN shall not have the right\nto convert any portion of the May Note to the extent that after giving effect to such conversion, YAII PN would beneficially own 4.99% of the number of Common Stock\noutstanding immediately after giving effect to such conversion or receipt of Common Stock as interest. The provisions of the 4.99% beneficial ownership limitation can be waived\nby YA II PN (but only as to itself) upon not less than 65 days prior notice to us.\nIssuances of our Common Stock to YA II PN under the May Note or the Warrant will not affect the rights or privileges of our existing shareholders, except that the economic and\nvoting interests of each of our existing shareholders will be diluted as a result of any such issuance. Although the number of shares of our Common Stock that our existing\nshareholders own will not decrease, the shares of our Common Stock owned by our existing shareholders will represent a smaller percentage of our total outstanding shares of our\nCommon Stock after any such issuance of shares of our Common Stock to YA II PN upon conversion of the May Note or exercise of the Warrant. There are substantial risks to our\nshareholders as a result of the sale and issuance of Common Stock to YA II PN under the May Note and the Warrant. See “Risk Factors.”\n17\nPRIVATE PLACEMENTS\nFrom February 29, 2024 through June 21, 2024, we closed on private placement transactions with four “accredited investors” (the “Investors”), as defined in Rule 501(a) of\nRegulation D under the Securities Act. In connection with the private placement transactions, we entered into securities subscription agreements (the “Subscription Agreements”)\nwith the Investors pursuant to which we offered and sold to the Investors a total of 826,264 shares (the “2024 Shares”) of our Common Stock at a purchase price of $2.25 per share\nfor 444,445 shares, $2.75 per share for 181,819 Shares, and $3.00 for 200,000 Shares, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $2.1 million.\nOn August 29, 2024, we issued the August Note in the original principal amount of $500,000, to Quen Inno Tech Co., Ltd. (the “Quen Inno Tech”). Quen Inno Tech paid a purchase\nprice of $500,000 to the Company for the August Note.\nThe August Note accrues interest at an annual rate of 0%; however, the interest rate will increase to an annual rate of 10% upon the occurrence of an event of default. Beginning\non August 21, 2025, and continuing on the same day of each successive calendar month thereafter, we are required to make installment payments on the August Note until it is\nfully repaid or Quen Inno Tech has converted the outstanding balance into shares of our Common Stock. At any time, subject to certain ownership limitations, Quen Inno Tech\nmay convert any portion of the outstanding and unpaid principal, interest, or other amounts outstanding under the August Note into Common Stock at a price equal to $3.36 per\nshare. In addition, the August Note grants us the right to redeem early a portion or all of the amount under the August Note prior to its maturity or conversion at a 15% premium.\nThe August Note contains customary representations and warranties for the benefit of Quen Inno Tech. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the August\nNote were made only for purposes of the August Note and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreement and are subject to certain important\nlimitations.\nIssuances of our Common Stock to Quen Inno Tech under the August Note will not affect the rights or privileges of our existing shareholders, except that the economic and voting\ninterests of each of our existing shareholders will be diluted as a result of any such issuance. Although the number of shares of our Common Stock that our existing shareholders\nown will not decrease, the shares of our Common Stock owned by our existing shareholders will represent a smaller percentage of our total outstanding shares of our Common\nStock after any such issuance of shares of our Common Stock to Quen Inno Tech upon conversion of the August Note. There are substantial risks to our shareholders as a result\nof the sale and issuance of Common Stock to Quen Inno Tech under the August Note. See “Risk Factors.”\n18\nUSE OF PROCEEDS\nThis prospectus relates to shares of Common Stock that may be offered and sold from time to time by the Selling Stockholders. We will not receive any proceeds from the resale of\nshares of Common Stock by the Selling Stockholders.\nWe may receive up to $5,000,000 in gross proceeds pursuant to the SEPA and up to $400,750 upon exercise of the Warrant.

Under these rules, beneficial ownership generally includes any shares as to\nwhich the individual or entity has sole or shared voting power or investment power and includes any shares that an individual or entity has the right to acquire beneficial\nownership of within 60 days of the Determination Date, through the exercise of any option, warrant or similar right (such instruments being deemed to be “presently exercisable”).\nIn computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, shares of our Common Stock that could be issued upon the\nexercise of presently exercisable options and warrants are considered to be outstanding. These shares, however, are not considered outstanding as of the Determination Date\nwhen computing the percentage ownership of each other person.\nTo our knowledge, except as indicated in the footnotes to the following table, and subject to state community property laws where applicable, all beneficial owners named in the\nfollowing table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares shown as beneficially owned by them. Percentage of ownership is based on 3,988,317 shares of\nCommon Stock outstanding as of the Determination Date. Unless otherwise indicated, the business address of each person in the table below is c/o Reborn Coffee Inc., 580 N.\nBerry St. Brea, CA 92821.

You should also refer to the text\nof our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws, which are filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is part.\nAuthorized and Outstanding Capital Stock\nThe total amount of our authorized share capital consists of 40,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value\n$0.0001 per share.\nCommon Stock\nHolders of shares of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters on which stockholders are entitled to vote generally, including the\nelection or removal of directors. The holders of our common stock do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors.\nHolders of shares of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends at the same rate when, as and if declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available therefor,\nsubject to any statutory or contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends and to the rights of the holders of one or more outstanding series of our preferred stock.\nUpon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, and after payment in full of all amounts required to be paid to creditors, the holders of shares of our common will be entitled to\nreceive pro rata our remaining assets available for distribution.\nAll shares of our common stock that are outstanding are fully paid and non-assessable. The common stock is be subject to further calls or assessments by us. Holders of shares of\nour common stock do not have preemptive, subscription, redemption or conversion rights. There will be no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock.\nThe rights, powers, preferences and privileges of holders of our common stock will be subject to those of the holders of any shares of our preferred stock or any other series or\nclass of stock we may authorize and issue in the future.\nNo shares of common stock are subject to redemption or have preemptive rights to purchase additional shares of common stock. Holders of shares of our common stock do not\nhave subscription, redemption or conversion rights. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock.\nAnti-Takeover Effects of Certain Provisions\nBecause our stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights, stockholders holding a majority of the voting power of our shares of common stock will be able to elect all our\ndirectors. A special meeting of stockholders may be called by a majority of our board of directors, the chair of our board of directors, or our chief executive officer. Our bylaws\nestablish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for\nelection to our board of directors.\nThis will make it more difficult for another party to obtain control of us by replacing our board of directors. Since our board of directors has the power to retain and discharge our\nofficers, these provisions could also make it more difficult for existing stockholders or another party to effect a change in management. This intended to preserve our existing\ncontrol structure following this offering, facilitate our continued product innovation and the risk-taking that it requires, permit us to continue to prioritize our long-term goals rather\nthan short-term results, enhance the likelihood of continued stability in the composition of our board of directors and its policies and to discourage certain types of transactions\nthat may involve an actual or threatened acquisition of us. These provisions are also designed to reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited acquisition proposal and to discourage\ncertain tactics that may be used in proxy fights. However, such provisions could have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares and may have the\neffect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying changes in our control or management. As a consequence, these provisions may also inhibit fluctuations in the market price of our\nstock that could result from actual or rumored takeover attempts.\n23\nWe are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested\nstockholder for a period of three years after the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder, subject to certain exceptions.\nExclusive Forum\nOur bylaws contain an exclusive forum provision providing that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for: (1) any derivative action or\nproceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by, or other wrongdoing by, any of our directors, officers, employees, agents\nor stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or (4)\nany action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. However, the exclusive forum provision states that it shall not apply to actions arising under the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nIn addition, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the\nSecurities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the\nSecurities Act or any other claim for which the federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with\nthe federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nAny person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to this provision included in\nour bylaws. The exclusive forum provision, if enforced, may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our\ndirectors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find the exclusive forum provision to be inapplicable or unenforceable\nin an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and growth prospects. For example, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware recently determined that a provision stating that U.S. federal\ndistrict courts are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act is not enforceable.\nCorporate Opportunities\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce any interest or expectancy in the business opportunities of our its officers, directors, agents, stockholders, members,\npartners, affiliates and subsidiaries and each such party shall not have any obligation to offer us those opportunities unless presented to one of our directors or officers in his or\nher capacity as a director or officer.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nOur transfer agent and registrar is Securities Transfer Corporation. The transfer agent’s address is 15500 Roosevelt Blvd, Suite 104, Clearwater, Florida 33760 and the telephone\nnumber is (469) 633-0101.\nListing\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “REBN”.\n24\nSELLING STOCKHOLDER\nThis prospectus relates to:\n● The resale of 826,264 shares of our currently outstanding Common Stock.\n● The issuance and resale of up to 2,859,310 shares of Common Stock issuable by us, consisting of (i) up to 1,670,844 shares of Common Stock that we may sell to YA II PN,\nfrom time to time at our sole discretion, pursuant to the SEPA; (ii) 64,656 Commitment Shares; (iii) up to 175,000 shares of Common Stock underlying the Warrant; and (iv)\n948,810 shares of Common Stock underlying the Notes.\nFor additional information regarding the shares of Common Stock included in this prospectus, see the section titled “The SEPA Transaction,” “The YA Note Transaction,” and\n“Private Placements” above.

The percentage of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Selling Stockholders prior to the offering shown in the table below is\nbased on an aggregate 3,988,317 shares of our Common Stock outstanding on August 6, 2024.\nBecause the purchase price per share to be paid by YA II PN for the shares of Common Stock that we may, in our discretion, elect to sell to YA II PN from time to time after the date\nof this prospectus in purchases pursuant to the SEPA, if any, will fluctuate based on the market prices of our Common Stock at the times we elect to sell such shares to YA II PN in\npurchases under the SEPA, it is not possible for us to predict, as of the date of this prospectus and prior to any such purchases under the SEPA, the actual number of shares of\nCommon Stock that we will sell to YA II PN under the SEPA, which may be fewer than the number of shares of Common Stock being offered for resale by YA II PN under this\nprospectus.

The other Selling Stockholders and any broker-dealers or agents that are involved in selling the\nsecurities may be deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with such sales. In such event, any commissions received by such broker-\ndealers or agents and any profit on the resale of the securities purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act.

Each director serves\nuntil the expiration of the term for which such director was elected or appointed, or until such director’s earlier death, resignation or removal.\nInvolvement in Certain Legal Proceedings\nAs of the filing of this the registration statement of which prospectus is contained, there are no legal proceedings, and during the past ten years there have been no legal\nproceedings, that are material to an evaluation of the ability or integrity of any of our directors, director nominees or executive officers.\nCommittees of Our Board of Directors\nOur board of directors has established a compensation committee and an audit committee. The composition and responsibilities of each of the committees of our board of directors\nare described below. Members serve on these committees until their resignation or until otherwise determined by our board of directors. Our board of directors may establish other\ncommittees as it deems necessary or appropriate from time to time.\nAudit Committee\nAs of the date of this filing, our audit committee consists of Farooq M. Arjomand, Sehan Kim, and Andy Nasim. Each member of our audit committee can read and understand\nfundamental financial statements in accordance with applicable requirements. The chair of our audit committee is Farooq M. Arjomand, who our board of directors has determined\nis an “audit committee financial expert” within the meaning of SEC regulations. In arriving at these determinations, our board of directors has examined each audit committee\nmember’s scope of experience and the nature of their employment in the corporate finance sector.\nThe principal duties and responsibilities of our audit committee include, among other things:\n● hiring and selecting a qualified firm to serve as the independent registered public accounting firm to audit our financial statements;\n31\n● helping to ensure the independence and performance of the independent registered public accounting firm;\n● helping to maintain and foster an open avenue of communication between management and the independent registered public accounting firm;\n● discussing the scope and results of the audit with the independent registered public accounting firm, and reviewing, with management and the independent registered\npublic accounting firm, our interim and year-end operating results;\n● developing procedures for employees to submit concerns anonymously about questionable accounting or audit matters;\n● reviewing our policies on risk assessment and risk management;\n● reviewing related party transactions;\n● obtaining and reviewing a report by the independent registered public accounting firm at least annually, that describes its internal quality-control procedures, any material\nissues with such procedures, and any steps taken to deal with such issues when required by applicable law; and\n● approving (or, as permitted, pre-approving) all audit and all permissible non-audit services to be performed by the independent registered public accounting firm.\nOur audit committee operates under a written charter that satisfies the applicable listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nCompensation Committee\nOur compensation committee consists of Farooq M.

In accordance with the Nasdaq Stock Exchange corporate governance standards, a majority of the independent directors may\nrecommend a director nominee for selection by the board of directors. The board of directors believes that the independent directors can satisfactorily carry out the responsibility\nof properly selecting or approving director nominees without the formation of a standing nominating committee. As there is no standing nominating committee, we do not have a\nnominating committee charter in place.\nThe board of directors will also consider director candidates recommended for nomination by our stockholders during such times as they are seeking proposed nominees to stand\nfor election at the next annual meeting of stockholders (or, if applicable, a special meeting of stockholders). Our stockholders that wish to nominate a director for election to our\nboard of directors should follow the procedures set forth in our bylaws.\nWe expect to expand our board of directors in the future to include additional independent directors. In adding additional members to our board of directors, we will consider each\ncandidate’s independence, skills and expertise based on a variety of factors, including the person’s experience or background in management, finance, regulatory matters and\ncorporate governance. Further, when identifying nominees to serve as a director, we expect that our board of directors will seek to create a board of directors that is strong in its\ncollective knowledge and has a diversity of skills and experience with respect to accounting and finance, management and leadership, vision and strategy, business operations,\nbusiness judgment, industry knowledge and corporate governance.\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\nIn filing our Registration Statement on Form S-1 on July 3, 2017, we adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to all our employees, officers and directors.

Indemnification of Directors and Officers.\nUnder Delaware law, a Delaware corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action,\nsuit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than one by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that the person is or was a\ndirector, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, against\njudgments, fines, amounts paid in settlement and reasonable expenses, including attorneys’ fees actually and necessarily incurred as a result of such action or proceeding, if such\ndirector or officer acted, in good faith, for a purpose which such person reasonably believed to be, in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation and, in criminal\nactions or proceedings, in addition, had no reasonable cause to believe that such conduct was unlawful.\nIn the case of a derivative action, a Delaware corporation may indemnify any such person against expense, including attorneys’ fees actually and necessarily incurred by such\nperson in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if such director or officer if such director or officer acted, in good faith, for a purpose which such person\nreasonably believed to be, in or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation, except that no indemnification will be made in respect on any claim, issue or matter as to\nwhich such person will have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any other court in\nwhich such action was brought determines such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expense.\nDelaware Law permits a corporation to include in its certificate of incorporation a provision eliminating or limiting a director’s liability to a corporation or its stockholders for\nmonetary damages for breaches of fiduciary duty. Delaware Law provides, however, that liability for breaches of the duty of loyalty, acts or omissions not in good faith or\ninvolving intentional misconduct, or knowing violation of the law, and the unlawful purchase or redemption of stock or payment of unlawful purchase or redemption of stock or\npayment of unlawful dividends or the receipt of improper personal benefits cannot be eliminated or limited in this manner.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law and may, if and to the extent authorized by\nthe Board of Directors, indemnify our officers and any other person whom we have the power to indemnify against any liability, reasonable expense or other matter whatsoever.\nAny amendment, modification or repeal of the foregoing provisions shall be prospective only, and shall not affect any rights or protections of any of our directors existing as of the\ntime of such amendment, modification or repeal.\nWe may also, at the discretion of the Board of Directors, purchase and maintain insurance to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law on behalf of any of our directors, officers,\nemployees or agents against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity.\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling the\nRegistrant pursuant to the foregoing, the Registrant has been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities\nAct and is therefore unenforceable.\nII-1\nItem 15.

Provided, however,\nthat no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed\nincorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of\nsale prior to such effective date, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration\nstatement or made in any such document immediately prior to such effective date.\nII-3\n(5) That, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each filing of the registrant’s annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange\nAct (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plan’s annual report pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act) that is incorporated by reference in\nthe registration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time\nshall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.\n(i) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant\npursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as\nexpressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by\nthe registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding)\nis asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its\ncounsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is\nagainst public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.\nII-4\nSIGNATURES\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, the registrant has duly caused this registration statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly\nauthorized in the Brea, California, on September 11, 2024.\nREBORN COFFEE, INC.\nBy: /s/ Jay Kim\nJay Kim\nChief Executive Officer\nPOWER OF ATTORNEY\nEach person whose signature appears below constitutes and appoints Jay Kim as his true and lawful attorneys-in-fact and agents, each acting alone, with full power of\nsubstitution and resubstitution, for him and in his name, place and stead, in any and all capacities, to sign any and all amendments (including post-effective amendments) to this\nregistration statement on Form S-1 and any subsequent registration statement the Registrant may hereafter file with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 462\nunder the Securities Act to register additional securities in connection with this registration statement, and to file this registration statement, with all exhibits thereto, and other\ndocuments in connection therewith, with the Securities and Exchange Commission, granting unto said attorneys-in-fact and agents, and each of them, full power and authority to\ndo and perform each and every act and thing requisite and necessary to be done in order to effectuate the same as fully, to all intents and purposes, as he might or could do in\nperson, hereby ratifying and confirming all that said attorneys-in-fact and agents, or any of them, may lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof.\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act, this registration statement has been signed by the following persons in the capacities and on the dates indicated.\nSignature Title Date\n/s/ Jay Kim Chief Executive Officer and Director September 11, 2024\nJay Kim (Principal Executive Officer)\n/s/ Stephan Kim Chief Financial Officer September 11, 2024\nStephan Kim (Principal Financial Officer and Principal\nAccounting Officer)\n/s/ Farooq M.

The Company shall not issue any fraction of a share of Common Shares upon any conversion. All calculations under\nthis Section (4) shall be rounded to the nearest $0.0001. If the issuance would result in the issuance of a fraction of a share of Common Shares, the Company shall round such\nfraction of a share of Common Shares up to the nearest whole share. The Company shall pay any and all transfer, stamp and similar taxes that may be payable with respect to the\nissuance and delivery of Common Shares upon conversion of any Conversion Amount.\n(b) Mechanics of Conversion.\n(i) Optional Conversion. To convert any Conversion Amount into Common Shares on any date (a “Conversion Date”), the Holder shall (A)\ntransmit by email (or otherwise deliver), for receipt on or prior to 11:59 p.m., New York Time, on such date, a copy of an executed notice of conversion in the form attached hereto as\nExhibit I (the “Conversion Notice”) to the Company and (B) if required by Section (4)(b)(iii), surrender this Note to a nationally recognized overnight delivery service for delivery to\nthe Company (or an indemnification undertaking reasonably satisfactory to the Company with respect to this Note in the case of its loss, theft or destruction). On or before the\nthird (3rd) Trading Day following the date of receipt of a Conversion Notice (the “Share Delivery Date”), the Company shall (X) if legends are not required to be placed on\ncertificates of Common Shares and provided that the Transfer Agent is participating in the Depository Trust Company’s (“DTC”) Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program,\ncredit such aggregate number of Common Shares to which the Holder shall be entitled to the Holder’s or its designee’s balance account with DTC through its Deposit Withdrawal\nAgent Commission system or (Y) if the Transfer Agent is not participating in the DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, issue and deliver to the address as specified in\nthe Conversion Notice, a certificate, registered in the name of the Holder or its designee, for the number of Common Shares to which the Holder shall be entitled which certificates\nshall not bear any restrictive legends unless required pursuant to rules and regulations of the Commission. If this Note is physically surrendered for conversion and the\noutstanding Principal of this Note is greater than the Principal portion of the Conversion Amount being converted, then the Company shall as soon as practicable and in no event\nlater than three (3) Business Days after receipt of this Note and at its own expense, issue and deliver to the holder a new Note representing the outstanding Principal not\nconverted. The Person or Persons entitled to receive the Common Shares issuable upon a conversion of this Note shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders\nof such Common Shares upon the transmission of a Conversion Notice.\n6\n(ii) Company’s Failure to Timely Convert. If within three (3) Trading Days after the Company’s receipt of an email copy of a Conversion Notice\nthe Company shall fail to issue and deliver a certificate to the Holder or credit the Holder’s balance account with DTC for the number of Common Shares to which the Holder is\nentitled upon such holder’s conversion of any Conversion Amount (a “Conversion Failure”), and if on or after such Trading Day the Holder purchases (in an open market\ntransaction or otherwise) Common Shares to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of Common Shares issuable upon such conversion that the Holder anticipated receiving\nfrom the Company (a “Buy-In”), then the Company shall, within three (3) Business Days after the Holder’s request and in the Holder’s discretion, either (i) pay cash to the Holder\nin an amount equal to the Holder’s total purchase price (including brokerage commissions and other out of pocket expenses, if any) for the Common Shares so purchased (the\n“Buy-In Price”), at which point the Company’s obligation to deliver such certificate (and to issue such Common Shares) shall terminate, or (ii) promptly honor its obligation to\ndeliver to the Holder a certificate or certificates representing such Common Shares and pay cash to the Holder in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the Buy-In Price over the\nproduct of (A) such number of Common Shares, times (B) the Closing Price on the Conversion Date.\n(iii) Book-Entry. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, upon conversion of any portion of this Note in accordance with the\nterms hereof, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Note to the Company unless (A) the full Conversion Amount represented by this Note is being\nconverted or (B) the Holder has provided the Company with prior written notice (which notice may be included in a Conversion Notice) requesting reissuance of this Note upon\nphysical surrender of this Note. The Holder and the Company shall maintain records showing the Principal and Interest converted and the dates of such conversions or shall use\nsuch other method, reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and the Company, so as not to require physical surrender of this Note upon conversion.\n(c) Limitations on Conversions.\n(i) Beneficial Ownership. The Holder shall not have the right to convert any portion of this Note to the extent that after giving effect to such\nconversion, the Holder, together with any affiliate thereof, would beneficially own (as determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated\nthereunder) in excess of 4.99% of the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to such conversion or receipt of shares as payment of interest. Since\nthe Holder will not be obligated to report to the Company the number of Common Shares it may hold at the time of a conversion hereunder, unless the conversion at issue would\nresult in the issuance of Common Shares in excess of 4.99% of the then outstanding Common Shares without regard to any other shares which may be beneficially owned by the\nHolder or an affiliate thereof, the Holder shall have the authority and obligation to determine whether the restriction contained in this Section will limit any particular conversion\nhereunder and to the extent that the Holder determines that the limitation contained in this Section applies, the determination of which portion of the Principal amount of this Note\nis convertible shall be the responsibility and obligation of the Holder. If the Holder has delivered a Conversion Notice for a Principal amount of this Note that, without regard to\nany other shares that the Holder or its affiliates may beneficially own, would result in the issuance in excess of the permitted amount hereunder, the Company shall notify the\nHolder of this fact and shall honor the conversion for the maximum Principal amount permitted to be converted on such Conversion Date in accordance with Section (4)(a) and, any\nPrincipal amount tendered for conversion in excess of the permitted amount hereunder shall remain outstanding under this Note. The provisions of this Section may be waived by a\nHolder (but only as to itself and not to any other Holder) upon not less than 65 days prior notice to the Company.\n7\n(ii) Principal Market Limitation. Notwithstanding anything in this Note to the contrary, the Company shall not issue any Common Shares upon\nconversion of this Note, or otherwise, if the issuance of such Common Shares would exceed the aggregate number Common Shares that the Company may issue in a transaction in\ncompliance with the Company’s obligations under the rules or regulations of Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (the “Nasdaq”) and shall be referred to as the “Exchange Cap,” except that\nsuch limitation shall not apply if the Company’s stockholders have approved such issuances on such terms in excess of the Exchange Cap in accordance with the rules of the\nNasdaq.\n(d) Other Provisions.\n(i) All calculations under this Section (4) shall be rounded to the nearest $0.0001 or whole share.\n(ii) So long as this Note remain outstanding, the Company shall have reserved from its duly authorized share capital, and shall have instructed\nits transfer agent to irrevocably reserve, the maximum number of Common Shares issuable upon conversion of this Note (the “Required Reserve Amount”), provided that at no time\nshall the number of Common Shares reserved pursuant to this Section (4)(d)(ii) be reduced other than proportionally with respect to all Common Shares in connection with any\nconversion (other than pursuant to the conversion of this Note in accordance with their terms) and/or cancellation, or reverse stock split. If at any time the number of Common\nShares authorized but unissued and not otherwise reserved for issuance (including (i) in relation to equity or debt securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for or\nthat can be settled in Common Shares (other than the Note) and (ii) Common Shares remaining available for issuance under the Company’s equity incentive plans) is not sufficient\nto meet the Required Reserve Amount, the Company will promptly take all corporate action necessary to propose to its general meeting of shareholders an increase of its\nauthorized share capital necessary to meet the Company’s obligations pursuant to this Note, recommending that shareholders vote in favor of such an increase. The Company\ncovenants that, upon issuance in accordance with conversion of this Note in accordance with its terms, the Common Shares, when issued, will be validly issued, fully paid and\nnonassessable.\n(iii) Nothing herein shall limit a Holder’s right to pursue actual damages or declare an Event of Default pursuant to Section (2) herein for the\nCompany’s failure to deliver certificates representing Common Shares upon conversion within the period specified herein and such Holder shall have the right to pursue all\nremedies available to it at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief, in each case without the need to post a bond or\nprovide other security. The exercise of any such rights shall not prohibit the Holder from seeking to enforce damages pursuant to any other Section hereof or under applicable law.\n8\n(iv) Legal Opinions. The Company is obligated to cause its legal counsel to deliver legal opinions to the Company’s transfer agent in\nconnection with any legend removal upon the expiration of any holding period or other requirement for which the Underlying Shares may bear legends restricting the transfer\nthereof. To the extent that a legal opinion is not provided (either timely or at all), then the Company agrees to reimburse the Holder for all reasonable costs incurred by the Holder in\nconnection with any legal opinions paid for by the Holder in connection with sale or transfer of Underlying Common Shares. The Holder shall notify the Company of any such\ncosts and expenses it incurs that are referred to in this section from time to time and all amounts owed hereunder shall be paid by the Company with reasonable promptness.\n(e) Adjustment of Conversion Price upon Subdivision or Combination of Common Shares. If the Company, at any time while this Note is outstanding,\nshall (a) pay a stock dividend or otherwise make a distribution or distributions on shares of its Common Shares or any other equity or equity equivalent securities payable in\nCommon Shares, (b) subdivide outstanding Common Shares into a larger number of shares, (c) combine (including by way of reverse stock split) outstanding Common Shares into\na smaller number of shares, or (d) issue by reclassification of Common Shares any shares of capital stock of the Company, then the Fixed Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of\nwhich the numerator shall be the number of Common Shares (excluding treasury shares, if any) outstanding before such event and of which the denominator shall be the number of\nCommon Shares outstanding after such event. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of\nstockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or re-\nclassification.\n(f) Other Corporate Events. In addition to and not in substitution for any other rights hereunder, prior to the consummation of any Fundamental\nTransaction pursuant to which holders of Common Shares are entitled to receive securities or other assets with respect to or in exchange for Common Shares (a “Corporate\nEvent”), the Company shall make appropriate provision to ensure that the Holder will thereafter have the right to receive upon a conversion of this Note, at the Holder’s option, (i)\nin addition to the Common Shares receivable upon such conversion, such securities or other assets to which the Holder would have been entitled with respect to such Common\nShares had such Common Shares been held by the Holder upon the consummation of such Corporate Event (without taking into account any limitations or restrictions on the\nconvertibility of this Note) or (ii) in lieu of the Common Shares otherwise receivable upon such conversion, such securities or other assets received by the holders of Common\nShares in connection with the consummation of such Corporate Event in such amounts as the Holder would have been entitled to receive had this Note initially been issued with\nconversion rights for the form of such consideration (as opposed to Common Shares) at a conversion rate for such consideration commensurate with the Fixed Price. Provision\nmade pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be in a form and substance satisfactory to the Required Holders. The provisions of this Section shall apply similarly and equally to\nsuccessive Corporate Events and shall be applied without regard to any limitations on the conversion or redemption of this Note.\n(g) Whenever the Fixed Price is adjusted pursuant to Section (3) hereof, the Company shall promptly provide the Holder with a written notice setting\nforth the Fixed Price after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment.\n9\n(h) In case of any (1) merger or consolidation of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company with or into another Person, or (2) sale by the Company\nor any Subsidiary of the Company of more than one-half of the assets of the Company in one or a series of related transactions, a Holder shall have the right to (A) exercise any\nrights under Section (3)(a)(vii), (B) convert the aggregate amount of this Note then outstanding into the shares of stock and other securities, cash and property receivable upon or\ndeemed to be held by holders of Common Shares following such merger, consolidation or sale, and such Holder shall be entitled upon such event or series of related events to\nreceive such amount of securities, cash and property as the Common Shares into which such aggregate Principal amount of this Note could have been converted immediately prior\nto such merger, consolidation or sales would have been entitled, or (C) in the case of a merger or consolidation, require the surviving entity to issue to the Holder a convertible\nNote with a Principal amount equal to the aggregate Principal amount of this Note then held by such Holder, plus all accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts owing thereon,\nwhich such newly issued convertible Note shall have terms identical (including with respect to conversion) to the terms of this Note, and shall be entitled to all of the rights and\nprivileges of the Holder of this Note set forth herein and the agreements pursuant to which this Note was issued. In the case of clause (C), the conversion price applicable for the\nnewly issued shares of convertible preferred stock or convertible debentures shall be based upon the amount of securities, cash and property that each Common Shares would\nreceive in such transaction and the Fixed Price in effect immediately prior to the effectiveness or closing date for such transaction. The terms of any such merger, sale or\nconsolidation shall include such terms so as to continue to give the Holder the right to receive the securities, cash and property set forth in this Section upon any conversion or\nredemption following such event. This provision shall similarly apply to successive such events.\n(5) REISSUANCE OF THIS NOTE.\n(a) Transfer. If this Note is to be transferred, the Holder shall surrender this Note to the Company, whereupon the Company will forthwith issue and\ndeliver upon the order of the Holder a new Note (in accordance with Section (5)(d)), registered in the name of the registered transferee or assignee, representing the outstanding\nPrincipal being transferred by the Holder (along with any accrued and unpaid interest thereof) and, if less than the entire outstanding Principal is being transferred, a new Note (in\naccordance with Section (5)(d)) to the Holder representing the outstanding Principal not being transferred.\n(b) Lost, Stolen or Mutilated Note.

NATURE OF OPERATIONS\nReborn Coffee, Inc. (\"Reborn”) was incorporated in the State of Florida in January 2018. In July 2022, Reborn was migrated from Florida to Delaware, and filed a certificate\nof incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware having the same capitalization structure as the Florida predecessor entity. Reborn has the following\nsubsidiaries:\n● Reborn Global Holdings, Inc. (\"Reborn Holdings”), a California Corporation incorporated in November 2014 and wholly-owned by Reborn Coffee, Inc. Reborn\nHoldings is engaged in the operation of wholesale distribution and retail coffee stores in California to sell a variety of coffee, tea, Reborn brand name water and other\nbeverages along with bakery and dessert products.\n● Reborn Coffee Franchise, LLC (the \"Reborn Coffee Franchise”), a California limited liability corporation formed in December 2020 and wholly-owned by Reborn\nCoffee, Inc, is a franchisor providing premier roaster specialty coffee to franchisees or customers. Reborn Coffee Franchise continues to develop the Reborn Coffee\nsystem for the establishment and operation of Reborn Coffee stores using one or more Reborn Coffee marks. Reborn Coffee Franchise does not have any franchisee\nas of December 31, 2023.\n● Reborn Realty, LLC (the \"Reborn Realty”), a California limited liability corporation formed in March 2023 and wholly-owned by Reborn Coffee, Inc, is an entity which\nacquired a real property located at 596 Apollo Street, Brea, California.\n● Reborn Coffee Korea, Inc. (the \"Reborn Korea”) – a Korea corporation located in Daejon, South Korea formed in October 2023 and wholly-owned by Reborn Coffee,\nInc, with one retail coffee store under the brand name of Reborn Coffee.\n● Reborn Malaysia, Inc. (the \"Reborn Malaysia”) – a Malaysian corporation located in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia formed in October 2023, is majority owned by Reborn\nCoffee, Inc. (60% ownership), with one retail coffee store under the brand name of Reborn Coffee.\nReborn Coffee, Inc., Reborn Global Holdings, Inc., Reborn Coffee Franchise, LLC, Reborn Realty, LLC, Reborn Korea and Reborn Malaysia will be collectively referred as\nthe \"Company”.\nGoing Concern Matters\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America\n(\"GAAP”), which contemplates the Company’s continuation as a going concern. The Company incurred a net comprehensive loss of $2,307,156 during the six months\nended June 30, 2024, and has an accumulated deficit of $19,064,080 as of June 30, 2024. In addition, current liabilities exceed current assets by $2,054,312 as of June 30,\n2024.\nManagement intends to raise additional operating funds through equity and/or debt offerings. However, there can be no assurance management will be successful in its\nendeavors.\nThere are no assurances that the Company will be able to either (1) achieve a level of revenues adequate to generate sufficient cash flow from operations; or (2) obtain\nadditional financing through either private placement, public offerings, and/or bank financing necessary to support its working capital requirements. To the extent that\nfunds generated from operations and any private placements, public offerings, and/or bank financing are insufficient, the Company will have to raise additional working\ncapital. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available, or if available, will be on terms acceptable to the Company. If adequate working capital is not\navailable to the Company, it may be required to curtail or cease its operations.\nDue to uncertainties related to these matters, there exists substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The accompanying\nconsolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification of asset-carrying amounts or the amounts and\nclassification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nUnaudited Interim Financial Statements\nThe accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements (\"Interim Financial Statements”) of the Company and its 100%-owned subsidiaries\nhave been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP”) for interim financial information and are\npresented in accordance with the requirements of Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. Accordingly, these Interim Financial Statements do not include all of the information and\nnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. These Interim Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements\nand notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in the Company’s Form 10-K/A. In the opinion of management, the Interim Financial Statements included\nherein contain all adjustments, including normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position, the results of operations\nand cash flows for the periods presented.\nThe operating results and cash flows of the interim periods presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other interim period or the\nfull year.\n5\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nReporting\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include Reborn Coffee, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and\nfor the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP”)\nas promulgated in the United States of America. The consolidated financial statements include Reborn Coffee, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary. All intercompany\naccounts, transactions, and profits have been eliminated upon consolidation.\nMinority Interest\nReborn owns 60% of Reborn Malaysia located in Kuala Lumpur with one retail coffee store under the brand name of Reborn Coffee. For the six-month period ended June\n30, 2024, Reborn’s interest was not material as the store in Malaysia opened in November 2023 and operated in limited capacity and revenue.\nReverse Stock Split\nOn January 12, 2024, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment (the \"Certificate of Amendment”) to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse\nstock split of its issued Common Stock in the ratio of 1-for-8 (the \"Reverse Stock Split”). The Common Stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market on a Reverse\nStock Split-adjusted basis at the market open on Monday, January 22, 2024.\nSegment Reporting\nFASB ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, requires public companies to report financial and descriptive information about their reportable operating segments. The\nCompany’s management identifies operating segments based on how the Company’s management internally evaluate separate financial information, business activities\nand management responsibility. At the current time, the Company has only one reportable segment, consisting of both the wholesale and retail sales of coffee, water, and\nother beverages. The Company’s franchisor subsidiary was not material as of and for the six-month ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.\n6\nWe shall generate revenues from two geographic areas, consisting of North America and Asia. The following enterprise-wide disclosure is prepared on a basis consistent\nwith the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The following table contains certain financial information by geographic area:\nFor the Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 2023\nNet Sales:\nNorth America $ 2,713,064 $ 2,641,244\nAsia 177,899 -\nTotal net sales $ 2,890,963 $ 2,641,244\nJune 30, December 31,\nAs of 2024 2023\nLong-lived asset, net:\nNorth America $ 3,194,542 $ 2,162,263\nAsia 767,857 1,331,787\nTotal long-lived asset, net $ 3,962,399 $ 3,494,050\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported\nin our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Such estimates include accounts receivables, accrued liabilities, income taxes, long-lived assets,\nand deferred tax valuation allowances. These estimates generally involve complex issues and require management to make judgments, involve analysis of historical and\nfuture trends that can require extended periods of time to resolve, and are subject to change from period to period. In all cases, actual results could differ materially from\nestimates.\nForeign Currency Translations\nReborn has controlling interests in subsidiaries in foreign countries, South Korea and Malaysia. Fluctuations in foreign currency impact the amount of total assets,\nliabilities, earnings and cash flows that the Company report for foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. Dollars for, and as of the end of, each\nreporting period. In particular, the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar generally will reduce the reported amount of our foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, total\nrevenues and total expense that we translate into U.S. Dollars and report in the Company’s consolidated financial statements for, and as of the end of, each reporting\nperiod. However, a majority of the Company’s consolidated revenue is denominated in U.S. Dollars, and therefore, the Company’s revenue is not directly subject to\nforeign currency risk.\nIn accordance with FASB ASC 830, \"Foreign Currency Matters”, when an operation has transactions denominated in a currency other than its functional currency, they\nare measured in the functional currency. Changes in the expected functional currency cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates are included in net income for the\nperiod.\n7\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company’s net\nrevenue primarily consists of revenues from its retail stores and wholesale and online store. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue as follows:\n● Retail Store Revenue\nRetail store revenues are recognized when payment is tendered at the point of sale. Retail store revenues are reported net of sales, use or other transaction taxes that\nare collected from customers and remitted to taxing authorities. Sales taxes that are payable are recorded as accrued as other current liabilities. Retail store revenue\nmakes up approximately 92% of the Company’s total revenue.\n● Wholesale and Online Revenue\nWholesale and online revenues are recognized when the products are delivered, and title passes to the customers or to the wholesale distributors. When customers\npick up products at the Company’s warehouse, or distributed to the wholesale distributors, the title passes, and revenue is recognized. Wholesale revenues make up\napproximately 8% of the Company’s total revenue.\n● Royalties and Other Fees\nFranchise revenues consist of royalty fees and other franchise fees. Royalty fees are based on a percentage of a franchisee’s weekly gross sales revenue at 5%. The\nCompany recognizes the fee as the underlying sales occur. The Company recorded revenue from royalties of $0 for the periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. Other\nfees are earned as incurred and the Company did not have any other fee revenue for the periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.\nCost of Sales\nProduct, food and drink costs – stores and cost of sales – wholesale and online primarily include the costs of ingredients of food and beverage sold and related supplies\nused in customer service. The wholesale and online sales also include costs of packaging and shipping.\nShipping and Handling Costs\nThe Company incurred freight out costs, which are primarily included in the Company’s cost of sales – wholesale and online. Freight in costs, when attached to a specific\npurchase, are included as a component of the cost of the purchased goods and materials items and allocated to accounts in accordance with the nature of the goods.\nWhen the freight in costs are not allocable to an individual purchase or are more significant, they are recorded to a freight and shipping account within cost of sales.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense includes store-related expense as well as the Company’s corporate headquarters’ expenses.\nAdvertising Expense\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses amounted to $76,626 and $49,531 for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,\nand are recorded under general and administrative expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n8\nPre-opening Costs\nPre-opening costs for new stores, consist primarily of store and leasehold improvements, and are capitalized and depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the\nimprovement or the lease term, including renewal periods that are reasonably assured.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivables are stated net of allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined primarily on the basis of past collection\nexperience and general economic conditions. The Company determines terms and conditions for its customers based on volume transacted by the customer, customer\ncreditworthiness and past transaction history. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, allowance for doubtful accounts were zero, respectively. The Company does not\nhave any off-balance sheet exposure related to its customers.\nInventories\nInventories consisted primarily of coffee beans, drink products, and supplies which are recorded at cost or at net realizable value.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are provided using both the\nstraight-line and declining balance methods over the following estimated useful lives:\nFurniture and fixtures 5-7 Years\nStore construction Lesser of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements, generally 6 years\nLeasehold improvement Lesser of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements, generally 6 years\nWhen assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation thereon are removed, and any resulting gains or losses are included in the consolidated\nstatements of operations. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated life of the asset, not to exceed the length of the lease.\nRepair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\nOperating Leases\nThe Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC”), Topic 842, Leases (\"ASC 842”) which requires the\nrecognition of the right-of-use assets and relating operating and finance lease liabilities on the balance sheet. Under ASC 842, all leases are required to be recorded on the\nbalance sheet and are classified as either operating leases or finance leases. The lease classification affects the expense recognition in the income statement. Operating\nlease charges are recorded entirely in operating expenses. Finance lease charges are split, where amortization of the right-of-use asset is recorded in operating expenses\nand an implied interest component is recorded in interest expense.\nEarnings Per Share\nFASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share, requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share computations.\nBasic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding\nduring the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of\nadditional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. In\nperiods where losses are reported, the weighted-average number of common stock outstanding excludes common stock equivalents, because their inclusion would be\nanti-dilutive.\nThe Company did not have any dilutive, or potentially dilutive, shares outstanding for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.\n9\nLong-lived Assets\nIn accordance with FASB ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, the Company reviews for impairment of long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles\nwhenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. The Company considers the carrying value of assets may not be\nrecoverable based upon our review of the following events or changes in circumstances: the asset’s ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive\ncash flow in future periods; loss of legal ownership or title to the assets; significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset; or significant\nnegative industry or economic trends. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset are less than\nits carrying amount. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company was not aware of any events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the long-\nlived assets are impaired.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company records its financial assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined under the applicable accounting standards as the exchange price that would be\nreceived for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between\nmarket participants on the measure date. The Company uses valuation techniques to measure fair value, maximizing the use of observable outputs and minimizing the use\nof unobservable inputs. The standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last\nunobservable, that may be used to measure fair value which are the following:\nLevel 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 – Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are\nnot active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 – Inputs include management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. The inputs are\nunobservable in the market and significant to the instrument’s valuation.\nAs of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company believes that the carrying value of accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other current\nassets and liabilities approximate fair value due to the short maturity of theses financial instruments. The financial statements do not include any financial instruments at\nfair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis.\n10\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consisted of taxes currently due and deferred taxes. Deferred taxes are\nrecognized for the differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes.\nThe Company follows FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences\nof events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future\nyears of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax\nrates, applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax\nassets to the amount expected to be realized. ASC 740-10-25 provides criteria for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax position. The\nCompany must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing\nauthorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on\nthe largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The Company did not recognize additional liabilities for uncertain tax\npositions pursuant to ASC 740-10-25 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are accounts receivable arising from its normal business activities. The\nCompany performs ongoing credit evaluations to its customers and establishes allowances when appropriate.\nCompany purchases from various vendors for its operations. For the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, no purchases from any vendors\naccounted for a significant amount of the Company’s coffee bean purchases.\nRelated Parties\nRelated parties are any entities or individuals that, through employment, ownership, or other means, possess the ability to direct or cause the direction of management and\npolicies of the Company.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncement\nThe Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements\nmay be expected to cause a material impact on our financial statements.\n11\n3. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nProperty and equipment consisted of the following:\nJune 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nFurniture and equipment $ 2,271,089 $ 2,552,021\nLeasehold improvement 632,516 1,037,277\nStore 1,876,479 663,651\nStore construction 475,500 361,575\nVehicle 103,645 103,645\nTotal property and equipment 5,359,229 4,718,169\nLess accumulated depreciation (1,396,830) (1,224,119)\nTotal property and equipment, net $ 3,962,399 $ 3,494,050\nDepreciation expense on property and equipment amounted to approximately $172,710 and $135,398 for the six-month periods ended and $63,330 and $56,097 for the three-\nmonth periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n4.

Installment payments, including principal and interest, are due monthly beginning April 16, 2022 (twenty four months from the\noriginal date of the SBA Loan Agreement) in the amount of $2,505. The balance of principal and interest is payable thirty years from the original date of the SBA Loan\nAgreement.\n14\n7. LOAN PAYABLE, PAYROLL PROTECTION LOAN PROGRAM (PPP)\nLoans payable, Payroll Protection Loan Program (PPP) consisted of the following:\nJune 30, December 31,\nAs of 2024 2023\nLoan payable from Payroll protection program (PPP) $ 73,721 $ 97,273\nLess - current portion (22,126) (45,678)\nTotal loan payable, payroll protection program (PPP), less current portion $ 51,595 $ 51,595\nThe Paycheck Protection Program Loan (the \"PPP Loan”) is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the \"SBA”). The interest rate of the loan is 1.00% per\nannum and accrues on the unpaid principal balance computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days. Commencing seven months after\nthe effective date of the PPP Loan, the Company is required to pay the Lender equal monthly payments of principal and interest as required to fully amortize any\nunforgiven principal balance of the loan by the two-year anniversary of the effective date of the PPP Loan (the \"Maturity Date”). The PPP Loan contains customary\nevents of default relating to, among other things, payment defaults, making materially false or misleading representations to the SBA or the Lender, or breaching the terms\nof the PPP Loan. The occurrence of an event of default may result in the repayment of all amounts outstanding under the PPP Loan, collection of all amounts owing from\nthe Company, or filing suit and obtaining judgment against the Company. Under the terms of the CARES Act, PPP loan recipients can apply for and be granted\nforgiveness for all or a portion of the loan granted under the PPP. Such forgiveness will be determined, subject to limitations, based on the use of loan proceeds for\npayment of payroll costs and any payments of mortgage interest, rent, and utilities. Recent modifications to the PPP by the U.S. Treasury and Congress have extended the\ntime period for loan forgiveness beyond the original eight-week period, making it possible for the Company to apply for forgiveness of its PPP loan.\n8. INCOME TAX\nTotal income tax (benefit) expense consists of the following:\nFor the Six-Month Periods Ended June 30, 2024 2023\nCurrent provision (benefit):\nFederal $ - $ -\nState - -\nTotal current provision (benefit) - -\nDeferred provision (benefit):\nFederal - -\nState - -\nTotal deferred provision (benefit) - -\nTotal tax provision (benefit) $ - $ -\nA reconciliation of the Company’s effective tax rate to the statutory federal rate for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\nJune 30, June 30,\nDescription 2024 2023\nStatutory federal rate 21.00% 21.00%\nState income taxes net of federal income tax benefit and others 6.98% 6.98%\nPermanent differences for tax purposes and others 0.00% 0.00%\nChange in valuation allowance -27.98% -27.98%\nEffective tax rate 0% 0%\n15\nThe income tax benefit differs from the amount computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% due to California state income taxes of 8.84% and changes\nin the valuation allowance.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for\nincome tax purposes. The components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nJune 30, December 31,\nDeferred tax assets 2024 2023\nDeferred tax assets:\nNet operating loss $ 4,152,849 $ 3,507,307\nOther temporary differences - -\nTotal deferred tax assets 4,152,849 3,507,307\nLess - valuation allowance (4,152,849) (3,507,307)\nTotal deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance $ - $ -\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had available net operating loss carryovers of approximately $3,507,000. Per the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) implemented in\n2018, the two-year carryback provision was removed and now allows for an indefinite carryforward period. The carryforwards are limited to 80% of each subsequent year’s\nnet income. As a result, net operating loss may be applied against future taxable income and expires at various dates subject to certain limitations. The Company has a\ndeferred tax asset arising substantially from the benefits of such net operating loss deduction and has recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of this deferred\ntax asset since it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset may not be realized.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and California and is subject to income tax examinations by federal tax authorities for tax year ended\n2018 and later and subject to California authorities for tax year ended 2017 and later.

ROU\nassets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.\nGenerally, the implicit rate of interest in arrangements is not readily determinable and the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value\nof lease payments. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate is a hypothetical rate based on its understanding of what its credit rating would be. The operating lease\nROU asset includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our variable lease payments primarily consist of maintenance and other operating expenses\nfrom our real estate leases. Variable lease payments are excluded from the ROU assets and lease liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for\nthose payments is incurred. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease\nexpense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. The Company has elected to account for these lease and non-lease components as a single\nlease component.\nIn accordance with ASC 842, the components of lease expense were as follows:\nFor the six-month period ended June 30, 2024 2023\nOperating lease expense $ 704,678 $ 579,270\nTotal lease expense $ 704,678 $ 579,270\nIn accordance with ASC 842, other information related to leases was as follows:\nFor the six-month period ended June 30, 2024 2023\nOperating cash flows from operating leases $ 707,148 $ 569,113\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities $ 707,148 $ 569,113\nWeighted-average remaining lease term—operating leases 5.9 Years\nWeighted-average discount rate—operating leases 10.8%\nIn accordance with ASC 842, maturities of operating lease liabilities as of June 30, 2024 were as follows:\nOperating\nFor the years ended December 31, Lease\n2024 (remaining six months) $ 874,387\n2025 1,401,371\n2026 1,211,859\n2027 734,407\n2028 410,673\nThereafter 1,553,692\nTotal undiscounted cash flows $ 6,186,388\nReconciliation of lease liabilities:\nWeighted-average remaining lease terms 5.3 Years\nWeighted-average discount rate 10.7%\nPresent values $ 4,434,803\nLease liabilities—current 1,016,649\nLease liabilities—long-term 3,418,154\nLease liabilities—total $ 4,434,803\nDifference between undiscounted and discounted cash flows $ 1,751,585\nContingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings from time to time as part of its business.

The shareholders\nof common stock shall be entitled to one vote per share and dividends declared by the Company’s Board of Directors.\nPreferred Stock\nThe Company has authorization to issue and have outstanding at any one time 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share, in one or more\nclasses or series within a class as may be determined by our board of directors, who establish, from time to time, the number of shares to be included in each class or\nseries, fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such class or series and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof. Any\npreferred stock so issued is senior to other existing classes of common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or amounts upon liquidation or dissolution. As of\nJune 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, no shares of our preferred stock had been designated any rights and we had no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding.\nIssuance of Common Stock in Settlement of Antidilution Provisions\nIn May 2018, the Company had entered into a share exchange agreement wherein Capax, Inc., the predecessor entity of Reborn Coffee, Inc. (\"Capax”) effectively merged\nwith Reborn Global Holdings, Inc. to form the Company.

In the event the ownership of the pre-merger shareholders of Capax fell below 5%, the Company was obligated to issue that number of shares of common\nstock to those shareholders which would increase the ownership of all of the Pre-Merger Shareholders to five percent (5%) of the total outstanding voting common shares\nof the Company. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company issued 325,495 shares of common stock under these provisions.\nOn January 25, 2022, the Company modified this agreement with the preexisting shareholders to effectively end the antidilution protection at the time of a successful\npublic offering, eliminating the one-year period following an the public offering as provided under the original agreement. The shareholders would be entitled to additional\nprotection through the IPO date should the Company issue any additional shares between December 31, 2021 and the IPO date. The Company has not issued any\nadditional shares subsequent to December 31, 2021 and the shareholders do not have such antidilution protection rights since the Company’s IPO date.\nDividend policy\nDividends are paid at the discretion of the Board of Directors. There were no dividends declared for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.\n19\n11. EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe Company calculates earnings per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260, Earnings Per Share, which requires a dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per\nshare.

As discussed in the section titled \"Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” the following discussion\nand analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that, if they never materialize or prove incorrect, could cause our\nresults to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not\nlimited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled \"Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ending December 31, 2023.\nBusiness\nReborn is focused on serving high quality, specialty-roasted coffee at retail locations, kiosks and cafes. We are an innovative company that strives for constant improvement in\nthe coffee experience through exploration of new technology and premier service, guided by traditional brewing techniques. We believe Reborn differentiates itself from other\ncoffee roasters through its innovative techniques, including sourcing, washing, roasting, and brewing our coffee beans with a balance of precision and craft.\nFounded in 2015 by Jay Kim, our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Kim and his team launched Reborn with the vision of using the finest pure ingredients and pristine water. We\ncurrently serve customers through our retail store locations in California: Brea, La Crescenta, Corona Del Mar, Laguna Woods, Manhattan Beach, Huntington Beach, Riverside,\nSan Francisco, Irvine, Diamond Bar and Anaheim.\nReborn continues to elevate the high-end coffee experience and we received first place traditional still in \"America’s Best Cold Brew” competition by Coffee Fest in 2017 in\nPortland and 2018 in Los Angeles.\nThe Experience, Reborn\nWe believe that we are the leading pioneers of the emerging \"Fourth Wave” movement and that our business is redefining specialty coffee as an experience that demands much\nmore than premium quality. We consider ourselves leaders of the \"fourth wave” coffee movement because we are constantly developing our bean processing methods,\nresearching design concepts, and reinventing new ways of drinking coffee. For instance, the current transition from the K-Cup trend to the pour over drip concept allowed us to\nreinvent the way people consume coffee, by merging convenience and quality. We took the pour over drip concept and made it available and affordable to the public through our\nReborn Coffee Pour Over packs. Our Pour Over Packs allow our consumers to consume our specialty coffee outdoors and on-the-go.\nOur success in innovating within the \"Fourth Wave” coffee movement is measured by our success in B2B sales with our introduction of Reborn Coffee Pour Over Packs to hotels.\nWith the introduction of our Pour Over Packs to major hotels (including one hotel company with 7 locations), our B2B sales increased as these companies recognized the\nconvenience and functionality our Pour Over Packs serve to their customers.\nOur continuous Research and Development is essential to developing new parameters in the production of new blends. Our first place position in \"America’s Best Cold Brew”\ncompetition by Coffee Fest in 2017 in Portland and 2018 in Los Angeles is a testament to the way we believe we lead the \"Fourth Wave” movement by example.\nCentered around its core values of service, trust, and well-being, Reborn Coffee delivers an appreciation of coffee as both a science and an art. Developing innovative processes\nsuch as washing green coffee beans with magnetized water, we challenge traditional preparation methods by focusing on the relationship between water chemistry, health, and\nflavor profile. Reborn Coffee proactively distinguishes exceptional quality from good quality by starting at the foundation and paying attention to the details. Our mission places\nan equal emphasis on humanizing the coffee experience, delivering a fresh take on \"farm-to-table” by sourcing internationally. In this way, Reborn Coffee creates opportunities to\ndevelop transparency by paying homage to origin stories and sparking new conversations by building cross-cultural communities united by a passion for the finest coffee.\nThrough a broad product offering, Reborn Coffee provides customers with a wide variety of beverages and coffee options. As a result, we believe we can capture share of any\nexperience where customers seek to consume great beverages whether in our inviting store atmospheres which are designed for comfort, or on the go through our Pour Over\nPacks, or at home with our whole bean ground coffee bags. We believe that the retail coffee market in the US is large and growing. According to IBIS, in 2021, the retail market for\ncoffee in the United States is expected to be $46.2 billion. This is expected to grow due to a shift in consumer preferences to premium coffee, including specialized blends, espresso-\nbased beverages, and cold brew options. Reborn aims to capture a growing portion of the market as we expand and increase consumer awareness of our brand.\n21\nPlan of Operation\nWe have a production and distribution center at our headquarters that we use to process and roast coffee for wholesale and retail distribution.\nCurrently, we have the following twelve retail coffee locations:\n● La Floresta Shopping Village in Brea, California;\n● La Crescenta, California;\n● Corona Del Mar, California;\n● Home Depot Center in Laguna Woods, California;\n● Manhattan Village at Manhattan Beach, California.\n● Huntington Beach, California;\n● Galleria at Tyler in Riverside, California;\n● Intersect in Irvine, California;\n● Diamond Bar, California;\n● Anaheim, California;\n● Daejeon, Korea; and\n● Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nRevenue\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset are less than its carrying amount. As of June 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023, the Company was not aware of any events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the long-lived assets are impaired.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales includes costs associated with generating revenue within our company-owned retail locations, and franchising operations (of which, as of June 30, 2024, we had\nnone).\nShipping and Handling Costs\nThe Company incurred freight out cost and is included in the Company’s cost of sale.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense includes store-related expense as well as the Company’s corporate headquarters’ expenses.\nAdvertising Expense\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred.

Revenues were approximately $1.4 million for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024, compared to $1.5 million for the comparable period in\n2023, representing an decrease of approximately $146,000, or -9.6%.\nProduct, food and drink costs\nProduct, food and drink costs were approximately $630,000 for the six-month period ended June 30, 2024 compared to $882,000 for the comparable period in 2023, representing an\ndecrease of approximately $252,000 or 28.6%, and were approximately $324,000 for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024 compared to $518,000 for the comparable period in\nthe prior year, representing a decrease of $194,000 or 37.5%. The decrease in costs for the periods was driven by the Company’s cost reduction initiatives throughout the divisions.\n24\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were approximately $4.3 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2024 compared to $3.9 million for the comparable period in the prior\nyear, representing an increase of approximately $414,000, or 10.6%, and were approximately $2.3 million for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024 compared to $2.2 million for\nthe comparable period in 2023, representing an increase of approximately $118,000, or 5.4%.\nThis increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the hiring of additional administrative employees, increases in professional services and corporate-level\ncosts to support growth plans, the opening of new restaurants, as well as costs associated with outside administrative, legal and professional fees and other general corporate\nexpenses associated with being a public company.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have a history of operating losses and negative cash flow in operating activities. We have incurred recurring net losses, including net losses from operations before income\ntaxes of $2.3 million and $2.3 million for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We used $2.9 million and $2.3 million of cash for operating activities for\nthe six-month periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOur cash needs will depend on numerous factors, including our revenues, completion of our product development activities, customer and market acceptance of our product, and\nour ability to reduce and control costs. We expect to devote substantial capital resources to, among other things, fund operations and continue development plans.\nIn August 2022, the Company consummated the IPO of 1,440,000 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $5.00 per share, generating gross proceeds of $7,200,000.\nNet proceeds from the IPO were approximately $6.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses of approximately $998,000.\nTo support our existing and planned business model, the Company needs to raise additional capital to fund our future operations. The Company has not experienced any difficulty\nin raising funds through loans, and has not experienced any liquidity problems in settling payables in the normal course of business and repaying loans when they fall due.\nSuccessful renewal of our loans, however, is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. In addition, the increasingly competitive industry conditions under which we operate\nmay negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows. Additional debt financing is anticipated to fund the Company’s operations in the near future. However, there are\nno current agreements or understandings with regard to the form, time or amount of such financing and there is no assurance that any of this financing can be obtained or that the\nCompany can continue as a going concern.\nSix Months Ended\nJune 30,\n2023 2022\nStatement of Cash Flow Data:\nNet cash used in operating activities (2,895,711) (2,283,101)\nNet cash used in investing activities (641,060) (4,417,782)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 3,989,521 4,019,340\nCash Flows used in Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities during the six-month period ended June 30, 2024 was approximately $2.9 million, which resulted from net loss of $2.3 million and from the\nchanges in operating assets and liabilities.\nCash Flows used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities during the six-month periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was $641,000 and $4.4 million, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities for\nthe second quarter of 2024 was primarily related to the purchase of equipment.\n25\nCash Flows provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the six-month period ended June, 2024 and 2023 was $4.0 million and $4.0 million, respectively. Net cash flows provided by\nfinancing activities for the second quarter of 2024 was primarily proceeds from the issuance of common stock.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had total assets of approximately $10.5 million. Our cash balance as of June 30, 2024 was approximately $617,000.\nCredit Facilities\nEconomic Injury Disaster Loan\nOn May 16, 2020, we executed the EIDL Loan from the SBA under its EIDL assistance program in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. As of June 30,\n2024, the loan payable, EIDL Loan noted above is not in default.\nPursuant to the SBA Loan Agreement, we borrowed an aggregate principal amount of the EIDL Loan of $500,000, with proceeds to be used for working capital purposes. Interest\naccrues at the rate of 3.75% per annum and will accrue only on funds actually advanced from the date of each advance. Installment payments, including principal and interest, are\ndue monthly beginning May 16, 2021 (twelve months from the date of the SBA Loan Agreement) in the amount of $731. The balance of principal and interest is payable thirty years\nfrom the date of the SBA Loan Agreement. In connection therewith, we also received a $10,000 grant, which does not have to be repaid. During the year ended December 31, 2020,\n$10,000 was recorded in Economy injury disaster loan (EIDL) grant income in the Statements of Operations. The schedule of payments on this loan was later deferred to commence\n24 months from the date of loan and we has paid all payments owed since May 2022.\nIn connection therewith, we executed (i) a loan for the benefit of the SBA, which contains customary events of default and (ii) a Security Agreement, granting the SBA a security\ninterest in all of our tangible and intangible personal property, which also contains customary events of default (the \"SBA Security Agreement”).\nPaycheck Protection Program Loan\nIn May 2020, we secured a loan under the PPP administered by the SBA in the amount of $115,000. In February 2021, we secured a second loan under this program in the amount of\napproximately $167,000. The interest rate of the loan is 1.00% per annum and accrues on the unpaid principal balance computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed\nin a year of 360 days. Commencing seven months after the effective date of each PPP Loan, we are required to pay the Lender equal monthly payments of principal and interest as\nrequired to fully amortize any unforgiven principal balance of the loan by the two-year anniversary of the effective date of the loan. The PPP Loan contains customary events of\ndefault relating to, among other things, payment defaults, making materially false or misleading representations to the SBA or the Lender, or breaching the terms of the PPP Loan.\nThe occurrence of an event of default may result in the repayment of all amounts outstanding under the PPP Loan, collection of all amounts owing, or filing suit and obtaining\njudgment against us. Under the terms of the CARES Act, PPP loan recipients can apply for and be granted forgiveness for all or a portion of the loan granted under the PPP. Such\nforgiveness will be determined, subject to limitations, based on the use of loan proceeds for payment of payroll costs and any payments of mortgage interest, rent, and utilities.\nRecent modifications to the PPP by the U.S. Treasury and Congress have extended the time period for loan forgiveness beyond the original eight-week period, making it possible\nfor the Company to apply for forgiveness of its PPP loan. We were granted forgiveness for the initial PPP Loan prior to December 31, 2021 and expects to be granted forgiveness on\nthe remainder subsequently.\nLeases\nOperating Leases\nWe currently lease all company-owned retail locations. Operating leases typically contain escalating rentals over the lease term, as well as optional renewal periods. Rent expense\nfor operating leases is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term and begins when Reborn has the right to use the property. The difference between rent expense and\ncash payment is recorded as deferred rent on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Pre-opening rent is included in selling, general and administrative expenses on the\naccompanying consolidated statements of income. Tenant incentives used to fund leasehold improvements are recorded in deferred rent and amortized as reductions to rent\nexpense over the term of the lease.\nIncome Taxes\nReborn files income tax returns in the U.S. federal and California state jurisdictions.\nWe are taxed at the prevailing corporate tax rates for U.S. federal, state and local income taxes. Accordingly, a provision is recorded for the anticipated tax consequences of our\nreported results of operations for U.S. federal, state and foreign income taxes.\n26\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that we are required to disclose pursuant to these regulations. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into operating\nlease commitments, purchase commitments and other contractual obligations. These transactions are recognized in our financial statements in accordance with GAAP.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to utilize estimates and make judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses\nand related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be\nreasonable under the circumstances. The estimates are evaluated by management on an ongoing basis, and the results of these evaluations form a basis for making decisions\nabout the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Although actual results may differ from these estimates under different\nassumptions or conditions, management believes that the estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements are reasonable. The critical accounting policies affecting our\nfinancial reporting are summarized in Note 2 to the financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nWe have determined that all other issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements are inapplicable or insignificant to us and once adopted are not expected to have a\nmaterial impact on our financial position.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by 17 C.F.R. 229 (10)(f)(1)(i) and are not required to provide information under this item.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\nas amended (the \"Exchange Act”)), as of June 30, 2024. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of June 30, 2024,\nour disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under\nthe Exchange Act (a) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC”) rules and forms and (b) is\naccumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding any\nrequired disclosure.\nManagement has identified control deficiencies regarding inadequate accounting resources, the lack of segregation of duties and the need for a stronger internal control\nenvironment. Our management believes that these material weaknesses are due to the small size of our accounting staff. The small size of our accounting outsourced staff may\nprevent adequate controls in the future due to the cost/benefit of such remediation.\nTo mitigate the current limited resources and limited employees, we rely heavily on direct management oversight of transactions, along with the use of external legal and\naccounting professionals. As we grow, we expect to increase our number of employees, which will enable us to implement adequate segregation of duties within the internal\ncontrol framework.\nThese control deficiencies could result in a misstatement of account balances that would result in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to our financial statements\nmay not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In light of this material weakness, we performed additional analyses and procedures in order to conclude that our financial\nstatements for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q were fairly stated in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, management believes that\ndespite our material weaknesses, our financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, are fairly stated, in all material respects, in accordance with GAAP.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially\naffect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n27\nPART II—OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings.\nIn the future, the Company may be subject to various legal proceedings from time to time as part of its business. We are currently not involved in litigation that we believe will have\na materially adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. As of June 30, 2024, there is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any\ncourt, public board, government agency, self- regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of our company or any of our subsidiaries\nthreatened against or affecting our company, our common stock, any of our subsidiaries or of our company’s or our company’s subsidiaries’ officers or directors in their capacities\nas such, in which an adverse decision is expected to have a material adverse effect.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nAs a \"smaller reporting company” as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide information required by this item.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.\nNone.\nItem 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities\nNot applicable.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nItem 5. Other Information\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2024, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) adopted, modified or terminated a \"Rule 10b5-1\ntrading arrangement” or a \"non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” as such terms are defined under Item 408 of Regulation S-K.\n28\nItem 6.
